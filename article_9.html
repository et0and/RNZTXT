            <p>Kiwis love munching ultra-processed foods, which make up half of our average calorie consumption.</p>
        
            <p>But filling up on that tasty stuff with the very low nutritional value doesn't serve our brains, says clinical psychologist and nutritional psychiatry researcher Julia Rucklidge.</p>
        
            <p>More than 5 million people have watched her 2014 TED talk "The surprisingly dramatic role of nutrition in mental health".</p>
        
            <p>Ten years on, there's no question that a diet too low in essential vitamins and minerals leaves us at greater risk of mental health struggles, she tells RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>Rucklidge is currently director of Puna Toi Ora - the University of Canterbury's Mental Health and Nutrition Research Lab.</p>
        
            <p>In ten years of clinical trials with people struggling due to depression, ADHD and PTSD, she has prescribed high doses of vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) in pill form with positive results.</p>
        
            <p>Rucklidge's website has a recipe collection.</p>
        
            <p>In treating depression, micronutrient supplements give about the same response rates as pharmaceutical antidepressants, Rucklidge tells Mihi Forbes, but with far fewer side effects.</p>
        
            <p>With the symptoms of ADHD, stimulants have a greater impact than nutritional treatments, she says, but the latter also helps take down a child's emotional volatility and thereby improve a family's day-to-day life.</p>
        
            <p>A direct way to access the mood-boosting benefits of nutrition is switching to a Modified Mediterranean diet of olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts, Rucklidge says.</p>
        
            <p>People whose depression has drained them of the energy required to face changing their diet and learning how to cook might find micronutrient supplements can get them out of a hole, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Although not a perfect solution, they've now been proven to deliver "a robust, strong effect" as a mental health treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Raising awareness of their healing potential is just part of Rucklidge's mission to empower Kiwis to become more resilient.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about moving. It's about being socially connected. It's about having a purpose in life."</p>

Eating a Mediterranean-style diet can be a mental health tool, says Professor Julia Rucklidge.
