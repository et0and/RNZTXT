            <p>The news many fans of a certain blue dog have been waiting for has arrived.</p>
        
            <p>A movie based on the popular children's animated series Bluey is headed to theaters. An announcement was made Tuesday on social media with BBC Studios, Disney, Disney+ and ABC tagged.</p>
        
            <p>The series creator, Joe Brumm, posted a letter on the show's site, writing that he had news "some good, some trifficult".</p>
        
            <p>"Let's start with the good - after some time spent away from the series, working on another project, an old idea resurfaced and before I knew it, I'd written a Bluey feature script that I really love," he wrote. "Fast forward through a tonne of contracting and we're about to embark on making an animated Bluey movie!"</p>
        
            <p>The "trifficult" news, he wrote, is his decision to step away from the television series.</p>
        
            <p>"I always said I wouldn't keep making the show if I thought I couldn't make any new season as good as the last," Brumm wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"This would have been the case for me with a potential season four, so I've decided to take a break from my involvement in the TV series. In the event I can't wrap my head around doing more seasons myself, 'The Sign' will mark my TV finale for Bluey and I wrote it as such."</p>
        
            <p>He also offered up a statement in a press announcement for the film.</p>
        
            <p>"I really enjoyed the experience of working with a longer format on 'The Sign' in Series 3, so going even further with a feature film feels like a natural extension of that," Brumm said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always thought 'Bluey' deserved a theatrical movie. I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together."</p>
        
            <p>Vocal talent from series, including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack, will be a part of the movie, along with music created by "Bluey" composer Joff Bush.</p>
        
            <p>The project is scheduled in theaters in 2027 and will air on ABC iview and ABC Kids in Australia post-theatrical release.</p>
