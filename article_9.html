            <p>When we die, most of us will end up in a brown box, but the more eccentric among us may want something a little more personal.</p>
        
            <p>That is why 15 years ago Ross Hall launched a business called Dying Art, designing custom caskets that reflect the personality of the people who would eventually be laid to rest in them.</p>
        
            <p>Some he has created include a Lego casket, a giant block of Dairy Milk chocolate, and a sailboat complete with mast.</p>
        
            <p>The idea came to him when he was writing out his will, he told RNZ's Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>"I got to the little part in it where it said, 'Do you want to be buried, or do you want to be cremated?'</p>
        
            <p>"And I thought, 'I don't want to take up too much space, I'll get cremated'. And then I thought to myself, 'I really don't want a brown box'.</p>
        
            <p>"My life has been far too colourful to have a brown box. And I started thinking about, what did I want? And I thought, well, 'maybe I want a red box with flames on it, because that's probably where I'm going to end up'."</p>

            <p>Hall owns a design company and so set his creative team loose on creating bespoke caskets.</p>
        
            <p>"We designed up 20 different caskets and took them around to the funeral homes, because I worked out that I needed to work through the funeral homes, because it was just makes it so much easier when the family's grieving."</p>
        
            <p>It had been a slow-growing concern, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But as time has gone on, the funeral industry has changed so much, and funerals have become a lot more of a celebration rather than a boring ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>"People have got a lot more adventurous in their thinking about it. And we probably do two or three [caskets] a week, some weeks we do five."</p>

            <p>The boat coffin was one of Dying Art's more memorable creations.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a client come to us whose Dad was a mad sailor. And he said, 'I want to make my dad a boat'. And I said, 'we've got this one'. He goes, 'I'm a boat builder. I want to make it myself'.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we helped him make it, it ended up about 4.5 metres high because it has a keel on the bottom and a mast.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no two ways about it, that is a statement when it walks outside the church."</p>

            <p>Other coffins, heartbreakingly, were much smaller, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just did one recently for a little guy, and he was into Godzilla. And they're such little boxes, you know? It's pretty tough doing kids' ones."</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, the business, a side-line to his main design company, gave him personal satisfaction, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The gratitude that we get from families after the event is fantastic, the feedback we get is great.</p>
        
            <p>"It's feel-good feeling, I feel like I can give something back."</p>
