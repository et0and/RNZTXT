            <p>The Princess of Wales has been given a standing ovation on Centre Court where she watched the Wimbledon men's singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic with her daughter Princess Charlotte.</p>
        
            <p>It was Catherine's second public appearance following her cancer diagnosis and abdominal surgery earlier this year, and she was met with a standing ovation by spectators.</p>
        
            <p>As patron of the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Catherine presented the singles trophy to Alcaraz.</p>

            <p>Sunday's head-to-head saw Alcaraz retain his title against seven-times Wimbledon winner Djokovic.</p>
        
            <p>Before taking their seats, Catherine and Charlotte met some of Britain's tennis players, including Emma Raducanu.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the trophy presentation on Centre Court, Catherine also spoke to some of the ball boys and girls.</p>
        
            <p>Congratulations @carlosalcaraz on your remarkable victory.Thank you to everyone who works so hard to make @Wimbledon the spectacle that it is    pic.twitter.com/Ko99725iYR</p>
        
            <p>The Princess commiserated and shook the hand of runner-up Djokovic, before presenting the trophy to Alcaraz, who won 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4).</p>
        
            <p>In June, the princess made her return to public duties with an appearance at Trooping the Colour, waving and smiling from the Buckingham Palace balcony with her children.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Catherine addressed her cancer diagnosis in a statement saying that while she is making "good progress", she was "not out of the woods yet".</p>
        
            <p>That was the most significant update on her health since revealing in March that she had cancer.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, the princess said she had "good days and bad days", and that her treatment would be ongoing for a few more months.</p>
        
            <p>While Catherine settled in to watch the tennis final, the Prince of Wales was in Berlin, gearing up to support England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain.</p>

            <p>His side was eventually defeated by the Spaniards 2-1, with the Prince of Wales posting on X: "This time it just wasn't meant to be. We're all still so proud of you. Onwards @England."</p>
