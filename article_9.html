        <h2>'Never give up': Realising the dream of Sarjeant Gallery</h2>
        <p>
The gallery has been ‘newly reimagined’ with extension from architects Warren and Mahoney, in a codesign partnership with Whanganui iwi.  Video, Audio

            <p>Culture 101 is in Whanganui for the opening weekend of Te Whare o Rehua Sarjeant Gallery, speaking to innovators, and creative movers and shakers in this international UNESCO city of design. </p>
        
            <p>The gallery project is billed as the largest arts development in the Lower North Island since Te Papa opened, in 1998. </p>
        
            <p>One of the country’s grandest and oldest galleries, the Sarjeant has had a $70 million restoration and extension - Te Pātaka o Sir Te Atawhai Archie John Taiaroa wing.</p>
        
            <p>The gallery closed in 2014 after being considered an earthquake risk.  </p>

            <p>A key figure in the gallery’s reopening is the gallery Trust's chair Nicola Williams, who has spearheaded an impressive fundraising campaign.  </p>
        
            <p>As well as the restoration and earthquake strengthening of the original 1919 building - often lauded as one of the country’s most beautiful public buildings - the new extension has doubled the gallery’s size and created new public facilities.</p>
        
            <p>It has also created significant storage facilities for what is considered the country’s greatest art collection outside the main centres. Previously that collection was in serious risk of damage.</p>

            <p>For Whanganui, the gallery is much more than just a building. Sitting atop a sand hill in the Pukenamu public gardens, this has previously been a pa site and then a colonial military garrison. There are spectacular views, on a clear day, from the new extension out to Mount Ruapehu one way, and across the city to the sea from the other.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whare o Rehua (a name meaning House of Inspiration, gifted by local iwi in 1995) sits as a beacon. A symbol of the city’s rich heritage and the progressive spirit that built the city.</p>

            <p>The new gallery’s opening has seen iwi gather for the weekend from throughout the region, with a dawn ceremony on Saturday 9 November, to open Te Pātaka o Sir Te Atawhai Archie John Taiaroa wing, followed by a public opening of the complex. </p>
        
            <p>For the gallery trust chair Nicola Williams it's a huge weekend, after beginning the journey with the redevelopment project with then- Sarjeant director Greg Anderson in 2014. </p>
        
            <p>The redevelopment was committed to in 2019, with a funding partnership between Whanganui District Council, the gallery trust and central government. Funds have also been provided by numerous public and private trusts, corporate sponsorship and individual philanthropy. </p>
        
            <p>Significantly, for a gallery that once symbolised colonial wealth (the original gallery and its running were funded through a bequest by landowner Henry Sarjeant), the redevelopment is a significant bicultural undertaking. </p>
        
            <p>Williams has described the fundraising journey as her life for many years. In 2019 she was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her efforts. </p>
        
            <p>Williams is Whanganui born and bred, and being a businesswoman is in her genes. Her late mother Pam Williams (QSO) ran a well known successful fishing business, Whanganui Trawlers. Williams says her “never give up” approach was ingrained in her by her mother from an early age. </p>
        
            <p>As well as working for 18 years in the family company, she has worked for a finance company and merchant bank, as well as being a trustee of many arts and community groups and charities. </p>
        
            <p>She talked with Mark Amery and Perlina Lau live from Te Whare o Rehua, on Culture 101.</p>
