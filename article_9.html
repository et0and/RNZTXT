            <p>At the "risk of ruining their childhoods", Rob Johnson and Christopher Webb look back at their favourite films from decades past on the podcast Still Any Good?</p>
        
            <p>For Johnson, the 1986 film Footroot Flats, which he'd "worshipped" as a kid growing up in Gisborne, has been the trickiest to review honestly.</p>
        
            <p>"I almost felt like my New Zealand citizenship would be revoked or I'd get hate mail if I said it wasn't good," he tells Emile Donovan.</p>

            <p>As a child, movies just "wash over you", Webb says, and can stay magical in your memory.</p>
        
            <p>"Your disbelief is suspended so easily as a child and you just don't question the ridiculous plot holes or the over-the-top performances or the shonky special effects… When you're a jaded, middle-aged man, it's a little bit different."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to assessing old films, he and Johnson try not to be cynical and the only "cardinal sin" is when the politics are just too problematic to ignore.</p>
        
            <p>Movies that are not well-made yet entertaining, like Jean Claude Van Damme's "testosterone-fuelled, highly ridiculous" 1986 film Bloodsport, win the podcasters' stamp of approval, Webb says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a five-star film but I absolutely love it. I thought it was such fun to watch and it was even more fun to talk about. It was just brilliant."</p>
        
            <p>He also recommends the 1985 Van Damme film No Retreat, No Surrender.</p>
        
            <p>"It is so ridiculous. I just absolutely loved it. It was such a wonderful choice. It's one of the funniest things I think I've ever seen."</p>
        
            <p>For both Webb and Johnson, the 1983 fantasy film Krull was an obvious choice for the first episode of Still Any Good?</p>
        
            <p>Johnson and his brother would watch their VHS copy of the "slightly rubbishy, slightly cheesy sci-fi" film at least once a year, and he says revisiting was rather sobering.</p>
        
            <p>"I just absolutely loved it as a child. It was, it was everything special-effects-wise, story-wise that I could have wanted… Revisiting it in the cold, hard light of 2017 was certainly a different experience."</p>
        
            <p>For Johnson, the 1983 pirate comedy Yellowbeard has been one of the most painful movies to revisit.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought it was the funniest film I had ever seen. It was just an abomination rewatching that."</p>
        
            <p>Webb says that for him, looking back at the 1976 disaster comedy The Big Bus was "just so, so disappointing".</p>
        
            <p>"As a kid I thought it was the funniest thing that I'd ever seen, and I was horrified by the end of it."</p>
