            <p>A veteran television producer has described the arrival of colour television as one of the biggest broadcasting breakthroughs of the time.</p>
        
            <p>The reflections come 50 years after the 1974 Christchurch Commonwealth Games opened, an occasion which also marked most New Zealanders' first glimpse of colour television.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch games dubbed "the friendly games" marked the second time New Zealand had hosted an incarnation of the multi-sport event, after Auckland staged the British Empire Games in 1950.</p>
        
            <p>Colour television was officially launched in New Zealand in October 1973, two months before Christchurch games.</p>
        
            <p>It also came 13 years after television was first broadcast in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>According to Te Papa, the first K9 colour television set was was purchased by the Paterson family in Wellington in August 1973.</p>
        
            <p>Producer George Andrews, who has been making documentaries about New Zealand for more than half-a-century, was a reporter for the BBC at the '74 games.</p>
        
            <p>He said colour television enriched the live broadcast experience for viewers.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that it was colour television and that it was a huge first made it [the games] all the more exciting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The thrill was given a further shot in the arm when Dick Tayler galloped to gold in the 10,000 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"That was about the most spectacular opening that New Zealand could've imagined ... that gave the event an enormous impact."</p>
        
            <p>Andrews ranked both colour TV's debut and the 1975 Telethon broadcast - that launched TV2 - as the two biggest television events of the 70s.</p>
        
            <p>Retired business owner Tony Graham ran a TV repair and electronics store in Hokitika for nearly 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>He explained it took several years before manufacturers could meet the demand.</p>
        
            <p>"Colour TV sets fell on allocation from the manufacturer.</p>
        
            <p>"In Hokitika, there was only about half-a-dozen colour TVs anyway at that stage and they were just being supplied in ones and twos by different manufacturers.</p>
        
            <p>"It took a while before there was a reasonable amount of TV sets in the town."</p>
        
            <p>Graham said the backlog lasted for "several years".</p>
        
            <p>The colour television furore of the mid-70s has also been referenced in local film and television over the past decade.</p>
        
            <p>The first ever episode of New Zealand television series Westside - James Griffin and Rachel Lang's award-winning prequel to Outrageous Fortune - was set against the backdrop of the 1974 Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>One of the episode's storylines centres on Ted West's gang robbing a supply of Phillips K9 televisions because of their $700 price tag.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone wants colour for the games," Pana Hema Taylor's Bert Thompson says.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran cameraman Gerard Smyth was a cameraman at the '74 Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>He said the transformation for camera operators wasn't as dramatic as it was for the "sparkling coverage" audiences saw.</p>
        
            <p>"The cameraman still saw black and white so we didn't see much difference."</p>
        
            <p>Smyth said the 10 day experience of the Commonwealth Games was probably the "best time Christchurch ever had".</p>
        
            <p>By 1975, everything from international sport, to election campaign adverts to the classic Great Crunchie Train Robbery ad were being seen in full technicolour.</p>
        
            <p>The first All Blacks test broadcast in colour was, ironically, one when the team weren't in even playing in black.</p>
        
            <p>The famous All Blacks-Scotland test at Auckland's Eden Park, later dubbed the "waterpolo test" was possibly the wettest rugby test ever played in this country.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty years on, industry veterans admit colour television isn't as important to New Zealanders as it was during its auspicious beginnings.</p>
        
            <p>"The world has changed," Andrews said.</p>
        
            <p>"Broadcast television will never be as important as it was then ... but it's still about telling stories with pictures."</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch City Council is now looking to revive the colourful days of 50 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Elected members have narrowly agreed to consider a bid for a future Commonwealth Games event.</p>
