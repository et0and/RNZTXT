        <h2>At The Movies: Challengers</h2>
        <p>
Zendaya shines in this Luca Guadagnino-directed tale of tennis and romantic triangles, writes Simon Morris.  Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Director Luca Guadagnino has had a glittering career, both in Italy and then internationally. </p>
        
            <p>From the literary I Am Love and the terrifying Suspiria, to the intimate gay love story Call Me By Your Name - there seems nothing he can’t handle.  </p>
        
            <p>So why not a romantic triangle like Challengers?</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, Challengers isn’t actually an Italian production.  It’s entirely homegrown American, produced by two Hollywood industry figures, old and young. </p>
        
            <p>One is former Sony head honcho Amy Pascal, and the other is star Zendaya, who plays a tennis champion called Tashi.</p>
        
            <p>Tashi came up the hard way from poor beginnings. But by the time we meet her, the world is her oyster. </p>
        
            <p>And two young tennis-players, Art and Patrick, working their way up rather more slowly, are star-struck when they meet her.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Faist (Art) and The Crown’s Josh O’Connor (Patrick) – could afford to go to a private tennis school, but it doesn’t mean they’re not both fiercely competitive.</p>
        
            <p>The competition between them goes on for years, with the film flashing backwards and forwards in time, while the fortunes of all three go up and down.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick is the glamorous bad boy. Art is more the slow and steady type.  And the scenes we linger on most are that first meeting and the bitter, final play-off, winner takes all, many years later.</p>
        
            <p>Of the two, only Art seems to be taking it all seriously. But for Tashi, taking it seriously isn’t necessarily the point of a competition – not in the early days at any rate.   </p>
        
            <p>She’s a tennis player. And this seems to be the ultimate tennis match. Until suddenly it isn’t.</p>
        
            <p>Just as Tashi closes in on tennis’s Number 1 slot, she has an accident on the court and breaks her leg badly. She knows that means the end of her tennis career.</p>
        
            <p>Or is it? Both Art and Patrick know she understands the game better than anyone. With her in their corner, either challenger could become champion.</p>
        
            <p>In most routine, ‘eternal triangle’ stories, audiences usually have a pretty good idea of the outcome.</p>
        
            <p>No matter how much the star couple seem unsuited, and how attractive the romantic third wheel may appear, we can usually guess who gets who in the end.</p>
        
            <p>But smart film makers – like everyone involved in Challengers, including writer Justin Kuritzkes – realise audiences like to be kept guessing.  </p>
        
            <p>The blueprint was a French New Wave film called Jules and Jim, which, like Challengers, kept putting off the decision.  </p>
        
            <p>Here, decent but insecure Art offers stability. Flashy risk-taker Patrick offers excitement. Which one do we choose?</p>
        
            <p>The one we choose of course is Tashi herself, who, as played by Zendaya, is by far the most appealing character, partly because she can’t make up her mind.  </p>
        
            <p>And Challengers isn’t about happy endings – or endings at all. It’s about what keeps top tennis players going – game after game, set after set, match after match, tournament after tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Making the film better than you’d expect – especially for non-pro tennis players – is how it’s directed by Guadignino.   </p>
        
            <p>The way he drowns out boring arguments with Trent Reznor’s punchy music. How he switches the point of view in the matches – at one stage, daringly, from the ball’s point of view – is often dazzling.</p>
        
            <p>But the performances are the point - young, playful, self-centred, sexy. Star Zendaya is now queen of the world and this is why. </p>
        
            <p>Her model good looks, her passion on the tennis court, her refusal to back down – right now she’s the most interesting thing on the screen.</p>
