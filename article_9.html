            <p>Dev Patel is best known for playing nice chaps in Slumdog Millionaire, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Lion.</p>
        
            <p>Who knew he wanted to write, direct and star in a ferocious revenge movie like Monkey Man?</p>
        
            <p>Monkey Man has been a long time coming, apparently - ever since Patel got a black belt in tae kwan do.</p>
        
            <p>His plan was to make a martial arts film that blends the visceral violence of Korean films with the spirituality of Bollywood.</p>
        
            <p>This is hardly my wheelhouse, so I have no idea whether Monkey Man is what he wanted to make. I can only tell you what I saw.</p>
        
            <p>It opens on our unnamed hero, the Kid, as a kid, with his mother telling him bedtime stories about Demon Kings and heroic White Monkeys.</p>
        
            <p>Mum's idea of a soothing story isn't mine.</p>
        
            <p>We flash forward 20 years or so where the Kid works as a stooge at a backstreet fight club, wearing a monkey mask. His job is losing fights to make his opponents look good, but he has aspirations. He wants a better job - one that will get him closer to his enemies.</p>
        
            <p>He's now got a job - first washing dishes, then waiting tables. And he keeps getting into fights - and losing - with the gangsters who run this town.</p>
        
            <p>This is Slumdog territory, where the rich own everything and the poor are nothing. And leading the rich are a sinister Guru - a sort of Indian TV evangelist - a corrupt Cop, dishing out the beatings, and a shadowy Politician being pushed into high places.</p>
        
            <p>Do you want more backstory?</p>
        
            <p>No, the audience for a blood-red-poster film like Monkey Man doesn't need much more than this. They want action, but not just scenes of the Kid being beaten up in a wrestling ring.</p>
        
            <p>Clearly, before anything improves, he's going to need to sharpen up his act - and possibly dye his monkey mask a fetching shade of white.</p>
        
            <p>You're right, he's gonna need a montage - though where Monkey Man's montage differs from the standard, hair-metal number in this sort of film is it uses the rapid-fire beats of Indian tablas to sharpen him up.</p>
        
            <p>And when finally Dev Patel, the tae kwan do expert and first-time director, steps up to the plate, the action scenes are undeniably impressive.</p>
        
            <p>Particularly a fight in a kitchen with knives, guns, broken bottles and frying pans all vying with each other for maximum impact.</p>
        
            <p>Behind the fights there's rather less going on - though lack of depth hasn't hurt the John Wick movies, the obvious role model for Monkey Man.</p>
        
            <p>Once in a while, a supporting character makes a brief appearance, like Sharlto Copley as the fight club MC, or the amusing Alphonso and his tiny car.</p>
        
            <p>Equally wasted is Sita the nightclub hostess who you keep hoping will be more than just someone the Kid rescues now and again.</p>
        
            <p>Mind you, even the dastardly bad guys tend to be crowded out by ever-more frequent fight scenes.</p>
        
            <p>Are fight scenes enough in a modern-day action movie? A couple of years ago, I'd have said no, you need someone to be interested in, not just someone with a grudge. But clearly, I'm not exactly a Monkey Man.</p>
