        <h2>Why are musicians and fans wearing earplugs at gigs?</h2>
        <p>
There is a cultural shift in the works when it comes to partying: Young people are thinking about their ears, writes Samantha Mythen.

            <p>Booming bass and sound waves bombarding your body and ears with each guitar strum, drumbeat or twist on a controller. You are a puppet in the crowd, the musician on stage twirling strings making you dance.</p>
        
            <p>Glorious, euphoric fun.</p>
        
            <p>Until, you are lying in bed, ears ringing, unable to sleep.</p>
        
            <p>Exposure to loud sounds for an extended period can lead to ear damage, resulting in tinnitus and hearing loss.</p>
        
            <p>But a new generation of musicians and music lovers hope to hear long into old age, their latest event essential; earplugs.</p>
        
            <p>Producer and DJ Jon Tweed, 29, has been attending gigs for a good decade and he has been wearing earplugs for most of those years.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and my mates started going to more electronic gigs in town, which tended to be louder than university events at that time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we started noticing ringing in our ears and were going to bed hearing that same ringing even though we weren't at the gig anymore."</p>
        
            <p>He went to Rockshop and bought a mid-range set of earplugs for about $40.</p>
        
            <p>"After wearing those, I felt the after-effects were less noticeable. You didn't leave thinking wholly my ears have just been slammed with noise."</p>
        
            <p>Four years ago, he bought custom-moulded earplugs with a flat-frequency response drop.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't compromise what you're hearing so much apart from removing harshness and overall volume for your ears."</p>
        
            <p>In the past, Tweed would get comments from other gig-goers asking why he wore earplugs. But he said it become much more common to see people adorning their ears with protection.</p>
        
            <p>"People are a lot more responsive. Particularly international DJs coming over are very across it and you see almost all of them wearing earplugs when they're playing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's setting a good example."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi-owned earplug company Sets first came onto the scene in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Co-founders Emily Janus and Grace Ko said the demand was not there when they started, with the only earplugs available being targeted primarily towards musicians and industry professionals.</p>
        
            <p>"But we wanted to see everyone in the club protected - including those out on the dancefloor," Janus said.</p>

            <p>They had to focus heavily on educating their community on the risks of hearing damage before they saw an increase in demand.</p>
        
            <p>But now they have venues and festivals asking for Sets to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"The demand is growing quickly and we're seeing so many more people integrating Sets into their nights out."</p>
        
            <p>The demand has even brought another competitor to the market.</p>

            <p>Originally founded in Australia nine years ago, Earjobs has been supplying New Zealand for the past five years. The company just opened an Auckland-based warehouse in March.</p>
        
            <p>"We were always really impressed by how much demand there was in New Zealand, even with the time shipping took," co-owner Cel Ellis-Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we wanted to come over and demand is picking up every day."</p>
        
            <p>Ellis-Clark believed there had been a cultural shift, where being mindful of health was considered cool by younger generations.</p>
        
            <p>Once perceived as being overcautious or missing out on the experience by wearing earplugs, young people are choosing to think in the long term.</p>
        
            <p>"It's bucking a long-standing historical trend of young people being the most reckless in society," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"The good thing is, if more people wear earplugs, the more others feel comfortable doing the same."</p>
        
            <p>Janus agreed, saying there had been a "huge shift" recently around partying and wellness, seen with the rise in low or 0 percent alcoholic drinks and hangover prevention supplements hitting the market too.</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal is for wearing earplugs on a night out to be the norm."</p>
        
            <p>Drummer Rick Cranson has spent his life playing music and attending gigs; 50 years of slamming sound into his ears.</p>
        
            <p>"I never got told as a young kid that hearing loss was going to be a thing and I used to finish practicing in my room, wondering why my ears were going reeeeeeeeeeee for the rest of the day and at night when I went to sleep," he said.</p>

            <p>"I can honestly say I would have used ear protection about 2 percent of the time, if at all, and I'm now suffering the consequences of that in a big way."</p>
        
            <p>Cranson has lost base and treble frequencies in his left ear, meaning his hearing distorts and can cut out at certain volumes.</p>
        
            <p>The only way to get those frequencies back is to have specifically customised hearing aids.</p>
        
            <p>"My friends have suggested I get some, and I think the time is coming when I may have to do that to maintain working in the industry that I love."</p>
        
            <p>He always wears earplugs when attending live music now, saying they do not ruin the quality of the experience.</p>
        
            <p>"You're still able to feel with your body some of those frequencies, and all that [wearing earplugs] it's doing is evenly reducing the volume that your ears are exposed to, and I think the technology for earplugs now is that good it doesn't ruin things."</p>
        
            <p>Tweed and Cranson believed there was also the responsibility of club owners and musicians to ensure their sound systems were putting out an appropriate volume level.</p>
        
            <p>"This way, even people without earplugs will not get their ears permanently damaged," Tweed said.</p>
        
            <p>Venues across the motu, such as Wellington's Meow and Christchurch's Hide, are picking up on the demand for hearing protection.</p>
        
            <p>Both offer foam earplugs from behind the bar and sell Sets earplugs, which often sell out.</p>
