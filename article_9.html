            <p>Living with Long Covid can be exhausting, painful and lonely, and most people do not know when their symptoms will improve.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2000 people in New Zealand have registered as having Long Covid, while another 1200 have started the process to join the official registry.</p>
        
            <p>It was set up by University of Auckland researchers to get a better understanding of how many people in New Zealand have the disease.</p>
        
            <p>Those academics think around 10 to 20 percent of people infected by Covid-19 may go on to develop Long Covid, which means up to 200,000 could be suffering.</p>
        
            <p>Every person with Long Covid has a story - here are a few to show what life with the disease can be like.</p>
        
            <p>Rufial Willow-Blake Lemmens feels like she has missed every first with her children because Long Covid has her in bed 18 hours a day.</p>

            <p>"Those moments are gone forever. That grief and guilt of always telling them to leave me to rest or that I'm not coming to watch them swim."</p>
        
            <p>Just a year ago, 37 year-old Rufial was a busy mum of two with a baby on the way. She was active, climbing mountains and regularly hosting a church group.</p>
        
            <p>Now, after catching Covid-19 in late 2022, she battles daily with extreme fatigue and often loses the ability to use her legs, arms and torso.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have a life... I can't take a bath or go for a walk. I can't even listen to music or watch TV, the stimulus is too much and it tires me out. I just desperately want to do some baking, some sewing, or take my baby for a walk in the pram. I've never done that."</p>
        
            <p>Rufial said it took months to access support through Work and Income and Disability Support Services.</p>
        
            <p>She was finally approved to hire a nanny to help with childcare in September. Rufial also has funding for a support person to shower and feed her each day.</p>
        
            <p>"I know I'm lucky. I know that the majority of people with Long Covid don't actually get support. I think the only reason I get it is because I have a baby - I think that's the only reason I've been approved".</p>
        
            <p>Rufial wished those with Long Covid could access disability support faster and that there could be more emotional support for people like her that are isolated.</p>

            <p>"I'm numb all the time. I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't laugh, I don't cry - I'm numb."</p>
        
            <p>The 61-year-old has been suffering since November 2022. He's exhausted, has difficulty breathing and battles with brain fog as well as the constant buzzing of tinnitus.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard for people to understand. You try and do stuff and then you end up crashing for two or three days, sometimes longer, because you've done a wee bit of work around the house or something's stressed you out."</p>
        
            <p>Dean used to enjoy going out and watching live sport - particularly Otago and Highlanders rugby games - but now he is too sick to go and is worried he will get Covid-19 again.</p>
        
            <p>"You lose your self-confidence. I don't even want to go out at times because I get physically drained. It gets into your head and you can't relax. There are some whānau functions that I haven't gone to because I couldn't handle the noise. You get tired and want to sit down somewhere and you've got everyone else running around having fun".</p>
        
            <p>Dean is on a sickness benefit because his underlying health issues and Long Covid diagnosis mean he cannot work.</p>
        
            <p>He has a good doctor and sees a counsellor regularly, but he wished there was more financial support available and a place for people with Long Covid to talk in person.</p>

            <p>Hannah Vogels' life was once packed and busy. The 25-year-old was working, studying and enjoying spending time with her friends.</p>

            <p>Then, in February 2022, she caught Covid-19, which soon developed into Long Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"I already had ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) so I was aware I could get Long Covid. Then the fatigue from Covid-19 hit me hard and never went away."</p>
        
            <p>Hannah deals with pain, dizziness, migraines and exhaustion. She has also developed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which affects the heart.</p>
        
            <p>"I get nerve pain in my legs which feels like they're are burning. I can lose sensation in my hands and legs sometimes".</p>
        
            <p>Hannah was forced to move back home with her family and has been unable to work since.</p>
        
            <p>She said accessing a disability benefit took a lot of time and effort for someone struggling with intense exhaustion.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't feel well-supported. I feel like I'm having to do all the work. I should be able to focus on turning up to my appointments, taking medication and following my treatment plan. But I am spending my time researching, advocating for myself and pushing paperwork".</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The 55-year-old developed symptoms in 2020, lost his well-paying job in IT and went on a sickness benefit.</p>
        
            <p>Over the last three years Karl has had a heart murmur, a collapsed lung, chronic diarrhoea, migraines, exhaustion and intense brain fog.</p>
        
            <p>"I have used Wellington buses for years, but when I was really sick it got to the point where my girlfriend wouldn't let me take the bus. On a couple of occasions I had to ring her to come and find me because I was lost."</p>
        
            <p>By September 2021 Karl could no longer afford to live in his rental home, so he and his partner sold everything and bought a house bus. But that meant he didn't have anywhere permanent for his son to stay.</p>
        
            <p>"It hurts. I feel like I'm failing him. I feel like he needs his father."</p>
        
            <p>Karl has struggled to get a diagnosis for Long Covid, a common problem due to the wide range of symptoms the disease can cause.</p>
        
            <p>"Going through the health service and getting gaslit like that is one of the very worst parts of it. I went there for help, and I got brushed off and insulted by somebody who didn't take the time to have a look.".</p>
        
            <p>Karl wants a Long Covid clinic set up to streamline healthcare for people like him and he wants access to government financial support to improve.</p>
        
            <p>Long Covid Support Aotearoa connected RNZ with Rufial, Dean, Hannah and Karl.</p>
        
            <p>It is a support group that began as a Facebook page in 2020 for people looking for answers after they caught Covid-19 and did not get better.</p>
        
            <p>It currently has around 2300 members who share resources, research and advice.</p>
