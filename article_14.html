            <p>Six months after author Neil Gaiman was accused of sexual assault by two women, including one from New Zealand, more allegations against him have been revealed.</p>
        
            <p>The 64-year-old fantasy author, known for his works such as The Sandman, Good Omens and American Gods, was first accused of sexual assault in July 2023, by UK-based platform Tortoise media in a podcast series called Master: The allegations against Neil Gaiman.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple women have now spoken to Vulture, a US entertainment news page for the New York Magazine, with allegations of sexual assault.</p>
        
            <p>Writer Lila Shapiro spoke with eight women who detailed their experiences, including four who had previously been featured on the podcast.</p>
        
            <p>One of the women, New Zealander Scarlett Pavlovich, who was hired as a nanny for Gaiman and his ex-wife musician Amanda Palmer, when they were living on Waiheke Island, detailed how she had been friends with Palmer when she was 22 and Palmer was 44, before being introduced to Gaiman.</p>
        
            <p>She told Vulture she randomly met Palmer on the street in Auckland and they soon became friends. She said she had a crush on Palmer and was happy to help out with looking after her young child she shared with Gaiman (who Palmer was separated from at the time).</p>

            <p>Pavlovich said within hours of being introduced to Gaiman he had persuaded her to take a bath naked in his outdoor bathtub, before he joined her and performed a sex act against her will while telling her to call him "master", Vulture reported.</p>
        
            <p>She was 22 and Gaiman was 61.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged assaults continued, Pavlovich told Vulture, throughout her time babysitting for the family and their young child began referring to her as "slave", she said.</p>
        
            <p>On one occasion she passed out due to the pain from a sexual encounter with Gaiman, Pavlovich alleged on the Master podcast.</p>
        
            <p>Pavlovich filed a police report against Gaiman accusing him of sexual assault, but Vulture reported NZ police said "the matter had been closed".</p>
        
            <p>She told Vulture she had to sign an NDA after she stopped working as the family's nanny.</p>
        
            <p>Another woman, Katherine Kendall, who met Gaiman in 2012 when she was 22, alleged he attempted to have sex with her on his tour bus and told her he was "used to getting what he wanted".</p>
        
            <p>Kendra Stout told Vulture she had been a fan of Gaiman's work and met him at a book signing when she was 18.</p>
        
            <p>Stout alleged Gaiman raped her three years later when she asked him to stop due to having a painful urine infection.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman denied the original allegations in July 2023 and claimed the sexual encounters had been consensual.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman's literary agents did not respond to a request for comment from RNZ, but he has since responded to the allegations publicly on his website.</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman said he read the latest accounts and there were moments he "half-recognised" along with moments he did not.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was "far from a perfect person", but had never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone.</p>
        
            <p>"I went back to read the messages I exchanged with the women around and following the occasions that have subsequently been reported as being abusive.</p>
        
            <p>"These messages read now as they did when I received them - of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again."</p>
        
            <p>Gaiman said he realised he could have "done better" and was emotionally unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>"I was obviously careless with people's hearts and feelings, and that's something that I really, deeply regret. It was selfish of me. I was caught up in my own story and I ignored other people's.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from what actually took place that they bear no relationship to reality."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would not accept being described as someone he was not and would not admit to doing things he did not do.</p>
