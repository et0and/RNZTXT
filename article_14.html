            <p>Analysis - Moana Pasifika threw Friday night's game against the Highlanders away in the first half, eventually going down 31-29 at the North Harbour Stadium in Albany.</p>
        
            <p>In a tough, close battle in round three of Super Rugby Pacific, the hosts, playing at home for the first time, in front of a vocal crowd, stopped the Highlanders from scoring any points in the second 40.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, they were reminded again that the game of rugby is pretty simple - get possession, keep it and turn those into points.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika could not do that in the first 40 minutes of Friday night's Super Rugby Pacific clash against the Highlanders at home in North Harbour.</p>

            <p>While Moana Pasifika did plenty of hard work in the first half, their own mistakes presented the Highlanders a 21 points advantage in the first 40 minutes as the visitors stormed to a 31-10 lead at half-time.</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika were already disadvantaged going into the game.</p>
        
            <p>It was virtually a match-up of David against Goliath, the biblical story told and re-told so many a times.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders have been in the Super Rugby mix for a long time - 1996, to be precise, was when they first started playing in the Super 12 competition.</p>
        
            <p>Playing their first game at home, North Harbour Stadium being their new home ground, Moana Pasifika were decked in their heritage colours - wearing an exact replica of the jerseys won by the Pacific Islanders in 2004.</p>

            <p>The Tau Moana response by the home team to the Highlanders haka set the tone for a fiery contest as thousands of fans packed the stadiums at the Albany ground.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders took an early 10 point lead in as many minutes, but Moana Pasifika responded with heavyweight prop Sione Mafile'o and then fullback David Havili scoring a try each within four minutes of each other.</p>
        
            <p>But then disaster struck.</p>
        
            <p>First it was winger Caleb Tangitau who intercepted a Moana Pasifika passing movement five metres off the line to dash 90 metres to dot down between the posts.</p>
        
            <p>Then it was Taniela Tele'a who completed another opportunity when Jackson Garden-Bachop tapped back from a high ball he could not fully gather, before lock forward Mitch Dunshea dived over the line pushing the Highlanders further ahead, and Sam Gilbert added the extra points.</p>

            <p>Halftime - Highlanders 31, Moana Pasifika 10.</p>
        
            <p>Savea won the battle against Highlanders captain and strongman Jim Tavatavanawai, and claimed a superb try in the second spell, catching a clean ball and running to score untouched.</p>
        
            <p>Havili and number eight Semisi Tupou Ta'eiloa claimed a try each in the half as well while the Highlanders were restricted from scoring any points.</p>
        
            <p>With five minutes to go Moana Pasifika threw all they had into the game but time ran out on them as Highlanders hung on to win 31-29.</p>

            <p>Highlanders captain Tavatavanawai said it was a tough battle and thanked his players for sticking with it, especially in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank the boys for that win," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The former Moana Pasifika player said their opponents gave it to them.</p>
        
            <p>"We stuck to the plan, there was a lot of emotions in the game."</p>

            <p>Losing captain Savea said it was a tough one to lose.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked the crowd who turned out in numbers to support them.</p>
        
            <p>"We did not start well but realty proud of my boys and big shout out to the crowd, we really fell them tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"When you hear the crowd singing and cheering it lifts you up. So grateful to have the crowd here.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately we didn't get the win but we take the lessons and move forward to the Hurricanes."</p>
        
            <p>And as the darkness enveloped North Harbour Stadium last night it was plain that, had Moana Pasifika kept possession in the first half, they could have registered their first win at home.</p>
        
            <p>That would have to be left for the next one though.</p>
