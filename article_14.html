            <p>Three deaths have been reported by local media after a large earthquake in Papua New Guinea on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>There are varying reports of the exact magnitude of the quake, but the US Geological Survey said it was magnitude 6.9 and just over 40 kilometres deep.</p>
        
            <p>The Post-Courier newspaper is reporting three people died, including two children.</p>
        
            <p>It said more than 90 houses collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The East Sepik region has been grappling with flooding in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>A man from Sotmeri village in the Gawi local level government area, Ruben Kami, told the newspaper a three-year-old boy in their village had died after the weight of the house forced the child beneath the high waters.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Defence Dr Billy Joseph said the National Disaster Centre contacted the Provincial Disaster Coordinator for East Sepik, Derrick Watwik, who confirmed the earthquake was felt in Wewak with no major damage.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the communities at or near the epicentre may have experienced major destruction.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph contacted East Sepik Governor Allan Bird and offered his support, and would work closely to coordinate the response to the earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>He said he instructed acting commander of defence Phillip Polewara to order the CO of the Second Royal Pacific Islands Regiment at Moem Barracks to use all defence assets, including vehicles, to help the people.</p>
        
            <p>"Our bilateral partners have been alerted that we will be seeking assistance from them after we get initial reports from the Provincial Disaster Office," Joseph added.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph expressed gratitude to all frontline responders, volunteers, and individuals who stepped forward to help their fellow citizens.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain steadfast in our commitment to assist and support the people severely affected by these natural disasters, and we will continue to provide updates on our relief efforts in the days to come."</p>
