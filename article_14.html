            <p>It was touted as an economic triumph, but the Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill poisoned land, water, and people, leaving Kawerau high and dry.</p>
        
            <p>As Aotearoa debates new fast-track legislation, Mata examines the mill’s “toxic legacy."</p>
        
            <p>Tasman began its life as a joint venture between the Crown and Fletcher Holdings. Powered by geo-thermal energy, the mill was established to process mature pine trees from nearby Kaingaroa - a state-owned forest, planted by prisoners and the unemployed - on land wrongfully taken from Māori.</p>
        
            <p>To help the mill achieve that purpose - the government passed special fast track legislation, the Tasman Pulp and Paper Company Enabling Act 1954.</p>
        
            <p>"First of all, all the waste went into the Tarawera river," said Coleen Skerrit-White, trustee of Te Waiū Settlement Trust.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like a fairy tale," Tomai Fox says. "Once upon a time, there was a lake. Now there was no lake. And that's the hurting part of our people. And what is, what's happening down there?"</p>
