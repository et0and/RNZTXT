            <p>The Black Sticks women have failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time in 28 years after a gut-wrenching loss to the United States in India.</p>
        
            <p>The 1-0 defeat in their final pool game at Olympic qualifying tournament in Ranchi, followed by India's 5-1 win over Italy, was enough to leave New Zealand third in their group.</p>
        
            <p>With only the top two teams advancing to the semi-finals, the Black Sticks' hopes of competing at Paris this year are over, meaning the Olympic women's tournament won't feature them for the first time since the 1996 Games in Atlanta.</p>
        
            <p>Coming off a 3-0 win over Italy and a 3-1 loss to India, the 10th ranked New Zealanders needed victory over the US to ensure they advanced but weren't at their best against opponents ranked two places below them.</p>

            <p>After an even start, the Americans hit the front early in the second quarter through an Elizabeth Yeager goal from a penalty corner.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand earned their first penalty corner of the game five minutes into the second half but began to create chances in the final quarter as they sought goals.</p>
        
            <p>Two goals were disallowed from penalty corners with the first being deemed too high off a hit and the second was overruled for a Black Sticks player obstructing a defender.</p>

            <p>The unbeaten Black Sticks men kept their qualifying hopes alive with a 2-2 draw against reigning world champions Germany at their qualifying tournament in Oman.</p>

            <p>In a game that showcased the improvement the side has made in the past year, New Zealand stayed in the fight throughout the contest against their fifth-ranked opponents.</p>
        
            <p>Having opened with a 3-1 win over Chile, the 10th-ranked Black Sticks remain level at the top of their pool alongside Germany on four points.</p>
        
            <p>Victory over winless Canada on Friday morning will guarantee New Zealand advance to the semi-finals, although a draw or even a loss could yet be enough, depending on the result of the other game between Germany and Chile.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Lane set up Sean Findlay for a stunning goal in the opening minute but Germany led 2-1 at halftime courtesy of goals to Gonzalo Peillat and Tom Grambusch in the second quarter.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand posed more of a threat in the second half and found an equaliser when Kane Russell delivered a classy assist for Hayden Phillips to deflect the ball into the roof of the net.</p>
        
            <p>Black Sticks goalkeeper Leon Hayward made three excellent late saves to ensure New Zealand ended the match level-pegging.</p>
