        <h2>Tears, joy and fear on the streets of DC after Trump's victory</h2>
        <p>
"Like having a dog drive your car"' - one Harris supporter on women voting for Donald Trump.
</p>
        
            <p>Donald Trump's stunning victory in the US presidential election has been greeted with tears, anxiety, joy and elation on the streets of the nation's capital Washington DC this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The win over Kamala Harris makes Donald Trump just the second President to win a second term after previously losing.</p>
        
            <p>Trump supporters spoken to by RNZ in Washington DC were ecstatic about the win saying a new Trump presidency would bring about the change that the country desperately needed.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was promising to tighten the border to stop the flow of illegal immigration, introduce import tariffs to help protect the economy from cheaper foreign imports, and end the war in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel great about it... I think people underestimate that there's silent majority that comes out on election night for Trump," one man said.</p>

            <p>Another, originally from Wales, said he was "elated".</p>
        
            <p>"The economy played a big factor. I also think men came out and voted, the border was an issue, the non-domestic stuff, you know you've got three wars brewing and basically you need a war monger in office to clear it all up," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe it's an extremist way of looking at it but you push a certain amount of people too far and they're gonna start fighting back and it's gonna get ugly," another said.</p>
        
            <p>Last night in his victory speech, Trump talked of bringing in a golden era for the United States and stressed he would be keeping his promises.</p>
        
            <p>Harris supporters spoken to by RNZ however talked about being devastated and gutted by the result.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a union member, he's gonna gut the unions, he's gonna screw up our school systems, he's gonna gut all that stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"And I've got a grandson who was just born this year, I feel sorry for him. My son-in-law is from New Zealand, we'll probably move to New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>One woman spoken to became visibly upset when talking about her fears for the health rights of women under a Trump presidency and the ability of women to access abortions.</p>

            <p>"I don't understand it to be honest, I don't understand how you could be a woman and vote for Trump, it doesn't make any sense.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like having your dog drive a car because he likes car rides, or something, none of it makes any sense."</p>
        
            <p>Another Harris voter said he felt Donald Trump was a fascist and he now held grave fears for the future of American democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"Heart break a little bit," one woman said.</p>
        
            <p>A male voter said the country he grew up in "was not going to be that way any more".</p>
