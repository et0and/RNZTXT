            <p>Transparency International says the latest Corruption Perception Index shows another year of "little to no meaningful progress" towards curbing corruption in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>Transparency International has released its 2023 report, based on a points system, and Denmark, Finland and New Zealand top the list.</p>
        
            <p>Other than New Zealand and Australia, Fiji is the highest-ranked Pacific country, coming in 53rd.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji has 53 points out of a possible 100.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu is 61st (48 points) and Solomon Islands 70th (43 points).</p>
        
            <p>Then it's a drop to Papua New Guinea in 133rd with 29 points.</p>
        
            <p>Transparency International said the Asia-Pacific region shows long-term stagnation, although some countries historically at the top are backsliding.</p>
        
            <p>"While there's a steady influx of economic, military or financial incentives to support development and climate goals, many Pacific countries have weak governance systems - which some donors overlook, exposing these substantial investments to high risk of corruption," the organisation reported.</p>
        
            <p>Transparency International said a 2020 survey in Asia showed that nearly one in seven people had been offered bribes in exchange for votes in a national, regional or local election in the past five years.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in the Pacific region in 2021, approximately a quarter of respondents reported being offered a bribe for their votes.</p>
        
            <p>"These findings show the serious implications for the ability of elections to bring in governments that can be trusted to control and curb corruption effectively."</p>
        
            <p>But the organisation said at the regional level, Pacific leaders continue to demonstrate some commitment to the fight against corruption, with the gradual implementation of the Teieniwa Vision - a set of collective anti-corruption priorities.</p>
        
            <p>These were endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Progress has been slow and there has been limited involvement of regional civil society organisations around this initiative.</p>
        
            <p>"ASEAN leaders should also continue to find common mechanisms to review their anti-corruption commitments under the ASEAN Political-Security Community Blueprint 2025, a ten-year plan aimed at instilling a culture of integrity and anti-corruption in the region."</p>
        
            <p>They should also continue strengthening their national and regional anti-corruption frameworks, and increasing joint efforts to address grand corruption, Transparency International said.</p>
