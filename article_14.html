            <p>Total visitor numbers in the Cook Islands in 2024 could rival the pre-pandemic high set in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) which came to a halt in 2020 when borders shut.</p>
        
            <p>Numbers from the Cook Islands Statistics Office show close to 160,000 visitors went to the Cook Islands between January to November last year, with December figures still to be counted. The record number in 2019 was 171,550.</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands Tourism Industry Council president Tere Carr said 2024 was a very good year for the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"We're either equalling [the 2019 number] or will surpass it for sure once the numbers are tallied up for December," Carr said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there was good visitor numbers to the island [in December] which is unusual at this time of the year, at Christmas time and going into January."</p>
        
            <p>Carr said more tourists were choosing to spend Christmas and New Year in Rarotonga which was unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually created another problem where there's limited time to address some of the maintenance issues that most businesses have to do and that was traditionally during this time of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Carr said in 2019 the number of tourists had been building and some locals were unhappy with the growth.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said attitudes had changed with more tourists opting to stay in smaller holiday homes, not just where the main hotels were.</p>
        
            <p>"More locals are actually benefiting from it and that's a positive thing.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not seeing the same pushback this time; it seems like tourism has sort of absorbed itself into the various new accommodation areas around the island."</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead Carr said Rarotonga would continue to be a destination for families - especially from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got the high-end places - if people do want high-end accommodation, there are some available - but I think generally we're at that mid-market."</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands borders reopened to New Zealand in 2021 for three months, then again fully in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>With Rarotonga being the only destination open to New Zealanders for a period, Carr said it meant "a whole lot of New Zealanders" who had never been to Rarotonga fell in love with the place.</p>
