            <p>Back at work and already looking ahead to your next break?</p>
        
            <p>Here are the key dates to be aware of for 2025 - and how you can use the least amount of annual leave for the longest stretch of time off across the year.</p>
        
            <p>Waitangi Day falls on a Thursday, so by using one annual leave day on Friday 7 February, you'll get a four-day weekend.</p>
        
            <p>These fall in the same week this year so, by booking annual leave for 14-17 and 22-24 April, you'll use seven days of annual leave, but get 16 days off work.</p>
        
            <p>Take four days of annual leave 16-19 June and you'll have nine days out of the office.</p>
        
            <p>Already thinking ahead to next summer? Christmas Day and Boxing Day, as well as the New Year's statutory holidays fall on a Thursday and Friday in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Use those stat days, along with six days of annual leave, to take off 22, 23 and 24 December, along with 29, 30 and 31 December to get a 16-day stretch of time off work.</p>
        
            <p>While exact start dates for individual schools differ, Term 1 starts between Monday 27 January and Friday 7 February (at the latest).</p>
        
            <p>The first lot of school holidays run from 12 April to 27 April and include Easter and Anzac Day.</p>
