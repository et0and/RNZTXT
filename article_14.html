            <p>Kiwi actor Morgana O'Reilly still cannot quite believe she is in the third season of The White Lotus.</p>
        
            <p>She tells Afternoons host Jesse Mulligan how she got cast in the wildly successful HBO comedy and the "relentlessly juicy" new drama series Friends Like Her.</p>

            <p>O'Reilly recalls getting a response about her self-tape for the creators of the show while waiting for her friend to come down the aisle. </p>
        
            <p>"Shout out to my agent Zara, who I think was a bit of a dog with a bone with a casting agent," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I think she'd been establishing that relationship for quite some time so when the auditions came out, and I got an email like 'You've got an audition but you need to sign this NDA [non-disclosure agreement]' …[Soon after] she was like 'Oh, my goodness, that's the fastest signing of an NDA'.</p>
        
            <p>"I did a self-tape. Self-tapes are controversial amongst the acting folk [but] I love them and sent it off. Then like two weeks later, I got some nice feedback … I was actually at a friend's wedding. She was about to come down the aisle so I went and sat in the audience. I got this text from Zara that was like 'Oh my goodness, we've just had this lovely feedback from the casting of White Lotus'. I wanted to stop the wedding. But that was enough. I was like this'll do me for years, so nice. To just have somebody acknowledge [my tape] and like it, and especially them, was gorgeous.</p>
        
            <p>"Then another two weeks later, I was told that there was still quite strong interest, that there wouldn't be recalls and all that stuff and I would find out in the next few days. So again, I was like ' Oh, this is again, so nice. I can just enjoy the kind of fizz of it' and not… that drudgery of the back and forth which can be necessary for sure, but also it's incredibly emotionally draining."</p>
        
            <p>It was really cool to see The White Lotus creator Mike White at work, O'Reilly says. </p>
        
            <p>"He just loves actors. He loves performances, he loves cadence. He's always going 'try saying this' and he's behind the monitor sometimes. I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to make him crack up laughing."</p>
        
            <p>Part of what makes scoring a role in The White Lotus "a great cherry on top" is the boost it will give her current and future castmates, O'Reilly says,</p>
        
            <p>"If nothing else [an association with a White Lotus actor] elevates everyone that I work with, it just like opens the door."</p>
        
            <p>While filming the show, she thought about other Kiwi actors who could also thrive on a Mike White set.</p>
        
            <p>"Although there are some really great creatives there and I'm stoked to be there, it's another film set. It's better or no worse than what I know here."</p>
        
            <p>After a run of "kooky comedies", O'Reilly says it was a treat to play Nicole in the surrogacy drama Friends Like Her.</p>
        
            <p>"It was basically one of those roles that really got under my skin … I lost myself a bit and that's absolutely what you're in it for, you know.</p>
        
            <p>"I did a lot of prep by reading a lot about PTSD and trauma, because I really wanted to serve the many facets or nuances of somebody with a weighted past."</p>
        
            <p>She loved working with Australian actress Tess Haubrich, who plays her old friend Tess in the series.</p>
        
            <p>"She's such a firecracker, such a good actress. I loved working with her so much. Like a real game of tennis, you know, very playful, wicked, glorious."</p>
        
            <p>O'Reilly says Friends Like Her will attract an international audience.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a relentlessly juicy story and the whole cast is just especially good. It's been shot so beautifully. It's also like such a calling card for New Zealand, Kaikōura is stunning."</p>
