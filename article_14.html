            <p>"It's like this void, this emptiness in the room."</p>
        
            <p>Those are the words from one New Zealander experiencing loneliness, which is now at epidemic levels, according to Age Concern.</p>
        
            <p>The group recently carried out a study that showed 59 percent of Kiwis aged 65 and over had recently felt lonely or socially isolated.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint asked to hear from people feeling lonely and was overwhelmed with responses.</p>
        
            <p>We spoke to some of the people who got in touch.</p>
        
            <p>"After going out on a journey, say shopping or on a bus ride, you come home to a very empty house and that's when the loneliness just sets in straight away and you feel this, this emptiness, inside you, this, this horrible loneliness.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't know what to do about it - you can just sit there and mope, or just try to go to sleep."</p>
        
            <p>Michael is in his late 50's and lives in Christchurch, ever since he had a stroke 14 years ago, his life has become increasingly lonely.</p>
        
            <p>To combat those feelings of isolation, he tries to keep busy.</p>
        
            <p>"I try to tinker a lot with hobbies I had in the past that helps a little and a ride on the scooter always helps, go for the scooter around the block or down to the beach or the shops."</p>
        
            <p>Due to his recovery post stroke, it takes a lot of energy for Michael to socialise.</p>
        
            <p>But he is not even sure where to start when it comes to meeting people or organising an activity.</p>
        
            <p>He said it is harder because he is not on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not like they have posters saying 'Hey if you're lonely come and visit us and come and have a chat'.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no advertising at all anywhere, for anything."</p>
        
            <p>A study carried out by Age Concern shows 59 percent of participants aged 65 and over felt lonely or socially isolated.</p>
        
            <p>The study's authors describe it as a "hidden epidemic".</p>
        
            <p>Last year the US General Surgeon called loneliness a public health crisis.</p>
        
            <p>a 58-year-old man who did not want to be named was also living in Christchurch and struggling to socialise.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, I suppose it's just, you know, long term beneficiary barely getting by.</p>
        
            <p>"You have no money to socialise, so you don't meet new friends and your circles just get smaller as time goes by."</p>
        
            <p>He is on a benefit due to an injury that means he is unable to work, which he said was a huge barrier to getting out there to meet people.</p>
        
            <p>"When you barely have enough to pay the bills then you do not get the chance to meet new people, once you become a beneficiary, it's like you fall off a lot of people's radar or maybe they view you differently or something."</p>
        
            <p>He felt a sense of community had been lost over the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>"Those community things have been cut whether it's the council or the government saving money you know, when you lose community, it creates loneliness.</p>
        
            <p>"You get left behind by technology too, because I'm not on Facebook or any of those sorts of things.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, we used to get mailers in the letterbox, but you know, there is something on down the road or something."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Professor at Auckland University's school of population Janine Wiles has been part of many studies looking at loneliness.</p>
        
            <p>She said having shared spaces like libraries and parks is crucial to combat isolation.</p>
        
            <p>"They create opportunities for people to mix in more relaxed ways with people who are different, they have positive associations with health outcomes and even mortality."</p>
        
            <p>But Wiles said for those spaces to help, things like transport for people to get there must be invested in and getting the information to those that are not online.</p>
        
            <p>The onus should not just be on people that are lonely to make changes, we all have a part to play.</p>
        
            <p>"It's up to you to go and talk to people, all of us, benefit from diverse interaction, even if it's a very casual or relaxed smile at someone you are walking past."</p>
