            <p>Intense beefs, spectacular knockouts, end of eras and the birth of new stars, it was another chaotic year inside the world of the UFC. Jonty Dine takes a look back at the highlights.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya's revenge </p>
        
            <p>In this highly anticipated rematch, Adesanya took on his old rival and boogeyman, Alex 'Poatan' Pereira at UFC 287. Adesanya entered the octagon with a point to prove, having lost their previous encounter and being on the wrong end of a 3-0 scoreline between the pair across two combat sports. The champion had an aura of invincibility after just four UFC fights. After seemingly having the challenger hurt up against the cage, Pereira began to unload but overcommitted and caught a vicious right shot from Izzy on the button. The follow up shots were academic, but emphatic. Punctuated by performing Poatan's trademark arrow celebration as the Last Stylebender reclaimed his middleweight crown.</p>

            <p>The Suga Show begins </p>
        
            <p>The polarising bantamweight had the fan base split ever since not accepting his only career loss to Marlon Vera. Sean O'Malley refused to acknowledge the end of his undefeated streak with many calling him delusional. But O'Malley silenced his critics in August as he landed a clean right hook to knockout reigning champion Aljamain Sterling at UFC 292 and claim the 135 pound title.</p>
        
            <p>Jones reclaims his crown </p>
        
            <p>Jon Jone's much anticipated move up to heavyweight came with many questions, with most pressing being, "Is Bones the fighter he once was after three years out of the Octagon?". It took just over two minutes at UFC 285 against France's Cyril Gane to get an emphatic answer and the controversial Jones was once again the pound for pound king in MMA. Jones submitted Gane with a guillotine and barely broke a sweat in the process.</p>
        
            <p>Islam leaves no doubt </p>
        
            <p>Following a razor thin decision in their first meeting in Perth, Islam Makhachev and Alex Volkanovski each had claim to the best pound for pound fighter on the planet. However, taking the rematch as a short notice replacement for Charles Oliveria at UFC 294 in Abu Dhabi, Islam cracked Volk with a devastating head kick in round one and ended the rivalry in abrupt fashion. It marked Makhachev's 13th consecutive win, three shy of Anderson Silva's all time record of 16 while it was the first time Volkanovski has been knocked out since 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Strickland's shocker in Sydney </p>
        
            <p>A PR nightmare for the UFC, the brash American was now their middleweight champion after dominating almost every round against the incumbent Israel Adesanya. Though he was getting the better of the verbal exchanges in the lead up, few expected Strickland to back up his words in the cage. However, the champion was unable to penetrate Strickland's rock sold defence. Strickland punctuated his win when he charged down and screamed at Adesanya in the closing seconds.</p>

            <p>The Black Beast soars </p>
        
            <p>Derek Lewis, owner of the most UFC knockouts and king of the "swang and bang" took a different approach at UFC 291, opting to try his hand at a Jorge Masvidal impression. Within seconds of the bell, the Black Beast stormed towards his opponent and unleashed a terrifying Masvidal like flying knee flush on Marcos Rogerio de Lima. Lewis had both the fans and his opponent stunned as he finished up with some vicious ground and pound, to register his 14th knockout in the heavyweight division. Lewis celebrated as only he does, by taking off his shorts to the delight of the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Bo Nickal debut </p>
        
            <p>The highly touted wrestler came into the world's biggest MMA promotion with huge wraps, despite just a 3-0 record and has so far managed to live up to the hype. A three-time NCAA Division One champion, the middleweight made a seamless transition into the cage. His debut came on the main card at UFC 285, illustrating the excitement behind him. Squaring off against Jamie Pickett, Nickal immediately dragged his opponent to the mat and locked in an arm triangle with only three minutes on the clock. Nickal then showcased his striking prowess when he knocked out Val Woodburn in only 38 seconds four months later at UFC 290. A prospect who unlike Sage Northcutt and Raul Rosas Jr, has yet to succumb to the immense expectation.</p>
        
            <p>Gaethje the new BMF</p>
        
            <p>Two of the most exciting fighters on the planet went to war at UFC 291 for the Baddest Mother F***** title after it was vacated by Jorge Masvidal.</p>
        
            <p>Dustin Porier and Justin Gaethje was just the second meeting for the much maligned title but most looked past the gimmick for what was going to be a showcase of violence. Though it didn't reach the bloody heights most expected, it was predicably brutal and at one minute into round two, "the Highlight" added another to his reel with a picture perfect head kick to send the Diamond crashing to the canvas. Gaethje marked the moment with his trademark backflip off the cage.</p>
        
            <p>Ngannou departs</p>
        
            <p>The baddest man on the planet, Francis Ngannou opted to leave the UFC as heavyweight champion when they could not come up with an agreeable pay offer. Now a free agent, Ngannou signed with the Professional Fighters League with the condition he could pursue boxing. This came to fruition in a showdown with heavyweight champion Tyson Fury in October which though 'the Predator' lost, showed he belongs in there with the best.</p>

            <p>Game over for Gamebred </p>
        
            <p>After years as a journeyman, Jorge Masvidal enjoyed a sensational rise to superstardom in 2019 courtesy of his spectacular five second knockout of Ben Askren, backstage altercation with Leon Edwards and catch phrase "three piece and a soda." However, back to back losses to Kamaru Usman for the welterweight strap had killed much of the hype before a loss to heated rival Colby Covington ended all title aspirations. Gamebred was retired by Gilbert Burns at UFC 287 in a one sided decision in his hometown of Miami, ending a storied 20 year career which began in backyards with Kimbo Slice.</p>
        
            <p>Paddy vs Ariel </p>
        
            <p>One of the most unexpected rivalries of 2023 came between lightweight Paddy Pimblett and MMA journalist Ariel Helwani. Sparked from asking for payment for interviews, the pair went back and forth on podcasts with Helwani exposing the Liverpool larrikin with voicemail's contradicting Pimblett's claims. The fan base began to sour on the rising prospect and his comments following a controversial win over Jarred Gordon at UFC 282 solidified him as a villain.</p>
        
            <p>Poatan's a two division champ </p>
        
            <p>Alex Periera has made a monumental impact during his short stint in the UFC. Having been in the promotion for just two years, he has won championships in two weight classes. For years he dominated the kickboxing world before following his rival Israel Adesanya into MMA. After ending Adesanya's historic reign to win the middleweight title, Poatan moved up to lightheavyweight, where he was still an imposing physical presence. After dispatching contender Jan Blachowicz, Pereira earned a shot at champion Jiri Prozhaska. The pair had an epic back and forth but in the second, Pereira dropped Prochazka who shot for a takedown only to receive a barrage of elbows to the side of the head, ending the fight after four minutes of round two.</p>
        
            <p>The GOAT goes out on top </p>
        
            <p>At UFC 289 the greatest female mixed martial artist of all time lay down her gloves. The 'Lioness' had reclaimed her bantamweight title a year earlier and would defend it one more time against Irene Aldana. Amanda Nunes 50's across all three judges scorecards to close out her career in fitting style as a double champion. Nunes has the most wins in UFC women's history with 16, the most UFC title fight wins with 11, and the most finishes in UFC women's history with 10. Nunes finished with a record of 23-5 and a legacy that will take years to come close to.</p>
        
            <p>
Among Nunes' many highlights was ending the career of Ronda Rousey.
