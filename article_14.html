            <p>A 15-year-old who scored a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics says he was honoured to represent Aotearoa at the games. </p>
        
            <p>Yanhao 'Dwayne' Li has made history winning NZ's first ever ice skating medal at any winter olympics. </p>
        
            <p>He was awarded the medal for his free skating performance at the Winter Youth Olympics in Gangwon, South Korea. </p>
        
            <p>In an utterly graceful performance, Li pulled off a triple axel and a bunch of other technical moves.</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint it was a special and an emotional moment. </p>
        
            <p>"I feel very proud to represent New Zealand at such a big event. Seeing the New Zealand flag at the victory ceremony makes me very proud, I feel like all the hard work put in was worth it at the end, and that my training leading up to this has all paid off."</p>
        
            <p>Li said he was very nervous. </p>
        
            <p>"I was pretty shaky but I managed to control myself well, and I felt very excited being able to perform my programmes at such a big venue and skating to such a big crowd. Especially like the first element, my triple axel, this was my first time trying it in the competition and being able to be on my feet with such a big audience it feels really amazing."</p>
        
            <p>He said the consistency while training for the triple axel manoeuvre was not too bad. </p>

            <p>"I sometimes doubt myself a little bit while going into that jump but I think going into the competition I had a good mindset leading up to the jump."</p>
        
            <p>He admitted his training got tiring at around six to seven hours a day on the ice for two months, but he was glad he was able to showcase his work. </p>
        
            <p>To help get into the zone and concentrate, he treated the competition as everyday training.</p>
        
            <p>His family were back in New Zealand cheering him on, so his only support person at the games was his coach. </p>
        
            <p>Li is now setting his sights on the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taipei, which starts on 26 February.</p>
