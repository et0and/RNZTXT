        <h2>Country Life: 'It's lovely planting new trees and making nature'</h2>
        <p>
Ancient podocarp forest has become a classroom for schoolchildren taking part in a project to link land, river and community.

            <p>On the banks of the Ruamāhanga River, among towering ancient kahikatea, totara and matai, there are lots of small hands at work.</p>
        
            <p>A group of nine, 10 and 11-year-olds are planting saplings to help fill in the gaps which have been grazed over decades in this slice of forest on a farm in South Wairarapa.</p>

            <p>The 4.5 hectare block on Waihinga Farm, owned by the Smith family, is under a QEII Trust covenant, fenced off some years ago and left, with the help of volunteers, to rewild.</p>
        
            <p>Today it is an outdoor classroom, part of a project driven by the [Ruamāhanga Farm Foundation https://ruamahanga.org.nz/Ruamāhanga] to connect the land, river and local community.</p>
        
            <p>The same group of Year 5 and 6 children from Martinborough School has already spent time on the edge of the awa learning about its inhabitants and flow.</p>
        
            <p>The forest is likely the best example of what used to be on the plains of the valley, now mostly cropped, grazed or in grapevines, according to the QEII Trust's Trevor Thompson.</p>
        
            <p>"This is one of those final remnants that gives us an indication of what once was. So it's very important that we grab it with both hands, protect it," he told Country Life in between showing the children what and how to plant.</p>
        
            <p>About 9000 trees have been planted in the past year and a half.</p>

            <p>"We've got to try and fill in these light wells, make this a closed canopy, and then this area won't need our help."</p>
        
            <p>The children set to, digging in the dry earth. It's tough going and they are excited when they find a "smooshy" bit to create a bed for a new young plant.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really fun, really satisfying once you get a soft spot. I think it's lovely planting new trees and making nature," one of the boys said.</p>

            <p>Their teacher Courtney Miles said the tree planting will be turned into maths and literacy tasks later at school.</p>
        
            <p>"I think connection to community and connection to place is really important ... the children, you know, giving a little bit of themselves to this place as they're planting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really nice seeing children working together as well and connecting with other members of the community."</p>
        
            <p>The children are not just a "labour unit", Thompson said with a smile.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope and I'm sure they will become engaged and enjoy their time here most importantly, because if they enjoy being in the forest when they grow up to be big people, then they start looking after it."</p>
