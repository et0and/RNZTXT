            <p>The government's plan to liberalise granny flat rules will significantly save people time and money, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland says.</p>
        
            <p>Bill McKay, from the university's School of Architecture and Planning, has gone through the "nitty gritty" of the government's proposal and, all in all, believes it is a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal is also supported by the opposition, and would see people able to build small dwellings on their property without needing resource consent to do so.</p>
        
            <p>But what exactly is being proposed, and how easy will it actually be to build a self-contained dwelling in the backyard?</p>
        
            <p>McKay told Nine to Noon the government was seeking feedback and people could give it through the Ministry for Business and Employment's website until August.</p>
        
            <p>A discussion document released by the government had "quite a bit" of information about how it would change legislation to allow this to happen.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said the granny flats could be up to 60 square metres in size.</p>
        
            <p>It was "plenty of space" and "quite significant".</p>
        
            <p>According to Stats NZ, the median floor size of a new home consented in 2022 was 126sqm - so the dwelling could be just under half of that.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said the dwelling could only be one-storey high and had to be detached from the main house.</p>
        
            <p>There was nothing in the proposal saying how many bedrooms the dwelling could have, with McKay saying a dwelling of that size could easily have two along with living, kitchen, dining and a bathroom.</p>
        
            <p>The dwellings could be built without consent - as long as they met certain criteria.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said people would need to notify their local council that they were planning to build such a dwelling - and they would need to get some information.</p>
        
            <p>This included areas on the property that were prone to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Once the build was complete, the council would need to be notified and be supplied with some drawings, showing locations of drains, for example.</p>
        
            <p>All dwellings would still need to comply with the Building Code.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said there were a couple of options - including a licensed building practitioner building the dwelling or supervising construction.</p>
        
            <p>Dwellings would have to be "well off the ground" to avoid flooding - and plumbing and drainage would need to connect to council infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The whole plan was "not as simple as we think" and a lot would still need to go into the planning stage.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said there needed to be common ownership with the main house.</p>
        
            <p>The area could be subdivided but there would be "hoops" to jump through with doing that.</p>
        
            <p>It was up to existing council policy for whether or not it could be rented or used as an Air BnB, for example.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, McKay said he supported the plan but not everyone will be out on the weekend "knocking these up".</p>
        
            <p>But it would be faster, cheaper and enable families to look after themselves.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was interested to see how it would work on Māori land - as there was a huge need.</p>
        
            <p>The current proposal only allowed one granny flat per property and it must be near the main house.</p>
        
            <p>On Māori land, McKay said several dwellings of this smaller size - and maybe no main house - were "really needed" as kaumatua housing or starter homes for young people.</p>
