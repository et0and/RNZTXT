            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown says the deal with China "complements, not replaces" the relationship with New Zealand after signing it on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said "The Action Plan for Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) 2025-2030" provides a structured framework for engagement between the Cook Islands and China.</p>
        
            <p>"Our relationship and engagement with China complements, not replaces, our long-standing relationships with New Zealand and our various other bilateral, regional and multilateral partners - in the same way that China, New Zealand and all other states cultivate relations with a wide range of partners," Brown said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said the agreement would be made available "in the coming days" on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration online platforms.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said his government continues to make strategic decisions in the best long-term interests of the country.</p>
        
            <p>He said China had been "steadfast in its support" for the past 28 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been respectful of Cook Islands sovereignty and supportive of our sustained and concerted efforts to secure economic resilience for our people amidst our various vulnerabilities and the many global challenges of our time including climate change and access to development finance."</p>
        
            <p>The statement said priority areas of the agreement include trade and investment, tourism, ocean science, aquaculture, agriculture, infrastructure including transport, climate resilience, disaster preparedness, creative industries, technology and innovation, education and scholarships, and people to people exchanges.</p>
        
            <p>At the signing was China's Premier Li Qiang and the minister of Natural Resources Guan Zhi'ou. On the Cook Islands side, was Prime Minister Mark Brown and the associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration Tukaka Ama.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for New Zealand Minister for Foreign Affairs Winston Peters released a statement earlier on Saturday, saying New Zealand will consider the agreements closely, in light of New Zealand and the Cook Islands' mutual constitutional responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that the content of these agreements will be of keen interest to the people of the Cook Islands. We note that Prime Minister Mark Brown has publicly committed to publishing the text of the agreements that he agrees in China.</p>
        
            <p>"We are unable to respond until Prime Minister Brown releases them upon his return to the Cook Islands."</p>
