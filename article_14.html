            <p>A breakthrough in the study of the world's rarest whale was found by a Dunedin man having a cup of tea on his couch.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) said a creature, believed to be a male spade-toothed whale was reported washed up on the beach at Taieri Mouth in Otago on 4 July.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Gallagher had Thursdays off work, and decided to see what the waves were up to that morning.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted to check the swell in the hope of getting out for a surf, so went online to look at webcam footage of Taieri Mouth.</p>
        
            <p>On the camera, he saw something that looked like a beached whale, and did a double take.</p>
        
            <p>"You sometimes see seagulls that look like surfers and surfers that look like boats... beached dolphins that are actually logs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was all dependant on the webcam picture quality, the distances between objects and the light, Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>But this time around, he was certain it was a mammal.</p>
        
            <p>"I almost didn't call it into DOC because I thought they must've known about it or it had been there for a while. I didn't want to be annoying.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty lucky that I actually put my big kid pants on and rang it in."</p>
        
            <p>Later that night, DOC ranger Jim Fyfe contacted him to see if the creature, that Gallagher had tentatively compared to a porpoise, was still there.</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher explained he lived in Dunedin, half an hour from Taieri Mouth and out of view of the beach, and forwarded through the link to the web cam.</p>

            <p>A few days later, Fyfe got in touch again.</p>
        
            <p>"He mentioned that they'd been able to grab it and that it was a super rare beaked whale that was going to be frozen and held for further research," Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>"The rarest whale on the planet was found by me sitting on my couch, having a cup of tea, dreaming about having a surf when my wee baby daughter was feeling a little bit hōha."</p>
        
            <p>Since the 1800s, only six spade-toothed whale samples had been documented worldwide - the most recent was from Gisborne in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>The variable picture quality on the webcam had made it hard to determine scale, Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>"When [DOC] said it was five metres [long] I was like what the heck that's crazy... I'm sure if I saw it in real life, I wouldn't have called it a porpoise."</p>
        
            <p>Because of how quickly this animal was found, and how fresh it was, the first dissection of the species would now be able to happen, DOC said.</p>
        
            <p>A little of the find's shine was taken off by the whale being dead, Gallagher said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was kind of taken back by it, I was pumped to try and get out and get a wave but it didn't really feel right [after discovering the whale]. Plus I had a child that needed my attention.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very spiritual and majestic animals. You can't help but feel a bit sad for its loss," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm really stoked that it will contribute to our understanding of the deep blue."</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher said he would continue to report any future webcam discoveries to DOC.</p>
        
            <p>A sample from the whale had been sent to Auckland University to confirm its species.</p>
        
            <p>DOC hoped a hui would be held with all the various interested parties to decide on the next steps for the whale in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Until then, it was being held in a commercial cold store in Otago.</p>
