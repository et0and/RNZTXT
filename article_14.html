            <p>The Papua New Guinea government announced a late night Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday, with six new MPs coming into the executive.</p>
        
            <p>It comes during a two week state of emergency, established after rioting and looting left up to 22 people dead, and amid talk of votes of no confidence in the James Marape administration.</p>
        
            <p>There have been calls for Marape to resign, with MPs deserting the government.</p>
        
            <p>Senior police and public service officials have already been placed on suspension following the riots.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific's PNG correspondent, Scott Waide, has been across developments.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the most notable movement has been Ian Ling Stuckey, the Treasurer, being replaced by the prime minister and he being given the role of minister assisting the prime minister," Waide said.</p>

            <p>Marape said the changes were to introduce "new blood" and to recognise alliances within the coalition.</p>
        
            <p>"The country is not what it was in 1975. In 1975 we were a nation of under 3.5 million people. Today we are nation of over 12 million people. The challenges are much, much bigger."</p>
        
            <p>Waide said the United Resources Party, led by William Duma, was one of the big winners.</p>
        
            <p>The catalyst for the rioting was a protest by police over an apparent pay cut but Waide said it was not clear whether Stuckey was being blamed for this.</p>
        
            <p>He said the moves were about the government shoring up its support ahead of the no confidence motion window opening and it was too early to say whether it will lead to policy changes.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Marape said there will be support for businesses affected by the riots and looting.</p>
        
            <p>The National newspaper reports him saying that during the state of emergency period, the government was rebuilding the city and strengthening the police and defence forces.</p>
        
            <p>He said businesses were investors who pay tax, and their investments should have been protected by the government.</p>
        
            <p>The relief package would include a loan scheme, tax holiday, start-up capital and express access to foreign exchange, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The details were set to be released next week.</p>
