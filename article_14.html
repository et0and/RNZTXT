            <p>Current champions England ended their dismal World Cup campaign with a 93-run victory over Pakistan on Saturday, denying the 1992 champions the miracle they needed to make it to the last four of the showpiece 50-overs tournament.</p>
        
            <p>England had already been eliminated after six defeats in seven matches in a debacle that has prompted demands for an overhaul of their one-day squad.</p>
        
            <p>Electing to bat at Eden Gardens, England racked up a solid 337-9, with three of their top four batters smashing fifties in their third 300-plus total of the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Jonny Bairstow (59), Joe Root (60) and Ben Stokes (84) made half-centuries in a display that left their fans wishing the batters could have produced similar efforts more often in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan were all out for 244 in the 44th over and bowed out of the tournament after their fifth loss in nine matches.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have joined India, South Africa and Australia in the semi-finals, while England have secured a place in the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously the tournament hasn't gone to plan for us as a whole which is a real disappointment," said player-of-the-match David Willey.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a phenomenal group of players with massive talent. We have underperformed here which is disappointing."</p>
        
            <p>Malan (31) and Bairstow gave England a decent start following captain Jos Buttler's decision to bat.</p>
        
            <p>After the openers departed, Root and Stokes motored along even if it did not exactly rain boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>Pakistan's fielding was sloppy with Shaheen Afridi dropping Malan and Stokes off his own bowling, while Haris Rauf caught a skyer from Buttler only for his shoes to touch the boundary rope, thereby making it a six for England.</p>
        
            <p>Set a daunting target, Pakistan found themselves in the absurd position of needing to complete the chase in just 6.4 overs in order to make the last four ahead of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Willey (3-56), playing his last match for England, dismissed both the Pakistan openers in his first two overs.</p>
        
            <p>Babar Azam (38) and Mohammad Rizwan (36) got decent starts but could not push on to bigger totals.</p>
        
            <p>Agha Salman made 51 and down the order, Rauf smacked three sixes in his entertaining knock of 35 but it mattered little in the end.</p>
        
            <p>"We will sit together and take stock," Babar said of Pakistan's campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll take positives from this and discuss mistakes. I'm keen to lead the rebuild."</p>
