            <p>An ex-gang member and youth worker is using hand-carved canoes to help young people to reconnect with who they are.</p>
        
            <p>Sully Paea has overcome a challenging past and gone on to dedicate almost five decades to youth work in South Auckland. He established one of the area's first youth drop-in centres, the Crosspower Ministries Trust, and pioneered one of the first alternative education programmes in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Now the self-taught carver, who is of Niuean, Tongan and Samoan descent, is exhibiting a range of miniature vaka at Fresh Gallery in Ōtara.</p>
        
            <p>He began carving vaka five years ago during the Covid lockdowns, originally hoping to learn about his own history and culture.</p>
        
            <p>"I never realised that it created something that would take off ... it's been a very interesting, fascinating journey," he told Saturday Morning host Susie Ferguson.</p>
        
            <p>Paea, now 71, grew up in Niue, where he constantly heard the sounds of his neighbours building canoes.</p>
        
            <p>"I was fortunate to be able to grow up in that environment and see first-hand what they do."</p>

            <p>There was a lot of cultural knowledge wrapped in vaka-building, including lessons about the environment, the weather, and the moon and stars, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Paea described Niue as a "great place" but said his childhood "wasn't the best", and there was a lot of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>In the 1960s, he ran away and met up with his grandfather, who had been in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"He told me about the land of milk and honey and I said 'ooh I wanna jump on board, I'll go with you, I wanna get some of that milk and honey'."</p>
        
            <p>Paea moved to Aotearoa, but "I didn't find the milk and honey", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I found the Lion Red, rock and roll, everything that comes it. All the whisky that you can drink. So that was my life.</p>
        
            <p>"I went straight into that environment of alcohol and became an alcoholic, to a point where I had no life at all. Seven days - drink. That's all I lived for. Until I hit rock bottom."</p>
        
            <p>It took a spiritual experience to set him on a new course, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had an encounter with the almighty God that changed my life totally."</p>
        
            <p>He was "pulled out" of a life of drinking, crime and gangs and became a youth worker. At first, there was no pay, so he worked a full-time job during the day, then spent the evenings connecting with young people.</p>

            <p>Eventually it became a paid gig, and the youth centre followed in 1979.</p>
        
            <p>Paea said the community was being "neglected" today, and he was seeing more young people failing school, or selling drugs at the Ōtara Town Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"The gateway to the gangs is getting bigger and bigger, and you see more and more kids heading in that direction."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped that his exhibition could give Pasifika youth "a glimpse of who we are", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to know who we are, our identity as people. We're lost in a world that is not us and we need to find ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>Tau Vaka He Pasifika: The Canoes of the Pacific is on at Fresh Gallery Ōtara until 9 November.</p>
