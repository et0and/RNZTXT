            <p>Fiji's new anti-corruption chief has been taken in for questioning by the anti-corruption office in relation to an abuse of office allegation, a day after her appointment was announced.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Barbara Malimali, who has an active file at the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) concerning her role as the Electoral Commission chair, was revealed as the new commissioner of the anti-corruption office.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji media reported that the anti-corruption watchdog confirmed that Malimali, who remains the Electoral Commission chair, was questioned and released around midday local time.</p>
        
            <p>News of her appointment as head of FICAC drew criticism from Fijian political figures, including calls for the Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>"It is both astonishing and unethical that the Judicial Services Commission has confirmed the appointment of a person who is currently under investigation by the very organisation she is now set to lead," opposition MP Premila Kumar said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision raises serious concerns about the integrity and credibility of the appointment process," she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Rabuka has told state broadcaster FBC that the government had nothing to do with Malimali's appointment.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Judicial Services Commission was responsible for her appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Rabuka told FBC the country's Attorney-General Graham Leung would call a news conference later on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>According to a report by The Fiji Times, FICAC acting deputy commissioner Francis Puleiwai - who was acting as FICAC boss - said she had also applied for the role but was unsuccessful.</p>
        
            <p>Puleiwai also shot down reports the anti-corruption office was being put under pressure from Cabinet ministers who are currently under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no pressure in terms of having it expedited from the government, but there are still investigations," she was quoted as saying in The Fiji Times' report.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific has contacted FICAC and Fiji Police for comments.</p>
