        <h2>Individual letterboxes to go?</h2>
        <p>

            <p>New Zealand Post could eventually stop delivering mail to individual letterboxes and instead require clusters of boxes under proposed changes, and the Postal Workers Union is not happy.</p>
        
            <p>The government was consulting on changing the deed of understanding it has with NZ Post.</p>
        
            <p>Among the changes were reducing the minimum delivery frequency, and allowing NZ Post to deliver to cluster or community boxes for new addresses.</p>
        
            <p>Postal Worker's Union president John Maynard told Morning Report the suggestion to stop delivering to individual home letterboxes was "sort of hidden away in the document".</p>
        
            <p>"That impacts every single person, eventually, about New Zealand Post saying they'd rather deliver to clusters or counters, or letterbox nests, but not to your household."</p>
        
            <p>Maynard said the proposal was to gradually stop delivering to existing letterboxes.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not going to take your letter box, they just don't want to put anything in it."</p>
        
            <p>It was important for people to be able to have their say, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Putting the letterboxes in clusters makes it easier for the company to sack all the posties and have the delivered by vans which wouldn't have to stop at your house, they'd put your mail at the end of the street."</p>
        
            <p>Maynard wanted the consultation time frame to be extended and the details clarified.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment said at the moment no more than 3 percent of delivery points can be be counter services or community mailboxes.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed changes would allowing NZ Post to switch 5 percent of its pre-existing delivery points to communal delivery points per year.</p>
        
            <p>"To be clear, there is no proposal requiring all householders to have their letterboxes in clusters or receiving their mail at counters, community mail boxes or communal "delivery points", MBIE spokesperson James Hartley said.</p>
        
            <p>If the proposals were confirmed by the Media and Communications Minister, NZ Post would have "operational flexibility to make changes in line with these new obligations" and reasonable notice would have to be provided.</p>
        
            <p>"The government wants to know what people think about the proposed changes and how it could impact them if introduced," Hartley said in a statement. He urged people to send feeback by 10 December.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Post has also been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Jim said his letter box gets a lot of use thanks to local real estate agents.</p>
        
            <p>Many rural areas already had cluster mailboxes, Liz said.</p>
        
            <p>"Who knows people may actually talk to each other while they're collecting their mail. A beneficial spin off," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Granted fewer items are being posted. However, it is a contract with the New Zealand public. The suggested change would have a considerable impact on the disabled, elderly and others who cannot readily travel," Penelope said.</p>
        
            <p>Sam was worried about the children: "Don't take away that moment of joy when a child gets a birthday card from a grandparent or overseas relative, arrive in the letterbox!"</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Mbie) was consulting on five proposed changes:</p>
