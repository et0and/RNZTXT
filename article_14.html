            <p>Tongan Prime Minister Hu'akavameiliku Siaosi Sovaleni resigned on Monday ahead of a no-confidence motion, the Tongan parliament office has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"At the opening of today's (Monday) session, a teary-eyed Prime Minister asked the Lord Speaker if he could say a few words, before the Motion was tabled. He was permitted to address the House," Matangi Tonga reports.</p>

            <p>"I'll be resigning immediately according to the Constitution," he was quoted as saying.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister defeated a previous vote of no confidence in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>According to Matangi Tonga, the motion for the no-confidence vote had not been tabled, and there was no debate on it.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament has been adjourned for lunch and will resume at 2pm local time.</p>
        
            <p>Hu'akavameiliku will hold a news conference at lunchtime.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ Pacific after stepping down, he said "this is the best way forward for Tonga".</p>
        
            <p>"It's better for me just to leave," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked his supporters and is hoping "someone" will rise up to lead the Kingdom for the next 10 months before the next general election.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were a few highlights during his term as prime minister, including the setting up the Tonga National University, securing funding to get a second internet cable, and building a new hospital in Va'vau.</p>
        
            <p>AUT senior lecturer Sione Tekiteki told RNZ Pacific that Hu'akavameiliku "has been through a lot" and "we just have to respect his decision".</p>
        
            <p>"I think we just need to be mindful that he has been through a lot, both physically [and] mentally, but also the stress of having a country to lead, as well as all the international and domestic priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in that context, you just have to respect the decision he's taken, and obviously wasn't easy."</p>
        
            <p>He said Hu'akavameiliku would have "weighed up all of the the stresses", including the planned no confidence vote before deciding to step down.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably good that it's come from him and he's done it in his own terms."</p>
