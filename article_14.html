            <p>Denmark has recalled several spicy ramen noodle products by South Korean company Samyang, claiming the capsaicin levels in them could poison consumers.</p>
        
            <p>Three fiery flavours of the Samyang instant ramen line are being withdrawn: Buldak 3x Spicy & Hot Chicken, 2x Spicy & Hot Chicken and Hot Chicken Stew.</p>
        
            <p>Denmark's food agency issued the recall and warning on Tuesday, urging consumers to abandon the product.</p>
        
            <p>It is unknown if any specific incidents have prompted the Danish authorities into taking action.</p>
        
            <p>The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said it had assessed the levels of capsaicin in a single packet to be "so high that they pose a risk of the consumer developing acute poisoning".</p>
        
            <p>"If you have the products, you should discard them or return them to the store where they were purchased," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>It also emphasised the warning for children, for whom extremely spicy food can cause harm.</p>
        
            <p>The notice has sparked heated discussion online with many amused reactions from lovers of spicy food. Many have made assertions about the Danes' low tolerance for spice.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a friend from Denmark who thought tasteless breaded shrimp with a little bit of ground pepper on it was too spicy. Not surprised they think this ramen is poison," read one top-liked comment on a Reddit ramen forum.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear if the noodles have been recalled before in any other country. There appear not to be any other safety warnings issued globally.</p>
        
            <p>Capsaicin is the chemical compound in chilli peppers which creates the burning feeling.</p>
        
            <p>When humans eat peppers, the capsaicin is released into saliva and binds on to receptors in the mouth.</p>
        
            <p>Samyang is a major South Korean food manufacturer which brands itself as the first company in the country to create instant noodles, back in the 1960s.</p>
