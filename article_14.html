            <p>A tsunami warning has been lifted following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>The shallow quake hit 79 kilometres southeast of the village of Pangai, with warnings also extending to the island nation of Niue, the US Geological Survey said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1 meters above the tide level are possible for some coasts of Niue... and Tonga," The US tsunami warning system earlier said.</p>
        
            <p>It had warned that "hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within 300 kilometres of the epicentre along the coasts of Tonga".</p>
        
            <p>The Tonga national disaster agency issued a warning to residents to stay away from beaches and shorelines.</p>
        
            <p>"People living on the low lying coast areas please move to higher grounds or further in land," the Tonga National Disaster Risk Management Office wrote on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>A Kiwi living in Veitongo, Ben Maloney, said he woke up to his bed shaking.</p>
        
            <p>"The windows were all rattling and the whole house was shaking quite bad," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Earthquakes are common in Tonga, a low-lying archipelago home to around 100,000 people that straddles the seismic Ring of Fire.</p>
        
            <p>The Ring of Fire is an arc of intense tectonic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.</p>
