            <p>Warning: this story mentions suicide</p>
        
            <p>This month, the government will deliver on a campaign promise by launching a pilot 'young offender military academy' - a boot camp - despite a raft of evidence that "scare them straight" programmes are unsuccessful. </p>
        
            <p>Minister for Children Karen Chhour says that this scheme will include continued wrap-around service when teens leave the residential section of the programme, including consistent support with mentors in their community. In the pilot, teens will spend the first three months in residence, and a further nine meeting regularly with their mentor.</p>
        
            <p>In today's episode of The Detail, RNZ's Phil Pennington says success may depend on resources. </p>
        
            <p>"It is a very big task, and resource-intensive.</p>
        
            <p>"[Karen Chhour's] emphasis has been on the transition period that is hugely important, and if that doesn't work the whole thing won't work."</p>
        
            <p>This is where similar programmes have failed in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"The transition has been neglected and therefore these kids have gone on to re-offend. They're trying to get around that, but that's going to take a lot of resources." </p>

            <p>Oranga Tamariki will lead the programme, though other agencies including Police and New Zealand Defence Force have been involved. Oranga Tamariki has just cut more than 400 jobs. </p>
        
            <p>The pilot will involve up to 10 young offenders between the ages of 14 and 17. </p>
        
            <p>A briefing on these military academies from Oranga Tamariki to the minister, released under the Official Information Act, has given some insight into their profile.</p>
        
            <p>"It is pretty grim," says Pennington. </p>
        
            <p>The briefing says that "while the cohort of young people with serious or persistent offending is relatively small, they have the highest needs and the poorest outcomes." </p>
        
            <p>It goes on to say that 80 percent have "a confirmed or suspected mental health or disability related diagnosis," 20 percent have "attempted to end their life", 90 percent have "significant learning difficulties", and more than 50 percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls have "been physically harmed more than three times in the past year." </p>
        
            <p>In the podcast, Pennington says the research "pretty much says hard boot camps don't work, soft boot camps can work".</p>
        
            <p>"International research is showing that boot camps are one of the least effective interventions when it comes to reducing offending amongst young people.</p>
        
            <p>"Evaluation of previous military academies in New Zealand found it was expensive, had a bit of positive impact, but overall produced no better results in terms of re-offending than simply if that child was in the youth justice residence anyway."</p>
        
            <p>One of those previous academies was an NZDF programme called the Limited Service Volunteer programme, which the government has referred to as a blueprint for this academy.</p>
        
            <p>Another document recently released under OIA shows that this programme was riddled with problems, including staffers suffering "serious mental harm" and several having suicidal thoughts. The success rates were also poor by the time the programme ended. </p>

            <p>"That is embarrassing for Mark Mitchell and the government," Pennington says. </p>
        
            <p>"This scheme was not properly run. It was the one they wanted to refer back to, to say it worked there, it's going to work now.  </p>
        
            <p>"Why were they saying that, when they knew it had gone off the rails last year?" </p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki sent The Detail the following comment, attributed to Tusha Penny, the deputy chief executive of residences and homes.  </p>
        
            <p>"The design and development of the Military Style Academy pilot is progressing well...</p>
        
            <p>"Using an evidenced based approach, we believe Military Style Academies could be game changing for those youth that need more intensive support to turn their lives around."</p>
        
            <p>The finer detail of that design is yet to be revealed. </p>
        
            <p>"I think the real question is around just how much tension there is between boot camp, crack-down military-style activities, going on about Defence having a prime role in this, versus what they know is needed in terms of rehabilitation, taking a great deal of care within a structured framework to look after these children," Pennington says.</p>
        
            <p>"The research in front of them is really, really clear that if you put them in a pressured or punishment-style situation that that is not going to work well."</p>
