            <p>The Pasifika Festival concluded its second and final day today at Western Springs Park in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, attracting large crowds to celebrate the vibrant culture of the Pacific Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The annual event features a mix of cultural performances, workshops, music and kai, celebrating the traditions of 11 island nations. With eight stages across four zones, the festival unites a dynamic crowd of festivalgoers, performers and stallholders for Pasifika celebration.</p>
        
            <p>Attendees shared their thoughts on the importance of the event itself, the significance of their attire, and the Pacific cuisine, which was at the forefront of the attendee experience.</p>

            <p>A Cook Islands ukulele group, performing on the Aotearoa stage for the first time, expressed that attending the Pasifika Festival is a must.</p>
        
            <p>"We are Pasifika, so I try to come every year," said 'Papa O'. "Being able to sit on stage, play the ukulele, and sing...it's a beautiful experience."</p>
        
            <p>For many, the Pasifika Festival is a chance to unapologetically celebrate and share Pacific culture, uniting diverse Pacific communities.</p>
        
            <p>Festival attendee Stephen said that he had recently arrived from the UK to travel New Zealand, but met a Kiwi family the day before who "insisted" he go to the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"I met these lovely people the day prior, and they said, while I'm here I have to go see the culture - take me out to the city centre and see, enjoy, learn about different cultures. It's great."</p>
        
            <p>Jep Savali, Festival Director and Group Manager for Tātaki Auckland Unlimited, said that while not all Pacific countries are involved, it is a goal to work towards in the future.</p>
        
            <p>He added that the festival "is seeing improvement year on year," and is critical in providing avenues for both economic growth and employment opportunities within the community.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party Leader Chris Hipkins was in attendance, and earlier added that it is important for political leaders to show up to these events.</p>
        
            <p>"I think political leaders have have got a really important job in bringing the community together. That means celebrating our differences."</p>
        
            <p>Tuvalu performer Gina shared that her cultural attire was handcrafted by the women in her village.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here for Tuvalu, hosting the shared Tuvaluan stage. What I'm wearing was made by all the ladies in our village for us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In many Pacific Island cultures, communities come together to create cultural attire, with vibrant textiles and weaving techniques reflecting deep traditions. Gina explained that her titi (skirt) is specifically worn on-stage when she performs.</p>

            <p>Food was another highlight, with a range of Pacific dishes like panikeke (pancakes), sapasui (chop suey), 'ota 'ika (raw fish), hāngi, and barbecue.</p>
        
            <p>Samoan stallholder Abby, from True Island Delights, said their goal is to always bring high-quality island food to the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about the quantity of what we are making, but it's about the quality. That's what we value most in our food," she said.</p>

            <p>RNZ festival reporter Janay Harding sampled the 'ota 'ika and declared it "Tino reka!" (fantastic): "Fresh snapper, coconut, spring onions... amazing!"</p>
        
            <p>Johnny, another festival-goer, shared that his top picks were the pork ribs and cassava.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here for the barbecue, and for my family," he said. "It's a bit smaller this year, but I'm here with my nieces, it's their first time and they're enjoying the event."</p>
        
            <p>As the 33rd year of Pasifika Festival concludes, Savali added that the turnaround will see preparations for Pasifika Festival 2026 underway soon.</p>
