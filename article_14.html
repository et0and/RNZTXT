            <p>Multiple fake profiles impersonating the late Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins and fake livestream links have appeared on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>One page has more than 100 friends and advertises a hoax livestream link to his funeral using pictures of Fa'anānā and his family.</p>
        
            <p>The 49-year-old MP collapsed and died after taking part in a charity event in Auckland on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Tipene Funerals said it was aware of a number of fake Facebook pages but none were connected with the company.</p>
        
            <p>Tipene Funerals said authentic communications to the wider community about the funeral would come from its Facebook page or from the news media.</p>

            <p>Tipene Funerals spokesperson Taito Eddie Tuvalii said while it welcomed community Facebook pages set up to express grief, any with false livestream links or impersonating Fa'nanānā should not be trusted.</p>
        
            <p>"None of those pages are linked to us and ... we believe those pages are all scams under the advice of [company director] Francis Tipene.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no knowledge of them and have no idea who those people might be.</p>
        
            <p>"Efeso was somebody that connected with people from all over Tamaki and all over Aotearoa - we welcome that.</p>
        
            <p>"To the best of my knowledge, and from what I've seen, all of these pages with livestream details are not genuine or authentic pages."</p>
        
            <p>Tipene Funerals would provide livestream details on its Facebook page closer to the memorial on Thursday.</p>
