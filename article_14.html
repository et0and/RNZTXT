            <p>Would you trade food deliveries and a reliable internet connection for rolling hills, chicken coops and a big vege garden?</p>
        
            <p>A growing number of Kiwis are making the switch to the homesteading lifestyle - foregoing the conveniences of modern life with the aim to grow as much of their own food as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Some go into it for health and lifestyle reasons, while others say they want to be as self reliant as possible in uncertain economic times.</p>
        
            <p>On Luke and Deborah Halford's 10-acre homestead near Maungatapere there are flocks of animals, endless jars of preserved veges, and lots of kids - six to be exact.</p>
        
            <p>Deborah Halford said wanting a healthy life for them was a big part of the decision to start their homestead, about 20km from Whangarei.</p>
        
            <p>"Them knowing how to grow their own food, and where it comes from and all the health benefits - that is super important and I think a lot of kids don't necessarily grow up with that these days."</p>
        
            <p>The couple said the Covid-19 pandemic had cemented the importance of being able to grow nearly everything they needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone else was sort of stressing out in their little townhouses and we were kind of living in luxury on our one month holiday kind of thing," Luke said.</p>

            <p>"We came through it, a month no problem. There wasn't the stress of, 'What if we can't find it in the supermarket?' Because we pretty much had everything we needed," Deborah added.</p>
        
            <p>During that time, the kids got a different kind of education, Deborah said.</p>
        
            <p>"When our kids went back to school after the lockdown, they were asked what we had taught them in the meantime. Basically I told them we showed them how to raise and butcher chickens."</p>
        
            <p>The kids were now home-schooled, except for the eldest who was trialling high school.</p>
        
            <p>Pia Whittwer lives on a much smaller 1 acre homestead just out of Warkworth.</p>
        
            <p>During her career as a health professional, she saw how unhealthy modern life could be for some people.</p>

            <p>"That all links in, to a large extent, with the removal from being out in the open air, moving your body and being in nature. The city lifestyle seems to come with a lot more pressure and stress."</p>
        
            <p>Part of her homestead was a food forest, focused on plants that were self sustainable.</p>
        
            <p>"They should be growing themselves and they should establish a sort of network of plants that doesn't need looking after."</p>
        
            <p>Rebecca Stewart started the Homesteading New Zealand Facebook page, which had more than 65,000 members.</p>
        
            <p>More and more people were trying the self sufficient lifestyle, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been around for a very long time, there's just more people, I guess going back to this lifestyle with the current economic climate."</p>
        
            <p>Suddenly trying to produce all your own food could be a big step, Stewart said, and people who were interested should try to learn as much as they could about about growing food before giving it a go.</p>
