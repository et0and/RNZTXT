        <h2>Swipe card found in Antarctica 13 years after being lost in Wellington</h2>
        <p>
The card ended up under two metres of ice, at the bottom of the ocean, 4000 kilometres away.

            <p>You've heard of finding a needle in a haystack, but what about finding a swipe card in the vast expanse of the world's oceans?</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert senior music producer David McCaw is as baffled as he is elated to be reunited with his long-lost security card, 21 years after losing it.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just absolutely flabbergasted, just floored. It was so unexpected and so bizarre that I've never quite got my head around it."</p>
        
            <p>He picked it up from NIWA's headquarters in Wellington two weeks ago, and one way or another, it has clocked thousands of kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>The story starts in 2003, when David McCaw lost the card which gave him access to the Wellington Town Hall and Michael Fowler Centre after his car was broken into.</p>
        
            <p>"My briefcase was sitting in the passenger [foot]well of the car...so obviously someone saw it and broke the window and took the briefcase," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A few days later the police returned the briefcase where the swipe card had been stored, but it was empty and sopping wet.</p>

            <p>"I got a call about three days later saying, 'we've got your briefcase, come and get it.' They said someone had handed it in. They said someone had recovered it from the harbour, I don't know exactly where, and it had seawater and the remaining documents were soggy."</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward to 2016, and about 20 kilometres north of Scott Base, in Antarctica, NIWA diver Rod Budd was working with researchers on the sea floor at Cape Evans.</p>
        
            <p>"I was diving with a colleague of mine, and we were laying out some transects, which are basically just measuring tapes. I saw what I thought was a credit card, but it was a little too dark to tell so I just picked it up and put it in my pocket. It was unusual because you don't usually see rubbish and things down there," he said.</p>

            <p>Rod Budd has made 150 dives at Cape Evans, and he has only come across a handful of items that do not belong there.</p>
        
            <p>He said it took a clean of the card to notice it was worth keeping.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't till I got back to the surface, and I cleaned it up and I could see that it was a Radio New Zealand security card. I could quite clearly see David's name printed on it. I showed it to the rest of the team, and we thought we should send it back to him sometime."</p>
        
            <p>On their return to New Zealand, the team never got around to tracking down McCaw, so the swipe card sat in a box for eight years.</p>
        
            <p>Last year when NIWA did finally find him, they were shocked to discover he had never travelled to Antarctica.</p>
        
            <p>So how did the card end up under two metres of ice, at the bottom of the ocean, on the coast of Antarctica, 4,000 kilometres away from where it was lost?</p>
        
            <p>Hitching a ride with ocean currents sounds like a logical explanation, but NIWA principal scientist Craig Stevens said the chances of that were "infinitesimally small".</p>
        
            <p>He has mapped out the card's potential journey after sinking below the canyons off Wellington's harbour.</p>
        
            <p>After entering the Western Boundary Current, the card would pass Samoa and head towards the North Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"And then, if by some miracle you start to be less 'sinky,' you work your way to the surface through wind mixing and some other stuff," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Then the card would be flushed through Indonesia, crossing the world's largest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, before reaching Cape Evans.</p>

            <p>"The time scale for that is about a thousand years."</p>
        
            <p>Craig Stevens said it was more likely the card somehow became attached to something buoyant, and stayed at the surface where currents are much quicker and less predictable - but even then, it would have to travel round the globe multiple times before landing in the Antarctic.</p>
        
            <p>"Strange things do happen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are forms of biology that can crust on something and then become bouyant."</p>
        
            <p>But he said that was still an ambitious guess for the 13 year timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>"That's sort of short for traveling across the planet in the ocean... if it had been blown South, I bet it would've gone around the world a few times before it actually ended up in this 30 metre radius spot beneath an observation hole in Antarctica."</p>

            <p>Those odds lend themselves to the other main possibility that the card came with a visitor, be it a human or otherwise, to the dive hole or nearby sites.</p>
        
            <p>The mystery remains unsolved, but David McCaw says a concrete explanation would be music to his ears.</p>
        
            <p>"I would dearly love to know. It would be very satisfying to close the circle on this."</p>
