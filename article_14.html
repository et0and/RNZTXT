            <p>The whānau of a young Kiwi woman who went missing while on holiday in Bali say she has been found by tourists, after having not heard from her in days.</p>
        
            <p>Kaya Awhitu, a young woman from Papamoa in the Bay of Plenty, travelled with her partner to the Indonesian holiday destination last Thursday, but her family said on Wednesday they had not had any contact with her since Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Concerned whānau took to social media, describing Awhitu's disappearance as "out of the ordinary."</p>
        
            <p>"We know there's activity on her Messenger, but we feel that isn't her. She might just be having some downtime, but this is still unusual. Kaya, please just let us know you're okay, mama," a family member wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Awhitu was reportedly last seen at the Udara Hideaway Villa in Nusa Penida, an island accessible only by a 30-minute boat ride.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau said they instantly became worried when Awhitu failed to meet up with her partner when travelling to their next destination.</p>
        
            <p>But later on Wednesday, a Facebook post said she had been found.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to everyone for helping us find our girl," it read.</p>
        
            <p>"Toursist found her and she was able to make contact with us. She is safe with someone we trust ... We are bringing her home as we speak."</p>
        
            <p>In an earlier statement to RNZ, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: "The New Zealand Embassy in Jakarta is providing assistance to the whānau of a New Zealander reported missing in Bali. For privacy reasons, no further information will be provided."</p>
