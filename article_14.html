        <h2>'Significant' wave of Covid likely to hit NZ this winter</h2>
        <p>
The FLiRT subvariant is driving a big jump in cases, just as flu season begins.

            <p>Aotearoa is likely to see a "significant" wave of Covid-19 as we head into winter, a virus modeller says.</p>
        
            <p>A new subvariant of Covid-19, called FLiRT, has begun circulating around the motu.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Michael Plank, from the University of Canterbury, said it looked as if FLiRT - sometimes referred to as FLip - was driving Covid numbers up internationally and there were signs that was starting to happen in Aotearoa as well.</p>
        
            <p>There had been a "rapid increase" in Covid hospitalisations in the past couple of weeks, with about 240 people in hospital with the virus, up from 120 a couple of weeks ago, he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"It has risen quite quickly which does suggest that we are heading into a significant wave."</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, there had been "quite a big jump" in the levels of Covid being picked up in wastewater testing, Plank said.</p>
        
            <p>There were 6146 new cases of Covid reported in the past week - almost double the 3922 cases reported the week before.</p>
        
            <p>FLiRT was closely related to the JN.1 subvariant, which caused the wave that hit New Zealand over Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>There was no indication the subvariants caused more severe illness or different symptoms, but they appeared to be more transmissible than earlier forms of the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Plank said it was "bad timing" as Aotearoa headed into flu season, with the wave likely to peak in June or July.</p>
        
            <p>"The timing is a bit concerning in the sense that hospitals have always been busy at this time of year and we're now adding Covid into the mix," he said.</p>

            <p>"That could put quite significant pressure on our healthcare system."</p>
        
            <p>The good news was that vaccines were still likely to be "really effective" against the new subvariants, Plank said.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged everyone to stay up to date with their vaccinations, including getting a flu jab and a Covid booster if eligible.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone over 30 could get a free booster if they had not had a jab or the virus in the past six months, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting a booster in time for winter is a really good idea to reduce the likelihood of getting really sick with Covid over the coming winter."</p>
