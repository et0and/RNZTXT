            <p>The iconic wharenui at Te Tii Marae has reopened after completing stage one of its restoration.</p>
        
            <p>A dawn ceremony was hosted by mana whenua Ngāti Rāhiri and Ngāti Kawa who welcomed iwi leaders, politicians and the masses - at least 300 people.</p>
        
            <p>The upgrades include a paved courtyard, new carvings adorning the front of the house, and much-needed earthquake strengthening.</p>

            <p>Speaking to RNZ, Marae Pou Tīkanga Isaiah Apiata said over the past three years the age of the 101-year-old wharenui - named Te Tiriti o Waitangi 1840 - had begun to reveal itself.</p>
        
            <p>"[It had] cracks in the walls… reports indicated that the material that was used 101 years ago wasn't the standard of our health and safety regulations today."</p>
        
            <p>"We've placed metal beaming around the interior of the meeting house to ensure that it is earthquake-proof. We hope that it will continue to remain for the next 101 years."</p>
        
            <p>Te Tii Waitangi marae is situated just north of Paihia, next to the Waitangi River. The century-old wharenui replaced the original one built in 1881.</p>
        
            <p>The land nearby is where He Wakaputanga was signed in 1835 and five years later, chiefs debated on the same spot whether to sign Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>

            <p>During the ceremony, representatives from Taranaki presented mana whenua with a taonga symbolising the connection between Ngāti Rāhiri in Waitangi, and Ngāti Rāhiri ō Te Atiawa.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki iwi leader Wharehoka Wano told RNZ said Isaiah Apiata and Ngāpuhi elder Hone Saddler went South last year to visit and flesh out their shared whakapapa.</p>
        
            <p>"It was also the opening of Ngāti Rāhiri ō Te Atiawa tari and tohu, of Ngāti Rāhiri, was on display that morning. We brought the tohu back and also a bottle of wai (water) from our maunga and a poi."</p>
        
            <p>Wano said he hoped the focus of the marae would now be on educating future generations.</p>
        
            <p>"It is just refreshing the kōrero for the next generation. We heard a lot of references today to the future. We're talking about kōtahitanga in its various forms and what that looks like, but how does it for the new generation?"</p>

            <p>Far North councillor Penetaui Klescovic was in attendance and spoke with the haukainga.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ that now the marae has completed the first stage of renovations, conversations around bringing the politicians back should begin.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2016, there was a hui held here to address some of the issues that were taking place at that time. The solution from that hui was to move the Waitangi celebrations from this marae to the upper house."</p>
        
            <p>"Now the refurbishment of this whare is finished we need to consider, seriously, whether or not we move the celebrations back to the lower house where it should take place."</p>
        
            <p>The burden of hosting the nation should not fall on just Ngāti Rāhiri and Ngāti Kawa, but all of Ngāpuhi.</p>
        
            <p>"On that basis, people will want to pitch in and if they can see the value and what you're trying to achieve then they are more likely to get in and support," he said.</p>

            <p>Speaking toward the end of the ceremony, marae chair Ngāti Kawa Taituha said there was still work to be done at the marae.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a bit more development to go… our whare kai is going to be next and then our kōhanga."</p>
        
            <p>"We want a combination of an education hub and a media hub."</p>
        
            <p>He said he wanted the renovations to be complete by 2035, the 200-year anniversary since He Whakaputanga was signed.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of work to do to serve our people and lift the health and wellbeing of all our whānau," he said.</p>
