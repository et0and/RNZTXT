            <p>Marine police say a missing Sydney fisherman was not attacked by a shark but dragged into the water by it after he became entangled in fishing gear.</p>
        
            <p>A multi-agency air and sea search will continue on Tuesday for the man, identified by New South Wales Game Fishing Association as Paul Barning.</p>

            <p>The life member of the Port Hacking Game Fishing Club was taking part in a tournament about 55 kilometres off the coast of Port Stephens when it is believed he became caught in fishing line and fell overboard.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers aboard a recreational fishing vessel reported seeing a person being dragged into the water by a shark.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Ambulance confirmed Marine Rescue received a radio call that someone had fallen overboard and that a shark was involved.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday afternoon, Superintendent Joe McNulty from New South Wales Police Marine Area Command confirmed a shark had been reeled in, but it did not attack.</p>
        
            <p>"The fishing boat at the time was retrieving a mako shark and we believe during that manoeuvre the man has become entangled in the fishing gear and has been forced over the side," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mako sharks can reach four metres in length.</p>
        
            <p>"At no time did that man resurface," Superintendent McNulty said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidence to say that shark has attacked the person in the water."</p>

            <p>The NSW Game Fishing Association on Monday said Barning was "tragically lost at sea in the most unlikely circumstances".</p>
        
            <p>NSW Game Fishing president Steve Lamond described the incident as a "something that you are not likely to ever see again".</p>

            <p>"Definitely no shark attack, as such, involved," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was absolutely just a freak tragedy that has occurred during an attempt to capture a fish.</p>
        
            <p>"It's never happened before in Australia to my knowledge."</p>

            <p>Game fishing is a type of offshore sport fishing that involves catching large fish known for their size and fighting ability, such as marlin, sharks and tuna.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened in the same area where anglers reported three great white sharks circling their boat during a competition held last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent McNulty said Barning was not wearing a life jacket.</p>
        
            <p>The search for Barning will be expanded to waters south of Port Kembla on Tuesday.</p>
