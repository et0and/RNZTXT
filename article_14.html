            <p>Some first year University of Canterbury (UC) students are so famished they are resorting to purchasing takeaways after meals, despite paying annual residence hall fees of about $20,000.</p>
        
            <p>Students at the Christchurch campus have told of weight loss and cutting into their weekly budgets for food, due to the modest size of meals at a neighbouring hall-of-residence.</p>
        
            <p>The grumbles have prompted staff at the nearby University Hall to trial a self-service buffet system, beginning this week. It is an approach which hungry students spoken to by RNZ were eager to see become permanent.</p>
        
            <p>First year student Ollie Dooley said he had enjoyed his first few months of university life. But he admitted the size of the meals at University Hall had been a drawback.</p>
        
            <p>"All the guys agree that [the meals] aren't big enough," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's not enough food and the meals aren't big enough to be honest. At dinner I reckon I could eat at least two of the dinners we're getting."</p>
        
            <p>On rare occasions, hall servers would offer second helpings to students but only when they were "feeling generous", he said.</p>
        
            <p>With sport commitments cutting into meal times, Dooley said he and his friends were regularly spending money on food.</p>
        
            <p>"You're just coping by living off the vending machine and two minute noodles at nine o'clock at night sort of thing."</p>

            <p>Fellow first year student Jack Blyth felt the same way.</p>
        
            <p>"[The meals] can be pretty small at times, sometimes dinner is pretty small," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially after sports training."</p>
        
            <p>Blyth said the self-service trial appeared to be working well and that he was "very keen" to see it become permanent.</p>
        
            <p>Ollie Young said he could eat up to three servings of the average dinner at the hall.</p>
        
            <p>"The food portion sizes haven't been the best, kind of leaves you hungry after every meal. Breakfast is okay but lunch and dinner you can only get small servings."</p>
        
            <p>Young said he was coping by regularly visiting Dominos.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm probably spending an extra 50 bucks a week on food. I've lost five kilograms since I've been here."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow first year student Izzy Nigro said it was mainly the male students who were being left hungry following meals.</p>
        
            <p>"For girls it's not as bad because we don't need as much of a bigger portion size I find, for myself at least. I don't mind it as much but I know it leaves the boys hungry."</p>
        
            <p>Third year student Sophie Kennedy stayed at University Hall during her first year and she remembered the hall catering well for students.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty good, I was vegetarian," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The meal portion sizes were quite good we could go back for seconds. I've heard they've cut a lot of that."</p>
        
            <p>UC's executive director of people, culture and campus Paul O'Flaherty said about 2700 students opted to live in the halls.</p>
        
            <p>"Many have different needs.</p>
        
            <p>"Some hall residents, who may have higher energy needs, will make extra sandwiches and take fruit at lunch or breakfast that they can eat outside of mealtimes."</p>
        
            <p>He said self-service had always been part of University Hall, "aside from the main protein portion of the meal".</p>
        
            <p>"Students can get more protein at the hall's self-serve salad bar."</p>
        
            <p>University Hall was now trialling "complete self-service" in response to student feedback.</p>
        
            <p>"Feedback from student residents is regularly used to make changes in each of UC's independently managed halls," O'Flaherty said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hall staff are available daily to discuss any concerns and answer residents' questions."</p>
        
            <p>The University of Canterbury's Student Association said no one was available for comment.</p>
