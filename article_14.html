            <p>A little bit of sibling rivalry can be a healthy thing, as brothers Archie and Callum Woodhouse recently proved.</p>
        
            <p>The two recently came up against each other at the East Coast FMG Young Farmer competition held at the Solway Showgrounds in Masterton, where they took out the top two places.</p>
        
            <p>The brothers grew up on their family's sheep and beef farm near Eketāhuna, with both going down the rural route and studying at Lincoln University.</p>
        
            <p>Callum, 24, recently moved to Waikato where he is now working as a product specialist for Halter Ltd, which sells solar-powered smart cow collars to help farmers to remotely shift stock, monitor stock and create virtual fencelines. Archie, 22, has returned to the family farm after finishing his studies.</p>
        
            <p>Representing the South Wairarapa Young Farmers Club, both brothers took part in the competition which challenges young farmers on a range of essential skills. From fencing to bookwork, the two found their experience and areas of expertise differed.</p>

            <p>Fresh from four years of uni, Archie enjoyed the bookwork component especially, though he said it was also good to put his practical skills to use in fencing, which is "part of day-to-day farming". However, he found himself less experienced when it came to the horse module.</p>
        
            <p>"It was nice to be challenged," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Callum meanwhile enjoyed the farm work, but was a fish out of water when it came to the fisheries module.</p>
        
            <p>Both said it was good to test their skills against young farmers from other clubs and learn from them.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a great calibre of people involve in this year's competition," Archie said.</p>
        
            <p>It was he who ultimately came out on top, with Callum coming in second.</p>

            <p>Archie said it was nice to have some "familiar competition", describing his brother as being switched on both academically and practically.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cool to get a win there. It was a bit intimidating knowing he was breathing down my neck," Archie said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good knowing we were both here and both having a crack."</p>
        
            <p>Callum agreed competing against his brother provided some "healthy competition" and said he couldn't have been happier his brother beat him. He has even offered to help Archie with his revision for the upcoming national competition.</p>
        
            <p>Archie planned to spent the next three months studying and preparing ahead of the grand final of the FMG Young Farmer of the Year competition, to be held in Hamilton in July.</p>
