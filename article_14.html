            <p>A strong 5.3 earthquake has rocked the lower North Island, centred 10 kilometres east of Eketāhuna in the Tararua district.</p>
        
            <p>Geonet says it struck at 11.26pm on Tuesday and was 35 kilometres deep.</p>
        
            <p>Within half an hour more than 23,000 people had provided reports of experiencing it to Geonet.</p>
        
            <p>While most were in the central and lower North Island, it was felt as far away as the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>People from Eketāhuna, Masterton and Dannevirke posting on social media described a scary experience.</p>
        
            <p>"Man that was scary as hell," wrote one poster on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"Dogs freaked out and stuff all over my kitchen floor," wrote another.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard the bugger coming, then there was one big jolt which made the entire house shake and creak," a Masterton resident wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Really strong up Rangitumau, stuff fell in our living room but nothing broken," wrote another from the Masterton area.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident in the town posted on Facebook that items fell in their living room while another person felt the quake in Hāwera.</p>
        
            <p>"Loud earthquake! Heard that coming for what seemed like ages, then it roared! Never heard such a loud one before. Then it lightly rolled for about a minute! Not really jolty," another Facebook user based on the west coast of the North Island reported.</p>
        
            <p>Tararua District mayor Tracey Collis said the quake was widely felt across the region.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very, very long and very, very strong so immediately you knew that it was either centred close or a significant one for New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>No damage was reported to infrastructure but the emergency management team would be checking again on Wednesday morning, she said.</p>
