            <p>A supermoon graced the skies of New Zealand overnight as some Asian communities celebrated their lunar festivities.</p>
        
            <p>But those in the Northern Hemisphere are set to witness a combination of a 'Harvest Moon', supermoon and a partial eclipse.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Harvest Moon' is a full moon that occurs closest to the start of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. It results in a few nights of early moonlight in the evenings, which farmers have traditionally used to harvest their summer crops.</p>
        
            <p>People in the Europe, USA, Africa, and parts of Asia will see the partial eclipse, but it won't be visible in Aotearoa because it will be daytime for us (about 2.44pm).</p>
        
            <p>However, New Zealanders in cities with clear skies would have noticed the somewhat larger moon last night, Stardome astronomer Josh Aoraki said.</p>
        
            <p>A supermoon would have been "slightly larger, slightly brighter in the sky, and just a bit more spectacular than a regular full moon".</p>
        
            <p>"A supermoon is simply just when the moon is slightly closer to us, that's 'cause the moon's orbit is elliptical.</p>
        
            <p>"As for the name Harvest Moon, these names usually don't apply to the Southern Hemisphere."</p>

            <p>Chinese and Vietnamese communities celebrate the Harvest Moon during the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival or Reunion Festival.</p>
        
            <p>It is called the Reunion Festival because families and loved ones gather to witness a larger than usual sighting of the moon as the clear air arrives with the change of seasons in northern parts of Asia.</p>
        
            <p>The festival was initially celebrated by the heads of ancient Chinese dynasties, who would celebrate the bountiful autumn harvest with their subjects. Over time, however, the general population started to celebrate the occasion, enshrining it as an important annual cultural event.</p>
        
            <p>The celebration is traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. The holiday falls on 17 September this year.</p>
        
            <p>Kerala's community [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/indonz/527824/auckland-s-kerala-community-celebrates-onam-with-traditional-feast</p>
        
            <p>recently celebrated the beginning of the harvest season with Onam] - an annual 10-day Hindu cultural festival, which usually falls between August and September. It was traditionally celebrated for the homecoming of a mythical daitya king to Kerala from the netherworld.</p>
        
            <p>Two lunar eclipses will be visible in New Zealand in March and September next year as well as a partial solar eclipse in September next year.</p>
