            <p>A Tongan story has made it to Sundance - one of the biggest film festivals in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Two Tongan-New Zealand filmmakers are behind the short film Lea Tupu'anga Mother Tongue, helping people to grapple with cultural identity and language trauma, as the story explores a young woman's journey to reconnect with her Tongan heritage.</p>
        
            <p>The film was selected out of 17,000 applications for Sundance, which boasts of launching the careers of some of the greatest directors in the world, such as Christopher Nolan.</p>
        
            <p>Lea Tupu'anga Mother Tongue premiered on Monday (NZT) at Sundance Film Festival in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought let's just give it a gamble and we struck it lucky," director Vea Mafile'o said, explaining it was the first film festival they applied for.</p>
        
            <p>"Language is the theme of the entire short...it is a symbol," writer and actor Luciane Buchanan said.</p>
        
            <p>Buchanan is best known for her lead role in the Netflix hit show, Night Agent.</p>

            <p>Although the Tongan language was being heard on the big screen, Buchanan said the story was accessible to a wider audience as it explores "who we are without language".</p>
        
            <p>Both Mafile'o and Buchanan have experienced not being able to speak the Tongan language, which was the driving force behind telling the story.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very cathartic for me writing it. I have kind of gotten to the space of acceptance where this is a life long journey. It is not going to be fixed in a year," Buchanan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is on their own journey whether it is Te Reo or Tongan. There are so many factors as to why we do not have those language skills."</p>
        
            <p>Language is universal and something many of the film's audience had already resonated with, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"This film transcends cultures. A Black American man came up to me crying and resonated with it. An Iranian man was crying and told me this is my story. This is a global dilemma," Mafile'o said.</p>

            <p>Pacific films are scarce, especially in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>There was only one other Pacific film at Sundance, and it is Hawaiian.</p>
        
            <p>"We are the minority of the minority over here in America," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific islanders are under the same category as Asian. So essentially that is the same basket we are lumped into. It is definitely a voice that is rare in this space."</p>
        
            <p>Mafile'o said she wanted more Pasifika to join the film industry.</p>
        
            <p>"I am super excited about how this film can potentially highlight this is a space where Pacific belong."</p>
        
            <p>She explained, "it is not just actor director."</p>
        
            <p>There are other roles within the film industry such as editor, camera person, set builder and coffee maker, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are so many jobs [in film] that I think our people haven't realised yet."</p>
        
            <p>The pair hope to bring the film to the New Zealand International Film Festival.</p>
