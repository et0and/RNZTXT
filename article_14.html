            <p>The tropical depression east of Solomon Islands intensified into a tropical cyclone early Tuesday morning local time, the Fiji Meteorological Service says.</p>
        
            <p>The Fiji Meteorological Service said tropical cyclone Mal is a category one system.</p>
        
            <p>Schools in Fiji are closed on Tuesday, and Wednesday local time, and all public servants have been instructed to work from home.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji's Metservice said at 3am local time, Mal was positioned about 450km West of Rotuma - Fiji's northern most island - and about 720km north west of Nadi.</p>
        
            <p>It's moving south, south eastward at about 28kmph.</p>
        
            <p>Forecaster Samisoni Waqavakatoga said on it's current track, the eye of the cyclone will get closest to Fiji at 3am Wednesday morning and be 170km west of Nadi.</p>
        
            <p>"It is still a category one but there are high chances the environment is favourable for Mal to intensify further into a category two system within the next 6 to 12 hours before heading into Fiji waters," Waqavakatoga said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's expected to reach a high end of category two [cyclone] while it makes its south eastward movement west of the Fiji group in the next 24 to 48 hours."</p>
        
            <p>Waqavakatoga said there was a possibility it could reach category three status, with average wind speeds between 119kmph to 157kmph.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, local time, the Fiji National Disaster Management Office reported several bridges and crossings were inaccessible.</p>
        
            <p>The office called on the public to stay away and avoid crossing flooded roads, rivers, bridges, crossings, or walkways.</p>
        
            <p>The Fiji Roads Authority had warned that the "heavy rain can lead to fallen trees, obstructing roads and footpaths" and is calling on people to "please stay vigilant".</p>
        
            <p>Fiji's Agriculture Ministry is advising farmers in flood-prone areas to relocate to higher ground following the tropical cyclone warning.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji weather office said a storm alert is in place for the Yasawa and Mamanuca Group, western, northern, and southern Viti Levu, Vatulele, Kadavu, and nearby smaller islands.</p>
        
            <p>Rotuma, the western half of Vanua Levu (Dreketi, Bua to Savusavu), eastern Viti Levu, and Lomaiviti Group are under a gale alert.</p>
        
            <p>Farmers within the identified areas are advised to take precautionary measures to mitigate potential damage to crops and livestock.</p>
