            <p>The 'Wimbledon' of shearing is officially underway, with the Golden Shears competition beginning in Masterton on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>About 500 shearers and wool-handlers taking part in the three-day event - an increase of 25 percent on the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>The increased number of entries is due to a higher number of overseas shearers working in New Zealand this summer, with crews from Australia, Scotland, England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, France and Germany and even Mongolia taking part.</p>
        
            <p>New Golden Shears International Shearing Championships Society president Trish Stevens said they were absolutely overwhelmed.</p>
        
            <p>"We are particularly pleased with the numbers of novice and junior entries. The novice shearing, junior shearing and novice woolhandling [entries] have all reached capacity."</p>
        
            <p>Shearing Sports New Zealand chairman Sir David Fagan, who has a record 16 titles from the Golden Shears, said he was so excited by the numbers that he considered entering again.</p>
        
            <p>But with a strong number of entries comes the need for a lot of sheep.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have arranged for 3500 sheep to be ready for shearing, while most are Romney sourced from Wairarapa farms, there will also be Merinos from Maniatoto and Corriedales from Taihape.</p>

            <p>Stevens said the sheep were held briefly in covered pens behind Masterton's War Memorial Stadium until they were needed and returned to where they came from after shearing.</p>
        
            <p>Their fleeces are sent to wool brokers on behalf of the farmers.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a team of volunteers who ensure the sheep are transported to the stadium and returned to the right farm. It's a huge operation and a real skill to ensure it all goes smoothly," Stevens said.</p>
        
            <p>The Golden Shears is being livestreamed.</p>
        
            <p>This year, Noise Productions, responsible for streaming the competition, has installed six new cameras above the shearing stools.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Toby Mills said the cameras were focused solely on the sheep - tracking their movements.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always had cameras above the stall, but the problem is the shearers are moving so much, they often are only half in shot or are covering most of the action - these new cameras will hopefully show people more of the action," Mills said.</p>
        
            <p>"Competitive shearing is an unusual sport, a lot of people have seen it - so we are trying to make it as exciting as possible."</p>
