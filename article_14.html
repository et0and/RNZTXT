            <p>The BBC journalist who Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers called a "good girl", sparking sexism complaints, said she does not believe he meant to offend.</p>
        
            <p>Rodgers made the comment to reporter Jane Lewis during a post-match interview on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It was followed by calls from women's groups for him to apologise.</p>
        
            <p>The Northern Irishman said "some people were looking to be offended" and he has since "had a laugh" with Lewis about it.</p>
        
            <p>Lewis said she accepted the interview had "become a talking point".</p>
        
            <p>But she added: "I don't believe there was any offence meant by Brendan Rodgers - and for my part, there was none taken."</p>
        
            <p>The BBC Scotland Sportsound interview followed Celtic's 3-1 win against Motherwell at Fir Park.</p>
        
            <p>Rodgers was asked by Lewis about its impact on the Premiership title race.</p>
        
            <p>The Celtic manager said: "The story has already been written about this group. But we will write our own story."</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Lewis for "a bit more insight" into what he meant, Rodgers replied: "No, no, you know exactly what I mean".</p>
        
            <p>He concluded by saying "done, good girl, well done" before walking away.</p>

            <p>Rodgers told members of the media he found it "saddening" to be accused of sexism.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, for me, in society now ... they'll find something that is offensive to try and pin onto people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he based his relationship with journalists on warmth, respect and courtesy and that would never change.</p>
        
            <p>The Celtic manager added: "Obviously when there was that little bit that was out there, a big bit, however it was, then of course I feel the need to address it.</p>
        
            <p>"I have spoken to Jane and she wasn't offended, we had a laugh about it.</p>
        
            <p>"She will continue to ask me awkward questions I'm sure, and I see her every week and we've good relations like I have with most people in my life, whether that's professional or social.</p>
        
            <p>"I found it saddening as much as anything because I'm not that type of person. I could never be that, It's not how I am built.</p>
        
            <p>The Scottish Feminist Network and For Women Scotland had urged Rodgers to explain the "good girl" comment, which has been labelled as "casual sexism".</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for the group said: "Rodgers' throwaway comment encourages other football fans to behave in a similar way, demeaning women they work with or engage with.</p>
        
            <p>"It has to stop.</p>
        
            <p>"Jane Lewis was just doing her job, trying to extract an explanation from Brendan Rodgers on his cryptic comment.</p>
        
            <p>"That the go-to attitude of a manager of a winning team was condescension is quite illuminating but really very depressing in 2024. We thought dinosaurs were extinct."</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman at For Women Scotland said: "It's depressing that casual sexism is still embedded in sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Women's achievements are underrated and dismissed, and their professional status undermined. Rodgers owes the reporter an apology."</p>
