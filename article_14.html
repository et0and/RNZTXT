            <p>A Matamata College student has died after being hit by a train this afternoon in Matamata.</p>
        
            <p>The accident occurred close to the college at about 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesperson said an ambulance, two helicopters and a rapid response vehicle attended.</p>
        
            <p>An email from Matamata Intermediate's principal to a parent said the person hit by a train was a college student.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed the girl died from her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite receiving medical attention, the young female died at the scene," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police extend our condolences to her family, who are being supported.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will be continuing to make inquiries on behalf of the Coroner."</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe had also been advised.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's executive general manager of operations Paul Ashton, said a northbound freight train had been involved in the collision.</p>
        
            <p>"The collision did not happen at a level crossing," Ashton said.</p>
        
            <p>"KiwiRail's thoughts are with the victims family and friends."</p>
        
            <p>The train driver was being supported, Ashton said, and KiwiRail thanked first responders and all who helped at the scene of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police have urged anyone who saw the accident at the intersection of College Street and Firth Streets to get in touch.</p>

            <p>Locals were asked to avoid the area if possible, while emergency services worked at the scene, but by 7pm the road had reopened.</p>
        
            <p>A rail maintenance vehicle was derailed last week after being struck by a car at a level crossing a few hundred metres further up Firth Street.</p>
