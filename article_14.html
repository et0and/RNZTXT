            <p>New Zealand Olympians have returned triumphant after the team's most successful Games campaign ever.</p>
        
            <p>The athletes arrived at the Auckland International Airport on Wednesday for one last victory lap.</p>
        
            <p>Champion canoeist Dame Lisa Carrington, with three gold medals around her neck, said she was proud of the team's success.</p>
        
            <p>"You never start out knowing that is what's going to happen, but it's so cool to see our other athletes performing so well," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's special to be a part of that."</p>

            <p>Gold medal kayaker Finn Butcher planned to visit family in Otago.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a bit of a whirlwind, but I'm pretty stoked to come home and go down and see Central Otago again, take this [medal] down there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the team was pretty special and 10 golds is... I don't think anyone expected that."</p>
        
            <p>He said it had been a joy getting to know his fellow athletes.</p>
        
            <p>"In the New Zealand team it's been awesome to meet a few people and hang out. Almost everyone has been really welcoming and I'll definitely be keeping in touch," he said.</p>

            <p>In Paris, Taiko Torepe-Ormsby became the fastest swimmer in New Zealand history.</p>
        
            <p>It was his first time at the Olympics, surrounded by some of the best athletes in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"It was cool being around not just other swimmers but other athletes from around the world," he said of his time in the Olympic village.</p>
        
            <p>"Simone Biles for example, I was sitting next to her at dinner. Seeing all these famous people, putting myself next to them and [thinking] 'what's stopping me from being one of them as well?'"</p>
        
            <p>Between events, Torepe-Ormsby said he found some time to see the sights.</p>
        
            <p>"I was fortunate enough to go up the Eiffel Tower which was amazing, not really something a lot of people in the world are able to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>After he secured his medal, Butcher said he also had time to enjoy the Olympics as a spectator.</p>
        
            <p>"After my race I actually got away to a couple of events, so we went to support the Kiwis in the velodrome. The women's madison which is just bonkers as a race," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we watched Hamish Kerr in the athletics jump to gold, so that was pretty cool."</p>
        
            <p>After weeks of intense competition, chef de mission Nigel Avery said his Olympians were keen for a break.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody's pretty tired, people are ready to come home. It was 38 degrees the day we left, it was very very warm," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody's given it their all, so happy to go home."</p>

            <p>But he admitted it was hard to say goodbye.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of like, if you remember back when you were a kid going to school camp, you come home that first night and go 'where are my mates?' It's a bit like that, a real post-Games sort of blues," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm back to work, I'm a mortgage broker so I get back and try and help people into homes."</p>
        
            <p>Carrington said she was feeling mixed emotions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a short period of time and we build up to it for so many years," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gone in an instant. It's not relief, it's a bit of sadness because we've been working so hard and now it's over."</p>
        
            <p>As for what's next, Carrington said it was the little things she was most excited for.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen my dog in four months, so that's a really big thing. Also I haven't really had any coffee in four months so that's also on my list."</p>
