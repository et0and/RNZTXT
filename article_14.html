        <h2>RNZ presents Unsafe Harbour: Surviving St John of God</h2>
        <p>
In honour of all survivors and victims of abuse in state and faith-based institutions.
</p>
        
            <p>Warning: This story and video includes graphic details of sexual abuse.</p>
        
            <p>The final report of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry will be revealed today.</p>
        
            <p>Survivors are expected to pack Parliament's public gallery when the almost 3000-page document is tabled this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The report's tabling brings to a close almost six years of work by the Royal Commission.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2300 survivors gave evidence to the inquiry, as the commissioners examined the prolific and systemic abuse which occurred in state and faith-based institutions from 1950 to 1999.</p>
        
            <p>In honour of all survivors and victims of abuse in state and faith-based institutions, RNZ presents Unsafe Harbour: Surviving St John of God.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry was established in 2018 following decades of mounting pressure from survivors and advocates.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry's chair Judge Coral Shaw described the country's long history of systemic abuse as a "national disgrace".</p>
        
            <p>When handing the final report to Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, the commissioners said: "Meaningful action must start right now. For too long our nation has swept abuse and neglect in care by state and faith-based institutions under the carpet. That's not good enough. It must stop".</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission's final report will be made public at 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to make a formal apology to survivors in November.</p>
