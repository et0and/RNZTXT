            <p>A new service for survivors of abuse in New Zealand state care is aiming to break cultures of shame by providing people an outlet to share their stories.</p>
        
            <p>The launch of Survivors Experiences Service follows a high-level inquiry into abuse in state and faith-based care.</p>
        
            <p>Through the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry, a number of survivors expressed their need for a service to share their experiences, between the closure of the Royal Commission and the time when a new, independent redress system is established.</p>
        
            <p>Many survivors were Pasifika, MƒÅori and disabled people.</p>
        
            <p>The service provides fully accessible short-term support for survivors to help them share their experiences - before, during and after sessions - with referrals to other support services where needed.</p>
        
            <p>It is guided by an independent board, which includes survivors of abuse in state care, including co-chairs Frances Tagaloa and Eugene Ryder.</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa was "one of the few Pacific who came forward during the Royal Commission of Inquiry to share her experience".</p>
        
            <p>"I am a survivor of faith-based abuse. I was abused between the ages of five and seven by Brother Bede Fitton, also known as Frances Fitton." He has since died.</p>
        
            <p>She reported her abuse to the Catholic church 22 years ago and is still waiting for an apology.</p>

            <p>"I still remember the person I disclosed my abuse to. It did start my healing journey. I was able to get a counsellor and sought other help. I ultimately did tell my family and my parents. I was not sure if they would believe me."</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa hopes to empower others who have experienced such abuse, especially Pasifika, to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific people have suffered intensely through abuse in care. There is a strong cultural taboo about sharing abuse and trauma. It is not acceptable to share that in our culture and we need to break through that and this service is part of it."</p>
        
            <p>Inquiry chairperson Coral Shaw previously said the scale of abuse was far greater than imaginable.</p>
        
            <p>"I did not want anyone else to experience the impacts of abuse that I had experienced. It has been an incredibly difficult journey, but it is important to be a part of that change," Tagaloa said.</p>

            <p>Ryder has encouraged survivors "that still remain silent" to come forward and begin their "journey to healing", just like he had done.</p>
        
            <p>He said sharing his story was liberating.</p>
        
            <p>"It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and made me feel a lot closer to my family and children.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of tears were shed, but they understood. It gave me a sense of freedom to engage with the Royal Commission and to tell my story."</p>
