            <p>Sid Going, who played 86 times for the All Blacks including 29 tests, has passed away aged 80.</p>
        
            <p>Going's career spanned between 1967-77, in which he played a role in some of the most iconic test series the All Blacks have ever been involved with. His skill and influence on the game made him generally considered to be one of the finest halfbacks that has ever played.</p>
        
            <p>The news was confirmed on Saturday morning by Northland Rugby, the province Going played for 110 times when it was called North Auckland. NZ Rugby CEO Mark Robinson said: "It's incredibly sad to hear of Sid's passing. He was a dynamic player and one of the greatest halfbacks in All Blacks history. He had an immense pride in wearing the All Blacks jersey and representing New Zealand Māori, something which greatly endeared him to fans. We send our condolences and aroha to his family and loved ones."</p>
        
            <p>Incoming All Black coach Scott Robertson said that "Sid was a special player and man in our game. He lit up the field with his ability and energy. He lit up people's hearts up off it - that was his trademark."</p>
        
            <p>The Going family name is synonymous with Northland and the Mid-Northern club. Brothers Ken and Brian were also members of the team, with 12 of the wider family following in their path in later years. Going's son Milton represented the All Blacks Sevens, while his other son Jared played Super Rugby for the Crusaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Going brothers were also famous for devising the 'triple scissors' backline move, which was used when all three would play in the North Auckland side.</p>
        
            <p>Standing at 170cm and weighing 81kg, Going debuted for the All Blacks against the Wallabies at Athletic Park in Wellington, before being part of a the legendary 1967 side that was unbeaten on their tour of the UK and France. A year later he scored two memorable tries against France at Eden Park, capping off a decade of complete All Black dominance over the rest of the rugby world.</p>

            <p>At the time of the controversial 1970 tour to South Africa, in which the Māori Going was considered an 'honorary white', his place as All Black halfback had been challenged by Chris Laidlaw.</p>
        
            <p>In a selection debate that rages on to this day, both were excellent players but offered different skill sets - Going was seen as a far more instinctive player while Laidlaw was the educated, safer option.</p>
        
            <p>By then known as 'Super Sid', Going played in 14 matches on the tour, including the first and fourth tests in a bitter series defeat to the Springboks. The next season he started all four tests in the iconic British Lions series, before again touring South Africa in 1976.</p>
        
            <p>During the 1972 tour to the UK and Ireland, Going featured in several iconic All Black photos, most notably of the team running out under heavy guard during a match against Ulster in Belfast.</p>

            <p>He marked his last series with the All Blacks in 1977 with a famous try against the Lions at Athletic Park, before retiring from international rugby at the age of 34.</p>
        
            <p>A lifelong farmer, Going and his family were also deeply involved in the Church Of The Latter Day Saints, he became a bishop and was the president of the Hamilton New Zealand Temple. At the 2020 Halberg Awards, Going was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
