            <p>New Zealand's oldest man and former prisoner of war James "Jim" Easton has celebrated another lap around the sun, hitting the grand old age of 108 this week.</p>
        
            <p>The St Heliers Grace Joel Retirement Village resident is believed to be the oldest living man in New Zealand and Australia's oldest surviving World War II veteran.</p>
        
            <p>The Scottish national spent his formative years in New South Wales, Australia, and joined the Australian Army at the age of 23, where he was a signalman in the 8th Division Signals regiment.</p>
        
            <p>During World War II, Easton was a prisoner of war, surviving three-and-a-half years of starvation, sickness, and beatings at the hands of the Japanese. While captive he spent time constructing the notorious Burma railway, dubbed the "Railway of Death".</p>
        
            <p>When he was released from the prison camp - weighing just 47kg - medics told him the years of ill-treatment would likely knock at least 10 years off his life.</p>
        
            <p>But the semi-supercentenarian has defied the odds for another year, celebrating his 108th birthday on Thursday surrounded by long-time friends and Australian Army representatives Lieutenant Will Williamson and Corporal Tamara Madzika.</p>

            <p>The pair gave Easton a regimental tie and pin, made specifically for the regiment's 100th anniversary next year.</p>
        
            <p>"Not much different to how it felt to be 101," he said on turning 108.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what he enjoyed most about his Army service, Easton replied: "Trying to get out!"</p>
        
            <p>Many of Easton's friends suffered terrible nightmares, but he managed to develop a clever technique to prevent them.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever I felt one coming on I'd dream of nude women. That took it away immediately," he told the Herald after his 106th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>After returning to New Zealand in 1947, Easton had an idea to "go into show business" - joining the touring fairgrounds that would travel around the country, which started a 65-year career. He retired in his mid-90s.</p>

            <p>In 2022, Easton was believed to be the first New Zealander to receive a birthday card from two monarchs: one from King Charles III for his 106th, and one from Queen Elizabeth II for his 100th.</p>
        
            <p>Easton said his tips for longevity included never smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was 12 years old I would walk past the pub at 3pm and see all the miners walking in, and half an hour later I would walk back past and they would be out the front beating the daylights out of each other.</p>
        
            <p>"As a child, I always said, 'when I grow up I'm not going into those places', and I never have.</p>
        
            <p>"And here I am now, Jimmy's the king of the world," he said with his customary sense of humour.</p>
        
            <p>As for the last 12 months, it's been an eventful period for the 108-year-old - contracting Covid-19 for the first time, having an overnight stay in Auckland City Hospital after a fall and a request from a Japanese film crew to feature in a movie marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, which is set to air in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Joel Village manager Murray Parkes said every year Easton added to his long life made his incredible story even more remarkable.</p>
        
            <p>"Jim is absolutely one of a kind. He is a unique individual who, having survived an incredibly difficult experience during the war, has never let that dull his enthusiasm for life, his sense of humour or his will power," Parkes said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having outlived his wife and daughter, he has built up a very loyal surrogate family of friends and former employees from his 60-plus years of work on the showgrounds and it's clear the great level of regard and affection they have for him.</p>
        
            <p>"Jim is always a big part of the village's Anzac commemoration and, speaking on behalf of the team here, we are all very proud to play a part in looking after him in his later life."</p>
