            <p>New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens is alive and healthy, a spokesperson for the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) says.</p>
        
            <p>Mehrtens, who was a pilot for Susi Air, was taken hostage by TPNPB fighters in February this year, shortly after landing at a remote airstrip.</p>
        
            <p>A new video circulating on social media shows Mehrtens surrounded by armed men. The video said Mehrtens had been given two months to live before he will be shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has been unable to verify the footage or when it was filmed.</p>
        
            <p>However, West Papua spokesperson Akouboo Amatus Douw said the video dated back to May or June and Mehrtens remained in good health.</p>
        
            <p>"I just received a message from our teamwork [sic] just a few minutes ago and they said that he is still alive, he is very healthy at [the] moment," Douw said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We the liberation fighters gave him very good hospitality which is if he needs some medication or water or food or whatever, they [will] always provide since they captured him in February.</p>
        
            <p>"We have our own humanitarian team inside the TPNPB so that team looks after him.</p>
        
            <p>"His wellbeing and welfare is a top priority."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) was aware of the video, it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts were ongoing to secure Mehrtens' safe release, it said, including working closely with Indonesian authorities and deploying New Zealand consular staff to do so.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot's safety and wellbeing remained the top priority, and his family in Aotearoa and Indonesia were being supported, MFAT said.</p>
        
            <p>Douw said he wanted Mehrtens to be released under peaceful negotiations, facilitated by a third party.</p>
        
            <p>He said the TPNPB wanted to release Mehrtens "very soon" but it depended on the New Zealand and Indonesian governments.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready, we are happy, we hope [to release Mehrtens] anytime soon but it's depends on the Indonesian government and also New Zealand how they would like to go."</p>
        
            <p>Douw said discussions were "deadlocked" with New Zealand and Indonesia so the TPNPB is now waiting for the new New Zealand government to be established.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that the New Zealand prime minister and foreign minister, they might understand about how West Papuans struggle."</p>
        
            <p>Douw said he thought Mehrtens would remain safe.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Socratez Yoman, the president of the fellowship of Baptist Churches in West Papua based in Jayapura - the largest city in the Indonesian province of Papua - said he believed Mehrtens would remain safe and not be killed.</p>
        
            <p>"My people are not savages, they are not savage people, they have dignity, they respect, human dignity," Yoman said.</p>
        
            <p>Yoman said he hoped Mehrtens would be released soon.</p>
