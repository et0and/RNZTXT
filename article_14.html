            <p>The fallout from the World Cup final loss continues for All Blacks captain Sam Cane.</p>
        
            <p>After being sent off in the World Cup final against South Africa and having to sit on the sideline in Paris and watch his side go down 12-11, Cane will now have to appear before a World Rugby judiciary panel.</p>
        
            <p>Cane has been cited for a dangerous tackle on Springboks midfielder Jesse Kriel, half an hour into the game.</p>
        
            <p>He will appear before the judiciary tonight via video.</p>
        
            <p>If found guilty the low end of the punishment sits at a suspension for two games or two weeks, while the maximum penalty is 52 weeks or matches.</p>
        
            <p>Any ban that Cane has to serve would come into effect with his new Japanese club Suntory who he recently signed with.</p>
        
            <p>Cane is taking up a sabbatical option in his New Zealand Rugby contact that will see him miss next year's Super Rugby competition.</p>
