            <p>In August, te ao Māori was rocked by the news that Te Arikinui Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII had died, aged 69, just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia had been in hospital recovering from heart surgery. He died peacefully, surrounded by his wife Te Makau Ariki Atawhai and their children Whatumoana, Korotangi and Nga wai hono i te po.</p>
        
            <p>He had been crowned on 21 August 2006 following the death of his mother, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.</p>
        
            <p>In the last year of his life, Kiingi Tuheitia became synonymous with the word kotahitanga (unity) after he called a national hui in opposition to the government in January. In his speech to close the hui, he told the crowd: "The best protest we can do right now is being Māori ... Māori all day, every day, we are here, we are strong."</p>
        
            <p>During his tangihanga, he was often referred to as 'te Kiingi o te Kotahitanga' or the King of Unity.</p>
        
            <p>Manuhiri from all across the motu and beyond arrived at Tuurangawaewae to pay their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia. The first two days of the tangihanga were reserved for the people of Tainui, but there were a few notable exceptions, including Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Then, the gates of Tuurangawaewae were open to anyone. On the morning of 2 September alone, more than 10,000 people poured through the main gate, and a second gate had to be opened to allow everyone to enter the marae.</p>
        
            <p>The guests were not only Māori - many of those who arrived to pay tribute were Pākehā, Pasifika and from overseas.</p>

            <p>It took an entire army of volunteers to feed and take care of the tens of thousands of manuhiri who arrived at Tuurangawaewae for the tangihanga. From the Māori wardens directing traffic, to the women making sandwiches, to the children picking up rubbish on the riverbank, everyone at Tuurangawaewae had a role to play.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingitanga spokesperson Rahui Papa said one of the maxims of the marae was "no one should go home hungry".</p>

            <p>On the final day of the tangihanga, Kiingi Tuheitia was carried aboard a special waka along the Waikato River from Tuurangawaewae marae to Taupiri Maunga.</p>
        
            <p>Mourners lined both banks of the river to catch a glimpse of the waka as it passed by.</p>
        
            <p>But before the late King left Tuurangawaewae, there was a ceremony to welcome his successor. Kiingi Tuheitia's youngest child and only daughter became the eighth head of the Kiingitanga - Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po.</p>
