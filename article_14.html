            <p>Signs of potential disagreements are starting to surface at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>According to various reports coming out from Rarotonga, the Nauru delegation walked out of the main plenary on Wednesday morning local time (Thursday NZ time) ahead of the leaders retreat on Aitutaki.</p>
        
            <p>1News and The Fiji Times reported that Nauru President David Adeang "stormed out" when the candidacy of ex-president Baron Waqa to become the next Forum secretary-general was brought up for discussion.</p>
        
            <p>Waqa's candidacy had been endorsed by the Micronesia Presidents Summit and agreed to in a special leaders meeting in February this year, but has since received criticism due to his track record during his time in power, which includes sacking judges, being investigated by Australian police for taking bribes and imposing harsh restrictions on media.</p>

            <p>Sources in Rarotonga told RNZ Pacific that Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Matafa had raised concerns during the plenary meeting over the process in which Waqa had been elected and wants that discussed tomorrow (Friday NZ time) at the leaders retreat.</p>
        
            <p>According to reports Adeang then got up and left as he believed this meant Waqa's new role is in question despite being confirmed to lead the regional organisation.</p>
        
            <p>According to The Fiji Times after the Nauru delegation left, the remaining Micronesian bloc leaders were allowed to meet privately and report back to the plenary.</p>
        
            <p>The newspaper reported Forum chair and Cook Islands PM Mark Brown asked Fiji PM Sitiveni Rabuka to intervene if required to bring Nauru back to the discussion table.</p>
        
            <p>Palau's President Surangel Whipps Jr confirmed to RNZ Pacific on Tuesday that the Micronesian leaders "pledged our support in February and we will continue to support [Waqa]."</p>
        
            <p>"As the Micronesians, it's our responsibility to put up a name. We believe that the process was followed. If there's still more questions to be had, he's here to answer," Whipps Jr said.</p>

            <p>New Zealand's deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni, who is attending the Froum to represent the caretaker government, said "I've just seen what has been referenced online" when responding to questions from journalists on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not even entirely sure there was a walk out...because leaders are coming in and out during the Forum.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly, the process with regards to the selection of this SG moving forward has been raised as something we should discuss as leaders. And but there was no suggestion that we would revisit the decision [about the appointment of Waqa]," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Waqa's appointment was agreed on by all the Pacific leaders and "now there is a suggestion we should talk about the process moving forward to ensure that we're on the same page with respect to that".</p>
