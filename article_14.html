        <p>
Animal welfare, profitability and the right to farm are among the issues facing sheep breeders at this year's forum, attendees tell RNZ's Country Life.  Audio

            <p>Sheep breeders will increasingly have to address issues like animal welfare and the right to farm when they consider improving their sheep's genetics, according to experts.</p>
        
            <p>But the biggest issue facing breeders is profitability, they say.</p>
        
            <p>Those issues, and how genetic selection can improve sheep traits and boost farm profits, were among the talking points at the Sheep Breeders' Forum field day on Banks Peninsula this week.</p>
        
            <p>"Genetics really is an enabler. It's enabled us to get more fertility into our flocks and grow our lambs to heavier carcass weights without going over fat," said Jason Archer, head of genetics at Beef and Lamb New Zealand.</p>

            <p>The last Sheep Breeders Forum - which was held in 2021 - was cancelled on day one after an attendee tested positive for Covid, so there's been lots to catch up on.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a chance for breeders to get together, to network, to talk about common problems, to ask us questions, but also to ask questions of each other and, I guess, advance the cause of sheep breeding in New Zealand, " Dr Archer told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>With climate change, changing market requirements and environmental challenges, he thinks the sheep industry will take three genetic paths in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"One is, there'll be some breeders that stay with the strong wool, there'll be some breeders that take the wool right off, and then fining up the clip is another strategy that another group will probably take."</p>

            <p>The sheep of the future will also carry more social baggage than those of today, he said.  </p>
        
            <p>"We're going to have to address issues like welfare, and a right to farm animals is going to become an increasing thing in the future too."</p>
        
            <p>Sheep farming is also under scrutiny due to the greenhouse gas emissions of the animals, so developing a low-methane-emitting sheep, without sacrificing productivity, is a top priority.</p>
        
            <p>"Everywhere you go, people are talking about reducing methane outputs from sheep, cattle and other animals. It's not a New Zealand thing, it's a worldwide thing," he said.</p>

            <p>So how are these genetic improvements made in sheep?</p>
        
            <p>"It comes down to measuring animals, knowing what performance they are and then selecting them," Dr Archer said.</p>
        
            <p>An element of patience is required though. It can take many generations of sheep to achieve genetic gains.  </p>
        
            <p>"We talk about it as making cumulative and permanent gains, so every gain that we make each year stacks up. And after 10 years, you've actually made some significant change.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a building block, but the great thing is, once you've made that permanent gain step, it stays with you and you don't have to keep paying for it."</p>
        
            <p>But the biggest challenge facing breeders now is profitability, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's tough out there for sheep farmers. Costs have gone up, prices are at a real low and people are hurting. People are going to have to work our way out of that and it's not going to be easy."</p>
