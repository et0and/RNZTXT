        <h2>Destiny Church protests evoke dark past</h2>
        <p>
Recent events in Auckland have resurfaced memories of when being gay was considered a neurotic personality disorder

            <p>The protest by Destiny Church at an Auckland Pride event has revisited a rhetoric that many in the rainbow community thought was dead and buried.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the response from the general public has been a lashing out against Bishop Brian Tamaki's ManUp.</p>
        
            <p>Josiah Pasikale says the protest is "years behind the current conversation, and I think that the rainbow community is past that".</p>
        
            <p>"I think Destiny Church is being recognised more as a cult, in that they don't actually represent all churches, all of Christianity."</p>
        
            <p>After a decade of struggling to accept his sexuality, Pasikale no longer hides that he's gay.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in such a different space from when I last talked about my gay journey," he says.</p>
        
            <p>With a Tokelauan father and Fijian-Chinese mother, Pasikale grew up in a household that valued church and God, and a culture that didn't acknowledge or accept being gay.</p>
        
            <p>"See the thing with the Pacific language is that there's no word for gay. So, you have fa'afafineâ€¦ [which is] a male performing duties of a female. They normally help the mother out in the home, and they often have feminine qualities, [but] they're still recognised as males," he explains.</p>
        
            <p>Towards the end of high school, Pasikale became heavily involved in a church where the rhetoric of pastors only further ingrained that being gay was wrong, pushing him towards conversion therapy to try and "cure" his homosexuality.</p>
        
            <p>"I really believed that my gayness was some type of sickness or sin and that all I had to do was love God more, pray to God more.</p>
        
            <p>"My sexuality was something that I did not want, I didn't want to be attracted to men. I really wanted a wife and kids, I wanted to be like my friends who were attracted to women and getting married," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Pasikale is open about his sexuality to set a good example for younger men and women, saying it's something that would've changed things for him.</p>
        
            <p>"If only I had really good role models of being gay, I wouldn't have dreaded the acceptance of a faith," he says.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail also speaks to abuse in care survivor Joan Bellingham who grew up in Christchurch during the seventies, where being gay was something you didn't talk about publicly.</p>
        
            <p>"The first gay pubs were downstairs, and you had to have a pass to get through," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Bellingham knew she was a lesbian from a young age and despite prevailing social views never tried to hide it while she was training to become a nurse.</p>
        
            <p>"I got picked on by the tutors at Burwood Hospital and consequently got put into Princess Margaret Hospital," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Bellingham was about 18 at the time and spent the next 12 years in and out of hospital being treated for what doctors called a 'neurotic personality disorder'.</p>
        
            <p>The care included "excessive medication", electroconvulsive therapy and uncomfortable discussions with a male doctor.</p>
        
            <p>"He would ask me all sorts of questions about being a lesbian, he would ask me questions like, 'how many times a week do you have sex with your partner?' and 'what is it like?'," she told the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Bellingham eventually left the hospital in 1982.</p>
        
            <p>She remains open about her sexuality to set an example for young people. She doesn't want them to go what she went through.</p>
        
            <p>"The more we speak out, the more we're showing people that it's normal, it's okay, we're okay.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to be out there, we've got to be, and I know it's not easy for some people, but I think the more we do it and the more out there we are, the better it's going to be."</p>
