            <p>Hans Key, a champion for Pacific workers in Aotearoa, has received a King's Service Medal in the New Year Honours List.</p>
        
            <p>"Every single one of those who received an honour today represents remarkable service to New Zealand. New Zealand is a better place for their contributions," said Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, of the 190 recipients on the 2025 New Year Honours List, including three new knights and dames.</p>
        
            <p>The list also includes 12 Pasifika recipients, who have been recognised for their contributions to communities, academia, the arts, and advocacy. Among them is Hans Key, who has been awarded a King's Service Medal for services to health and safety and the Pacific community.</p>
        
            <p>Key established the "Puataunofo, Come Home Safely" programme in 2006, to provide health and safety messages to Pasifika manufacturing workers. The initiative was adopted by WorkSafe in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Key spoke about the origin of Pautaunofono's name.</p>
        
            <p>The name is made up of three parts: pua - flower that represents the worker, tau - bringing people together and nofo, sitting down together.</p>
        
            <p>Key, a Samoan-born New Zealander, hails from the villages of Manase and Malaela in Samoa. He immigrated to New Zealand with his parents for a better life, and settled in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>
Puataunofo is designed to raise health and safety awareness for Pasifika workers.

            <p>"My parents didn't have the best of everything. My father was a tradesman, which is how he got a work opportunity with Fletchers that got us over here, my mother on the other hand worked for Bluebird's factory in Ōtara.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time after school, my parents - they'd come home, and I'd see the plasters from their injuries at work, and when I started working later on in life, that's how the career path started for me.</p>
        
            <p>"That became my goal growing up, although I love sports and cooking, it was always at the back of my mind to keep our people safe," Key said.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead to the future, Key said they are now working toward taking their safety workshops from the shop floor level to management and beyond.</p>
        
            <p>Puataunofo was recognised at the 2009 New Zealand Workplace Health and Safety Awards and won the ACC Best Leadership of an Industry Sector Award in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm humbled by the nomination. It's not just me. It takes a village to raise a child, and so other people have played a part in terms of the work and this award," Key said.</p>
