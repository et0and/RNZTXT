        <h2>HopeWalk founder Joseph Fa'afiu humbled by NY honour</h2>
        <p>
Fa'afiu - who has been made MNZM - says Pacific Islanders can be secretive about mental health and he wants everyone to be able to discuss it in a safe way.

            <p>Iosefo Joseph Fa'afiu, founder of the HopeWalk suicide prevention movement, has been made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his services to mental health, youth, and the Pacific community.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'afiu has received many other awards including a Minister of Health Volunteer Award 2022, Kiwibank Local Hero Medal, 2017 and the Sunpix Pacific Community Leader of the Year 2016.</p>
        
            <p>"When I read the email, I thought it was a fake. It was a surprise, and I still feel humbled and overwhelmed, I don't know who nominated me, but I'd like to say thank you," Fa'afiu said.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'afiu is from the villages of Faleapuna and Satuimalufilufi in Samoa and grew up in East Auckland, in state housing.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'afiu acknowledged his grandfather, Fa'afiu Setefano, who came to New Zealand in the 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>"He was the navigator and the pathfinder for us and the reason why we are here today."</p>
        
            <p>Fa'afiu and his wife created HopeWalk Suicide Awareness after they lost a close friend to suicide.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2010, Ebuny sadly took her life the week we had dinner with her two days before she took her life; she was a mother of three girls and a wife.</p>
        
            <p>
Over eight years approximately 100,000 people have participated in HopeWalk events worldwide, which started in South Auckland.

            <p>"Everything seemed normal, and that started the movement to have a conversation about how to make our people safe.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, the movement's groundwork started with talks, and the first activation started with a walk.</p>
        
            <p>"That's where the name came from, it was a walk for hope, to give people hope that you can talk.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, Fa'afiu posted about their initiative on social media, and three thousand people responded. Over eight years approximately 100,000 people have participated in HopeWalk events worldwide, which started in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"From there, the snowball effect started there, where a lot of others wanted to join; it has grown and gone as far as Australia, America, the UK, the Pacific islands, Canada, and Brazil.</p>
        
            <p>"We Pacific Islanders can be passionate but also secretive about mental health. We want to discuss it in a safe way to find better solutions."</p>
        
            <p>Fa'afiu has worked with the Pacific Advisory Unit for the New Zealand Police, in South Auckland, and the Counties Manukau Pacific Advisory Board.</p>
        
            <p>He has also written two children's books about anti-bullying and identity and is the founder of the "Inspire" Youth Leadership Programme.</p>
