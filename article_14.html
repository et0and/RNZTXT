            <p>Plans for football to introduce 10-minute sin-bins for cynical fouls and dissent have been recommended for trialling in the professional game.</p>
        
            <p>The game's lawmakers, the International Football Association Board, said it will "identify which levels are best to test".</p>
        
            <p>The trial will also include a rule allowing only the team captain to approach the referee during a game.</p>
        
            <p>Sin-bins have been trialled at grassroots level since 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The proposals were announced at an Ifab meeting in London on Tuesday and are subject to approval at their Annual General Meeting in March 2024.</p>

            <p>Former referee Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee who sits on the governing body's technical subcommittee, said the proposed trials would "very probably" involve professional football.</p>
        
            <p>Ifab secretary Lukas Brud said one of the next steps was to identify the appropriate competition where the trials could take place.</p>
        
            <p>"The positive message of the meeting is that 'yes, we're going to do something in that direction'," Brud told BBC Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the next weeks and months we are going to identify which levels are best to test.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping in the next few months we will have clarity about which competitions will want to trial this as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's up to them, competition organisers, to decide whether they want to participate in those trials or not.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is important to understand that something big like this, and a big decision like that, has to be considered thoroughly when creating protocols and setting up the system to trial it. "</p>
        
            <p>Trials on sin bins for tactical fouling under consideration</p>
        
            <p>Sin bins were piloted in 2018-19 and led to the Football Association reporting a 38% total reduction in dissent across 31 leagues.</p>
        
            <p>They were then introduced across all levels of grassroots football from the 2019-20 season in an attempt to to improve levels of respect and fair play.</p>
        
            <p>The rule change was then implemented up to step five of the National League system and tier three and below in women's football.</p>
        
            <p>FA chief executive Mark Bullingham, a member of the Ifab board, indicated sin bins for tactical fouls could also be considered in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [there is] frustration for fans watching games when they see a promising counter-attack that's ruined by that [a tactical foul]," Bullingham said.</p>
        
            <p>"The question of whether a yellow card is sufficient for that has led to us looking at whether that should be involved in the protocol as well.</p>
        
            <p>"The starting point was looking at player behaviour and dissent - we're then looking at whether we should extend it into other areas, such as tactical fouls, as well."</p>
