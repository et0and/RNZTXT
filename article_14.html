        <h2>Tensions rise over campers living at abandoned golf course</h2>
        <p>
A camper living at the course has threatened visitors with a weapon, locals say, but the men camping there say it's them being harassed.

            <p>A camper living at the abandoned Gulf Harbour Country Club has threatened visitors with a weapon, locals say, but the men camping there say it is them that are being harassed.</p>
        
            <p>The property on the Hibiscus Coast was formerly a prestigious golf course and landmark of the area, but has been abandoned and plagued with issues including arson, and a hefty demolition bill owed to Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>Residents have posted on the neighbourhood Facebook page about two incidents when visitors to the property were threatened.</p>
        
            <p>But a man living at the club said this was all part of a vigilante hunt to target him, along with the other campers.</p>
        
            <p>He said locals had been harassing and threatening them, and they were only giving as good as they got.</p>

            <p>Tim Stewart has been living in his caravan at the property since shortly after the course was abandoned last year.</p>

            <p>He is retired and said he could not afford to rent a place - so he lives in his caravan and tries to enjoy some peace and quiet.</p>
        
            <p>But he had not had much of that recently. He said last month a local woke him with an early morning visit.</p>
        
            <p>"By the time I've put my trousers on to come up, I see the car screaming at the camper, as if it was going to hit him. Which is a lot worse than having an object thrown at you - a car is a lethal weapon times 10. So then the camper has chased him, thrown the object and it was nice and peaceful for a few days."</p>
        
            <p>Two incidents were posted about on the Keep Whangaparāoa's Green Spaces Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>One described a camper throwing a weapon at a car - the poster did not want to comment to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Zane Rowe, who also camped at the property, admitted it was him but said the visitor was having a go at Stewart first.</p>
        
            <p>"He put his window down, started abusing him, telling him to **** off: 'You burned the place down, you smashed the place, you wrecked the place, you shouldn't be here'.</p>
        
            <p>"I basically came out just to scare the guy."</p>

            <p>Rowe threw a type of gardening tool at the car, he said - a sickle, not a machete like the locals on the Facebook page claimed.</p>
        
            <p>Another local, who did not want to be named, said he drove up to the club to see what was left of it, and a camper swore at him and then got a weapon out of his van.</p>
        
            <p>He lived nearby and said he would consider getting a restraining order if any more violent incidents happened.</p>
        
            <p>Stewart said he felt intimidated by the visiting locals, but was not planning on going anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a great Winston Churchill speech isn't there: 'We shall fight them on the beaches and we shall fight them on the airfields, we shall never surrender," he laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"When I feel I'm in the right I will battle for my rights."</p>
        
            <p>He said the owner had given him permission to stay there.</p>
        
            <p>But Wayne Bailey, director of Long River Investments, which owns the property, did not want to comment on this to Checkpoint.</p>

            <p>A police spokesperson said as the site was private property it had no jurisdiction to remove the man, and it could not confirm whether he had permission to be there.</p>
        
            <p>Albany ward councillor John Watson said the campers at the country club were just the latest in a string of issues at the property.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had arson - this magnificent country club burned down. We've had anti-social behaviour, we've had vandalism. So the community out here are really at the end of their tether."</p>
        
            <p>The owners of the property were allowing the campers to stay on the property, Watson believed, or at least turning a blind eye to it - as part of their plan to let the property go to ruin.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm quite sure the bad publicity, the want and neglect are all quite acceptable to them. Because it fits in with their narrative that somehow this course can't be run.</p>
        
            <p>"Where in fact we know it can be, it was in the past. And there are people around who can do it again."</p>
        
            <p>The owners wanted to develop the land for housing, he said, though they would need to get around a 1000-year covenant with the council for the land to stay as green space.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint put this to Wayne Bailey but he did not want to comment on this issue either.</p>
