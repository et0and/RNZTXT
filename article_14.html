            <p>Trade Me has become the second company in five days to confirm it has been in talks with news publisher Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, CEO Anders Skoe said Trademe had an ongoing commercial relationship with Stuff which "in recent months has included discussions regarding content sharing".</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me had also been discussing "other collaborations", he said.</p>
        
            <p>His comments come after speculation that TradeMe or other media could be seeking a stake in Stuff, publisher of the news website as well as newspapers like the Post, Press and Sunday StarTimes.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, NZME told the NZX stock exchange it had been holding talks to buy some of the Stuff masthead newspapers and their sites to bolster its OneRoof business.</p>
        
            <p>But those talks were on hold due to a board takeover bid at NZME.</p>
        
            <p>Radio New Zealand revealed that Stuff's CEO and owner Sinead Boucher had changed part of her shareholding, in a move which could make it easier to sell a stake.</p>
        
            <p>Last December, the media company was divided in two - Stuff Digital administers stuff.co.nz, Neighbourly and its audio and video divisions. Newspaper brands and their own websites like The Post, The Press and The Waikato Times were incorporated into Masthead Publishing under Stuff Limited.</p>
        
            <p>Then in February, Boucher changed her holdings in Stuff Digital from being the owner of the one and only share to being the sole holder of one million shares.</p>
        
            <p>Business analysts said the move could make it easier to sell a stake or bring in partners.</p>
