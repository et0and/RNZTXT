            <p>Martin Phillipps would have been surprised by how loved and appreciated he was, says friend and film director Julia Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>Parnell directed The Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps documentary about The Chills front man who died this week at age 61.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he would have expected, with a smile on his face, for people to be talking about the music and his contribution in that way.</p>
        
            <p>"But I think he would have been surprised at the love and care and heartbreak. I think sometimes he did struggle to realise how loved and appreciated he was," Parnell told Music 101.</p>
        
            <p>"That's perhaps one of the sad things that I would often encourage him to feel more the sense of how adored he was."</p>
        
            <p>Parnell, who went on to form a close friendship with the musician, and was struck by what a singular man Phillipps was when she first met him, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just instantly felt connected to him, such an unusual, fascinating and complex individual.</p>
        
            <p>"Straightaway, I realised, how could I not want to work with him."</p>

            <p>The film was unflinching about the ups and downs of Phillipps' life and opens with him getting bad news about his health and battle with hepatitis C.</p>
        
            <p>"Very early in the filming, in the first few days that we started filming the documentary, he was told he only had a few months to live if he didn't change his lifestyle.</p>
        
            <p>"And that dire prognosis really set the tone for the documentary. So, it made it quite an urgent and deeply personal exploration of his life."</p>
        
            <p>Despite that bleak prognosis, Phillipps carried on making music and bringing it to audiences all over the world, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He knew he was not well, he always did and he always felt that sense of needing to get as much done as he possibly could."</p>
        
            <p>The film allowed him to move on and get on with what was left of his life, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He'd moved to a place, I think, where he had more clarity and ability to really tap into his creativity. He really stood tall afterwards, and made most of every minute he had left."</p>
        
            <p>Tours of Australasia, the US and Europe followed as did three new Chills albums, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just so impressed with what he has been able to do in the last few years and will always have that music now, that's his indomitable spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"And that music will just live on."</p>
