            <p>All Blacks captain Sam Cane faces at least a couple of months on the sideline after reportedly suffering a serious injury playing for Japanese club Suntory Sungoliath.</p>
        
            <p>Suntory, who sit third on the Division 1 table, have also lost Springbok wing Cheslin Kolbe to injury.</p>
        
            <p>Japan-based rugby journalist Rich Freeman reports that Cane injured his back and could be out of action for up to ten weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Cane was out of the game for several months after breaking his neck in 2018, while he missed the start of last year's World Cup with a back problem.</p>
