            <p>Shooter Neelam O'Neill is poised to make history as the first woman to represent New Zealand in air pistol at the Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>With the 2024 Paralympics kicking off in Paris on 28 August, O'Neill will also be the first New Zealand female shooter to compete at the games in 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to compete and to represent New Zealand," O'Neill said.</p>
        
            <p>Born in New Zealand to Fiji-Indian parents, O'Neill was introduced to recreational shooting when she was seven years old.</p>
        
            <p>Having grown up in Whangārei, the 31-year-old took up shooting as a sport after moving to Auckland for university in 2011, eventually recruiting six-time Paralympian Michael Johnson as her coach.</p>
        
            <p>"I started doing air rifle properly in 2012 and then started competing in 2013. I had my first international event in 2014," she said. "I picked up an air pistol in 2017 and, yeah, the rest is history."</p>

            <p>O'Neill said shooting was a financially challenging sport to compete in.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to get all the gear you use and keep replacing the pellets," she said. "The cost was so big I didn't even think I would be able to do it [go to the Paralympics]."</p>
        
            <p>O'Neill said New Zealand needed more women to compete in shooting.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be really cool to see more females and girls getting into it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of shooting, Neelam works at a bank in a customer service role.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was looking forward to the trip with her family.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to be the first time I'm going to Europe and, because my mum and sister are coming as well, it's the furthest we've been away from home," O'Neill said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just really love being able to travel with my sport and experience so many different cultures, backgrounds and food," she said. "I'm a big foodie."</p>

            <p>Joining O'Neill is a diverse team of 25 athletes on the New Zealand team, including Joshua Wilmer from Kawakawa Bay in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The 19-year-old is preparing for his first Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been swimming my whole life," said Wilmer, who started swimming lessons when he was three years old.</p>
        
            <p>"I always liked racing," he said. "That's my favourite part about swimming and I'm looking forward to Paris."</p>
        
            <p>Wilmer made his international swimming debut in 2022, finishing sixth in the 100m Breaststroke SB6 at the World Para Swimming Championships in Madeira, Portugal.</p>
        
            <p>A few weeks later, he emerged as an overnight star by winning gold at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games.</p>
        
            <p>Wilmer is of Māori, Chinese, Danish and English heritage.</p>
        
            <p>"I quite like that," he said when asked about his identity. "I'd rather it be a bit of everything than one thing."</p>
        
            <p>Wilmer is participating in the 100m breaststroke and said he loved it because it was a satisfying stroke.</p>
        
            <p>When not training in a pool, he works 25 hours a week at a car mechanic shop in Papakura.</p>
        
            <p>Wilmer is also looking forward to the food Paris has to offer.</p>
        
            <p>"I've heard that they've got good croissants," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Paralympic team features athletes competing in eight sports, including athletics, badminton, canoe, cycling, equestrian and table tennis - two more than at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven athletes will be making their Paralympic debuts, while 14 have competed in previous games.</p>
