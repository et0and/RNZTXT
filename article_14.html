Analysis - Here's a list of some of the potential options for Auckland's football side, from the predictable to the 'Ninja Knights'. Video

            <p>Analysis -'What's in a name?' William Shakespeare once asked. Actually, in football, a name means quite a lot. A club's name can accentuate historical links to institutions such as the army, railroads or universities or even an ongoing affiliation with other sports such as athletics or cricket.</p>
        
            <p>Or, like the Wellington Phoenix, it might represent the rebirth of a club from the ashes of a previous firestorm. Auckland, the location of aforementioned firestorm, will soon step back into the breach of professional football - with US businessman Bill Foley's project building momentum toward a 2024-25 A-League Men debut. This Thursday, the club's official name, logo and overall brand identity will be unveiled.</p>
        
            <p>What will it be? Foley has already dropped a massive hint, but here are some potential options for the newest professional football team in New Zealand:</p>

            <p>Some derivation of this name appears to be the frontrunner. Foley has a strong predilection for this moniker due to his time at West Point military academy where, you guessed it, the sports teams are known as 'The Black Knights'. Bar a huge turn-of-face this will be the new name of Auckland's latest football team, despite near universal disapproval among the football fraternity.</p>
        
            <p>But hold on: the New Zealand Knights were the previous incarnation in Auckland and they flunked, with poor performances and even worse attendances. Their failure has long been a stick with which to beat a second New Zealand expansion team.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps they are taking back ownership of the word 'knights'. It's almost a valiant thing to do, some might even call it chivalrous.</p>

            <p>OK, so Knights is on the table but why black? Why not blue? Blue is the colour most regularly associated with sport and Auckland. Sure, black has its place on a national scale but blue would more accurately represent the city.</p>
        
            <p>Saying that, the Blue Knights is also the name of a nationwide social organisation for retired police officers. Perhaps Foley doesn't fancy a World Wrestling Federation v World Wildlife Fund-style legal fracas on his hands.</p>
        
            <p>Final knights-related shout here and, I think you will agree, by far the superior. Back in 2007, with the name hunt ongoing for what would eventually become the Wellington Phoenix, this was the only suggestion out of 250 contenders listed by The Post which incorporated the name Knights.</p>
        
            <p>Why? Who knows and, frankly, who cares because ninjas are infinitely cooler than a colour palette.</p>

            <p>I know, yawn! However, this might be the best of the bunch. It's clean, it's crisp and it's timeless while also being modern - with most clubs moving away from nickname-type nomenclatures.</p>
        
            <p>Foley's other two football ventures adorn simple prefixes, AFC Bournemouth and FC Lorient. Either one would also look good in front of Auckland. Boring? Maybe. But like a classic plain tee, this format never goes out of style.</p>
        
            <p>The most likely suffixes for a football team, United and City, are already taken by other Auckland-based clubs. Perhaps Wanderers could be an option. Historically, this tack-on usually indicates a roaming team that began their football journey without a set home. With word of scheduling conflicts at preferred home option, Mount Smart, this tag may prove accurate.</p>

            <p>Up the Wahs! Those scheduling conflicts mentioned above are with New Zealand's leading domestic club on and, most importantly, off the pitch over the past 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>So why not jump on the bandwagon? Just straight up steal the name and hope a few people get confused and end up watching the other sort of 'footy'.</p>
        
            <p>Something about this name just looks cool. The MƒÅori name for our biggest city is already the default FIFA used throughout the Women's World Cup and would differentiate the A-League side from the already established Auckland clubs.</p>
        
            <p>Not only that, but it would be an immediate statement of inclusivity and progressive thinking.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps this is not just a team for Auckland but for all of New Zealand, laying the foundations for fixtures across the nation.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch, Hamilton, Rotorua, Napier. All would have the chance to see the nation's newest professional club. Just imagine it now, a packed house of 4,000 at Greymouth's Wingham Park. Bring on the roadshow.</p>

            <p>Generating a high-stakes rivalry with the Phoenix is a must for the new franchise. Naming themselves after another, entirely more bad ass, mythological winged creature should do the trick.</p>
        
            <p>Sure, a Phoenix is essentially immortal, but a Gryphon has the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. Give no thought to the aerodynamics of such a creature, just splendour in its ridiculous but magnificent form.</p>
