            <p>More than 14,000 people attended the first Holi celebration of the year in the Auckland town of Kumeu on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The event was organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, colloquially known as the Hare Krishna movement.</p>
        
            <p>Holi, or the Festival of Colours, typically includes Rangwali Holi or Dhulandi, where participants throw coloured water or powder at each other as they sing, dance and enjoy festive foods.</p>
        
            <p>It will be celebrated in India on 14 March, marking the arrival of spring in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

            <p>Legend traces the festival's origins to the courtship of Lord Krishna and his favourite consort, Radha.</p>
        
            <p>Krishna, envious of Radha's fair complexion, playfully applied various colours to her face.</p>
        
            <p>Participants at the festival re-enact this interaction by smearing coloured powder onto each other with a mix of romance and joy.</p>

            <p>The festival also marks the triumph of good over evil, with bonfires lit a day earlier to mark the occasion.</p>
        
            <p>This, as legend has it, is related to the story of a Lord Vishnu devotee called Prahlad and his aunt, Holika, who was the sister of demon king Hiranyakashyap.</p>
        
            <p>Holika, who was fortunate enough to be protected from fire, lured Prahlad onto the flames of a pyre on Hiranyakashyap's instructions.</p>
        
            <p>Many Hindus believe Prahlad's unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu - whose one of the incarnation is Krishna - saved him from the flames, while Holika met her demise.</p>

            <p>Kalasamvara Das, president of the Sri Sri Radha-Giridhari Temple that sits on the Hare Krishna premises, said the event had been held at the site in Kumeu for seven years.</p>
        
            <p>"The significance of the festival is that people [of different denominations, race or religion] can come together and have a great time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone started to look the same after covering each other in various colours while celebrating Holi and, as a result, their differences disappear, Das said.</p>
        
            <p>"The feedback I get from attendees is that they have never seen so many people smile at one place," Das said.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told participants at the event that it was important to embrace diversity.</p>
        
            <p>"In a world where we need a lot more unity and tolerance of diversity, it's great to see it happening here this afternoon," Luxon said, thanking the South Asian diaspora for its contributions to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Harinam Ruci Sankirtan, which tours countries to raise awareness about the Hare Krishna movement, attended the event as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We come here every year and plan to attend the Holi celebrations at Vrindavan this year," one of the members of the group said.</p>

            <p>Vrindavan is a town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where, according to legend, Krishna played Holi with Radha.</p>
        
            <p>The city hosts one of the biggest annual Holi festivals in the world, which last for almost a week.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile in Auckland, organisers emphasised on the diverse nature of participation at the event.</p>
        
            <p>Alan, who moved to New Zealand from Columbia last year, came with his family and experienced Indian culture for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>"We never got to play Holi back home. [It's] our first Festival of Colours," he said. "I am so glad we came. The people, the culture - it's amazing."</p>

            <p>Sumeet Verma, who hails from the Indian state of Punjab and has lived in Auckland for seven years, enjoyed the atmosphere of the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"I came here in 2019," he said. "Attending the festival after so many years is wonderful."</p>
        
            <p>Several celebrations are being planned nationwide to mark Holi over the next month.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga will celebrate Holi on 8 March, while Selwyn in Canterbury and Hamilton will mark the occasion on 9 March.</p>
        
            <p>Additional celebrations will be held in Wellington, Christchurch as well as Auckland, with organisers finalising the dates and logistics.</p>
