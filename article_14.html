            <p>The 26-year-old woman reported missing from West Auckland last week has been found dead.</p>
        
            <p>Te Atatū resident Monica Reid disappeared on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, police said they had found Reid deceased.</p>
        
            <p>Her death was not being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Police said her death would be referred to the coroner, and extended their sympathies to her family.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Reid's family described her as a "much-loved friend, sister and aunty of a large family".</p>
        
            <p>"All of us, we love Monica so much," her sister Cecilia told Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"Monica, if you are out there, know that I love you, we love you, and we just want to know you are safe."</p>
