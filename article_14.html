            <p>The future of women's international rugby is looking bright with another pinnacle event being added to the calendar and that has some young players excited.</p>
        
            <p>This week it was confirmed that the inaugural British and Irish Lions women's team will tour New Zealand in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>The WXV competition started last year with three global divisions, while the 2025 World Cup will involve 16 teams... four more than took part in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Island players have made their mark in the New Zealand game for some time and that is growing dramatically in the women's game.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one-year-old Liana Mikaele-Tu'u has been a part of the Black Ferns set-up since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"It's real exciting to think about the growth of the game and hopefully by that time of the tour we are still playing," Mikaele-Tu'u told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a lot of young talent. and to think about the years ahead with our careers is very promising."</p>
        
            <p>Having grown up and started her rugby career in Hawke's Bay, Mikaele-Tu'u is now with the Blues and is set to become a regular starter for the national side.</p>
        
            <p>The Lefagoalii and Sinamoga player was also a key player in the World Cup 2021 team.</p>
        
            <p>"To accomplish something so early in my career is something I will never forget."</p>

            <p>In two years' time the loose-forward will be gunning to solidify her position in the World Cup team in England.</p>
        
            <p>However, for now she wants to focus on, "enjoying the game and be at my best".</p>
        
            <p>"I'd love to be the best player in the world to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Mikaele-Tu'u said she was proud of her Samoan heritage and acknowledged that she inspired the younger generation, especially the Pasifika community.</p>
        
            <p>"To think that I can inspire at least one Samoan kid in New Zealand is a blessing. It is important to show the kids there is more to labour work."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Rugby's head of women's high performance, Hannah Porter, said including the Pacific countries in an international tour among other elite teams was a possibility in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always [at] the forefront of our minds in regards of what our competitions look like and making sure we include and grow that part of the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there will be lots of opportunities whether that is in the domestic competition or within an international setting."</p>
        
            <p>Mikaele-Tu'u said "exposure to more high-quality competitions is what our little Pacific nations need".</p>
        
            <p>"If you think about it the All Blacks, Black Ferns are made up of mostly Pacific nations."</p>
        
            <p>Before her career ends, Mikaele-Tu'u said she would like to represent her homeland Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>"I would love to play for Samoa before I retire, and I would like to see them in the same competition we are blessed to play in."</p>
        
            <p>The next competition for New Zealand's top rugby players is Super Rugby Aupiki which starts on 2 March.</p>
