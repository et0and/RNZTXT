            <p>Former South Africa rugby international Hannes Strydom has died in a car accident. He was 58.</p>
        
            <p>Stydom was part of the Springbok team that famously won the 1995 Rugby World Cup after the end of apartheid in 1994.</p>
        
            <p>He started the final where the home side defeated New Zealand 15-12 to take the crown in front of a beaming Nelson Mandela at Ellis Park.</p>
        
            <p>Strydom gained 21 Springbok caps in his career between 1993 and 1997.</p>
        
            <p>Former teammate and close friend Kobus Wiese told local media that details of the accident were still vague, but the vehicle Strydom was travelling in collided with a minibus taxi.</p>
        
            <p>The accident took place on Sunday near the coal mining town of Emalahleni in Mpumalanga province.</p>
        
            <p>South African Rugby Union President Mark Alexander hailed Strydom as "one of the heroes of our local game" in the Springboks' tribute to him.</p>
        
            <p>His former club, the Lions, also paid tribute to him, describing him as a legend who had formed a formidable lock combination with Wiese.</p>
        
            <p>"We share a tight bond as members of the 1995 group and to lose yet another one of our brothers is a big blow," said Lions Rugby Company chief executive officer Rudolf Straeuli.</p>
        
            <p>Strydom made his debut for the Springboks in 1993, and helped defeat arch-rivals New Zealand 15-12 in the 1995 World Cup final in Johannesburg - the biggest sporting event in South Africa after the end of apartheid.</p>

            <p>He ended his Springbok career in 1997 after playing in the British and Irish Lions series.</p>
        
            <p>Strydom also captained the Lions team that hoisted the local Currie Cup trophy in 1999.</p>
        
            <p>He made 115 appearances for the team between 1993 and 2000.</p>
        
            <p>Outside rugby, Strydom worked as a pharmacist in the capital, Pretoria, and started pharmacy chain Pharma Valu after hanging up his boots.</p>
        
            <p>In 2014, he suffered a cracked skull and stab wounds after six people attacked him in a carjacking, landing him in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>He is the fifth player from the 1995 Springbok team to have died.</p>
        
            <p>The others include Ruben Kruger in 2010, Joost van der Westhuizen in 2017, and Chester Williams and James Small in 2019. Coach Kitch Christie also died in 1998.</p>
