            <p>Wellington Water could bring a decommissioned 113-year-old dam back into service to increase future water supply.</p>
        
            <p>The 164-metre-long Morton Dam was built between 1908 and 1911 in the Lower Hutt suburb of Wanuiomata, and was decommissioned in 1988.</p>
        
            <p>Heritage New Zealand proposed listing the piece of infrastructure as a Category B heritage site in March, but that proposal was put on hold when it was discovered that Wellington Water was considering reinstating the dam.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water told RNZ they'd recently completed a "comprehensive water supply strategy update" which looked at options for long term supply and demand in the region beyond the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>One of the options was recommissioning the Morton Dam to to help meet demand from a growing population.</p>
        
            <p>Further investigations into the options are required and are slated for the coming years.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it will be likely a decade or more before any decisions are reached, and it could not say how much bringing the dam back into service would cost.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider told RNZ that alongside providing advice for councils' long term plans, it was important to consider increased demand on supply in the longer term.</p>
        
            <p>In Hutt City Council's draft long term plan, it allocated $1.5 billion for drinking, storm and wastewater infrastructure over the next 10 years.</p>
