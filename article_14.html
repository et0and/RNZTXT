            <p>Super Rugby is back for 2024, with a fresh look and a commitment to running rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The fifth of our New Zealand team previews assesses the Highlanders.</p>
        
            <p>Another year, another rebuild? It certainly seems that way for the Highlanders, whose entire identity is built on taking in the inexperienced, too experienced and other assorted offcuts. Even for them, though, this is a new look team that will be fun to watch - for fans of either side playing because all of their games will probably involve quite a few tries.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke Dermody returns as coach, where he very well might be on some sort of stipulation to get results after a couple of lean years in charge. Billy Harmon takes over as captain, he certainly was one of the Highlanders' success stories last year and his tireless form saw him propelled into the All Black conversation.</p>

            <p>The Highlanders' pre-season form has been really encouraging, with big wins over the Hurricanes and Crusaders. There is plenty of incentive there for players like new signings Jacob Ratumaituvuki-Kneepkens and Timoci Tavatavanawai to use this as a showcase for themselves, Forsyth Barr Stadium is a fast track known for producing excellent games so there will be space to run. Jamie Joseph is back on the coaching staff, his presence has no doubt meant some seriously tough training sessions, while the addition of Welshman Rhys Patchell should hopefully unlock an exciting backline.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, pre-season results do not really mean much to anyone else, and it is unlikely a lot of the Crusaders team they beat will be seen again during the Super Rugby season. Aaron Smith is gone, with him goes the experience of the second-most capped NZ Super Rugby player ever. Shannon Frizell decided to play his best rugby last year and then leave as well, but really the fact that even with those players the Highlanders still could not make the extremely generous playoff picture last year will be the biggest concern. If the return is worse this year then NZ Rugby should probably think about dropping them down to the NPC.</p>

            <p>"The pre-season has been going awesome. There are a lot of new guys in, a lot of young guys who are keen, and there's good energy. The coaches have done an excellent job setting up our environment and standards, which has shown in how we've started the year. We can keep building on that." - Billy Harmon</p>
        
            <p>"Billy leads by his actions - especially on the field. He's very measured around his delivery of messages and he's really calm, which is hugely important. He's one of our best players on the field and well respected by the team from what he did last year, and I know he's looking forward to leading the team again." - Clarke Dermody</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth Barr is the best stadium in the country, but it is also a microcosm of what Dunedin actually is. Down one end is the 'zoo', an apt name for what is portrayed as youthful, vibrant exuberance - but in reality, is just a bunch of transient teenagers getting so wasted their nights end in vomit, poor decisions and general regret. Surrounding this hot mess are the actual citizens of Dunedin, watching on and grimly accepting that without the university and its horde of drunks their town would be little more than a seedy port for illegal fishing trawlers. You have to hand it to Highlanders folks though, they know full well their only title win was a complete fluke so at least they are honest.</p>

            <p>Basically, every traditional NZ derby game the Highlanders play is crucial, even one win over a team forced to rest its All Blacks will be vital to their playoff chances. But in order for that to mean anything, they need to put away the other opposition: rounds seven to 10 are games against the Rebels, Reds, Force and Moana Pasifika and the Highlanders have to be targeting four solid wins there.</p>
