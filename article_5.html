            <p>The Defence Force says the operation to remove fuel from the sunken survey ship off Samoa should begin on 16 December.</p>
        
            <p>The Manawanui sank in October when the crew did not take it off autopilot in time and it hit a reef.</p>
        
            <p>Defence leaders told a scrutiny session by a select committee at Parliament on Tuesday afternoon that the fuel salvage was getting into place.</p>
        
            <p>"We're advised by the salvage company that the process to extract the oil ... will take around 20 days," chief of the Defence Force, Tony Davies, told MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Bad weather or other complicating factors could push that out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the session, Defence Minister Judith Collins rejected a suggestion by Labour's Peeni Henare that villagers near the site were unhappy at lack of support from the Navy and lack of action on the salvage.</p>
        
            <p>Henare said he heard from sources on the ground, at the site on the south coast of Upulo.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the navy had been "scrupulous" and "exemplary" in their behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The navy did not ask for this, and no one set out to sink it, but "clearly a few people have had a terrible day's" work, Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was not a tragedy, because 75 body bags did not come home, she added.</p>
        
            <p>The offshore patrol vessel Otago is now getting ready to head out to pick up on Manawanui's job.</p>
        
            <p>The navy would go back out "with our tails up, not down", the minister said.</p>
