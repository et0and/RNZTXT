            <p>The Prime Minister is standing by Erica Stanford after she called an opposition MP a "stupid bitch" in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford apologised in Parliament to her Labour counterpart Jan Tinetti on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon said it was not appropriate behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>But he was standing by his Education Minister saying she'd apologised and was doing a great job.</p>
        
            <p>"She's a great minister, she's doing an awesome job, she's got my support," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"She apologised for what was inappropriate behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said she realised straight away what she'd said was wrong and apologised to the House, Tinetti, and him.</p>
