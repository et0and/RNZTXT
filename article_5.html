            <p>A meeting between the coalition government and iwi leaders was positive, constructive and very direct, the Prime Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon, alongside ACT's David Seymour and New Zealand First's Shane Jones, met with the leaders of more than 74 iwi at a closed hui in Kerikeri on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media afterwards, Luxon said there was good conversation about a Treaty Principles Bill, and iwi leaders raised several issues.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon insisted there was no intention to take the bill beyond the first reading, as part of the coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>He said differences of opinion were acknowledged but overall there was goodwill on both sides.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi leaders and government would not agree on everything, Luxon said, but both parties were already thinking about how they could work together.</p>
        
            <p>One example was fast-track consenting.</p>
        
            <p>"So rest assured ... don't just react to the language you may have seen about fast-track consenting. The reality is we are going to uphold Treaty settlements and that's not at risk here. But we do need to find a way to build more infrastructure across this country, get water storage happening up here, to get better roading, so we can improve prosperity for everybody."</p>
        
            <p>He said another example was how poor rates of school attendance among Māori children was the responsibility of both iwi and the government.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Minister for Maori-Crown Relations Tama Potaka doubled down on calling Seymour the Crown's representative from Ngāti Rēhia during the opening remarks of the hui, which media were able to observe.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka spoke for the government.</p>
        
            <p>His comments about Seymour did not impress kaumātua Kipa Munro, who stood to interrupt him, telling the crowd that whatever Māori think of Seymour or his policies, he was still a Ngāti Rēhia descendant.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka denied he got it wrong, insisting he was following pōwhiri protocol.</p>
