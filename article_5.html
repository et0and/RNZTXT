            <p>Li said many products from New Zealand, including kiwifruit and Rockit apples, were popular with Chinese people.</p>
        
            <p>He said he would encourage Chinese scientific institutes to co-operate further with their New Zealand counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of Chinese people had stood outside the institute in heavy rain to welcome Li upon his arrival.</p>
        
            <p>Premier Li is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit New Zealand in seven years.</p>
        
            <p>The trip coincides with the 10-year anniversary of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>Li received an official welcome on Thursday before a formal meeting at Government House in Wellington, where a range of topics were discussed, including bilateral trade and human rights.</p>
        
            <p>The visit also comes against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions.</p>
