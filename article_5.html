        <h2>'Minister for the tobacco industry': Health advocates slam proposed tax freeze</h2>
        <p>
Former Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said Casey Costello needed to clear the air, while others are calling for her resignation.

            <p>Anti-smoking advocates and politicians are taking aim at Associate Health Minister Casey Costello after RNZ revealed she was looking into a three-year freeze on a tobacco tax.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, tobacco excise is increased each year in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). RNZ has learned Costello is proposing a three-year freeze on CPI-related excise increases for smoked tobacco.</p>
        
            <p>But when RNZ put that to her in an interview, Costello said she had not looked at it.</p>
        
            <p>Former Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said Costello needed to clear the air about what was going on.</p>
        
            <p>"Her story doesn't add up. There's a discrepancy between her claim that she did not seek specific advice on stopping the inflation adjustment tobacco excise and reporting by RNZ that she signed off a decision paper asking for that advice.</p>
        
            <p>"So she needs to come clean, release the paper in question, and clear the matter up."</p>
        
            <p>Health Coalition Aotearoa co-chairperson Boyd Swinburn said Costello needed to be stripped of her duties.</p>
        
            <p>"Casey Costello has lost all credibility as an Associate Minister of Health. Everything she has done to date is anti-health - in fact she is acting more like a minister for the tobacco industry," Swinburn said.</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister needs to take urgent action to restore credibility to this portfolio."</p>

            <p>Director of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) Ben Youden said the proposal simply did not make much sense.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the finance minister has stated last year that tobacco tax is an important revenue, it seems odd that a freeze on excise tax would be on the table."</p>
        
            <p>However, Youden said prices on tobacco needed to walk a fine line between deterring smokers and not financially hindering those addicted.</p>
        
            <p>Costello has also proposed removing the excise tax from smokeless tobacco products, where the tobacco is heated to a vapour rather than burned.</p>
