            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Takutai Tarsh Kemp has been diagnosed with kidney disease and will be taking leave from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The party made the announcement in a post on Instagram, saying Kemp, the MP for Tāmaki Makaurau, had been feeling unwell and underwent thorough testing.</p>

            <p>"I am optimistic about my recovery and look forward to returning with renewed energy to continue the fight against this government and for our communities, our whānau, our Mokopuna and Te Tiriti o Waitangi," Kemp wrote.</p>
        
            <p>She will take leave from Parliament for six weeks to focus on her health and wellbeing, including starting a treatment plan today.</p>
        
            <p>Kemp said she is optimistic about her recovery and she is grateful for the unwavering support of her whānau, party leaders and colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>Kemp won Tāmaki Makaurau by a slim margin of just four votes over Labour MP Peeni Henare in last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>Kemp was last year the chief executive of Manurewa Marae, where staff are facing allegations that census data was used to help Te Pāti Māori's election campaign.</p>
