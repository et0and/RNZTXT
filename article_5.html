            <p>Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins has died during a charity event in central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Collins was taking part in a ChildFund charity run in central Auckland on Wednesday when he collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The event, near Britomart, was to support local communities in the Pacific.</p>

            <p>Collins was married and a father of two. Born and raised in south Auckland's Ōtara, his parents had come to New Zealand from Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>He spent three terms in Auckland Council, serving as the chairperson of the Ōtara-Papatoetoe Local Board and as Manukau ward councillorm before he unsucessfully stood for Auckland's mayor in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Collins recently switched his allegiance from Labour to the Green Party and was elected into Parliament at the last election.</p>
        
            <p>A staunch advocate for the poor, he said he was "elated and humbled" to be elected after being ranked eleventh on the party list.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the Green Party co-leaders confirmed Collins collapsed while taking part in the ChildFund Water Run, saying the news came as a "profound shock to everyone".</p>
        
            <p>"Our absolute priority is to Efeso's wife and young girls."</p>
        
            <p>They said the onsite medical team immediately went to Collins' aid and did everything they could to revive him.</p>
        
            <p>"Efeso devoted his life to serving and making a difference to the lives of those he met, including his constituents, colleagues, friends, and family. He held the deepest respect of the members of all political parties and communities."</p>

            <p>A white sheet was put up outside Britomart before a black tent was eventually erected. Two ambulances originally attended the scene before leaving.</p>
        
            <p>Attendees at the charity event could be seen consoling each other and stood around holding hands and singing waiata. Others could be seen praying.</p>

            <p>Tributes have started pouring in from across the political spectrum and wider community.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party issued a statement in which they said they were devestated.</p>
        
            <p>Leader Chris Hipkins said he first met Collins in 1999 and had a "deep respect" for him.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters tweeted that his thoughts were with Collins' family after his "untimely and tragic passing".</p>
        
            <p>Fellow mayoral candidate Leo Malloy said he was at the event with Collins on Wednesday morning and "had a laugh" with him.</p>
        
            <p>"Efeso was a remarkable man, we didn't agree politically, but as a person, and an orator, he was without peer. A beautiful kind man gone far too soon," he posted on X.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Richard Hills, who served on the council with Collins, also posted on X and said everyone was shocked.</p>
        
            <p>"Devastated for Fia and his girls. He loved them so much, and he spoke about them at every opportunity. I can't even comprehend this. A life of service until the end."</p>
        
            <p>Parliamentary select committees were suspended Wednesday morning after some MPs were seen to be visibly shaken.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament was expected to meet as scheduled at 2pm on Wednesday afternoon, but was likely to be suspended for the rest of the day.</p>
        
            <p>The last MP to die during their term was Labour's Parekura Horomia in 2013.</p>
