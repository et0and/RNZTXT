            <p>Massey University says its Singapore campus will provide education services to students who do not want to study in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Massey signed an agreement with education provider PSB Academy on Tuesday, confirming its plan to set up a branch in Singapore.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, on a week-long trip in South East Asia, was at the signing event and expressed his support.</p>
        
            <p>"This collaboration reflects the shared commitment of New Zealand and Singapore to advance education and foster global partnerships," he said.</p>

            <p>Vice-Chancellor Professor Jan Thomas said sharing expertise and meeting the needs of a broader market were priorities for Massey.</p>
        
            <p>"Singapore is an important established market, which makes it a logical base for expansion into the Southeast Asian market, and beyond.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been teaching in Singapore since 2008 and Massey has an excellent reputation there, and across Southeast and Southern Asia," Thomas added.</p>
        
            <p>The university was expanding its offerings to include media, design and management, among other courses, Thomas said.</p>
        
            <p>The Tertiary Education Union has previously criticised Massey setting up a campus in Singapore when it was also cutting hundreds of local jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about job cuts, Thomas said it was important to diversify Massey's income.</p>
        
            <p>"Our role as a university is to both make sure we are fit for our future, adapting to our future, and also diversifying our income so that we aren't completely dependant on government funding. As you know that is under pressure in New Zealand, for all of our universities."</p>
        
            <p>Massey aims to enrol 5000 offshore students by 2026, with Singapore being a key contributor.</p>
