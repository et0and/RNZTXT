            <p>Tech experts say problems with Parliament's website that stopped people from submitting on the Treaty Principles Bill may come down to cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>People have expressed frustration and outrage this week, after persisent technical issues stopped them from giving online feedback before the midnight Wednesday deadline.</p>
        
            <p>MPs will meet to discusss allowing late submissions Thursday morning, though bigger questions about the state of Parliament's tech infrastructure remain.</p>
        
            <p>Consultant Louisa Taylor has about two decades' of experience in the tech field and said the errors she observed on the website could be caused by two things.</p>
        
            <p>"One is that there's high traffic on their website which has taken it out of action because they haven't prepared enough server capacity. That's the negligent part of it."</p>
        
            <p>"The second part was that the same sort of error might come from an attack. If a nefarious actor sent a lot of traffic to the site they could actually take it down."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said whatever the cause, Parliament's tech infrastructure clearly wasn't up to scratch and it could be down to the coalition's cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>"It was highly foreseeable that there would be a large number of submissions so the server needed to be sized. They just needed to get more machinery, more kit, ready."</p>
        
            <p>Another tech expert Sam Sehnert said it was "mind-boggling" Parliament's website wasn't up to handling high volumes of traffic and any investment made would be worthwhile.</p>
        
            <p>"It does take some time to set up but as you can see the value of doing that is well worth it and usually it's a result of cutting corners or trying to save a buck.</p>
        
            <p>"If you do that sort of thing, you cut those corners, then outages like this can happen."</p>
        
            <p>It's not clear how many people were affected by techincal problems but RNZ has seen evidence they could date back to late November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Back then, a submitter emailed their feedback to Parliament, flagging they had experienced problems with the official submissions portal.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ approached both the government and the Clerk of the House to ask what went wrong with the website and if it was connected to the coalition's cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>The government referred RNZ to a statement provided by the Clerk David Wilson, who said Parliament did attempt to prepare for the busy period.</p>
        
            <p>"The Office of the Clerk is aware that the unprecedented volume of submissions being made simultaneously caused issues for the Parliament website and submission portal.</p>
        
            <p>"While we anticipated a high volume of submissions, and had made improvements to deal with them within the constraints of the current architecture, the amount of traffic was even greater than expected."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said his office was not required to make any savings from its baseline during Budget 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Among those affected by the technical issues was Wellingtonian Peter McKenzie, who filled out all the fields before the vital second part of his submission disappeared when he submitted it.</p>
        
            <p>"It basically contradricted what I'd said in the first part which was why I didn't think the bill was appropriate given the way Māori have been treated."</p>
        
            <p>He called the helpline but had no luck.</p>
        
            <p>"The message said basically they were effectively out of the office at that time of day so I left them a message saying can somebody please call me back because I'm not happy at what's happened.</p>
        
            <p>"And I'll give you until 11.59pm which is when the thing closes and then I'll go to the news."</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie said it was incredibly frustrating.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a trust issue now with it. Was this deliberatly slanted so it would support the bill? That was the thinking I went through on Tuesday night which is why I was so angry with them.</p>
        
            <p>"Thinking you're misrepresenting my views deliberately with the system you're using."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori, Labour, the Greens and the ACT Party all support extending the submissions deadline to allow for give those who missed out on giving feedback another chance.</p>
        
            <p>MPs on the Justice Committee will meet via Zoom at 9am Thursdya to discusss next steps for the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>"In light of the technical issues receiving submissions online, the meeting will include decisions about how we treat emailed submissions (which aren't normally accepted), whether we re-open submissions and for how long, and how we treat late submissions from people who could not submit due to the website issues," committee chair James Meager said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would expect that anybody who tried to make a submission before the deadline, but was unable to do so due to technical reasons, will be given the opportunity to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"This is happened in the past when other technical issues have prevented submissions being made. We are treating this as we would any other bill so I don't see why it would be any different here."</p>
