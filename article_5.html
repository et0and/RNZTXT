            <p>Canterbury's regional council has added its voice to opposition to the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Canterbury (ECan) voted by 12-4 on Wednesday, 11 December, to make a submission to the Justice Select Committee, calling on the government to abandon the bill.</p>
        
            <p>The bill, which seeks to redefine the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, was introduced to Parliament last month, with submissions closing on 7 January.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Ian Mackenzie, John Sunckell, Nick Ward and David East voted against the submission presented by staff, dismissing it as ''political''.</p>
        
            <p>Sunckell said he had ''no sympathy'' for the bill, but believed making the submission would ''inflame'' the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Mackenzie said the council had a partnership with Ngāi Tahu and he did not think it was ''dependent on whether this bill goes forward''.</p>
        
            <p>North Canterbury councillors Claire McKay and Grant Edge backed the submission.</p>
        
            <p>But McKay said she shared Sunckell's concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Edge said Te Tiriti o Waitangi is ''a partnership of shared values''.</p>
        
            <p>Greg Byrnes agreed it was a political decision, but ''staying silent is not staying neutral''.</p>
        
            <p>''We are politicians, like it or not.''</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Craig Pauling said not speaking up was not an option for him.</p>
        
            <p>''Are we political? I'm pretty sure we are politicians. Every decision we make is political.</p>
        
            <p>''There are many times in human history where people should have said something, and they didn't.</p>
        
            <p>''I don't believe that speaking out on this issue will inflame the situation - instead, our submission provides clarity and gives our view.''</p>
        
            <p>Pauling said ECan's submission highlighted the absence of consultation with Māori during the development of the bill.</p>
        
            <p>He said the bill limited flexibility, and did not appear to take into account progress achieved through years of good-faith dialogue and collaboration in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>''People have mentioned that our partnership should be strong enough to remain, should the bill be passed into law,'' Pauling said.</p>
        
            <p>''But it is hard to make a partnership work when one partner's rights have been diminished.</p>
        
            <p>''Partnerships have to be mutually beneficial, or it just won't work.''</p>
        
            <p>Pauling said the Bill would likely result in increased costs to undo ''operational efficiencies'' achieved through the partnership approach.</p>
        
            <p>The submission also warned of a likely increase in litigation costs as councils, stakeholders and the judiciary grapple with interpreting and applying the new principles.</p>
