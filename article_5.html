            <p>Legislation making stalking a crime punishable by up to five years in prison has passed its first reading in Parliament, under urgency.</p>
        
            <p>It lists behaviours like recording or tracking someone, following them, or loitering near them. Three of those within a year would lead to a conviction.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation, introduced by Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith, also resembles a member's bill previously submitted by Labour's Ginny Andersen after the death of 21-year-old Aucklander Farzana Yaqubi, who was threatened and stalked for weeks before being stabbed to death.</p>
        
            <p>She had complained to police via the 105 reporting system and made a formal statement in the month of her death, but her complaint had not been progressed.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation was supported by all parties.</p>
        
            <p>It would now go for consultation at select committee, with Goldsmith encouraging anyone who had been affected by stalking to have their say.</p>
        
            <p>"Existing harassment laws haven't kept pace with trends in this dangerous area," Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since I announced this bill, many victims and advocates have talked about the need to have this law in place as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Four other amendments would also be made to support the new offence:</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said it came as part of the government's commitment to ensuring there were 20,000 fewer victims of serious violent crime by 2029.</p>
        
            <p>He had in June committed to introducing such legislation by the end of 2024, having previously only committed to doing so before the next election.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Goldsmith said every New Zealander deserved to feel safe in their community, and the government was determined to ensuring victims were at the heart of the justice system.</p>
        
            <p>"The public is clearly concerned about stalking, and we are moving quickly to create a new stalking and harassment offence as part of our plan to restore law and order," he said.</p>
