            <p>Parliament's Speaker has referred Te Pāti Māori MP Tākuta Ferris to the Privileges Committee.</p>
        
            <p>The referral relates to comments Ferris made during last week's general debate.</p>
        
            <p>"A knowledge gap is a dangerous thing," the MP for Te Tai Tonga told the House last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It allows lies to be presented as truths. Politicians call this obfuscation-the art of making something unclear, intentionally vague, ambiguous, to conceal or obscure the truth, to confuse others.</p>
        
            <p>"Lies, in other words. Many in this House are masters of it, and it is a disservice to those who voted you into your positions."</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's rules forbid MPs from calling each other liars.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon, Gerry Brownlee said he had received a letter from New Zealand First MP Jamie Arbuckle that said the comments raised a matter of privilege.</p>
        
            <p>"Following a point of order alleging that he had called members liars, Mr Ferris replied to me, "I haven't made that statement"," the speaker said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an apparent inconsitency between Mr Ferris' speech and his response to the point of order about it.</p>
        
            <p>"The offence of calling another member a liar has long been regarded as an offence against the House, which operates on the basis that members behave truthfully and honourably.</p>
        
            <p>"That would normally be dealt with as a matter of order. However, in denying that he made the statement it is possible that Mr Ferris has himself deliberately misled the House."</p>
        
            <p>Brownlee referred Ferris to the Privileges Committee.</p>
