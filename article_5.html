            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has named six people Knights or Dames as part of the New Year Honours list.</p>
        
            <p>They include Dames Julie Chapman, Ingrid Collins (Ngāti Porou) and Lydia Ko, along with Sirs John Gallagher, Ted Manson, and Peter Skelton.</p>
        
            <p>They are among 190 people who received recognition in the honours list this year.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Julie had dedicated her life to others through founding KidsCan Trust - which supports children in poverty - and Pet Refuge, which takes in pets from homes affected by domestic violence, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Her work with numerous other charities including Women's Refuge and Victim Support has made New Zealand a kinder place for our most vulnerable."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Ingrid Collins had been knighted for services to Māori, business, and health governance.</p>
        
            <p>"Dame Ingrid Collins has contributed 50 years of governance to Whangara B5 and has been Chair of the Whangara Farms partnership since inception in 2006. It is regarded as an exemplar of best practice, sustainability and innovation for Māori land development," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Her contribution is significant."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said there was no other golfer as successful as Dame Lydia.</p>
        
            <p>"She was such a trailblazer that, aged 27, she was the youngest player ever inducted into the LPGA Hall of Fame. Her list of successes is unprecedented, and New Zealand is extremely proud of her."</p>

            <p>Sir John Gallagher's appointment reflected continued service as a philanthropist, community leader and major shareholder and director of Gallagher Holdings, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"His service to Habitat for Humanity spans 25 years and the Gallagher Charitable Trust continues to benefit the community. The Waikato, and New Zealand, have benefited greatly from the Gallagher family's service," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Ted was being recognised for his charitable work.</p>
        
            <p>"Through his company TCLM, he provides vans for schools to enable thousands of students to participate in excursions. He established the School Ready Programme which provides targeted teaching resources for new entrant classes, with the aim of lifting children's social and learning skills.</p>
        
            <p>"He pioneered in-school counselling and wellbeing services, currently provided in 10 schools for more than 4500 students, and seeing a dramatic improvement in school attendance, discipline and academic results. New Zealand needs more outstanding citizens such as Sir Ted."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Peter Skelton's inclusion was in recognition of his work in environmental law.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Peter has been a key player in the development of Christchurch's post-earthquake Land Use Recovery Plan and has been heavily involved in the Canterbury Water Strategy," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was also instrumental in establishing the Resource Management Law Association in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was a better place because of the contributions of all 190 recipients, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst I cannot name every person included on this Honours list, I thank them for their service," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would also like to make special mention that this Honours list includes some of those who fought for others who suffered abuse in care. The courage it takes to fight for justice after suffering so much themselves is not only deserving of an honour but needs acknowledging."</p>
