            <p>Former Labour MP and mayor of Auckland's North Shore City Ann Hartley has died.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the family posted on social media that Hartley died Friday surrounded by family.</p>
        
            <p>Hartley was the first mayor of the newly created North Shore City in 1989, and went on to be elected to Parliament in 1999, winning the Northcote Electorate.</p>
        
            <p>Hartley went on to be the Deputy Speaker and Assistant Speaker and a member of multiple committees.</p>
        
            <p>She left Parliament in 2008 and served on the North Shore City Council.</p>
        
            <p>"Ann was the shining light of our family, we were all so proud of her endless support for social justice, advocating for community and her dedication to public service," her family said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Ann was selfless and spent her life making the country a better place for Ann's family, her loved ones and all who call New Zealand home."</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, she was named to the Queen's Service Order for "services to local government and the community."</p>
        
            <p>North Shore councillor Richard Hills paid tribute to Hartley on social media, calling her a "hugely influential person in my life".</p>
        
            <p>"Having Ann as a friend was like having an encyclopaedia of politics and community, we would talk for hours at her home or on the phone about strategy and plans to get the best for our community.</p>
        
            <p>"She worked hard to knock down doors and break ceilings for women and families, she worked hard for equality and equity in all her roles. She was one of the first woman mayors in Auckland, the first mayor for North Shore and she was the first woman deputy speaker when she was a Labour MP.</p>
        
            <p>Hills said Hartley was committed to what she believed in.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a fighter, a passionate campaigner and focused on investing in young people, the environment and public transport.</p>
        
            <p>"She did receive nasty attacks from her opponents over the years but always rose above it. I've even seen people in her swearing at her because she dared to say we needed the unitary plan to provide more housing for young people and future generations in places like Northcote and Takapuna."</p>
        
            <p>Arthur Schenck of Hamilton, who lived in Auckland's North Shore, had known Hartley for more than 20 years ever since she witnessed his application for New Zealand citizenship and later when he went on to volunteer for Labour himself.</p>
        
            <p>"I respected her precisely because she wasn't just a politician, she was more of an advocate for the community, and was always looking for ways to get government, local or central, to do more for the people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are very few like her."</p>

            <p>A private family funeral is being held but a public memorial is planned for 14 February at the Northcote Rugby Club, the family said.</p>
        
            <p>"People everywhere have a story to tell me about how Ann helped them or how her actions got something over the line for them," Hills said.</p>
