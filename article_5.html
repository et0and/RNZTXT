        <h2>Possible new chief science advisor for PM won't be announced until 2025</h2>
        <p>
The significant job vacancy has been causing concern in the science world since Christopher Luxon has refused to confirm when, or if, a new advisor will be appointed.

            <p>A review of the government's science, innovation, and technology sector, including the role of the prime minister's chief science advisor, is due in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Christopher Luxon told RNZ both the review findings and any appointment of a new advisor would be made public at that time.</p>
        
            <p>The official website for the advisor's office has been archived since late October.</p>
        
            <p>In June, the most recent advisor, Professor Dame Juliet Gerrard, finished her tenure which began in 2018 when she was appointed by Dame Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Sir Peter Gluckman held the role before then - he was appointed by Sir John Key in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>The significant job vacancy has been causing concern in the science world since Luxon has refused to confirm when, or if, a new advisor will be appointed.</p>
        
            <p>Simon Kingham was chief science advisor to the Ministry of Transport until May. He told Checkpoint the lack of hiring going on was "concerning".</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at it across the board and you look at the need for science and you look at some of the policies coming out of some of those agencies, it does look a little bit concerning."</p>
        
            <p>The Chief Science Advisor Forum remains in place, which is chaired by Dr Gill Jolly, the chief science advisor to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be really unfortunate if the prime minister didn't have a science advisor and my understanding is the prime minister said he wants one," Kingham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite why we haven't got one yet, I don't know."</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the coalition announced Dame Patsy Reddy, the former Governor-General, as the new chairperson of the Climate Change Commission.</p>
        
            <p>A press release from Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said Dame Patsy came to the role with an "extensive and distinguished career in law and governance" but there were no specific mentions of her climate or environment related experience, outside of being a trustee on the Malaghan Institute and the Aspen Institute New Zealand.</p>
