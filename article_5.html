        <h2>'Hōhā' with the government</h2>
        <p>
Listen: Māori MPs take aim at the government's policies and legislation.
</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Ngāpuhi representatives led a hīkoi to Parliament in opposition to the repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, 827 tamariki in state care whakapapa to Ngāpuhi.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāpuhi walked out of the National Iwi Chairs Forum, attended by the Prime Minister and a number of other government ministers, on Friday.</p>

            <p>Labour List MP in Northland, and spokesperson for children and youth, Willow-Jean Prime said Ngāpuhi are hōhā.</p>
        
            <p>"They are hōhā with policies and legislation that this government is driving and the impact that that is having on Māori, and included in that is, of course, the repeal of Section 7AA."</p>
        
            <p>"There are no Māori that have submitted to the select committee who have said, 'We support the repeal of Section 7AA', they are all opposed."</p>
        
            <p>On 29 July, 10 youth offenders, aged between 15 and 18, began at the government's new boot camp pilot in Te Papaioea - Palmerston North. Nine are Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Rangitāne Māori education expert Professor Meihana Durie, a descendant of Rangitāne from the hapū of Te Rangitepāia, was surprised about the lack of consultation with his hapū. Had consultation occurred, his hapū could have stated they believed other things could be done to better the lives of vulnerable rangatahi, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki acknowledged it should have engaged with mana whenua earlier, but remains committed to the programme, despite damning findings into the Whakapakari boot camp, and others raised in the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour said the pilot will be nothing like past boot camps and will be underpinned by intensive case management. </p>

            <p>Among those voicing their opposition to the pilot is Wellington Central MP, and Green Party spokesperson for justice and corrections, Tamatha Paul.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not environments that are going to help rangatahi to heal. They're not going to turn young people's lives around."</p>
        
            <p>Paul said there was a 100-page chapter dedicated to the abuse that was endured at boot camps in the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, and it was a slap in the face to survivors for the Minister to make a "very emotional" speech about the report, then go directly against their recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour was not available to be interviewed.</p>
