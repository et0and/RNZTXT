            <p>Consultation on open banking and open electricity has begun.</p>
        
            <p>Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly and Energy Minister Simeon Brown have now asked for feedback in both of those areas.</p>
        
            <p>Open banking was expected to be the first cab off the rank, with a view of it being operational by the end of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly said that was well before the target set by the recent Commerce Commission banking market study.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, banks and electricity companies are operating inside a walled garden," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"New entrants face high barriers to entry and as a result consumers do not benefit from innovative new products and services."</p>
        
            <p>Bayly said the government was seeking feedback about the development of regulations for open banking, while simultaneously asking for information on how a consumer data regime could be established for the electricity sector.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Brown emphasised the potential for open electricity to lower costs for households and businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Consumer NZ recently found that Kiwis saved an average of $524 per year by changing their electricity provider. But despite acute cost-of-living pressure, only 10 percent of households changed providers in the last 12 months."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said that showed the barriers for comparing plans and switching providers were too high.</p>
        
            <p>"Open electricity empowers consumers by making their electricity usage data more accessible, meaning consumers can better understand their unique needs and choose a plan that best suits their needs."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would also reduce electricity companies' ability to hide behind promotional campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>The government said in time, the intention was to also apply similar legislation to other sectors like insurance and telecommunications.</p>
