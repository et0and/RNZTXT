            <p>Access Matters Aotearoa want the government to withdraw the Accessibility for New Zealanders Bill, and draft a new bill that aligns more closely with the expectations of the disability sector.</p>
        
            <p>Its calling for minimum enforceable standards that would help address accessibility issues that impacts millions of New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Access Matters Aotearoa lead campaigner Juliana Carvalho said this would include being able to use all public transport, having closed captioning, sign language, audio descriptions, and allowing guide dogs to go anywhere.</p>

            <p>She said New Zealand is way behind other countries in terms of accessibility.</p>
        
            <p>"We want a bill that is fit for purpose, that will unleash the power and the potential of all individuals who have some sort of access needs," Carvalho said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she has heard from councils, businesses, and the community that they want to do the right thing, and want to make things accessible, but do not know how.</p>
        
            <p>Carvalho said having these accessibility standards would simplify it and make it easier for these groups to implement changes.</p>
        
            <p>She said all political parties were present and had a willingness to engage.</p>
        
            <p>"This year looks really promising," she said.</p>
