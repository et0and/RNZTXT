            <p>Deputy police commissioner Tania Kura has been appointed to the top job on an interim basis, while the government continues its search for a new police boss.</p>
        
            <p>Current commissioner Andrew Coster will step down from the role next month - finishing his term about six months early - to instead head up the new Social Investment Agency.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Tuesday morning, Police Minister Mark Mitchell said Kura would act in the position from 11 November until a permanent commissioner took over.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been working with Ms Kura for 12 months and I am confident she will provide the continuity of leadership the police service needs during this transitional period."</p>
        
            <p>This marks the first time a woman has held the top position in the police force, albeit in an interim capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Both Mitchell and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will recommend a new head of police after the Public Service Commission had carried out its recruitment process.</p>
        
            <p>The Governor-General will then appoint the successful applicant.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, Kura became the first female police officer to be appointed deputy commissioner. Most recently, she has been in charge of frontline operations, overseeing investigations and day-to-day policing across all 12 police districts.</p>
        
            <p>Kura joined the police in 1987. She has worked at the Royal New Zealand Police College and the districts of Canterbury, Southern, Central, Bay of Plenty, and Eastern in a variety of uniform and investigative and leadership positions.</p>
        
            <p>National had a turbulent relationship with the outgoing commissioner Coster. In opposition, Mitchell was openly critical of Coster's policing-by-consent model.</p>
        
            <p>In December, shortly after becoming police minister, Mitchell issued a "letter of expectation" to Coster and delayed expressing confidence in him.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, then-justice-spokesperson Simon Bridges called Coster a "wokester" and suggested he was soft on gangs.</p>
