About 35,000 people marched in September, protesting scaled back plans for the new Dunedin hospital, however critics still say they are still not being allowed access to crucial information.

            <p>The government has been accused of a "blatant disregard for transparency" as unanswered questions continue to mount while the South waits for a decision on the new Dunedin hospital.</p>
        
            <p>As weeks turn into months over the timing of the hospital announcement, dozens of Official Information Act requests have been declined or delayed.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year, the government announced a seismic shift to the hospital project, replacing it with either a scaled-back version or retro-fitting the existing hospital amid reports of budget blowouts.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Health Minister Dr Shane Reti and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop said a decision would be made "in a matter of weeks" and they received options from Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora (HNZ) for the $1.8 billion project in late December.</p>
        
            <p>The Otago Daily Times has made multiple OIA requests which have been rejected by Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand (HNZ) and Treasury.</p>
        
            <p>These include reports that have been made available to the government as part of its decision-making processes leading up the September announcements and data relating to the existing Dunedin Hospital, such as number of present ICU and ward and mental health beds.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the requests, which date back to as early as October last year, were declined on the basis the information would soon be published online.</p>
        
            <p>Months later, this has still not happened.</p>
        
            <p>Labour spokeswoman for health infrastructure Tracey McLellan said she had similar experiences with her own information requests about the hospital project.</p>
        
            <p>"Withholding information sought in October on the basis that it will be released soon - but then isn't - is totally unacceptable," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To add insult, the information that was recently released failed to address the specifics of my requests - is a blatant disregard for transparency."</p>
        
            <p>McLellan said she had been denied access to critical information on the basis it would be released soon.</p>
        
            <p>"Months later when information is eventually released, it fails to address the specifics of my request - this is a blatant attempt to hide information," she said.</p>
        
            <p>HNZ did not respond to criticism from McLellan, but said it anticipated documents relating to the new Dunedin hospital would be "proactively released soon".</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for ministers Reti and Bishop declined to comment on McLellan's accusations or whether ministers had been involved in discussions about when information on the hospital project would be released.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers stand by their commitment to make a decision as soon as is possible, because we all look forward to getting on with the job of delivering a great hospital for Dunedin and the South," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we have no updates at this time, we understand there is high interest from the community and will be making announcements in due course,"</p>
