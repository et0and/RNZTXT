            <p>Labour is criticising National for repudiating the contract to build new Cook Strait ferries without a back-up plan.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis halted the construction of two replacement ferries after the iReX project's budget blew out to nearly $3 billion in December.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail is still negotiating the exit from the $551 million contract signed with Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The government has considered buying second-hand or new, slightly smaller and not rail-enabled ferries instead - but has not yet made a decision.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Sunday, Labour's transport spokesperson Tangi Utikere said it was a complete failure.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just the beginning of the poor decision making this Government is becoming famous for."</p>
        
            <p>Utikere told RNZ this would not have happened under a Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we had a solution in place, we were working on that, what we would not have done is made the call that they've done without a plan B in place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still waiting to hear from the government what that plan is. They've told us that they want a resilient connection between the North and South Island, however their actions are showing that they're not serious about that right now."</p>
        
            <p>Utikere said, after nearly eight months of the coalition government being in power, it remains to be seen what it will do.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to wait, and as we do, the costs will continue to grow.</p>
        
            <p>"The consequences for Kiwis will be that they will have to wait more time and will mean that things like freight are going to be more expensive."</p>
