        <h2>Is $2b accommodation supplement just lining landlord pockets?</h2>

            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop says New Zealand rents are too high, but the evidence is mixed as to whether the accommodation supplement makes them higher.</p>
        
            <p>The government is undertaking a review of the housing supports available, including the supplement.</p>
        
            <p>It is paid, based on income, region of the country and housing costs, to lower-income households.</p>
        
            <p>In March this year, there were 360,279 households receiving the payment, up from 295,410 in March 2019.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2022/23 financial year, it cost the government $2.015 billion, up from $1.996b a year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said there were "good arguments" that the supplement pushed up rents, but also good arguments that it was an effective form of housing support for people who needed help.</p>
        
            <p>"All I can do is be guided by the economic evidence and it's pretty mixed that it drives higher rent."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had been "staggered" by the proliferation of funds across the system to help with housing. "We are taking a good look at all of them and looking at how they deliver value for money and trying to be clear and deliberate about what we are trying to accomplish."</p>
        
            <p>But he said rents were too high and the answer was to build more houses to address a supply and demand imbalance.</p>
        
            <p>Dominick Stephens, Treasury chief economic adviser, said it had not undertaken specific research on the impact of the supplement on rents.</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to research last year from the Housing Technical Working Group that said the main drivers of rent were income and housing supply relative to population.</p>
        
            <p>"One might draw a link from the research showing that rents are driven by incomes to the accommodation supplement, which boosts income for many tenants, but this would be a suggestive link only, not backed by specific research."</p>
        
            <p>Work by Motu Research in 2018 showed higher rents in the regions with more generous accommodation supplement entitlements, but an update in 2022 suggested less of a connection.</p>
        
            <p>Infometrics chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan said New Zealand studies tended to conflict with international ones.</p>
        
            <p>"The conclusions go against the common perception that the accommodation supplement simply ends up being an additional cash payment gobbled up by landlords through higher rents.</p>
        
            <p>"Economic theory states that any tax or subsidy will be borne or captured to some degree between producers - landlords in this case - and consumers - tenants in this case, but the specifics of who bears the cost or captures the subsidy depends on the dynamics of the market and the elasticity of demand and/or supply. Because demand and supply of rental housing are both very inelastic, it makes it difficult to theoretically determine where the incidence of the subsidy lies - hence the need for empirical studies."</p>
        
            <p>Economist Wasay Majid, of the University of Auckland, said research from the United Kingdom found reducing accommodation supplements led to overcrowding rather than lower rents.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the supplement needed to be more responsive to changes in rental expenses.</p>
        
            <p>"Means and asset testing disqualifies couples from the supplement if they have cash assets exceeding $16,200 - for singles, the limit is $8100. This is 1.75 percent of today's median house price, restricting a couple's ability to save for a mortgage deposit while receiving the supplement. This limit was around 17 percent of the median house price when it was last adjusted in 1988."</p>
