            <p>Just over half of students regularly attended school in term four last year, up on the same term in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh figures from the Ministry of Education show 53.6 percent of students met the criteria for regular attendance - present for more than 90 percent of the term.</p>
        
            <p>That was 3.5 percentage points higher than term 4 in 2022, but still 12.5 percentage points lower than the same term in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>All regions saw improved attendance, with the largest increase in Waikato - up 6.6 percentage points.</p>
        
            <p>There was an increase across all year levels too, and the trend of higher attendance between years 1 and 6 followed by a fall through intermediate and secondary years remained.</p>
        
            <p>Term four last year was the first not to be affected by Covid-19 health requirements, like self-isolation, since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>But sickness was still the main driver of non-attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"Comparisons to previous years are impacted by the government's Covid-19 response," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"In term four 2023, absences due to short-term illness/medical reasons declined for the first time since 2020, but remain higher than 2019."</p>
        
            <p>But the pandemic was still heavily influencing attendance, with messaging during that time reflecting an "abundance of caution", it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Post-pandemic, attendance messages need to balance caution with getting students back to school.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some learners with minor symptoms and mild anxiety who could and should be at school, but continue to miss school, which increases gaps in their learning."</p>
        
            <p>The government this week announced a plan in a bid to improve attendance.</p>
        
            <p>It included a traffic light system with "clear obligations" for students not attending school, increased data reporting, a public communications campaign, public health guidance about when a student is well enough to attend, and setting attendance as a strategic priority for school boards.</p>
