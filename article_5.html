            <p>The coalition government's pledge to shrink the public sector may have spooked many would-be shoppers in Wellington on Boxing Day, commentators say.</p>
        
            <p>South Wairarapa Mayor Martin Connelly said he was not surprised spending was low in the capital while nearby, his region was gaining steam.</p>
        
            <p>Boxing Day sales figures show retail spending in Wellington dropped by nearly 11 percent , while in Wairarapa to the north, spending grew by more than 8 percent on last year.</p>
        
            <p>Connelly believed government signals about possible public sector job cuts had made Wellingtonians cautious.</p>
        
            <p>"Depending on what figure you believe about how many people may or may not lose jobs in the coming few months, I have no doubt that it will certainly take the urge off many people to spend a lot of money.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll be in saving mode."</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, Connelly said that Wairarapa was attracting people with its great weather and lower-cost holiday options.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody can have a good time but [they don't] have to spend a huge amount of money, whereas if you take the kids to Queenstown ... you're going to be in for big bills every day."</p>
        
            <p>Infometrics principal economist Brad Olsen also pointed to looming public sector cuts, along with concerns over water restrictions in summer months, as possible reasons why Wellington's spending plummeted this year.</p>
        
            <p>The presence of two cruise ships in the capital on Boxing Day made the drop more shocking, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I do wonder as well if some of the worries around water restrictions have also seen a few more people who [have] not stuck around Wellington like they might have before because just across the hill in Wairarapa you saw the second biggest growth in spending in all areas of the country."</p>

            <p>But Olsen said some tourism hotspots and hospitality businesses seemed to be bucking the trend of weak retail spending across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The national retail spend on Boxing Day was just below the previous year's levels but food and liquor spending was up nearly 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis seem to be eating up a storm and I think, particularly when you look at what the Wairarapa offers, it's got some great food and beverage options.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps people were doing a bit more window shopping than actual shopping this year and instead also opting to go over the hill and make sure that they filled their belly."</p>
        
            <p>But Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston rejected the assertion that low spending on Boxing Day in the capital probably stemmed from looming cuts to the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>She said the dip was more likely to stem from the cost-of-living crisis and mortgage pressures.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it is accurate just to draw the dots between what's happening in the public sector and what we saw on Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be a number of factors at play and once the level of detail beneath those figures comes out, that may provide a bit of light."</p>
        
            <p>Targeting the public sector for savings was what the country expected from the National-led government, Upston said.</p>
