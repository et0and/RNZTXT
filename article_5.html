            <p>The shake-up of New Zealand's planning laws continues with a proposed second amendment to the Resource Management Act.</p>
        
            <p>It would focus on the areas of infrastructure and energy, housing, farming and natural hazards, with the intention of enabling projects to "drive economic growth and productivity", RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of the bill would coincide with the government making changes to help prepare and amend National Direction, which is made up of national policy statements, national environmental standards and national planning standards that all help support local decision-making under the RMA.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop, who made the announcement at the Local Government NZ conference on Thursday, is in charge of delivering on the 20 different coalition commitments relating to the RMA.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has already repealed legislation the previous government had introduced to replace the RMA and introduced the first RMA Amendment Bill earlier this year. It makes urgent changes to give certainty to councils while new legislation is being developed.</p>
        
            <p>Fast-track legislation has also been introduced, with the intention of creating a "one-stop-shop approvals, consenting and permitting regime" to speed up the delivery of significant projects, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>That legislation has been met with both criticism and support.</p>
        
            <p>"Our next step is four packages of reforms to be delivered through a second RMA Amendment Bill, which will be introduced alongside the single largest package of national direction changes in New Zealand's history: seven new national direction instruments, and amendments to 14 existing ones," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>They include:</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the package would enable a range of productivity-boosting energy and infrastructure projects, including a new NPS-Infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>A consistent approach to quarrying across the Resource Management System would be outlined, and it would extend the duration of port coastal permits by a further 20 years, which was signalled earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Telcos would get greater certainty and reduced consenting costs as they upgraded infrastructure, Bishop indicated, through changes to the NES for Telecommunications Facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The package would also give effect to the Government's Electrify NZ reforms to make it easier to consent renewable energy.</p>

            <p>Bishop said the housing package would contain the reform needed to enable the government's Going For Housing Growth policies.</p>
        
            <p>That included "requiring councils to demonstrate compliance with the 30-year Housing Growth Targets while providing the flexibility for councils to opt out of the Medium Density Residential Standards".</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the government planned to make changes to the National Policy Statement-Urban Development and the National Policy Statement-Highly Productive Land, as well as simplify heritage management, and develop new national direction to enable granny flats and papakƒÅinga housing, which had been previously signalled.</p>
        
            <p>The package was about driving primary sector productivity, Bishop said, and gave effect to National Party manifesto promises and coalition agreements.</p>
        
            <p>"Cabinet has agreed to amend the National Policy Statement-Highly Productive Land to make it clear that indoor primary production and greenhouses are permitted on highly productive land, as well as specifying that farmers are also allowed to build new specified infrastructure such as solar farms on that land."</p>
        
            <p>Further announcements would be made shortly, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This package will provide a comprehensive, nationally consistent framework for addressing the risks posed by natural hazards, including risks from climate change," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>That would create efficiency in the form of a new national direction on natural hazards, "which will provide direction to councils on how to identify natural hazards, assess the risk they pose, and how to respond to that risk through planning controls", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The RMA Amendment Bill 2 would also include "improved emergency provisions to better enable rapid responses to disasters".</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said he hoped to introduce the bill to Parliament by the end of the year.</p>
