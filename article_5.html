        <h2>Three strikes bill passes second reading</h2>
        <p>
Supporters say the bill will take "bad people" off the streets - but opponents say it doesn't address the root causes of crime.

            <p>A bill to reinstate the controversial 'three strikes' legislation - which will see repeat offenders automatically receive the maximum prison sentence allowed, without parole - has passed its second reading.</p>
        
            <p>The Sentencing (Reinstating Three Strikes) Amendment Bill was among a raft of legislation debated under urgency in Parliament on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It passed its second reading 68-54, with National, ACT and NZ First MPs all voting for it, and Labour, the Greens and Te Pāti Māori all voting against.</p>
        
            <p>It then moved immediately to the committee stage.</p>
        
            <p>That was still ongoing at midnight, when Assistant Speaker Greg O'Connor suspended the House for the night.</p>
        
            <p>The previous three strikes law was repealed by the previous Labour government in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government's new version will tighten the legislation, lowering the qualifying sentence threshold for the first strike from 24 months' imprisonment to 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>The first strike would be a "warning strike" only, Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee, of ACT, previously told RNZ, while the second strike would mean no parole. For a third strike, offenders would have to serve the maximum penalty without parole.</p>

            <p>Speaking in Parliament, NZ First MP Casey Costello said the legislation would put victims of crime first.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes when bad people do bad things they need to be punished. And sometimes when bad people do bad things they do them again and again," she said.</p>
        
            <p>National's James Meager, the chair of the justice committee, said other pieces of legislation would address other issues in the criminal justice system.</p>
        
            <p>The three strikes bill was about "taking bad people, dangerous people, harmful people, off the streets and keeping members of the public safe", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's Lawrence Xu-Nan said the bill would do nothing to rehabilitate offenders. He said punitive measures often led to reoffending.</p>
        
            <p>"Will [offenders] feel let down by society? Will they feel like 'You know what, society's against me anyway'? ... That's not how we integrate people into our communities."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Ginny Andersen said other measures were far more effective at reducing reoffending, as they got to the "root causes of crime".</p>
        
            <p>Those included the drug and alcohol treatment courts and Te Pae Oranga, the iwi community panels, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, of Te Pāti Māori, said the bill would disproportionately impact Māori, who were "more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested and convicted" than anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>Discussions on the legislation would resume at 9am Friday.</p>
