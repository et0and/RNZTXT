            <p>The new Public Service Commissioner says the sector has lost its way as an adaptable and responsive service business for the public.</p>
        
            <p>Delivering a keynote address to the New Zealand Economics Forum in Hamilton, Sir Brian Roche laid out some "diagnostics" of the sector, since he took the role in November.</p>
        
            <p>Stipulating that the public service "does perform and does deliver", Sir Brian said it needed to lift its productivity and streamline its processes.</p>
        
            <p>Despite criticism from previous Public Service Minister Nicola Willis of wasteful spending across government, Sir Brian did not believe it was at "any substantive scale", but the sector had built up elaborate sets or architecture that needed to be addressed.</p>
        
            <p>"Every now and again, vacuum cleaners need to have their dust bag cleared, because they become more effective."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Brian said current systems were not fit for purpose in a changing operating environment, the fiscal position and the economic growth focus Willis had told it to adopt.</p>
        
            <p>The current model was too tied up in risk considerations and consultations, which he believed had become a mechanism to avoid decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>"It's generated a lot of internally focused work and multiple meetings, the value of which is questionable, and often very frustrating to those who are trying to make change and lead initiatives," Sir Brian said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether we like it or not, the guise of collaboration has driven us towards a consensus-based model, where we're essentially held ransom by the slowest participant or the poorest performer, and that has to be addressed."</p>
        
            <p>New Public Service Minister Judith Collins recently met with public service bosses and told them to set higher standards, and champion innovation and new ideas, including embracing AI.</p>
