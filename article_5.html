        <h2>Lawyers have sometimes 'usurped' social workers' roles at Oranga Tamariki - CEO</h2>
        <p>
Oranga Tamariki says it has changed its public sector cuts proposal so that fewer lawyers' jobs would be shed, so as not to put service delivery at risk.

            <p>Oranga Tamariki says it has changed its public sector cuts proposal so that fewer lawyers' jobs would be shed, so as not to put service delivery at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive Chappie Te Kani told MPs on Wednesday this was actually due to the fact that its lawyers were doing more than they should.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got ourselves in a place as an organisation where our legal services have probably done more than they should and have usurped the role of social workers in some cases," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The lawyers that I proposed to be disestablished would actually put at risk the delivery of those services."</p>
        
            <p>His original plan was to save $58.5 million, and after getting feedback, he had been working for the last month to minimise impacts.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been very transparent in our advice to the government that the work we are doing will have an impact in some shape or form - this is where I drew the line," Te Kani told MPs.</p>
        
            <p>The original proposal was to cut almost 450 jobs, including not filling vacancies.</p>
        
            <p>"I have made some adjustments to the proposals that will be released to the organisation next Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The primary reason being ... ensuring we've got business continuity to minimise as much as possible risk to the delivery of services."</p>
        
            <p>No front-line services would be cut when he released his final decision on the cuts next Wednesday, he reiterated.</p>
        
            <p>"We stand here confident in the changes that we are about to make, and the plan we have to roll out those changes."</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour told the committee no one could guarantee perfection, but OT would have child-centred services that worked well.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>That would include giving social workers comprehensive information much more quickly about at-risk children via a data technology revamp, Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>The existing system was like "an old metal filing cabinet" where some data could never be found, MPs heard.</p>
        
            <p>"We currently have a system that does not do that, so we come back to gaps in the system, information gaps, information falling through the cracks," Te Kani said.</p>
        
            <p>The new data system would be "an absolute game changer" for staff and whƒÅnau, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A social worker starting a new plan for a child would save four hours compared to how long that took now.</p>
        
            <p>"We also want it to be interoperable with other agencies so we send the information across every part of the system as it pertains to that tamariki," he said.</p>
        
            <p>That would include more data sharing by OT with health and education agencies.</p>
        
            <p>However, Oranga Tamariki has confirmed to RNZ that it rescoped the data system project amid problems last year, downgrading it to a lesser scope of only a "minimum viable product".</p>
        
            <p>Te Kani and Chhour were quizzed on why $30m was being cut from Oranga Tamariki's budget.</p>
        
            <p>This was money not spent by contracted providers who failed to deliver some services, Te Kani said.</p>
        
            <p>Having taken six months to identify and get back the $30m the work they were now doing was on what new contracts would be put in place, with safety as the number one priority, and care and protection number two.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said they had also clawed back $42m she said had been sitting around unspent since it was assigned in 2019 for community home upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>A new plan and budget bid would be needed to use such money to upgrade rundown youth justice and care and protection homes, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour was also asked by committee member Labour's Willow-Jean Prime what the government's new boot camps were costing per child.</p>
        
            <p>A pilot camp based at a youth justice facility, using curriculum with input from the Defence Force, is expected to open in late July, putting up to 10 teenagers already in detention into a military-style academy system that runs for three months inside, then nine months in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said $29m was going on the camps and system as a whole, which RNZ revealed last week - ahead of a government announcement expected later this week - aims to match one-on-one mentoring and rehab, with "military" activities.</p>
        
            <p>She defended the approach, when the spectre of the failed attempts at similar camps was raised by Prime.</p>
        
            <p>"I can guarantee that we'll do better, and we'll make sure that these young people know that they deserve to have somebody that cares enough to try to make a difference in their lives."</p>
        
            <p>Only teenage offenders already in youth justice facilities will be in the pilot camp, but law changes would allow courts to send teens to a military style academy in future, the minister said.</p>
