            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey insists the hiring freeze at Health New Zealand/Te Whatu Ora should not be affecting mental health services, and has vowed to step in personally where that is the case.</p>
        
            <p>Following his speech to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists conference in Wellington on Wednesday morning, the minister was asked why politicians continued to deny there was a hiring freeze, when some frontline services were having recruitment efforts blocked.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said the issue was raised at a Parliamentary select committee in recent weeks at which both he and Health NZ chief executive Margie Apa "re-affirmed" there was "no impact on recruitment or training for mental health workforce".</p>
        
            <p>"Let's be very clear about that - it [mental health] is a priority and there is no impact," he told the audience of about 200 delegates, some of whom shook their heads in apparent disbelief and started murmuring to each other.</p>
        
            <p>The minister's claim was immediately challenged by the college's New Zealand chair, Dr Hiran Thabrew, a clinician at Starship Children's Hospital</p>
        
            <p>"We have been impacted directly - we've lost a couple of people who wanted to join our team, so that's not true."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey offered to raise that with Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We've made our expectation very clear for it not to impact, and I've got the chief executive, Margie Apa, on record in the media saying it's not impacting.</p>
        
            <p>"So if there are specific issues, I'm happy to take them away and raise them because that should not be happening."</p>
        
            <p>Thabrew asked whether the government would be honouring its pre-election promise to increase the number of psychiatrists, as the workforce crisis was reaching critical levels.</p>
        
            <p>The minister said the government was committed to boosting the mental health workforce overall by 500 a year, with plans to fund more training places for psychiatrists, internships for clinical psychologists and the introduction of new qualifications for assistant psychologists.</p>
        
            <p>Officials were currently working on the first-ever workforce plan for mental health, setting out the training pipeline, with psychiatry as "the focus", he said.</p>
