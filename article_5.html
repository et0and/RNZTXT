            <p>New Zealand would likely continue funding the UN agency delivering aid in Palestine if concerns about its staff were dealt with, the Foreign Affairs Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on Tuesday confirmed New Zealand was reviewing future payments to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).</p>
        
            <p>It follows accusations by Israel that agency staff were involved in the Hamas' attacks on 7 October, which left about 1300 dead and about 250 taken as hostages.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters told Morning Report the allegations warranted a proper investigation.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the critical issue was the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry more than 26,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military operation in response to 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said it was possible there were a few "rotten apples" within UNRWA.</p>
        
            <p>"If the matter has been dealt with, and with assurances that it does not happen in the future, then the crisis is of a level, we must, I believe, and I think the New Zealand people would want us to respond to the crisis rather than to react in that way and punish a whole lot of innocent people because of the actions of a few."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said it would be premature to make a decision before the UN finishes its investigation.</p>
