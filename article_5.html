            <p>Stats NZ's investigation into whether census data was misused during the election campaign has been extended, with no new deadline.</p>
        
            <p>Independent investigator Doug Craig, of RDC Group, was brought in after claims that private data from census forms was used to help Te P훮ti M훮ori's candidate Takutai Tarsh Kemp.</p>
        
            <p>Te P훮ti M훮ori strongly denies the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry was due to conclude by the end of July, but Stats NZ chief executive Mark Sowden said Craig had requested more time due to the complexity of the matter.</p>
        
            <p>"The seriousness of these allegations is such that there are multiple agencies investigating. It is important that those involved have the time needed to ensure the matters are thoroughly worked through," Sowden said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's vital the people of New Zealand can trust that when they provide their information to us it is held securely and is only used for the authorised purposes. That is why we are taking these allegations so seriously."</p>
        
            <p>The eventual findings would be shared with police, Public Service Commission and the wider public, Sowden said.</p>
        
            <p>The [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/519162/public-service-commission-to-conduct-inquiry-after-te-pati-maori-data-allegations</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Commission] is separately conducting an inquiry into the whether government agencies acted appropriately regarding the allegations and surrounding circumstances.</p>
