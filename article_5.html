            <p>The National Party's membership base rallied in Auckland this weekend, clearly relishing being back in government after last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>The party used the two-day conference to showcase the front bench of its caucus, its policies and its overall plan to get the country 'back on track'.</p>
        
            <p>National leader Christopher Luxon's tone was triumphant addressing the party faithful, now leading the biggest party in government.</p>
        
            <p>"Our victory last year is a testament to your commitment and to your dedication so can I just say thank you, thank you, thank you for everything that you do for us," he told the crowd of about 500 members.</p>
        
            <p>The conference was a victory lap of sorts for the party, outlining the new direction it's taking in areas like health, justice and education in a series of panel discussions.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis was unapologetic about cuts to public spending, including the roughly 6000 public sector jobs axed.</p>
        
            <p>"On our watch, there may be fewer people wearing lanyards on Lambton Quay, but there are gonna be a lot more people wearing high vis and hard hats and I say bring that on."</p>
        
            <p>The conference was a chance to outline what's been done and undone in the last nine months - and to pitch forward.</p>
        
            <p>So much so, the government announced it's hitting fast forward on a new maths curriculum for primary and intermediate students that will now kick in from Term 1 next year.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Standford promised teachers would get the support they need to deliver a revamped maths programme.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge this is going to be a big shift for teachers this year because we are bringing it forward but we are throwing everything at this. The resources we are putting in to support our teachers to teach the new maths curriculum next year is significant."</p>
        
            <p>There was a lot of talk about National's bread and butter - property, farming, law and order - at the weekend and very little mention of the party's coalition partners.</p>
        
            <p>The latest 1News Verian poll - out in late June - shows National remains the highest polling party in Parliament but would still need ACT and New Zealand First to form a government.</p>

            <p>Speaking to RNZ at the conference this weekend, former National Prime Minister Sir John Key said it was going well, all things considered.</p>
        
            <p>"They're doing well, you know, when you're in government, I know what it's like when you're working with coalition partners you put in lots of time and energy but it's like anything in life it's really like a marriage.</p>
        
            <p>"You can have the happiest marriage in the world but it doesn't mean you don't have the odd disagreement from time to time."</p>
        
            <p>On Christopher Luxon's personal popularity, which hasn't reached the levels of former prime ministers, Key believed the public will like Luxon, once they get to know him.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he is growing into the role and that's natural. I know when I took over the job in 2008 I think by this time, mid-2009, I was doing better and frankly by the middle of 2016 I obviously understood how it worked."</p>
        
            <p>The National Party was regrouping - happy - off the back of last year's election result but the biggest challenge is yet to come.</p>
        
            <p>It has just over two years now to navigate the three-way coalition and deliver on its promise to make New Zealanders' lives better.</p>
