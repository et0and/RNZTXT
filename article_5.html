            <p>The Children's Minister says Oranga Tamariki's breaching of confidential information of children and families could not be allowed to continue under this government's watch.</p>
        
            <p>An independent review details a host of what it calls grievous privacy breaches between 2021 and 2023 that in some cases led to physical harm to people.</p>
        
            <p>The review was finished almost a year ago but has only just been released - and the ministry has a lot of fixes still to make.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Chhour said the replacement of its unsecure case management system would help.</p>
        
            <p>She did not comment on when she learned of the findings that date back to April 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"While the issues covered in the Oranga Tamariki privacy report predate this government, they could not be allowed to continue under our watch," Chhour said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry had not had any serious (notifiable) breaches in the last 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"This is heartening but I will continue to monitor the ministry's progress."</p>
