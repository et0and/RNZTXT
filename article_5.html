            <p>A southern mayor fears lives could be at risk amid a funding shortfall for his region's roads.</p>
        
            <p>On 11 October, Southland mayor Rob Scott penned a letter to Transport Minister Simeon Brown explaining the issues his council faced trying to maintain its 5000km network - the second largest in the country.</p>
        
            <p>A copy of the letter was included in an agenda for this week's council meeting alongside data about shortfalls.</p>
        
            <p>Scott said the average Southland resident was responsible for the cost of 151 metres of road compared to 4m for every Aucklander.</p>
        
            <p>"Noting the size of our roading network ... with only 21,000 ratepayers to cover its costs, our people feel the pinch of every dollar that we spend."</p>
        
            <p>The council had reluctantly reduced its funding request to $147 million, meaning 105km of sealing and 13km of rehab work would go by the wayside, Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>But even then, NZTA Waka Kotahi only approved $125m, leaving the council "stranded" and needing to find a sum which was the equivalent of an 18 percent rating increase, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the cuts already proposed by staff were not satisfactory, such as dropping edge markings to save $1.2m.</p>
        
            <p>"At face value this might not sound like a big issue, but it is a significant safety concern especially in our 100km/hr rural roads.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have streetlights, and at night and/or poor weather conditions these lines are a vital tool in monitoring</p>
        
            <p>one's position on the road.</p>
        
            <p>'This is the kind of decision that has the likelihood of people losing their lives."</p>
        
            <p>Three requests were laid out to the minister - reconsider the request for the full $147m, remove "ring fencing" budgets so council could redistribute funds within its roading programme, and make Funding Assistance Rates more equitable.</p>
        
            <p>Information included in the council agenda said the Southland roading network was made up of 3000km of unsealed and 2000km of sealed roads.</p>
        
            <p>There were 840 bridges in the network, 56 of which were either closed or had weight restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Local Democracy Reporting, Scott said he had met with Brown once since sending the letter.</p>
        
            <p>"The numbers are hard to argue with there, and I'm optimistic that we'll get to a good outcome."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he had been advised by NZTA that a funding request of $143m was received, of which 87 percent had been funded.</p>
        
            <p>No council in New Zealand had received a full allocation for its request, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are always more bids for funding than there is money available, and NZTA must prioritise funding across the entire country."</p>
        
            <p>Brown had forwarded Scott's letter to the authority and asked them to find a solution to the line marking issue.</p>
