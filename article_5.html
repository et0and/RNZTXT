            <p>A year on from Jacinda Ardern's resignation and following an election loss, the Labour Party heads into its annual caucus retreat Thursday focusing on being a strong opposition.</p>
        
            <p>It was at last year's retreat that Ardern made the shock announcement she was standing down as prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Her successor, Chris Hipkins, says its been a long year.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly feels like more than a year indeed," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said he wasn't expecting any further resignations this year and those who were leaving have already made their announcements.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got an important job to do.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to make sure that we're a very effective opposition which means that we've got to scrutinise what the current government are doing and we've got to hold them accountable for the decisions that they're making."</p>
        
            <p>He said the party also needed to have new ideas and fresh policy for the 2026 election, and rebuild relationships with the party's base.</p>
