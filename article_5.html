            <p>Former Green MP Darleen Tana is heading to court today in an attempt to stop the party from using the waka jumping law against them.</p>
        
            <p>Tana filed proceedings against the Greens to prevent a meeting, scheduled for the weekend, to decide whether to oust the now independent MP from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The interim injunction aims to block the Greens' special general meeting from taking place, as well as calling for a judicial review of the party's co-leaders Chl√∂e Swarbrick and Marama Davidson, and the party.</p>
        
            <p>Tana's problems with their former party stem from allegations of worker exploitation at their husband's business and Tana's failure to disclose their knowledge of the situation.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens have called on Tana to resign, which they have not done.</p>
        
            <p>The party has a contentious history with the party-hopping legislation which they were opposed to.</p>
        
            <p>But they've now said they would use it to evict Tana from Parliament if the party's membership agrees. The legislation only requires the party's leader to begin the process.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said the legal challenge was in line with Tana's actions over the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report she didn't want to go into any legal details, before saying: "We're going into this with good faith as we have with every single step of this process."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick also refused to speculate on the legal worth of Tana's case, however, the Greens would be offering "full transparency" once the hearing was finished.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about who would be paying the legal bills for the Greens, she said a lawyer was working on a pro bono basis.</p>
        
            <p>"I really do implore the media and the public to ask them [Darleen Tana] that ... I think there is due questions to be asked on the other side."</p>
        
            <p>A hearing is due to get under way at 10am on Thursday at the Auckland High Court.</p>
