            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says he had "a good connection" with US president-elect Donald Trump during a "very positive, very warm" conversation this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon spoke to Trump on Tuesday for the first time since the US election in a phone call which Luxon said lasted 10-to-15 minutes and canvassed a range of topics.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked a little bit about some of the challenges in our respective economies, and also about some of the global conflicts, particularly Ukraine and Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really just a relational chance to say hello, and we committed that we would catch up in person at some future forum."</p>
        
            <p>The discussion did not delve into deep detail, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very positive, very warm, you know, a good connection," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a lot of attachment to New Zealand. It's a place that he speaks very highly of."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he also shared his experience living and working in the US: "I come from a business background into politics as well."</p>
        
            <p>He did not raise Trump's proposal to implement tariffs on imports into the US but said the president-elect was aware of New Zealand's commitment to free trade.</p>
        
            <p>"[Trump] knows New Zealand well, and ... the fact that we are a small nation that is very determined to continue to trade with anyone and everyone across the world."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said they talked about the two countries' "long and important relationship" and continuing their partnership throughout the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>The call took place roughly five days after Trump's commanding victory. Luxon said it was a "good sign" that Trump made time for such a small nation given his busy schedule.</p>
        
            <p>Since Trump's landslide victory last week he has spoken with several world leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and China's Xi Jin Ping.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's usual interview slot with Morning Report was moved to allow for the call from the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Posting on X, Luxon said New Zealand and the United States had a strong and enduring partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"Good to speak with President-elect @realDonaldTrump this morning to congratulate him on his historic election victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We agreed on the importance of deepening ties between our two nations and I look forward to doing just that."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister is heading to the APEC summit in Peru on Thursday where he will meet outgoing President Joe Biden.</p>
        
            <p>President-elect Trump campaigned on introducing tariffs of up to 20 percent on imported goods as part of his 'America First' economic policy.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has previously warned against jumping to conclusions about Trump policies that might affect New Zealand and has congratulated the Republican on a "comprehensive win".</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to working with him and advancing the interests of our great countries," he said last week.</p>
        
            <p>"I know both sides of the aisle in Washington... I've got no doubt we'll do everything we can to work constructively to move forward together."</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Trump's campaigning on trade tariffs which could be bad for New Zealand, Luxon said we needed to wait and see what policies were actually introduced.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi winemakers are anxiously waiting to see whether he follows through on the promise, with the US market accounting for some 40 percent of New Zealand's wine exports.</p>
