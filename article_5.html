            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell says officers are not mental health workers as he looks back on 2024, and into the new year.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ sat down with the minister for a year in review across his portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to policing, Mitchell said there had been a change in direction.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no real science in it," he said. "It was quite simply back to basics, doing their core role properly."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said that meant an increase in visibility and reassurance patrols.</p>
        
            <p>He was clear about what he thought had worked well in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"There's probably been three areas," he said. "One has been safety around the CBDs, that's our main cities and provincial and regional towns as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been around the gangs... because a lot of that harm, and a lot of that intergenerational stuff we can actually fix through clamping down on the gangs.</p>
        
            <p>"And the third one has been the violent youth offending around retail crime."</p>
        
            <p>There would be enough police staff to properly keep Aucklanders safe across the region this summer, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Policing is where you can never have too many staff really," he said.</p>

            <p>Asked if there was a criminal case in 2024 that had affected him the most, Mitchell told RNZ offending against children was something that impacted him.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a long way to go as a country to deal with that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have completely, totally, unacceptable levels of domestic violence and offending against kids, and we should be doing all that we can to make sure that our kids are safe.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's why you'll see me driving hard against the gangs because, in my own experience, though generations, a gang environment is not a good environment for children to be brought up in."</p>
        
            <p>(RNZ spoke to Mitchell before Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming was killed after being hit by a vehicle in the early hours of New Year's Day.)</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the government had social investment to encourage gang members, especially those with children, to leave.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll get alongside them, and we'll do the best we can to help them get retrained or rejoin society and leave that lifestyle of drugs, and violence, and misery behind."</p>
        
            <p>Looking forward, Mitchell said he wanted police to continue what they were doing.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to get our police responding to things that our police should be responding to, and not doing things they shouldn't be doing.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why you're seeing quite a bit of work go in the space around mental health, because our police officers are not mental health workers."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said a lot of the jobs officers were called to required a health response rather than a policing response.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to get that figured out so that we can get them back on their core role."</p>
        
            <p>Police began cutting back on how long officers spent at emergency departments handing a person over to health workers in November.</p>
        
            <p>They also brought in new guidelines on when officers would transport a patient to hospital, and when they would attend mental health facility call-outs.</p>
        
            <p>In other areas, Mitchell said he did not expect to be given the emergency management portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd asked the prime minister if I could be considered for both the police and corrections portfolios, because I felt really strongly that, in terms of public safety, those agencies have got such a big role to play," he said.</p>

            <p>"When I got emergency management, it's not something I had in opposition, it's not something that I really had a lot of experience with other than the fact with, on a very tactical level obviously, I'd been a police officer for 14 years and had been involved in emergency response."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the country was prepared for more local states of emergency, but that it would need to call on international allies like Australia or the United States if a particular large disaster occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"The way the response happens will dictate, in my view, how the recovery [goes].</p>
        
            <p>"You can be midway through a response, and really you're in recovery as well."</p>
