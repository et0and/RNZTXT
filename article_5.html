            <p>Labour's spokesperson for prevention of family and sexual violence, Ginny Andersen, said the death of two children in the first week of this year is a reminder that New Zealand needs to closely look at frontline services for vulnerable families.</p>
        
            <p>Two men are in custody facing murder charges in separate cases - the death of a child in Hamilton and another child in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police are also investigating an incident in Dargaville where a child was taken to hospital with serious head injuries over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen said it was an "unimaginable loss" for the families affected.</p>
        
            <p>She said the government's cuts to frontline social services are very concerning, leaving providers struggling and vulnerable families facing the consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"Frontline service providers warned of the safety risks if that funding was cut, and we've seen more than 330 services - ones like Family Start and women support, have those cuts that directly impact upon their service delivery," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, Oranga Tamariki discontinued funding to 190 service providers, saying they were underperforming or operating at a surplus. Another 142 providers had their funding reduced.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen said the cuts were risking the safety of whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"This government has seen police step back from family violence, while also at the same time, cutting frontline services, and so we're going to see some ramifications from those cuts, and I sincerely hope that it's not more fatalities," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen said families across New Zealand would've been rocked by the saddening news of the recent child deaths, and deserve to be reassured that there will be services in place to respond to family violence.</p>
        
            <p>"The government hasn't got a clear plan on how it's going to improve service delivery regarding family violence, and that's a concern given the fatalities we've seen so early in the year," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The lack of further funding towards Te Aorerekura - the national strategy to eliminate family violence and sexual violence - comes with a risk to community, Andersen said.</p>
        
            <p>She said that was a long term plan to ensure that there were networks on the ground to stop people from falling between the cracks.</p>
        
            <p>The children's minister Karen Chhour earlier said the government was working on the family and sexual violence action plan, focusing on protecting children and young people and breaking inter-generational cycles of violence in families.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is currently doing work to improve this, and I am asking this year, and heading into the future, that people work together - with each other and with relevant agencies, to take action so that we can help protect each other," she said.</p>
