            <p>The second day of commemorations at Waitangi are getting underway.</p>
        
            <p>They will be marked by a rare visit to the Treaty Grounds by Kīngi Tūheitia, who will be welcomed onto the Whare Runanga Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Kīngi Tūheitia is bringing with him the mauri of the Hui aa Motu in Ngāruawāhia.</p>
        
            <p>Discussions from that hui were expected to continue at Waitangi, with a particular focus on the Declaration of Independence and the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori will be welcomed alongside the king - they did not arrive with the other opposition parties on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Outgoing Labour MP Kelvin Davis gave his final speech as a politician at Te Whare Rūnanga on Saturday; telling the crowd the lion's den of government representatives was about to arrive, and not to speak to decision makers like lambs. He also expressed his disappointment Te Paati Māori did not walk onto the marae with Labour and the Greens.</p>
