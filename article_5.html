            <p>Grant Robertson says being gay was a "factor", but not the only reason, he missed out on being chosen as Labour leader a decade ago.</p>
        
            <p>The former deputy prime minister, who announced his retirement from politics in February, ran for the leadership in 2013 and again in 2014, but lost.</p>
        
            <p>He knew his being gay was an "issue" within the Labour Party and a "factor" in his defeats, he told Q&A host Jack Tame.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think it probably affected [the 2013 bid] . Although whether I would have been able to win that one, even without that, I'm not sure.</p>
        
            <p>"By the time we got to 2014, it was less of an issue the second time around. But it continued to be there."</p>
        
            <p>David Cunliffe was chosen as leader in 2013 and Andrew Little in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson chose not to run for a third time when the role of Labour leader came up for grabs again in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, he became deputy prime minister to Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>"I was able to be there and support my friend in doing that," he told Q+A.</p>
        
            <p>"That was all enormously fulfilling."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he thought briefly about putting his name forward again when Ardern announced she was quitting in 2023, but ultimately decided not to.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd been up close to that job and I knew exactly what it took to do it, and I knew that I didn't have that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it would be dishonest to chase a job that I knew I couldn't give the 110, 120 percent that was required."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson is the most senior openly gay politician in New Zealand history.</p>
        
            <p>He said he thought New Zealand had changed a lot in its attitudes to the rainbow community in the decade since his failed leadership bids, but there was still room for improvement.</p>
        
            <p>"I still think there's some distance to go for us to get to a place where people can be who they want to be, live their lives freely and be appreciated for who they are in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson will give his valedictory speech on Wednesday and take up a role as Otago University's vice-chancellor on 1 July.</p>
