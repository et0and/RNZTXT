            <p>Hamilton councillors have spent $42,000 of ratepayer money upskilling themselves, including $3000 on a two-day course in Canada and $790 on a Koru Club membership.</p>
        
            <p>Professional development budgets are allocated to each elected member to spend on training and attending conferences and meetings relevant to their roles and portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>This year, under pressure to cut costs in the face of a 16 percent rate rise, Hamilton City Council slashed the PD budgets in half, from $6000 each per year to $3000.</p>
        
            <p>Angela O'Leary, a long-time city councillor who became deputy mayor this term, said the Koru Club membership was for the year she was appointed to a Local Government New Zealand working group in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>O'Leary said she was expected to do a lot of travel during that period and "it was thought appropriate for the deputy, as with the mayor".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm no longer required to travel so it won't be renewed."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand currently advertises annual memberships at $775 and benefits include access to the airline's lounges, of which there is a small one at Hamilton Airport.</p>
        
            <p>In total, O'Leary spent $3472 in the 2023/24 financial year on professional development, including almost $2500 on attending LGNZ conferences in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>She has not spent any of her PD budget so far this year.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Ewan Wilson, chair of the economic development committee, spent $3033 on tuition fees for a two-day leadership seminar at the McGill Executive Institute in Canada in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson, who previously lived in Canada, paid for his own airfares to Montreal, Quebec for the course because it exceeded his PD budget.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said the seminar was about effective leadership aimed at equipping current leaders with "additional tools for their leadership toolbox".</p>
        
            <p>"I think the cost of the course was basically the same as attending the local government conference in Wellington," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a worthwhile course from a well-recognised institution and is absolutely in my mind totally appropriate that as chair of economic development of New Zealand's fastest-growing city that I try to keep my skills up to date.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole concept of personal development is that we're given a budget - and our budget's been cut in half - and that elected members get to choose to attend training for conferences or a learning opportunity that will help them do their work and add value to their participation."</p>
        
            <p>His entire spend for the year was exactly $6000 and included $2112 for registration and airfares to attend an infrastructure conference in Wellington.</p>

            <p>So far this financial year, Wilson has spent $2735 for Sister City visits to Chengdu in China and Saitama in Japan to "build stronger relationships with Sister Cities".</p>
        
            <p>He again paid his own airfares.</p>
        
            <p>His trip came at the same time the council was reviewing the benefit of its five Sister City relationships, the outcome of which will go to the economic development committee.</p>
        
            <p>In April, mayor Paula Southgate travelled to Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium on a Sister City visit for Anzac Day but the trip, which her husband accompanied her on at his own expense, was not funded through her PD budget.</p>
        
            <p>Southgate's spend totalled $1706, of which $1688 was to attend the LGNZ conference in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>For the 23/24 year, councillor Emma Pike spent $5262 of her budget, including $3833 for accounting study at the University of Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Melaina Huaki, who quit the council earlier this year after being queried about her low meeting attendance rate, spent $4535 including on environmental training on making good decisions.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Louise Hutt spent $4340, including for an urban economics short course.</p>
        
            <p>The highest spend so far this year is $2951 for courses and accommodation in Auckland by councillor Anna Casey-Cox.</p>
        
            <p>The only councillors who did not use any of the PD budget in both financial years were former deputy mayor Geoff Taylor, east ward councillor Kesh Naidoo-Rauf, and first-term councillor Andrew Bydder.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Tim Macindoe only joined the council earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson said if PD budgets were unspent they did not roll over.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021 the PD budget was also slashed in half from $6000 to $3000.</p>
