            <p>ACT leader David Seymour - the architect of the government's proposed Treaty Principles Bill - has welcomed a Waitangi Tribunal report, despite it recommending the idea be abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>Waitangi Tribunal chair Caren Fox said the bill and a proposed review of Treaty clauses - put forward by New Zealand First - were part of a pattern of the Crown using Parliament's policy process against Māori.</p>
        
            <p>However, Seymour saw the report as a contribution to the national conversation he had long been calling for.</p>
        
            <p>"We need a national conversation about our founding document. Are there two classes of New Zealanders in partnership, each with different rights? Or are we a modern democracy where all citizens have equal rights?"</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he looked forward to having that discussion over the next several months.</p>
        
            <p>"My fundamental question is this: where are the successful societies that treat people differently based on their ancestry? Many of the worst events in history came from treating humans based on their membership of a group.</p>
        
            <p>"If the Treaty is a partnership between the Crown and only Māori, what is the place of a non-Māori child born today? Are they born into second-class citizenship where some public positions are not available to them because they have the wrong ancestors?</p>
        
            <p>It was time to cast off the "divisive notion that the Treaty is a partnership between two classes of New Zealanders each with different rights", Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not only untrue, it is incompatible with the fundamental democratic value that all citizens are equal under the law."</p>
