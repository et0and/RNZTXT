        <h2>US tariff 'will have an impact on New Zealand exports', McClay says</h2>
        <p>
Trade Minister Todd McClay has confirmed New Zealand exporters will face a 10 percent tariff on all goods to the United States, from this weekend.

            <p>Trade Minister Todd McClay has confirmed New Zealand exporters will face a 10 percent tariff on all goods to the United States, from this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>There is no indication at this stage there will be any change or duties imposed on New Zealand services.</p>
        
            <p>President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would instigate reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on other countries - including responding to what he said was a 20 percent tariff on US goods from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>McClay has confirmed New Zealand does not have a 20 percent tariff rate that it subjects US exports too.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand officials would be tasked with passing on that message to US counterparts, who McClay said were possibly assuming New Zealand applies 20 percent due to a rate connected to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
        
            <p>In reality, New Zealand applied a much lower rate for US exports into New Zealand, McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs minister Winston Peters said the US' calculations were a mistake, but it was "immaterial" and questioned why it was a concern.</p>
        
            <p>"If you think that's significant, then we got a much more reasonable deal out of them than anybody else did."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "a day of celebration" as many countries closer to the United States had done worse than New Zealand, and paid tribute to those who had worked behind the scenes engaging with the US.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm delighted today that that is the outcome. Many of our exporters need to know that they've got a 15 percent-plus advantage over their competitors in the United States, and we'll turn this around real fast if they take it positively," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters travelled to the US last month where he met with his counterpart Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to get more information about any potential tariff hikes and advocate for New Zealand to not be too heavily stung.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past few days McClay has spoken with a number of businesses who export to the US and they have told him they "still see opportunity for them" in that market.</p>
        
            <p>He added, it was "important to note many other countries around the world are facing much higher tariffs".</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst not unexpected, it will have an impact on New Zealand exports."</p>

            <p>McClay told reporters at Parliament on Thursday morning, there was no sense of relief in only 10 percent being applied because tariffs were "not good for trade, so we're not feeling relieved".</p>
        
            <p>"Although I think there is recognition that New Zealand isn't seen as one of the countries that has an unbalanced trading relationship with the US."</p>
        
            <p>He said it wasn't surprising to be captured by the tariffs in one way or another, and regardless, New Zealand will continue to have a "constructive and very positive relationship" with America.</p>
        
            <p>Trade officials are also clarifying with the US whether the 10 percent is in addition to tariffs already paid.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears it is a blanket tariff but we're looking to clarify that quickly."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has no plans to retaliate against the US tariffs because that would "put up prices on New Zealand consumers and be inflationary," he said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand exports about $9 billion worth of goods to the US, so the cost of a 10 percent tariff would be about $900 million to exporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there is some pretty clear evidence that will be worn by US consumers, not New Zealand exporters," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>As for what New Zealand's average tariff rate is on the US, McClay said it was around 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That figure, and how low it is, is a point that has been made to the US in talks between the two countries, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's trade spokesperson Damien O'Connor said it was disappointing New Zealand could not secure a lower rate, and questioned the success of Peters' talks in Washington D.C.</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor said he had no idea how the US landed on the 20 percent tariff rate figure that New Zealand subjects US exports to.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it'd be a very brave person to try and do some calculations on how the US works out a lot at the moment. That's quite unfortunate, not just for New Zealand but actually for all those others who are facing 10 percent, at least, plus, tariff on goods they export to the US."</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor said it was hard to imagine any friend would disrupt the world of trade the way the US had, but New Zealand would continue to trade with its second biggest trading partner.</p>
