            <p>A law change to protect comedians, critics and artists who make memes and poke fun at others will be debated in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's Copyright (Parody and Satire) Amendment Bill was pulled from the ballot on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It will allow people to use a copyright work for parody or satire, such as memes.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party MP Kahurangi Carter said Kiwis were known for their love of spoofs, parodies and dark humour.</p>
        
            <p>"Satire is more than a joke - it's also a way of making sense of the world when sometimes it can feel dark and heavy," says Kahurangi Carter.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little ironic that we, a nation of quintessential dry-humour lovers, can't lampoon and parody with the rest of the world without risk of breaching copyright. And yes, that includes making proper memes.</p>
        
            <p>"This Bill protects artists' right to freedom of speech, and in doing so helps protect our democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Humour was essential to a thriving democracy, and parody and satire played a critical role in public discourse, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If it passes, big companies won't be able to sue artists for being cool and funny."</p>
        
            <p>The law change would bring New Zealand in line with other countries, including Australia and the United States, she said.</p>
