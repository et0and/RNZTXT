            <p>The government is moving to shake up how builders can meet insulation standards for new homes, in a way it says will save thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>A consultation period for feedback on changing the way energy efficiency standards can be met runs until February.</p>

            <p>The government said that could save at least $2300, and as much as $15,000 per home.</p>
