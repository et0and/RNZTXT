            <p>Smaller NGOs are set to benefit from funding for mental health support, the Minister for Mental Health says, as the government lowers the threshold required to access it.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Doocey said the lower funding limit will help "clear the way" for more organisations to contribute to the government's "visions" of faster access to mental health support.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the government's Mental Health Innovation Fund, $10 million is up for grabs over two years - some of which has already been allocated.</p>
        
            <p>Organisations looking to access that funding were required to match it with at least $250,000.</p>
        
            <p>Following feedback from the sector, organisations will now only have to front up $100,000 meaning smaller organisations will be eligible.</p>
        
            <p>"This fund was created in consultation with NGOs so it's important that, if changes are made, they are made following feedback from the sector," said Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>He made announcement on Thursday while speaking to the NGO sector at the Platform Trust Members Day.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased to be announcing today there is now a lower limit required to access match funding. We have gone from requiring at least $250,000 per application to $100,000.</p>
        
            <p>"This means more NGOs will benefit, but the real winners are New Zealanders looking to access timely mental health support."</p>
        
            <p>MATES in Construction, The Mental Health Foundation, YouthLine, Wellington City Mission, Rotorua Youth One Stop Shop and the Sir John Kirwan Foundation all received funding in the first round.</p>
        
            <p>Proposals to access the fund will need to show they can address the following:</p>
        
            <p>Doocey also spoke about his priorities for the year, including bringing down mental health and addiction wait times.</p>
        
            <p>"We are the first government to introduce specific mental health targets and the initiatives funded to date are taking pressure off the public system and using a workforce that sits outside it."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said the government has a responsibility to look at "every option we can to ensure New Zealanders have timely access to mental health support where and when they need it."</p>
        
            <p>"It is vital that we enable NGOs to deliver innovative projects and initiatives that increase faster access to better mental health support across New Zealand."</p>
