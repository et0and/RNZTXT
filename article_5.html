            <p>Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters has been labelled a climate denier by the opposition after downplaying the climate crisis while visiting the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Peters returned from Tonga on Tuesday night after attending the Pacific Islands' Forum - but not before making comments the prime minister had to clean up.</p>
        
            <p>Peters raised eyebrows when asked if he believed in climate change in Tonga on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Do I believe in climate change... for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years there has been climate change," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Cyclone Gabrielle happened in the '30s in Hawke's Bay. The biggest tsunami in recent times was in 1968."</p>
        
            <p>Peters spread climate misinformation at a public meeting in Napier during last year's election campaign; citing incorrect figures about the human impact on CO2 and trying to link tsunamis to global warming.</p>
        
            <p>Three climate scientists found his comments inaccurate, with one suggesting Peters' narrative came from the climate sceptic community that used small, jumbled numbers to trivialise the subject.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Peters' most recent comments in Tonga, Christopher Luxon was quick to explain the pair are both on the same page.</p>
        
            <p>"Both Winston Peters and I agree climate change is an existential threat to the Pacific Islands. There's no doubt about that and that's not in dispute."</p>
        
            <p>The comments came moments before Question Time started in Wellington, with Labour and the Greens launching a climate attack on the coalition.</p>
        
            <p>Peters was in the hot seat, answering questions on behalf of Luxon as acting prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>"Why does the prime minister believe that it's okay for the minister of foreign affairs to travel to the Pacific and question the science of climate change in front of leaders who, in some cases, are finding their countries literally sinking into the ocean?" Labour leader Chris Hipkins asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Does he agree with comments from former Tuavalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga who said, when speaking about this government's planned reversal of the oil and gas ban, 'don't forget that whatever you are going to do, it is going to increase greenhouse gas emissions, which are going to sink the islands of Tuvalu and kill the people'," Greens co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick asked.</p>
        
            <p>Peters was unapologetic in the House before backing away from the comments when asked if he believed humans had a role in climate change.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, when has anybody ever denied it? But I was trying to make the point that some people don't seem to understand when they think that they're the only ones in any generation that's ever been concerned about it."</p>
        
            <p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres has put a spotlight on the impact of climate change, particularly sea level rise, during his time in Tonga this week.</p>
        
            <p>He has also criticised governments - like New Zealand - for overseeing new oil and gas exploration, saying they're "signing away our future".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon does not believe these comments were directed at New Zealand, adding he agrees with them.</p>
        
            <p>"I fully support those comments. Every country needs to be able to move away from fossil fuels and embrace renewables, but let's be a bit more intellectually rigourous about that and make sure that we've actually got the plan to actually deliver that objective, rather than just make sweeping statements.</p>
        
            <p>"As you see in New Zealand, you can make as many sweeping statements as you like in 2018 but look at the pain and suffering we're causing to lower middle income working New Zealanders across this country."</p>
        
            <p>The Pacific Islands Forum reaches critical talks on Thursday as leaders gather for a day-long retreat on another island, with no officials or media present.</p>
        
            <p>Forum talks almost collapsed in 2019 over clashes between Australia and Tuvalu, over Australia's refusal to roll over on removing references to coal in the forum communiqué.</p>
        
            <p>It is unlikely discussions will reach such a head this year but fossil fuels will no doubt continue to be a heated topic.</p>
