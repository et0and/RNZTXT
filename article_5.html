            <p>New National MP Cameron Brewer has apologised for a "poor attempt at humour" after celebrating the return of "stale, pale males" in his election night victory speech, having ousted Labour's Vanushi Walters from Upper Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>In a recording of the speech leaked to RNZ, Brewer can be heard declaring himself a "glass ceiling breaker" to laughs from the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be the first male MP for Upper Harbour," he says to cheers. "Stale, pale males are back!"</p>
        
            <p>An audience member shouts in response: "Stale, pale, male!"</p>
        
            <p>The comments come as National faces scrutiny for a lack of diversity in its new caucus, and follow a public commitment from leader Christopher Luxon to improve representation.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 70 percent of National's caucus this term are men, and 80 percent are Pākehā.</p>
        
            <p>The Upper Harbour electorate had been held by Walters - New Zealand's first Sri Lankan-born MP - since 2020, and before that, National's Paula Bennett since the seat's formation in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Contacted by RNZ, Brewer said the remarks were intended to be funny and self-deprecating but accepted they were unwise.</p>
        
            <p>"If anyone is offended by this comment, of course, I apologise... I don't want to be the subject of distraction," Brewer said.</p>
        
            <p>"In my defence, it was a private function, but nonetheless, it was a silly thing to say. It was clearly a poor attempt at humour, and it's something I wouldn't say again."</p>
        
            <p>Brewer told RNZ he was disappointed the speech had been leaked and regretted that his "minor offence" could have poorly reflected on him or the National Party.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an exciting election night victory. We were all a little bit excited. And hence, my speech possibly went off the core message of gratitude.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lesson for a first-term MP that even if you're in a private function, cracking jokes, you've just got to be ultra careful as to what you say."</p>
        
            <p>Brewer said he "absolutely" supported his leader's stated drive to improve diversity within the National Party.</p>
        
            <p>"That is something I clearly support, if you look at all my work in local government, in and around business advocacy [and] community leadership in different roles over the last 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"I've helped as many candidates as I can, all around Auckland, of various ethnic heritage and backgrounds."</p>
        
            <p>The small private function was held at the Massey Rugby Football Club at Moire Park in West Harbour.</p>

            <p>Luxon has talked at length about the need for National's caucus to more closely reflect the make-up of New Zealand, sending a direct message to party faithful last year that he wanted them to front more diverse candidates.</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, Upper Harbour's local members selected Brewer as a candidate ahead of the four other contenders on the shortlist, all women, including now-ACT MP Parmjeet Parmar.</p>
        
            <p>Most recently a communications consultant, Brewer spent six years as an Auckland councillor from 2010 to 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Before that, he led the Newmarket Business Association for five years, and worked as a press secretary for former ACT leader Rodney Hide, former Auckland Mayor John Banks and former Opposition leader Jenny Shipley.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Brewers comments today, National Party leader Christopher Luxon said: "I haven't spoken to him about it, but I noticed that um, I think it was a poor attempt at a self-deprecating joke that probably backfired on him a little bit but I see he's apologised since.</p>
        
            <p>"He did it in good spirit and he didn't mean to cause offence to anyone."</p>
