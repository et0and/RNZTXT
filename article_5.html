            <p>One person was arrested following a protest outside National's caucus retreat in Christchurch last night.</p>
        
            <p>National MPs had gathered in ÅŒtautahi for the party's annual retreat, and were dining at the Curators House restaurant near the Botanic Gardens.</p>
        
            <p>The protesters, who had earlier gathered outside the retreat at the Commodore Hotel, were calling on the government to demand a permanent ceasefire and end to the occupation in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Video supplied to the New Zealand Herald shows police leading away one member of the group, which was shouting "shame on you" to National MPs as they boarded a bus.</p>
        
            <p>The person was released without charge.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there were no significant incidents reported in relation to the protest, which was conducted without issues.</p>
        
            <p>The Palestine Solidarity Network has criticised police for its response.</p>
        
            <p>"We are shocked by the excessive force used by police on those exercising their right to protest," the group said on Instagram.</p>
