            <p>The government has allocated $200 million of funding for Auckland's City Rail Link to remove level crossings.</p>
        
            <p>The metro rail project - due to be completed in 2026 - has so far been plagued by cost and time overruns.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Chris Bishop said the level crossings would have caused traffic headaches as trains become more frequent, and are a safety hazard.</p>
        
            <p>At Auckland's level crossings in the decade between 2013 and 2023, Auckland saw almost 70 crashes, plus over 250 pedestrian near-misses and 100 vehicle near misses.</p>
        
            <p>"This is great news for Auckland and will unlock congestion across the city, and enable better flow of traffic," Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Once open next year, CRL will double Auckland's rail capacity and reduce congestion across the city, enabling Aucklanders to get to where they want to go faster.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is committed to unlocking Auckland's traffic chokepoints, and one of the key ways we will do this is by removing level crossings."</p>
        
            <p>The funding is the government's share of the costs of removing several level crossings in Takanini and Glen Innes, and for building three new road bridges, and access bridges at three stations.</p>
        
            <p>The funding allocation must be approved by the NZTA board, expected in April.</p>
        
            <p>The seven priority level crossings for removal are at Spartan Road, Manuroa road, Taka Street, Walters Road, Takaanini Station, Te Mahia Station and Glen Innes Station, the government said.</p>
