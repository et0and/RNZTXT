            <p>The government wants to make remote virtual inspections the default for building consents across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk announced the plan to seek feedback on the move in the second half of this year, saying a video conferencing approach will reduce travel times and delays to get a building consent.</p>
        
            <p>"Remote inspections offer significant productivity gains that make it easier and cheaper to build. However, the use of remote inspections is currently inconsistent across the country, with some councils being reluctant to use it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why the government is progressing work to make remote inspections the default approach across New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Penk said the move would also lower transport emissions, lead to better record keeping and documentation, and reduce the time wasted by increasing flexibility for inspectors and building professionals alike.</p>
