            <p>Police commissioner Richard Chambers says the proposal to scrap an executive role focusing on iwi and communities is not diminishing its importance.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal sent to police staff on Tuesday includes disestablishing 37 executive and support service positions, as well as creating 20 new positions - a net reduction of 17 roles.</p>
        
            <p>There will be fewer deputy chief executives, with one proposal being to disestablish the iwi and communies role.</p>

            <p>Police will still focus on iwi and communities, and the functions would be put into other senior roles in the executive, Chambers told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to invest in particularly in our sworn Māori male and female leaders of the future and there are ways that we can do that.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not diminishing the importance of that role at all. What I'm looking to do is to build that up from a grassroots level.</p>
        
            <p>"More importantly, have an assistant commissioner iwi and communities in place. We have people within the iwi and communities team, not just here in Wellington but across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to focus on building that capability and in particular our police officers, men and woman, who are Māori, Pacific and ethnic - that is what my focus will be, rather than investing in the top layers of the organisation."</p>
        
            <p>"It was "absolutely not" a response to the coalition government's Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said a leaner executive would result in savings to invest in frontline policing.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers sent the proposal to affected staff on Tuesday, and feedback is open until 10 February.</p>
        
            <p>"All feedback will be reviewed and carefully considered before final decisions are made in late February," he said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a lot of very positive feedback. Of course there is always going to be a mix of feedback and we invite some other suggestions before some final decisions are made but overall the vast majority of the feedback that I've had ... at a lot of different levels has been very positive."</p>
