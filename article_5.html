        <h2>'A state of serious grieving' - Politicians across the spectrum on Kiingi Tuheitia's death</h2>
        <p>
Tributes have been paid by political leaders following the death of the Māori King, Kiingi Tuheitia, aged 69.
</p>
        
            <p>A fierce advocate for Māoridom, for unity, and for inclusivity.</p>
        
            <p>Such are the tributes being paid by political leaders following the death of the Māori King, Kiingi Tuheitia, aged 69, early Friday morning, just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is in Tonga for the Pacific Islands Forum, issued a statement, acknowledging Te Kiingi for his "unwavering commitment to his people" and his tireless efforts to uphold the values and traditions of the Kiingitanga.</p>
        
            <p>"I will remember his dedication to Aotearoa New Zealand, his commitment to mokopuna, his passion for te ao Māori, and his vision for a future where all people are treated with dignity and respect.</p>
        
            <p>"I will also remember the kindness he showed me personally whenever I met with him at Turangawaewae."</p>

            <p>Deputy Prime Minister - and NZ First leader - Winston Peters told RNZ's Morning Report that today was a "very, very sad day" for many across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a state of serious grieving, and rightly so."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said Kiingi Tuheitia was right in his constant calls for unity: "Unity is the key ingredient to progress into the future, not differences and not squabbles."</p>
        
            <p>Māori Crown Relations Minister Tama Potaka told Morning Report that Kiingi Tuheitia was a rallying force for unity and a man who respected the dignity and mana of all.</p>
        
            <p>"The King was someone who demonstrated mana motuhake [self-determination], kotahitanga [unity], and most importantly manakitanga [hospitality]."</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, former prime minister Dame Jacinda Ardern described Kiingi Tuheitia as an advocate for Māori, as well as fairness, justice and prosperity.</p>
        
            <p>"You wanted children, young people, and those who have been left behind to have opportunities and hope. You worked tirelessly on building understanding and knowledge of our shared history and in doing so, strengthening Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"And amongst all of that, you made everyone feel welcome - including me. Nga mihi nui, Kingi. Rest easy now."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins also posted his reflections on social media, saying he was saddened and shocked by Kiingi Tuheitia's passing.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiingi Tuheitia was a fierce and staunch advocate, voice and leader, not only for Māoridom - but for a better and more inclusive Aotearoa New Zealand. His commitment to the kaupapa was fearless and unwavering - that's his legacy that we'll all remember fondly."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Morning Report, senior Labour MP Willie Jackson described Kiingi Tuheitia as a humble man who never expected the role but stepped up and stood out.</p>
        
            <p>"One of te ao Māori's great leaders, no doubt about that, no one could bring te ao Māori together like King Tuheitia."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said the King was also not afraid to stray into the political arena.</p>
        
            <p>"He was able to cross over and he was determined to get development for his people and I admire him for that," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was really worried about what the government was doing but that did not stop him from engaging with the government."</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour expressed his "sympathy and sincere condolences" to Kiingi Tuheitia's family and the wider movement: "Our thoughts are with you."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Te Pāti Māori said it was with great sadness that they received the news of Kiingi Tuheitia's death.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi said his death is "deeply mourned".</p>
        
            <p>"Kiingi Tuheitia was grassroots, humble, not fluent or flashy in formalities, yet naturally prepared to serve and lead," Ngarewa-Packer said.</p>
        
            <p>While Waititi said: "His legacy of unification, of mana motuhake and rangatiratanga, will live on through the movement and through te iwi Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Party president John Tamihere said the Kiingitanga gave people hope.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a Māori movement that has never surrendered its mana."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said Kiingi Tuheitia's legacy was one of unity, kindness and truly listening to understand.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiingi Tuheitia's ability to deliver incisive, unapologetic, profound truths on open hearts and ears was a testament to how he navigated the world and embodied tino rangatiratanga.</p>
        
            <p>"His deep passion for this planet and all who lived on it - from our tamariki, to the creatures in our oceans and forests - was palpable... Kiingi Tuheitia saw the nation we could be, and invited us all to live up to it."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick confirmed the Greens will be paying respects to Kiingi Tuheitia but is still planning exactly what that will involve.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Māori King and his wife, Makau Ariki, sat and spoke with her at the koroneihana celebrations, the 18th anniversary of his coronation, about how special and profound it was to see te ao Māori on the international stage at the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>She said he also told her about plans for nations across the Pacific to recognise the legal personhood of whales, and he saw how that would help protect the ecosystem, the people and the planet.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that he was able to see the interconnections between all of those things, between the health of our taiao and the creatures that live within it and ultimately the people that also share this planet, yeah, he was a deeply, deeply wise man.</p>
        
            <p>"And also so deeply unpretentious as well and I think that's why when he spoke, everybody listened - because he didn't deign to speak all too often."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said the best way to honour the King is to uphold his vision of unifying the country, which means upholding He Whakaputanga and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>It was something successive governments had, she said, not done near enough to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously that was a pretty strong flashpoint at koroneihana just last week and I'd hope that this house turns them down a notch and reflects calmly and passionately ... on what it is that has created this nation and how we can move forward together."</p>
