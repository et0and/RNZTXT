            <p>A one-term government, funding for cancer medications and the quality of TVNZ's broadcasting were hot topics of discussion at Labour's lower North Island regional conference in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>During his keynote speech, leader Chris Hipkins told party faithfuls that Labour had a chance to make the coalition a one-term government.</p>
        
            <p>He told them National's tax cuts were the wrong choice when the government had to borrow to fund them. Cancer was also high on his list of concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"I think one of the most reprehensible things that this government have done is extend a promise to those New Zealanders suffering with cancer, and then not deliver on that promise. It was the wrong promise to make in the first place."</p>
        
            <p>He said decisions around what medications get funded should not be the subject of political promises on the campaign trail.</p>
        
            <p>Labour had three goals ahead of the next election, Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first is we need to be a very effective opposition."</p>
        
            <p>The second was to have new ideas and policies that would "capture the imaginations of New Zealanders" when the election did roll round.</p>
        
            <p>Then the third was to rebuild and broaden the Labour movement.</p>
        
            <p>During a question-and-answer session afterwards, Hipkins was asked if he regretted cancelling the proposed RNZ/TVNZ merger.</p>
        
            <p>With the media facing a turbulent few months, a number of job losses have come from the state-owned enterprise.</p>
        
            <p>But Hipkins was still not convinced the merger was the answer.</p>
        
            <p>The two media outlets functioned very differently, with TVNZ operating under a "commercial culture" and RNZ a "quality public broadcasting culture", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no question we need to have quality public broadcasting in New Zealand. I'm sad to say I think Television New Zealand stopped being a quality public broadcaster decades ago, and I think we need to be very careful about making sure that whatever we do, we don't destroy the quality public broadcasting culture that exists within RNZ now."</p>
