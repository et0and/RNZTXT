            <p>All costs associated with travelling to a national apology for survivors of abuse in care will be covered free of charge.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister will make the apology at Parliament on 12 November, which will also be live streamed to public venues in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In July, survivors largely or completely covered the cost of their own travel to Parliament to see the final report of the royal commission of inquiry tabled.</p>
        
            <p>Expressions of interest were now open for each survivor and one support person of their choice to attend Parliament, or an event nearest their home - at the Due Drop Events Centre in Auckland, Shed 6 in Wellington or the Christchurch Town Hall.</p>
        
            <p>Lead Coordination Minister Erica Stanford said the government was making sure as many survivors as possible could attend an apology event.</p>
        
            <p>"Costs associated with travelling to all apology events will be covered, including one night of accommodation for those travelling from outside of an event city. Food costs will also be covered.</p>
        
            <p>"Travel assistance will be provided in forms of air travel, petrol vouchers, gift cards, and train and bus tickets. For survivors who prefer to use their own transport, costs will be reimbursed."</p>
        
            <p>The apology, announced by the prime minister on the day the royal commission report was tabled, was to formally acknowledge the "tremendous harm and the failings of state and faith-based institutions that was perpetuated across New Zealand over decades", Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the apology in November, the government will detail more about the response to the royal commission's final report.</p>
        
            <p>Registrations for attending one of the apology events was open from 12-30 September. If demand for any of the public locations was more than the space available, a balloting process would be used and everyone who registered would be notified by 12 October.</p>
        
            <p>"As many survivors of abuse in care may have never disclosed their abuse, there will be no verification process undertaken for the expressions of interest," Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>"The system will be operated on a trust basis. We ask New Zealanders leave attendance at the events for survivors and their supporters."</p>
