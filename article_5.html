            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's popularity has seen a boost in the latest 1News-Verian poll, while the left and right voting blocs remained steady.</p>
        
            <p>The numbers for the governing parties remained unchanged, with only minor shifts for the opposition compared to the previous poll - Labour and Te Pāti Māori gaining 1 percentage point each while the Greens dropped 2 points.</p>
        
            <p>Of parties not in Parliament, TOP was down 1 point to 1 percent, while New Zeal was up 1 point to 1 percent. About 11 percent of respondents said they did not know who they would vote for, or refused to say.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps the most notable change from the poll was Christopher Luxon's rise in the preferred prime minister rankings, up 5 percentage points to 28 percent. Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick and NZ First leader Winston Peters also saw small increases.</p>
        
            <p>Preferred prime minister:</p>
        
            <p>The poll surveyed 1001 eligible voters and was weighted for demographics, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval. It was conducted between 10 and 14 August.</p>
        
            <p>Polls compare to the most recent poll by the same polling company, as different polls can use different methodologies. They are intended to track trends in voting preferences, showing a snapshot in time, rather than be a completely accurate predictor of the final election result.</p>
