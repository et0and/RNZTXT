The government's finances are worse than expected amid a slowing economy and growing expenses.

            <p>The government's finances worsened more than expected in the past year as inflation and interest rates lifted expenses quicker than than a rise in the tax take.</p>
        
            <p>Final government accounts for the year ended June show a deficit of $12.9 billion compared with forecasts in May of a deficit of $11.1b, and the previous year's $9.4b shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>The accounts showed the impact of a slowing economy on company profits, and higher expenses through wage settlements and higher pension and benefit payments.</p>
        
            <p>A strong labour market and higher interest rates underpinned the increase in tax revenue, but it did not keep pace with the lift in expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the government books were "not in great shape" and made "sobering" reading.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to tidy them up and impose restraint."</p>
        
            <p>She said the previous Labour government had set the budget policies and spending for much of the 2023/24 financial year, but the coalition government's mini-budget in December 2023 had limited the deficit increase by $1b.</p>
        
            <p>However, Willis said the government was looking to drive more value from its spending, but was looking for improved economic growth and productivity to help increase revenue and reduce expenses.</p>
        
            <p>She said near term, spending would be a challenge and about half of next year's allowance for new budget policies of $2.4b had already been committed, but that would not lead to "dramatic change" in planned spending plans.</p>
        
            <p>Willis laid responsibility for much of the current state of the books on the previous Labour administration.</p>
        
            <p>"Government spending has skyrocketed over the last six years and so has government debt."</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition government is committed ... to getting the books back in surplus and starting to bring down net debt as a proportion of gross domestic product."</p>
        
            <p>However, Willis said higher unemployment and an increase in benefit payments were downside risks to spending plans.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the state of the books was not his party's fault.</p>
        
            <p>"This is well after Nicola Willis delivered her first Budget, in fact if you count her mini Budget before Christmas she's now delivered two budgets.</p>
        
            <p>"The days where she could get away with blaming everybody else for her problems are well and truly over."</p>
        
            <p>He said the state of the books proved the coalition's tax cuts were unaffordable.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders will continue to pay the price for those tax cuts well into the future; a price that's disproportionate to any benefit that they might have got from it.</p>
        
            <p>"And it means New Zealanders should be bracing for more public sector cuts, more public service cuts, a health system that is descending further and further into crisis and other public services that will also be facing cuts."</p>
