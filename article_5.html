            <p>Dr Shane Reti has lost his health portfolio in a major reshuffle by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>He will be replaced by Simeon Brown, while also dropping from fourth to ninth in the Cabinet rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Reti was widely expected to lose the portfolio, one which has become a problem area for the government.</p>
        
            <p>Polls show New Zealanders are becoming increasingly concerned at the state of the health sector, which is struggling under staff shortages, governance problems, funding deficits, and the proposal to scale back Dunedin Hospital's rebuild.</p>
