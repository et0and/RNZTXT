            <p>The government has put out new guidance on how public agencies should safely use artificial intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers are pushing for greater use of AI to improve services and efficiency.</p>
        
            <p>One of the guidelines says disinformation and "hallucinations" where AI makes things up, were core issues.</p>
        
            <p>Good quality data was key to avoiding this, and workers should include in any instructions to generative AI that it had the option to say "I do not know" when the model was unsure.</p>
        
            <p>"Never consider generated content as authoritative."</p>
        
            <p>Teams that use AI should be diverse to help avoid bias and discrimination in results, said another guideline.</p>
        
            <p>Digitising Government Minister Judith Collins said the guidance would enable safe and responsible uptake of AI with the highest standards of trust and accountability.</p>
        
            <p>"AI systems are evolving rapidly, and government policies, guidance and use cases will continue to adapt," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Users are being encouraged to join a community of practice, and an expert advisory panel is being set up.</p>
