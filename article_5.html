            <p>Requiring tech companies to pay news organisation is not the right way forward, a media lecturer and campaigner says.</p>
        
            <p>The government announced on Tuesday it would press ahead with an amended Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill which will force tech giants to pay news organisations for their content.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition parties have all voiced in-principle support for the bill. But coalition partner ACT was expected to invoke the 'agree to disagree' provision from its coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Better Public Media's Peter Thompson told Morning Report there was no guarantee the money paid would be put towards the kind of public media content the country needed.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no guarantee that they'll spend in on the sorts of journalism that we currently lack."</p>
        
            <p>It was also "complicated" to figure out how much the news organisations and technology companies each benefited, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The suggestion the Minister would be deciding which tech companies should pay, meant the whole situation could turn into a "lobbyist charter".</p>
        
            <p>"There's also no guarantee that Meta and Google will not actually go ahead with their threats to actually walk away and block news content, as they've done in other countries."</p>
        
            <p>Following the Australian law was "terrible precedent", Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone that understands the model thinks the Australian model is nonsense apart from the Rupert Murdochs who have benefited from it."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said a 3 percent levy on digital advertising was a better option.</p>
