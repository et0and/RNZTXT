            <p>The Dunedin City Council is considering whether to explore a possible unitary authority for Otago, at a meeting this week.</p>
        
            <p>A unitary authority is a territorial authority with regional council responsibilities headed by a mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Kevin Gilbert sent the notion of motion, saying he believed a conversation about governance structure was needed.</p>
        
            <p>The motion recommended that council requests staff to prepare a high-level report for discussions about a possible unitary authority for Otago by December.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors will discuss this at their meeting on Tuesday.</p>
