            <p>Police have been called to a protest in the Bay of Islands where opponents of a housing development say three people were trespassed and one was taken away in handcuffs.</p>
        
            <p>Ōpua residents and local hapū are protesting against a developer's plans for about 13 homes on a headland known as Puketītī, where a contractor resumed work on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to the Kellet Street property at 2.45pm when security guards reported three people were trespassing and refusing to leave.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the matter was resolved without issue but officers would conduct follow-ups to prevent any further incidents.</p>
        
            <p>The protest group said one of their members was taken to Kawakawa police station in handcuffs but later released without charge.</p>
        
            <p>Locals want the land returned to council ownership and protected as a reserve while hapū say it is subject to a Treaty claim.</p>
        
            <p>The long-running protest started in October 2020 but had been quiet since late 2022.</p>
        
            <p>At a public meeting in June, the landowner offered to reduce the number of homes to 13 from the original 17, and to preserve the top of the hill as a lookout.</p>
        
            <p>Protests resumed when vegetation clearance began earlier this month before hapū had met to discuss the offer.</p>
