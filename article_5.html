            <p>The government says New Zealand is not among a group of about 15 countries that have committed to join the coalition of the willing on Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand attache was among military officials from about 30 countries who have been meeting in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>France later said about 15 countries had expressed interest in discussing a new security architecture, and Britain said it was accelerating work on the coalition, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins told RNZ in a statement on Thursday that "New Zealand has not been asked to provide security guarantees at this point".</p>
        
            <p>The talks in Europe were scheduled to carry on, with a leaders' summit on Saturday and further meetings of officials next week.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Defence is participating in discussions about possible post-conflict support for Ukraine," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>Any decision would ultimately be up to Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand continues to support Ukraine's efforts to defend itself from Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion."</p>
        
            <p>Finland said it would definitely be part of any "coalition of the willing".</p>
