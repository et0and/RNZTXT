            <p>Victoria University is speaking to one of its professors about the language they used in an anti-government social media post.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) has warned Victoria University that the comments "may bring the centre into disrepute".</p>
        
            <p>Professor Joanna Kidman heads up the publicly-funded but independent anti-extremism centre, which was set up after the mosque shootings and is funded by the Department of Prime Minister through a charitable trust.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, responding to the government's military boot camp policy, she questioned if it was a "death cult" that "hates children".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet spokesperson Bridget White said Professor Kidman was employed by Victoria University and not a public servant.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has conveyed to the university via the Trust its concerns that Professor Kidman's comments may bring the centre into disrepute."</p>
        
            <p>ACT public service spokesperson Todd Stephenson said she should be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Kidman has not responded to RNZ's requests for comment.</p>
