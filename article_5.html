            <p>The Government has begun the search for two new ferries to replace the problem-plagued Interislander fleet.</p>
        
            <p>Rail Minister Winston Peters has this morning announced it has started a worldwide search for two medium-sized ships, and will engage with international ship builders that can deliver the ferries by 2029.</p>
        
            <p>"This will narrow the list of potential ship builders to those able to strike a deal, ensuring no time is wasted when we issue the ship specifications later this year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, the Government is also asking eligible parties, such as maritime transport operators and infrastructure investors, to put forward https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/536384/interislander-replacement-opposition-astounded-disgusted-over-omnishambles alternative ideas for the delivery of ferry services].</p>
