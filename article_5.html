            <p>Handwriting, tidal waves of property problems, and a clash with a former minister featured when the Education and Workforce Select Committee reviewed the government's education budget on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford faced questions about the government's focus on teaching children to read using structured literacy approaches based on the sounds represented by letters and groups of letters.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford asserted structured literacy was the only effective way to teach children to read, prompting her predecessor, Labour MP Jan Tinetti to interject "That's not true".</p>
        
            <p>"Well, name something else, Ms Tinetti," Stanford responded.</p>
        
            <p>"I can actually," Tinetti said and went on to state that some structured literacy approaches were known to put too much "cognitive load" on children, damaging their learning.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford also faced questions about the Budget allocation of $780 million over four years to cover depreciation of school buildings.</p>
        
            <p>She told the committee the increase was based on a revaluation of school buildings and was important for ensuring classrooms were kept up to scratch.</p>
        
            <p>She said some rooms were in a terrible state.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been into schools that have got buildings sliding into lakes, black mould, mushrooms. I've been sent pictures of chairs falling through floors. We do have a tidal wave of these sorts of issues," Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford also backed calls from her Ministerial Advisory Group on English and maths for a greater focus on handwriting.</p>
        
            <p>She said handwriting was important for children's literacy because children who could write naturally were better able to concentrate on the content of their work.</p>
        
            <p>"Many schools are doing handwriting and it's fantastic, but it's not consistent," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The government would look at how it could include handwriting in its push to improve children's literacy, Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>There was no evidence about the effect of many education initiatives and the government was focused on ensuring money was spent on things that were proved to work, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the government was also looking closely at learning support for children with disabilities with the aim of focusing funding on the most effective interventions.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, Tertiary Education Minister Penny Simmonds appeared before the committee to answer questions about the government's tertiary education budget.</p>
        
            <p>She said switching the fees free policy to pay for the last rather than first year of study would reward tertiary students who completed their qualifications.</p>
        
            <p>The change would save $800m over four years in money that would otherwise be spent on people who did not complete their qualification, Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the policy might improve retention rates but that was not its goal.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not set up for incentivising people to continue, it's a reward for those that have continued and that have been successful and it shows a better value for government spend of that funding," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Waiving fees for people who did not continue their studies beyond the first year was not a good use of public money, Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds also said polytechnics were under-utilising property worth $131m and selling that property would reduce their operating costs and improve their viability.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had told Te Pūkenga in a letter last month to consider asset sales.</p>
        
            <p>"Some work had been done in identifying around $131m of assets that were either under-utilised or un-utilised that were being looked at for consideration of being divested from Te Pūkenga and I was making it very clear that that work should continue," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Education Review Office chief executive Nicholas Pole told the committee it had just completed an investigation into initial teacher education.</p>
        
            <p>"Subjects like maths, science, technology were areas where primary school teachers particularly struggled," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Secretary for Education Iona Holsted clarified expectations about the use of contractors in light of staff cuts at the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry had always employed fixed-term contractors to help with curriculum work and that would continue, she said.</p>
