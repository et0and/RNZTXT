            <p>Kiingitanga have a new leader and all eyes are now on how Kuini Nga Wai Hono i Te Po will continue her father's call for Māori to unite against government policies.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year iwi turned out in force at Tūrangawaewae in response to a rare royal proclamation from King Tuheitia to come together.</p>
        
            <p>It followed nationwide protests against the new coalition's moves to end co-governance policy and reinterpret the Treaty principles.</p>
        
            <p>Kuini Nga wai hono i te po was welcomed as the new Māori monarch as her father, the king of kotahitanga, was buried at Taupiri Maunga yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Those in the crowds expressed enthusiastic support for the King's successor and faith in her ability to continue his legacy of kotahitanga.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that she's gonna do a great job and that she's real independent," a young woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Good decision! We were rooting for her!" another young woman added.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's definitely the good choice for our people," a woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely. She's regal, she's regal bro. We're in for a good reign. I won't see the next one, I was here for the last one 18 years ago, but my kids will be here for the next one so we're in good hands," a man said.</p>

            <p>"100 percent, I definitely agree, and I think with her being so young still she'll be able to connect a lot younger to our rangatahi as well and they will be able to learn a lot from her," a woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Amazing, perfect decision. She's just genuinely a beautiful person so I think she'll make a beautiful queen," another woman said.</p>
        
            <p>It was only two weeks ago when Kiingi Tuheitia reiterated his call to bring Māori together.</p>
        
            <p>"The key to moving forward is to trust one another and support each other. You know sometimes we make things hard for ourselves. Let us embrace this kotahitanga and just roll with it."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Now, the mantle to carry that legacy on has been passed to his daughter, Kuini Nga wai hono i te po, who has been chosen by the Kiingitanga counsel Tekau-mā-rua.</p>
        
            <p>Tainui leader and historian Tom Roa said she was the woman for the job.</p>
        
            <p>"She will make the job fit her, the woman. Every iwi ... carried that sentiment but it's more a sentiment, that commitment to kotahitanga."</p>
        
            <p>The traditions of the Kiingitanga are strong and run deep, as acknowledged by Taatere McLeod, who spoke on behalf of the hau kaainga [local iwi] during the tangi.</p>
        
            <p>"A movement that was established 166 years ago as a response to some terrible, challenging and heinous times experienced by the people not only of this tribe but around the country."</p>
        
            <p>Navigating Crown and Māori relations is not a new feat for the movement.</p>
        
            <p>Former Minister of Treaty Negotiations Andrew Little said the Kiingitanga was playing a crucial role in te ao Māori right now.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a unifying movement, a unifying force that's crucial now because of the various threats that seem to be in play in terms of the progress that has been made with the Crown-Māori relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to continue to make progress. The Crown's mana has to be restored and the Treaty fully respected. We still have a ways to go."</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has been criticised for policies some say are taking the country backwards in regards to race relations.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka was the "government face" at Tuurangawaewae yesterday.</p>

            <p>He has known the new queen since she was young and knows the importance of face to face engagement</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly the prime minister has taken a little bit of time over the last seven to nine months to engage with and to face up, kanohi ki te kanohi, with King Tuheitia and the Makau Ariki and I expect that engagement will continue.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course we've got a number of quite challenging topics on the horizon."</p>
        
            <p>For Potaka, his focus is a thriving economy and better outcomes for all.</p>
        
            <p>"Through that we can really have the space, place and energy to celebrate what's really important to us, which is our cultural identity and the responsibilities that we have to Te Taiao and to our awa and to our maunga.</p>
        
            <p>"And those things are perpetual. Government policies probably come and go, but the need for us to look after our environment, the need for us to look after our people, not only Māori but all New Zealanders, pervades."</p>
