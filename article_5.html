            <p>Labour MPs will be not be joining the government in being welcomed on to the Treaty grounds at Waitangi, but a pōwhiri for opposition parties will take place two days prior.</p>
        
            <p>Labour deputy leader Carmel Sepuloni told First Up she did not know who made the decision for the change, but it was different from past years when MPs across Parliament were welcomed together at Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>She said the government could expect a very similar response to what they faced at Rātana Pā, if not more heightened.</p>
        
            <p>"We were received warmly, and we're often challenged at Rātana as well as received warmly."</p>
        
            <p>She said a challenge this year from one of the speakers was for Labour to ensure the current government only last for one term, for Labour to be ready to reinstate the policies that have been dropped, and continue to support Māori and make progress for all New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been challenged in quite a robust way in the past, but this year from what I saw, [the government] were challenged heavily on their agenda regarding Māori, they were questioned about their motives and they really were hit up big time about the fact that the government's agenda is going to take Māori backwards.</p>
        
            <p>"It was interesting to watch … certainly it looked like National's trying to wash their hands of this decision to look at the principles or redefine the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, but they have allowed this to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"They have agreed in their coalition agreement that this will go to Select Committee and we know what's going to happen. It is going to create divisiveness, it already has. And so they have to take responsibility for having an active hand in that divisiveness."</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni said she thought it was cowardly that ACT leader David Seymour did not go to Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've seen in the past is despite the fact that there may be debate that makes politicians feel uncomfortable, they generally show up. And so, it was cowardly of David Seymour not to show up, particularly given so much of his agenda, his narrative, his rhetoric, has been with respect to Māori, so he should have been there."</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, National deputy leader Nicola Willis told First Up that the Treaty of Waitangi is "clearly" a partnership between the Crown and iwi. It followed Seymour's claim that he believed the Treaty was not a partnership.</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni said she was not comfortable with National's promise the Treaty would not be undermined.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not comfortable in the decisions that have been made. That doesn't show leadership. They're saying they're not going to support something even though they've allowed it to go to Select Committee.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to take up the time of the politicians and the officials. It's also going to take up money. There's a lack of leadership in even allowing this to go through, so I'm not comfortable with the promise or the direction and the decision-making that's been undertaken by Christopher Luxon and the government in general."</p>
        
            <p>NZ First leader Winston Peters and deputy leader Shane Jones delivered fiery speeches at Rātana, and faced some heckling. Sepuloni said she had not seen a response like it at the Pā before.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very confrontational. It was very uncomfortable to watch, and there's a level of arrogance, really in the way in which the issues were approached by the politicians from the government.</p>
        
            <p>"That was what incited the heckling and the response from those that were in attendance."</p>
