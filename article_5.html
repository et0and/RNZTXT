        <h2>Live: 'You started the fire, David. You have to take the heat' - Treaty hīkoi continues south</h2>
        <p>
The co-leader of Te Pāti Māori says a haka interrupting the vote on the Treaty Principles Bill was not an assault or threat to any MP.

            <p>Co-leader of Te Pāti Māori Debbie Ngarewa-Packer says a haka interrupting the vote on the Treaty Principles Bill was not an assault or threat to any MP.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament was suspended yesterday because of a haka begun by Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke joined by the Gallery and Opposition MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer denied that she or anyone in her party fired an imaginary gun in ACT leader David Seymour's direction.</p>
        
            <p>"You started the fire, David, you have to take the heat, noone that I know did that ... you have enflamed and deliberately antagonised Māori."</p>
        
            <p>She defended the performance of the haka in Parliament at the end of such a critical debate. It continued a pattern of her party breaking the rules because it was an environment not geared towards the needs of the country's Indigenous population.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing else more critical for Māori. There is no way that the House has ever in the history of the existence of Parliament been able to tinker with te Tiriti."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the fifth day of Te hīkoi mō te Tiriti will soon be underway in Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi will move from Apumoana Marae, where they stayed last night, to Village Green park for a 10am activation.</p>
