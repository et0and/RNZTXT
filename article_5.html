            <p>Tributes are flowing in for former National Party Minister Nikki Kaye, who has died after a long battle with cancer at age 44.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood she died at the weekend. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 at 36 years old.</p>
        
            <p>Her former colleague, Maggie Barry, posted a photo of the pair on Facebook with the caption "farewell my friend".</p>
        
            <p>Others have also chimed in to praise Kaye, National's deputy leader under Todd Muller, for her "tireless dedication" to her work.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki's contribution to our party, her community, and New Zealand has left an indelible mark," Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and deputy National Party leader Nicola Willis said in a joint statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki was a remarkable person and a crusader for what she believed in, and her contribution has left our country in a better place."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said Kaye was one of the bravest Parliamentarians New Zealand had seen.</p>
        
            <p>"She was not only a colleague, but a brilliant friend to many of us. She was fiercely committed to her constituents and her values and she contributed so much of her soul to this country and our party.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>Devastating news. Nikki was one of the bravest parliamentarians New Zealand has had, fiercely advancing the liberal values and causes she believed in. She loved the National Party and contributed so much of her soul to it. I will be forever grateful for the contribution she made…</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said today's news was incredibly sad.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki Kaye and I were opposite numbers at Parliament in the Education portfolio, and I would describe us very fondly as frenemies," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a lot of respect for her and how she went about her work.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't agree with all of her decisions, but found her immensely reasonable. She poured her heart and soul into the electorate and she always pushed for better for children and young people."</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Kaye worked incredibly hard, cared passionately about her electorate, and was always willing to agree an idea was good, or bad, based on her values rather than just politics.</p>
        
            <p>"We laughed a lot over the years, and while we may have had some decent debates, nothing ever felt genuinely personal. I'm sorry that I never knew Nikki was unwell again, if I had, I'd liked to have talked with her just one more time."</p>
        
            <p>Others also posted to social media to pay tribute:</p>
        
            <p>I’m so saddened to hear of the passing of friend Nikki Kaye, former National Party MP and Minister at only 44 from a long battle with cancer. I have lots of happy memories of times with her.</p>
        
            <p>RIP Nikki Kaye.  You achieved more in 44 years than most would do in twice that. You will be missed.</p>
        
            <p>Such sad news - @nikkikaye was the most phenomenally, hardworking Minister who was so passionate about innovation in education and continued leading in this space globally after leaving parliament. A huge loss ❤️ https://t.co/CyWdE3TpsW pic.twitter.com/GV7eGCsuAo</p>
        
            <p>Kaye had openly spoken about her health before retiring from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>She was in Parliament for 12 years, entering in 2008 (aged 28), before announcing in July 2020 she wouldn't contest the upcoming election.</p>
