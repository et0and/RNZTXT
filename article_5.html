            <p>The government is consulting on whether to follow Australia in banning engineered stone benchtops, or to stop short of one.</p>
        
            <p>Australia banned the use and manufacture of engineered stone in July after a concerted campaign focused on people who have become seriously ill.</p>
        
            <p>Workplace Safety Minister Brooke van Velden said workplace inspections had shown up patchy risk management here.</p>
        
            <p>"While I do not believe there is currently evidence to support a full ban of the product, I encourage submitters to provide their views, and the implications of that stance," she said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>She was open to a full range of regulatory responses.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe has taken enforcement against 239 businesses over engineered stone since 2019. "The range of risks assessed has expanded," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Engineered stone is made by mixing finely crushed rock with a polymeric resin. In its solid form it is safe, but shaping it creates dangerous dust.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has already been looking at the regulations for months.</p>
        
            <p>It told the minister in January 2024 there was "a growing body of evidence of harm".</p>
        
            <p>The new consultation comes five years after the first safety alert issued by WorkSafe, warning the dust can cause chronic silicosis or accelerated silicosis that can be fatal.</p>
        
            <p>The Asthma Foundation, doctors and unions have called this year for New Zealand to follow Australia in a ban.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that we use an evidence-based approach and consider a range of tools to tackle this issue in a New Zealand context," van Velden said.</p>
        
            <p>One message that emerged from a nationwide consultation with industry was that businesses wanted more and better guidance in general, because they "do not receive proper guidance" on how to stay safe, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The wider risks from respirable crystalline silica, aside from engineered stone, are part of the consultation.</p>
