            <p>Political leaders and members of the community have been gathering in Auckland to pay their respects to Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins, who died last week.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā, 49, collapsed and died during a charity event in the Auckland CBD on 21 February.</p>
        
            <p>His body is lying in state in Onehunga for three days leading up to his funeral.</p>
        
            <p>A steady stream of mourners arrived at the Tipene Funeral home in Onehunga on Monday to pay their respects to a beloved community leader.</p>
        
            <p>Tangaloa Sa Fata Meafou, Fa'anānā's cousin, was among them and described the emotional scene inside.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of them inside, they were crying, and [it was] hard for them to do their testimony about Efeso, they said it's really hard because he [did] a lot for people,"</p>
        
            <p>She said Fa'anānā was being remembered as someone who touched many lives.</p>
        
            <p>"People know that he's a humble man," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a really, really good person."</p>

            <p>Green Party co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw were in attendance, as well as MP Chlöe Swarbrick and Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins.</p>
        
            <p>Singing could be heard from inside the funeral home, as mourners embraced each other.</p>
        
            <p>One mourner, Li'amanaia, said Fa'anānā was an important member of his community.</p>
        
            <p>"Efeso gave his all, and he gave his wisdom and shared it with our community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think, right now, the family needs that community to support the wife and their beautiful two daughters."</p>
        
            <p>He said Fa'anānā left behind a lasting legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"His legacy lives on," Li'amanaia said</p>
        
            <p>"He left some really big shoes that no one can fill."</p>
        
            <p>Another mourner remembered F'anānā for his sense of humour.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time you give him a mic to go on stage, he was one person that he would make you laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just a god-gifted person, and we are very sad, very saddened to hear that he is gone."</p>
        
            <p>Over the weekend, multiple fake profiles appeared on Facebook impersonating Fa'anānā and advertising livestream links.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Tipene Funerals said there were community pages set up to share grief, but any impersonating Fa'anānā were a hoax.</p>
        
            <p>The road around the funeral home has been closed, and will remain so for the three days leading up to the funeral on Thursday.</p>
