            <p>MPs won't be taking the mainstage at Auckland's Big Gay Out this year as organisers rethink how they engage with politicians.</p>
        
            <p>The annual event celebrating rainbow communities runs during Pride month in February.</p>
        
            <p>First held in 1999, it's attended by over 10,000 people. This year's event is 16 February.</p>
        
            <p>Burnett Foundation Aotearoa, which hosts the event, says it is taking the time to review how it engages with politicians at its events "to ensure not just the advancement of our advocacy efforts but also the safety of our community".</p>
        
            <p>"Politicians are more than welcome to attend Big Gay Out, and political parties will be briefed on our advocacy priorities for the event, as well as the key community and health promotion activities on the day.</p>
        
            <p>"However, this year our stage is just for talent.</p>
        
            <p>"We are of course continuing to advocate directly for the issues that impact our communities through our organisation's policy."</p>
        
            <p>Burnett Foundation Aotearoa interim general manager Alex Anderson told RNZ politicians who usually attend Big Gay Out were informed before the public announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect MPs will still be in attendance as guests, and two opposition political parties have booked stalls in the ANZ Big Gay Marketplace."</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the foundation's advocacy priorities have been developed alongside the Rainbow Support Collective and other HIV community based organisations.</p>
        
            <p>Politicans will be encouraged to discuss these issues throughout the day with community members and the media but Anderson would not yet reveal what these are.</p>

            <p>In previous years, political parties were given a slot in the timetable to speak from the mainstage.</p>
        
            <p>The inclusion of political parties at Pride events has often been controversial.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon abruptly left the event after being confronted by protesters.</p>
        
            <p>Burnett Foundation did not respond when asked if this played into its decision this year.</p>
        
            <p>The government is currently making changes to a number of areas that affect rainbow communities.</p>
        
            <p>It has signalled its intention to consider regulating the prescribing of puberty blockers in gender affirming care, and opened public consultation on the matter.</p>
        
            <p>Sports Minister Chris Bishop has asked Sport New Zealand to review and update its guidelines for the inclusion of transgender people in community sport.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford says the government will rewrite the relationships and sexuality education curriculum for the first time in nearly 20 years.</p>
