        <h2>'Triple-whammy' for Wellington hospitality sector as public service shrinks</h2>
        <p>
Ministries and agencies are looking to axe jobs to meet the government's demand to trim budgets, and most of those will be in the capital.

            <p>The hospitality sector in Wellington says it is looking at a challenging few months ahead, as hundreds of public service jobs are set to be cut.</p>
        
            <p>Ministries and agencies are looking to axe jobs to meet the government's demand to trim budgets, and most of those will be in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality New Zealand chief executive Steve Armitage says Wellington bars and restaurants are already dealing with various pressures, including the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition we're heading into winter months, which traditionally are quite a bit quieter, so the impacts of what we're hearing in terms of the cuts around, you know, ministries and government departments, are yet to be seen.</p>
        
            <p>"And you throw in that employment uncertainty and effectively, we have a bit of a triple-whammy to deal with."</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has directed ministries and agencies to slash expenditure by either 6.5 percent or 7.5 percent to help reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Armitage said his association has been getting fairly consistent reports from its Wellington members that trading is already down.</p>
        
            <p>"The day-to-day trade is certainly expected to get a little bit tougher over the next few months. And hopefully, you know, businesses have been able to bank a little bit over the summer period in the way that they usually do to help tide them through the winter season."</p>
        
            <p>As of now, at least 845 job losses have been signalled, according to figures made public by ministries and the Public Service Association.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Employment Louise Upston earlier this week said job losses in the public sector were "unfortunate", but the government had to ensure agencies were exercising restraint.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time as cutting its workforce, the government was planning to bring back targets for the public service.</p>
