            <p>A woman facing possible deportation from Australia says it is "devastating" the country is hardening its stance on people like her.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised his government would stop deporting people with criminal histories who had spent most of their lives in Australia, but were New Zealand-born and unable to become Australian citizens.</p>
        
            <p>But a new directive from Australia's Immigration Minister Andrew Giles, announced on Friday, effectively reneged on that promise, stripping back the directive to give more weight to a person's ties to Australia before deporting them.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has criticised the move, saying the changes are wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Haley Rukuwai was just six when she moved with her parents across the Tasman from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She has now spent 35 years in Australia and all of her close family - including her children, who have Australian citizenship - live there.</p>
        
            <p>Rukuwai is currently being held in a detention centre after serving 16 months in prison for a range of charges, including possession of drugs, breaches of bail, driving while disqualified, failure to appear, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle and breach of a domestic violence order.</p>
        
            <p>Her offending occurred after a relationship breakdown, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My marriage broke up, we separated and the divorce was just really ugly, custody battles... and I guess I didn't cope."</p>
        
            <p>She started using drugs, eventually lost custody of her children and became homeless.</p>
        
            <p>Rukuwai said the breach of domestic violence was the result of a text message she sent her ex-husband after her child returned from a weekend with him with a bite mark, bruise and story of being neglected.</p>
        
            <p>"I was obviously mad and threatened to do harm if it ever happened again. While I was just letting off steam, it was used against me and I suffered for it.</p>
        
            <p>"I hate to seem like I'm trying to downplay the seriousness of domestic violence because I do not condone it and was an actual victim of it myself, but I think the way it was used against me was far too harsh."</p>
        
            <p>She has been in the detention centre, waiting to hear whether she will be deported, since December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in detention longer than my entire jail sentence, when does this end?</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to be in here and doing everything you can, which is not a lot, to show that you deserve a second chance," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Albanese's promise to stop deporting people like her had been "a glimmer of hope", she said.</p>
        
            <p>The news announced on Friday was "devastating".</p>
        
            <p>"For that to be taken away, it's like, 'Oh my god', it doesn't look good.</p>
        
            <p>"It's destroying lives, it's destroying families and we're all suffering."</p>

            <p>Filipa Payne, from the advocacy group Route 501, has slammed the Australian government's decision, calling it "a political move".</p>
        
            <p>There were people in detention centres for crimes like graffiti and shoplifting, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Payne pointed out the treatment New Zealanders in Australia received compared to Australians in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been structured out of Australia's social service system for years now and our people have had no support in a country that continues to want us to come into it."</p>
        
            <p>She had a message for anyone thinking about moving or travelling to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"I say 'come home, you're at risk.'</p>
        
            <p>"I say to New Zealanders, 'don't enter that country even on holiday. You possibly could end up in detention.'"</p>
