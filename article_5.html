        <h2>100,000 guns put on Firearms Registry</h2>
        <p>
A gun store owner believes licensed firearms owners are yet to register more than a million weapons in protest against the legislation.

            <p>More than 100,000 firearms have been entered into the new Firearms Registry since it was launched in June.</p>
        
            <p>It requires the country's roughly 235,000 licensed gun holders to register their firearms using an online system by mid-2028.</p>
        
            <p>Te Tari PÅ«reke - Firearms Safety Authority executive director Angela Brazier said close to 10 percent of those licence holders had registered, with the South Island leading the way.</p>
        
            <p>The registry aimed to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands and digitising the system helped to detect illegal activity, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Along with preventing the sale and purchase of stolen firearms, the registry provides a better way for police to trace where firearms used by criminals have come from."</p>
        
            <p>But Gun Supplies owner Don Perry said many licence holders were delaying registering their firearms as long as possible before the scheme became compulsory in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>"People are just anti-government legislation when it comes to gun control.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the firearms owners have been through hell, and this is one way of showing their objection to one part they can control for the next few years."</p>
        
            <p>He said gun sales had dropped by nearly 75 percent, while ammunition purchases were increasing.</p>
        
            <p>He was unsure how long his six-person business would be able to endure the slump.</p>
        
            <p>"Business has been s..., absolute s... since the register's come in. Most just do not want to register their firearms, hence the reason sales have just stopped because of it. We're just going backwards fast," Perry said.</p>
        
            <p>Ammunition was the one item which was bucking the trend.</p>
        
            <p>"Ammunition sales are up. It's the one thing we're continuing to sell," Perry said.</p>
        
            <p>Council of Licensed Firearms Owners Hugh Devereux-Mack was surprised so few firearms licence holders had engaged with the register.</p>
        
            <p>"It wouldn't surprise if people are purchasing ammunition ahead of that becoming a triggering event specifically to avoid having to register their firearms in general."</p>
        
            <p>He said owners had security concerns about how their data was being held and processed. Police had been unable "to build a trust and confidence" that data would be safe.</p>
        
            <p>Devereux-Mack said firearms owners could be holding off in the hope the new government would scrap the register.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who does have an activating circumstance, whether they move houses, apply for a new licence, get it renewed or purchase or sell a firearm must register and as a licensed firearms owner that is their requirement by law.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we do know many are avoiding those circumstances if possible, specifically to find out what's going to happen in future."</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury - the area with the most licence holders - had the highest number of firearms registered, with 14,289.</p>
        
            <p>Southern and Central districts were not far behind with more than 12,000 registered in each district, while 10,098 firearms were registered in Bay of Plenty and more than 8000 in Waitemata and Waikato districts.</p>
        
            <p>She thanked gun owners who had already filed their weapons into the registry, and encouraged others to get onboard by going to www.firearmssafetyauthority.govt.nz or calling 0800 844 431 during business hours.</p>
        
            <p>"When fully rolled out, the registry will provide a picture of all lawfully held firearms and arms items in New Zealand," Brazier said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will give greater transparency when firearms are changing hands and ultimately make the availability of firearms to the black market more difficult."</p>
        
            <p>Tasman and Wellington gun owners have registered more than 7000 firearms each, and there were 5839 firearms in the system at Counties Manukau, 5313 in Eastern district, 4420 in Auckland City, 4235 in Northland and 512 in other locations.</p>
