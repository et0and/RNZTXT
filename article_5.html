            <p>The Chief Human Rights Commissioner said it's encouraging to see that a large number of New Zealanders have made submissions on the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions online closed just before midnight on Tuesday 7 January, while hard copies can still be posted or delivered to Parliament before 5pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation - which proposes to rewrite the treaty principles as they are defined by the courts - has attracted widespread opposition, with tens of thousands of people marching against it when it passed its first reading in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The commissioner Stephen Rainbow said it was positive to see many New Zealanders engaged with the bill.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's fantastically encouraging that so many New Zealanders are actually engaged in the future of our country, that they want to submit on this bill, and I think that's a really really positive indication about the level of engagement around something that's really critical for our future," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The bill is clearly an example of looking at the future of the country and how we work together to create a successful future for all the people that live here.</p>
        
            <p>"And the fact that so many people actually are interested in that, engaged in that, want to submit, I think is a very very positive sign," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow said due the need for political neutrality in his role, he has not made a submission.</p>
        
            <p>"The human rights commissioner role is a really important one of holding government to account, shining the bright light of justice into every aspect of society, and to do that one has to be neutral, and that's very much what I aspire to be," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow said he needs to ensure that he can work across the political spectrum when it comes to addressing really critical human rights issues.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow was appointed Human Rights Commissioner in August 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The appointment had prompted concern from some, including Labour and the Greens - given Rainbow's pro-Israel views and comments about "trans agenda" on social media in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow had told Morning Report that an Auckland Transport investigation had cleared him over accusations of transphobia.</p>
