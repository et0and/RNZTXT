            <p>The government plans to scale back the number of rules agencies must follow when tendering contracts, which it says will make it easier for New Zealand businesses to access government contracts collectively worth $50b a year.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, government agencies must follow 71 rules when tendering contracts, but Minister for Economic Growth Nicola Willis wants to scrap 24 of them, which she said are redundant or unecessary, duplicate content, repeat staturory and regulatory requirements, or have never been applied in practice.</p>

            <p>"Reducing the number of rules will streamline and simplify the process for New Zealand businesses."</p>
        
            <p>Willis has instead proposed a new 'economic benefit' test, where suppliers will have to demonstrate how they will deliver economic benefits for contracts above the value thresholds of $100,000 for goods, services, and refurbishment works, and $9m for construction works.</p>
        
            <p>According to the consultation document released by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, agencies will have to consider the following opportunities to deliver economic benefit:</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the changes closes on 9 April.</p>
