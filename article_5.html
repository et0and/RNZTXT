            <p>Labour MP and former trade minister Damien O'Connor has removed a social media post he shared online that seems to justify Hamas' 7 October attack on Israel, but he has not apologised.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party says O'Connor must formally say sorry or be stripped of his role as Labour's associate spokesperson on foreign affairs.</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor had reposted a video of a speech by retired US Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson on X / Twitter, along with the quote: "Palestinians have every right to do whatever they did on October 7th".</p>
        
            <p>The post was deleted from O'Connor's page shortly before midday Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Monday, ACT issued a media release, denouncing O'Connor's actions as "extreme and hateful".</p>
        
            <p>ACT MP Simon Court, perhaps Israel's most ardent defender in Parliament, told RNZ that O'Connor had gone "far too far" by sharing the post.</p>

            <p>"Hamas-led Palestinians invaded Israel, killed over 1000 people, took over 100 hostages, committed atrocities on a scale not seen since the Holocaust in World War Two," Court said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no world in which what Damien O'Connor said is okay."</p>
        
            <p>Court demanded Labour leader Chris Hipkins reprimand his senior MP and remove him from his position.</p>
        
            <p>"[O'Connor] shouldn't be speaking on behalf of one of New Zealand's largest and oldest political parties and saying things that are essentially the promotion of terrorism and a pogrom."</p>
        
            <p>Asked by RNZ for a response, Labour issued a brief statement on behalf of O'Connor, noting that the post had been removed but offering no explanation or apology.</p>
        
            <p>"It's intolerable to see civilians continue to suffer disproportionately as innocent victims in this conflict," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"We call on the National government to take stronger action on this situation, including recognition of Palestine and by intervening in the [International Court of Justice] case brought by South Africa against Israel."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ also asked for a response from Hipkins. A spokesperson replied: "Damien acknowledged his mistake and removed the retweet himself. No further action is being taken in this case".</p>
        
            <p>Court said Hipkins needed to stop prevaricating and make Labour's position clear.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwi Jewish families and Israelis who live here must be quite horrified by what they've heard this Labour former minister say," Court said.</p>
        
            <p>"Either Damien O'Connor... has fallen for the trick, or he truly believes that what Hamas-led Palestinians did on that day is okay.</p>
        
            <p>"Hipkins needs to front up and say, is that Labour Party policy?"</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Labour MP Duncan Webb posted and then deleted a video on social media featuring pro-Palestinian protesters chanting at the prime minister: "How many kids did you kill today".</p>
        
            <p>ACT has positioned itself as the most pro-Israel party in Parliament, with leader David Seymour citing the large Jewish community in his electorate.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour last week requested that Foreign Minister Winston Peters consult the party on New Zealand's position on Israel before making significant decisions on it.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand, the week before, had voted in favour of a UN resolution in support of Palestine, at odds with Australia and Canada which both abstained.</p>
        
            <p>Discussing the vote, Peters told RNZ that Israel had the right to defend itself "but there comes a time when you cannot maintain that argument when so many innocent people become the victims of your defence."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon last week said New Zealand's position was "clear-minded and very sensible" given the risk of contagion through the region.</p>
        
            <p>Asked by AAP whether Israel's military response to the 7 October attacks was disproportionate, Luxon responded simply: "yes".</p>
        
            <p>Posed the same question by RNZ on Monday, Court offered a contrary response: "I've seen no evidence of that from here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"What we have seen is Israel being incredibly targeted... Unfortunately, these terrorist organisations choose to hide among civilian populations and use their own people as human shields."</p>
        
            <p>Israel declared war after Hamas militants invaded Israeli territory on 7 October, killing more than 1100 people and kidnapping about 250 more, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military response, according to Gaza's health authorities.</p>
