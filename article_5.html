            <p>The first New Zealanders evacuated from New Caledonia should be back in Auckland tonight.</p>
        
            <p>A C-130 Hercules took off for Nouméa this afternoon in what is the first of a series of flights to help those stranded.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fully expected they'll be back in Auckland tonight," Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>Since Peters' briefing, the NZDF Hercules has landed at Noumea's Magenta airport, and began its return flight - first of a series to pick up stranded travellers - about 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>It is a domestic airport much closer to the city than the international airport, which is still closed.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the NZDF has had to take a smaller plane so around 50 people will be on the first flight.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said New Zealand was working with Australia, having received requests for help from other countries.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific Island countries need our help and indeed I can tell you countries you'd be most surprised about have also asked for help.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to get the job done and when we have we'll tell you what the details are."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the Defence Force had been poised to start evacuations but had to wait until the French government gave them the green light.</p>
        
            <p>"We were charged with action getting our team ready and within an hour of knowing, that plane was on its way."</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a lot of hard work by the Foreign Affairs team and all those involved, including waiting up until 2.30am last night to find out what the last message might be."</p>

            <p>He would not be drawn on whether or not the approval for passage through Magenta Airport - a domestic airport about 4km from the centre of Nouméa - could have come through faster.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is they've got to make sure the roads are clear, that we can get people safely from where most of them are to Magenta Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a size matter for our aeroplanes and so that's why we're constricted to what we've got here now.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to trust that the flag's gone up because they can be certain it will be safe but you never know.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a difficult circumstance. I'm just grateful for their help and their cooperation."</p>
        
            <p>It was likely the next flight would leave for Noumea on Wednesday morning, he said.</p>
