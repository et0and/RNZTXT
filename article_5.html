            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has shared a Christmas message to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"From our family to yours, we hope you have a very Happy Christmas," Luxon posted, along with a Christmas tree and Santa emoji, on social media.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Luxon also shared a video message, with the caption: "Happy Christmas New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a massive year, a tough one for a lot of people, and a better year than the last for so many.</p>
        
            <p>"The Christmas season often brings out the best in us, the willingness to lend a hand, to spend time being selfless, to think about others, and to help someone in need.</p>
        
            <p>"And I saw that this month when Amanda and I joined the 750 people in my electorate of Botany, packing boxes for those in need this Christmas. I know people have been doing this across New Zealand, so I want to thank everyone who has given their time and their energy to help your fellow New Zealander this Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"And for those working over the break in our hospitals, police, surf life-saving, Coast Guard, firefighters, and everyone working paid or unpaid like our farmers, retail, and hospitality workers, and more.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you. Thank you so much for the work that you do keeping us safe and keeping the country running.</p>
        
            <p>"Now the great privilege of this job is every day I get to meet Kiwis who share with me their aspirations and challenges, which is what makes me more determined to get New Zealand back on track, and realising all of the fabulous potential that exists in this country.</p>
        
            <p>"And of course, there is so much more for us to do as a Government, and I look forward to getting into that work in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"But for now, I hope that everyone has a fantastic Christmas, and a very happy New Year."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon later shared a photo of himself, his wife Amanda, his daughter Olivia, and son William wearing matching pyjamas.</p>
