            <p>ACT MP Mark Cameron made an impassioned plea to Parliament, urging more assistance for rural communities, following the death of his 22-year-old son.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron's son, Brody, died in May, in a suspected suicide confirmed by his father.</p>
        
            <p>During a general debate at Parliament on Wednesday, Cameron delivered an emotional speech which shed light on his motivation for remaining an MP and the toll his son's death had taken.</p>
        
            <p>"Yesterday was World Suicide Prevention Day. Hard for some, bloody hard for me. I buried my boy, and he is gone," Cameron said.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party caucus joined him in the House. The acting Speaker and other MPs acknowledged his loss, after the heart-aching speech.</p>
        
            <p>He said his son's death, while traumatic, reminded him why he became an MP.</p>
        
            <p>"I stand here to address this House, to address all of you, a shadow of the man that boy would have become. A shadow. But I am here, because I must. I am a father to a lost son, a parent to a lost child. But I turn up every day in this House because I believe in rural New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My boy was a contractor, a farmer, an every day good Kiwi bloke. He is no more."</p>
        
            <p>Cameron said he hoped that by advocating for rural communities, he may be able to help others.</p>
        
            <p>"I might save someone else, I might be able to help rural people preserve their way of life," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Listen to these people. Politicians need to stop and actually listen to rural folk."</p>
        
            <p>He said "red tape", "sermons" and other obstacles added further stress to farmers.</p>
        
            <p>"My boy is gone. His suicide was one thing. It could have been many things. But I will say this, to this House, in this god awful mess that is my life, I am in this House every day because I absolutely believe in rural people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Parliament, together, needed to focus on people - to combat suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Cameron is a List MP, who entered Parliament with the ACT Party in 2020.</p>
