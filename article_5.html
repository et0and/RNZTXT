Greg O'Connor is reported to have said sanctions are not necessarily a bad thing, and could be a good thing - particularly for those aged under 21.

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins says comments from one of his MPs about benefit sanctions being a good thing are not words he would use.</p>
        
            <p>Greg O'Connor, Labour's Ohariu MP, is reported to have said sanctions are not necessarily a bad thing, and could be a good thing - particularly for those aged under 21-years-old.</p>
        
            <p>Labour has been critical of the coalition government's increasing use of sanctions for beneficiaries who do not meet their obligations to get work-ready.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the government announced it will double how long breaches count against beneficiaries, with a new traffic light system coming into effect.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins responded by saying the government was more interested in kicking beneficiaries when they were down, than helping them back into work.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media on Tuesday about O'Connor's comments, Hipkins said overall, Labour is sceptical of benefit sanctioning but he has never said there is no place for them.</p>
        
            <p>"We've not said that we're completely opposed to sanctions, that's never been Labour's position, but right now when there's a shortage of jobs available we should be more focused on providing people with support, like training, to get them into sustainable long term employment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins plans to speak to O'Connor about his comments.</p>
