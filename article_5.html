The government is promising a swathe of changes to bolster KiwiBank, and bring about more competition in the banking sector.

            <p>The Prime Minister says he still holds out hopes that banks will respond to the government's desire for more competition in the sector.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon told Morning Report the potential private capital injection of up to $500 million into Kiwibank could prove to be a catalyst.</p>
        
            <p>He says the capitalisation will make the sector more disruptive and he wants a greater move towards open banking and allowing customers more flexibility and less restrictions in being able to shift.</p>
        
            <p>The government will decide on what extent they will look to prop up Kiwibank by March next year, he says.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis says the banks need to get on and do what is needed as required by the Commerce Commission as they've been "dragging their heals".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, nurses are set to begin rolling strikes in Auckland on Tuesday and it's been revealed health workers are being asked to 'fill in' on reception.</p>
