            <p>The government is venturing into the world of artificial intelligence, launching a virtual assistant dubbed Gov-GPT, modelled on Chat-GPT.</p>
        
            <p>Technology Minister Judith Collins announced the new tool at the Aotearoa AI Summit in Auckland on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Callaghan Innovation will run a pilot of the chatbot, designed to help Kiwis easily find information about the government and its agencies.</p>
        
            <p>"GovGPT is an exciting first step towards a vision of a 'digital front-door', where individuals can find answers to their questions about government in a convenient and timely way," Collins said.</p>

            <p>Callaghan Innovation is also debuting a separate programme to encourage businesses to take up AI, offering access to research and expert assistance, as well as potential grants.</p>
        
            <p>Both projects were being funded through baselines.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the government was keen to safely maximise the value of AI for the economy and all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"AI is predicted to contribute $76 billion to the New Zealand's annual GDP by 2038," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is crucial we support businesses to improve their awareness and uptake of AI, so they can capitalise on the benefits as the rest of the world rapidly adopts this technology."</p>
