            <p>Health New Zealand is holding meetings Friday morning with staff whose jobs would be significantly impacted by its latest cutback proposals.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands between 200 and 400 jobs were on the line.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation documents with the details were being issued.</p>
        
            <p>Briefings were being held for teams covering procurement and community mental health.</p>
        
            <p>Another team that assesses the needs of elderly and sick people at home was next up.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA union said the consultation period till late January was too short, given it was almost the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>It wrote to Health NZ on Thursday night asking for this to be extended by at least a fortnight.</p>
        
            <p>The consultation periods for other cuts, more than 1200 positions announced in November, were recently extended to mid and late January.</p>
