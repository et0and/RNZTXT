            <p>The Public Service Association is accusing the government of "brutal austerity" - after the coalition forecast further cuts in next year's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's financial position has deteriorated - with tax revenue estimated down $13 billion over a four-year period.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis says it proves the need for fiscal discipline.</p>
        
            <p>But the PSA says the reckless drive to cut costs shows the government is prepared to put dollars ahead of New Zealanders' lives.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the HYEFU update the government and opposition were already blaming each other.</p>
