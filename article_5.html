        <h2>Documents show the struggle behind Dunedin Hospital</h2>
        <p>
As early as June 2020, Treasury was warning the hospital project was "in doubt with major risks". Audio

            <p>Reviewers were calling oversight of Dunedin's hospital rebuild a "struggle" and a "mess" at a critical time when costs were spiralling out of control, newly released papers show.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest weakness was pinpointed as poor governance and oversight - and months were lost trying to make sure this had been fixed.</p>
        
            <p>In the same period in 2021-22, costs blew out by $200 million.</p>
        
            <p>They have subsequently gone up another $300m at least, sparking a government rethink. That, in turn, has sparked a 'Save Our Southern Hospital' campaign, and warnings from doctors that a hasty redesign could leave health services in the region in a precarious state.</p>
        
            <p>The slide between 2016-23 is revealed in 16 reviews and papers newly released by Health New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet ministers, who have called into question how the previous government ran the project, have been eager to promote the reviews.</p>
        
            <p>These showed "a steadily worsening outlook for the project", they said.</p>
        
            <p>The papers show that by June 2020, a project that had been amber (on a green-amber-red scale) in 2017 was now amber-red, with Treasury warning "successful delivery of New Dunedin Hospital is in doubt with major risks".</p>
        
            <p>The project had "suffered from successive delays in decision-making in recent years, resulting in increased costs and an ever-more pressing need to make progress", it said.</p>
        
            <p>Governance - the core job of the Southern Partnership Group, since 2015, to "ensure the project is successfully delivered on time and within budget" - was rated by Treasury as the major problem.</p>
        
            <p>"Almost without exception, interviewees cited governance as one of their most prominent concerns," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Governance was variously described as 'a struggle', 'a mess', 'lacking delegation', having 'contested accountabilities', 'suffering from a lack of trust'.</p>
        
            <p>"A strong opinion was voiced that so far little action has been taken to address those concerns."</p>
        
            <p>The Labour-led government, led by Health Minister Chris Hipkins, moved to fix it by replacing the Southern Partnership Group with a new executive steering group.</p>
        
            <p>This was to provide "assurance around fiscal controls, the timely delivery of fit for purpose buildings and the development of quality services".</p>
        
            <p>It was also intended to be a model for use on other big health projects.</p>
        
            <p>But straight away another major lapse occurred, the papers showed: The Southern DHB was not told about the governance findings for months.</p>

            <p>"In essence, five months have been lost," a Treasury review in November 2020 said.</p>
        
            <p>Noting tensions within the district health board, and between the DHB and the Ministry of Health, it added: "The review team considers this to be a significant loss of opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>The lapse came at a time that was critical for engaging with building firms about the contract for the outpatients block.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, in December 2020, six months on from the June warning, the governance change was made.</p>
        
            <p>Yet even then, a report back to Cabinet that had been due in May 2021 to check that governance had improved was instead delayed by almost a year, to February 2022.</p>
        
            <p>A month later, in March 2022, ministers were forced to mount a salvage operation that revolved around making design changes to make savings amid a $200m cost blowout.</p>
        
            <p>During the 2021-22 period when governance was meant to be improving, matters had got worse, the reviews showed.</p>
        
            <p>The final Treasury review in December 2021 said both that the project was "generally on track" but also that, "Delivery of [new Dunedin hospital] to scope, time and approved budget is at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Budgetary pressures arising from disruption to materials supply and labour markets, to levels unseen in recent times, are threatening to derail the project."</p>
        
            <p>It called for urgent measures.</p>

            <p>Treasury in that review called, once again, for governance arrangements to be looked at - a whole year after the steering group established under Hipkins had taken over governance.</p>
        
            <p>The December 2021 review also repeated Treasury's call for the upgrade to the hospital's data and digital technology to be included in the project, instead of being treated separately.</p>
        
            <p>"Integrate the buildings, ICT and Transformation Programmes into a single and coherent programme of works," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Bundled like this, the project budget would be about $2 billion, it said - half a billion more than the budget at that time.</p>
        
            <p>Even up until now, ICT has not been included, and the National-led government has cited this as another driver of cost increases that could push the whole project to $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's associate health spokesperson Tracey McLellan rejected a suggestion the last government was asleep at the wheel.</p>
        
            <p>" I don't agree ... the issues with the project were well known and they were well managed," she said. Those included supply chain disruption caused by Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>The final December 2021 review said the project was largely on track but to be aware of "headwinds", she said.</p>
        
            <p>There was only so much cost-saving moves they could make at the time, she added.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was "a big distraction", McLellan said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is now what we're talking about instead of this government's refusal to build the hospital that Dunedin deserves, that is the point here."</p>
