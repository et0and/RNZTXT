            <p>The Chief Children's Commissioner is acknowledging the harm experienced by tamariki in the Abuse in Care report, but says abuse is still happening.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry released their findings this afternoon that looked at and faith-based institutions between 1950 and 1999.</p>
        
            <p>At least 200,000 people have been abused or neglected - with sexual abuse and willful neglect being common.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Claire Achmad says state care and the youth justice system is continuing to harm children and young people.</p>
        
            <p>She says Oranga Tamariki data shows 519 children have been harmed in the last year, with 894 recorded findings of harm, despite the number of children in care declining over the period.Many of the survivors spoken to by RNZ say they are glad the report is finally being released, but some remain sceptical over whether the government will honour it.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to make a formal apology to survivors in November.</p>
