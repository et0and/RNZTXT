            <p>Tamatha Paul is calling on New Zealanders to carry on the momentum in submitting their views for other bills currently for public consultation in addition to the Treaty Principles Bill submission deadline yesterday, specifically the Bootcamp and Anti-Stalking bills.</p>
        
            <p>The Oranga Tamariki (Responding to serious youth offending) Amendment (Bootcamp Bill), aimed at addressing youth crime through rehabilitative programmes, sparked interest and debate on the principles it stands for.</p>
        
            <p>The Bootcamp Bill was another legislation by the Act Party, which closes at 11.59pm on Thursday, January 9.</p>
        
            <p>Although the purpose of the bill is to rehabilitate youth, Paul said this bill like many others was not the right approach to helping people.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a whole lot of stuff going on with this kino kƒÅwana. We need to be vigilant, and we need to pace ourselves so that we can continue to speak up for what is right," Paul said.</p>
        
            <p>In a recent TikTok video, Paul mentioned other bills needing active engagement on what the public views were for the shaping of their legislative process.</p>
        
            <p>The Boot Camp Bill, aimed at addressing youth crime through rehabilitative programmes, sparked significant public interest and debate.</p>
        
            <p>As a proponent of youth-focused initiatives, Paul believed that incorporating diverse perspectives was crucial for creating policies that genuinely reflected the needs of the community.</p>
        
            <p>"The Treaty Principles Bill is obviously of great significance, but there are a number of other bills going through parliament that are of major relevance to our people. For example, the Anti-Stalking bill that is out for consultation until February 13."</p>
        
            <p>The Crimes Legislation (Stalking and Harassment) Amendment Bill aims to criminalise stalking, with a particular focus on protecting women.</p>
        
            <p>If enacted, the legislation will introduce penalties of up to five years' imprisonment for stalking offences.</p>
        
            <p>Paul highlighted the importance of the Anti-Stalking bill retrieving public submissions, stressing that every voice mattered.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the first-ever Anti-stalking/anti-harassment legislation that we've ever had in Aotearoa. So that's a big one, as a country we know we have one of the worst statistics when it comes to domestic violence and family violence."</p>
        
            <p>Although there have been concerns due to the speculation of submission numbers of support for the bill rather than against, Paul said the number of submissions was significance, whether supporting or against.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what the makeup of that for and against is, however, that should not be the reason that we're doing it. Don't let what other people are saying decide why you submit. You should be doing your submission because it's the right thing to do, not out of spite or regarding some information you saw on social media."</p>
