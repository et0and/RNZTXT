            <p>RNZ launched a political poll in April 2025 in partnership with the longstanding and reputable polling company Reid Research.</p>
        
            <p>The poll builds on the former Newshub-Reid Research Poll, which ran successfully from 2009 to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The polls, which will run about four times a year, involve 1000 online interviews nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Each poll includes standard questions about party vote preference and preferred prime minister, along with whether respondents feel the current government is taking the country in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>Responses to these questions will be collated and updated on this page each polling cycle.</p>
        
            <p>Each poll also includes several topical questions. The results of these will be reported as part of that cycle's news coverage.</p>
        
            <p>The crucial question asked in each polling cycle focuses on who respondents would give their party vote to if a general election was held the following day.</p>
        
            <p>These are the results of the most recent poll.</p>
        
            <p>And here is how the party vote trend has evolved over time.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ uses these party vote results to calculate the seats each party would be allocated in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Under current rules, parties must receive 5 percent of the vote or win an electorate seat to be returned to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>For the purposes of this poll, if support for a party currently in Parliament falls below the 5 percent threshold, but that party currently holds an electorate seat, RNZ assumes that party will retain its electorates.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand does not vote for its party leaders but a leader's popularity or support is strongly linked to party support.</p>
        
            <p>In the most recent poll, this is where the current party leaders and other contenders stood.</p>
        
            <p>And here is how party leaders' support has changed over the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>As well as outright preferences, the RNZ-Reid Research Poll also asks respondents how well the leaders of National and Labour are performing in their roles.</p>
        
            <p>The overall outcome (the difference between respondents who believe a leader is performing well and those who believe they are not performing well) is represented in this chart of net favourability.</p>
        
            <p>We also ask how respondents feel about the overall direction of the country under the current government.</p>
        
            <p>The RNZ-Reid Research poll margins of error (expressed at a 95 percent confidence level) are:</p>
