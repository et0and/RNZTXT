        <h2>Luxon speaks to media after Waitangi event in Akaroa</h2>
        <p>
Ngāi Tahu's Treaty settlement has allowed them to become a driving force in the country's economy, the PM says.

            <p>Ngāi Tahu's Treaty settlement has allowed it to flourish and become a driving force in the country's economy, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says.</p>
        
            <p>He was speaking at Ōnuku marae in Akaroa on Thursday where he has controversially decided to spend Waitangi Day instead of heading to Waitangi to join other political leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's big Waitangi Day moment began with heckling as he took the stage, a protester being taken away by security as the PM tried to start his speech.</p>
        
            <p>Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro also spoke at the marae.</p>

            <p>Luxon spent much of his speech revisiting Ngāi Tahu's historic Treaty settlement in 1998 which was achieved in the face of "enormous challenges".</p>
        
            <p>"And yet, through persistence, resilience, and a commitment to your people, you have created a legacy that inspires us all."</p>

            <p>Ōnuku marae was "a place of deep significance, not only for Ngāi Tahu, but for our entire nation", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because it is here Ngāi Tahu chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi 185 years ago, laying the foundation for what was hoped would be a lasting partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"And here, in this very place, my predecessor as prime minister, Dame Jenny Shipley, delivered the Crown apology to Ngāi Tahu.</p>
        
            <p>"Reconciliation has paved the way for the iwi's success, prosperity and cultural revitalisation."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister also made a brief reference to the Treaty Principles Bill, promising once again it would not become law.</p>

            <p>It was important Treaty promises were honoured and it must be done in a way that brought the nation closer together "rather than pulling us apart", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"National governments have always worked constructively and productively with Māori on Treaty issues while ensuring equal citizenship and equal opportunity for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"That will continue under my government."</p>

            <p>Ngāi Tahu had endured more than 100 years of adversity and become "disconnected from their land and people" after signing the Treaty, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"But despite this, you never gave up. You continued to fight for recognition, justice, and the restoration of what was lost - to preserve your culture, language, and identity."</p>
        
            <p>A Treaty settlement almost 27 years ago had provided the chance to rebuild and become "a thriving iwi".</p>
        
            <p>"Today, Ngāi Tahu is a tremendous force in New Zealand's economy - driving change across property, tourism, fisheries and agriculture.</p>
        
            <p>"But the success goes beyond profit - it's about creating lasting value for whānau and the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>He said across the country, iwi and Māori were following similar paths - "building thriving businesses, supporting local economies, creating jobs, and ensuring a solid foundation for future generations".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon pressed his case for economic growth, saying iwi were among those supporting the government's goals.</p>
        
            <p>To this end more than 20 iwi-led or partnered projects were on the government's Fast Track List, and the government was also partnering with iwi and Māori to build infrastructure in several regions.</p>
        
            <p>"As we look to the future, Ngāi Tahu's achievements exemplify what is possible when a strong foundation of economic growth is in place."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon reminded the audience that in 2040 Aotearoa would mark the bicentenary of the Treaty's signing.</p>
        
            <p>"The Treaty is central to the history of New Zealand, and it is central to our future.</p>
        
            <p>"The government's role is to honour the Treaty, work in partnership with Māori, and ensure that the country continues in a spirit of Kotahitanga."</p>
        
            <p>He expressed a wish for today's children to have the opportunity to be successful in their own country.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why our focus must be on shared prosperity. And when Māori communities succeed, all of New Zealand benefits."</p>
        
            <p>In his speech, Luxon also paid tribute to the Māori leaders lost in the last few months, including Kīngi Tūheitia, Tā (Bom) Gillies, Dame Tariana Turia, and, in recent days, Dame Iritana Tāwhiwhirangi.</p>
        
            <p>It's expected events at at Ōnuku marae will continue through until mid-afternoon.</p>
