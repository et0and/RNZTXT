            <p>When Parliament began its September sitting block on Tuesday, MPs met only to acknowledge a death and agree to return the following day.</p>
        
            <p>The shortened day was to show respect after the unexpected death last week of the Māori King, Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII.</p>
        
            <p>Such an early adjournment is unusual, but not unprecedented. Typically this sort of thing is reserved for the death of a former Prime Minister, and is a significant honour.</p>
        
            <p>This is the third such instance in the past two years. Almost exactly two years ago Parliament adjourned for the week following the death of Queen Elizabeth. In February it was for the sudden death of brand new Green MP - Fa'anānā Efeso Collins.</p>

            <p>Below are some of the remarks made by MPs speaking today.</p>
        
            <p>"As Kiingi Tuheitia made his final journey along the Waikato River from Tuurangawaewae to his resting place at his ancestral maunga Taupiri, thousands gathered from all corners of our country and the world to pay their respects - a testament to the profound impact that he has had on so many lives. Kiingi Tuheitia's passing marks the end of an era, but his spirit and legacy will continue to inspire for generations to come. Rest in peace, Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiingi Tuheitia was a servant to his people. He guided them with wisdom, strength, and an unwavering commitment to kotahitanga. Kiingi Tuheitia carried himself with deep personal humility. A son of Huntly and a former truck driver, he had the ability to connect with people from any and all walks of life. He was not just a leader but a friend and mentor to many, and, in particular, a strong advocate for young people. His words often carried the weight of profound wisdom and his presence was a source of great comfort and strength, as I count myself so fortunate to have experienced."</p>

            <p>"I confessed to him, then, relatively new in the job as leader of the Labour Party and at that point prime minister of New Zealand, that issues to do with te reo Māori and, particularly, any issues that involved me speaking in te reo Māori always made me nervous. They would make me nervous because no matter how much I practised my mihi beforehand - I could have it absolutely perfect before I stood up to speak, under the pressure of saying in front of somebody else, I would inevitably speed up, I would trip over my words, and I would get it wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"He said to me, and I've always remembered it, he said 'the important thing is that you try because people will acknowledge you for trying and that is the important thing. And if you keep trying, you'll get better'. I think to some extent that actually reflects the relationship between the Crown, the government, and Māori. We have to keep trying and we won't always get it right. And as we pursue kotahitanga, as we pursue unity and togetherness, there will undoubtedly be bumps in that road. But the key thing is with goodwill and with effort, we can continue to make progress."</p>

Chris Hipkins says Kiingi Tuhetia told him that if he kept working at his te reo Māori he would get better.

            <p>"Kiingi Tuheitia said that mana motuhake has room for everyone, and I think that that is something that all of us, especially at this point in human history and at this point in Aotearoa New Zealand, should reflect on. At the end of last year, when some conceived of a potential attack on the constitutional foundations of this country, Kiingi Tuheitia instead saw an opportunity to affirm, to clarify who we are and what we are and what we should aspire to be, and the connections that we've made here, between what we aspire to do in what we call progressive politics, where we want to build the house for all of us to move into, before simply turning to burn it down - the one that we currently operate in. I also reflect upon the fact that the Kiingitanga movement is not a conquering nor a colonial monarchy but one by Māori, for all."</p>
        
            <p>"You don't fulfil a role unless you can capture respect, and respect can only be earned. In the 18 years King Tuheitia, who came from a very earthy background - served his time not only as a truck driver but working at what we might call the grassroots level of his people in Waikato as he grew into the role, it would be very churlish and it would be negative of any Kiwi not to acknowledge that in the latter stage of his career, he found the sweet spot.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only did he provide an opportunity for the various iwi to come together but he sought to reach out and be a figure that went beyond the ebb and flow of politics and, indeed, the other debates that swirl around and make us Kiwis. So we salute those efforts of his. As I said in our Māori language, he is not the ika whakawera - ie, the boaster. He is not the waha papā-the loudmouth-he was the hūmārika, the one who appreciated the dignity of silence and often let silence do his talking for him."</p>
        
            <p>"But what I would do is ask Aotearoa that we take that moment and embrace that, because that is our history. That is something that we all whakapapa to under Te Tiriti. We all belong to the Kiingitanga. We all were part of the vision for a united Aotearoa. We all need to be reminded of our role as the Kiingi did. He encouraged that we continue to look after each other, that we weather the storm, and we weather the storm together - not by some standing over there under shelter and some being left behind. Māori are the forever people, but we must also remember we are the forever hosts and we must forever host and look after our visitors."</p>
