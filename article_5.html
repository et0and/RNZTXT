            <p>Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says the horse racing industry needs to raise the stakes and get its "mojo" back.</p>
        
            <p>Peters, who is also the minister for racing, spoke at an industry event at Auckland's Ellerslie Racecourse on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>There, the TAB and NZ Thoroughbred Racing announced a revised summer calendar with five new events funded by the TAB that would bring the 2024 to 2025 summer prizepool up to $23.8 million, compared to $14.8m last season.</p>
        
            <p>The following 2025 to 2026 season would have a total prize pool of $27.5m.</p>
        
            <p>This included a new "Champions Day" featuring a $9m prize pool.</p>
        
            <p>"The racing industry is facing new challenges and change is needed," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"Racing is worth more than $1.6 billion to the New Zealand economy; it employs more than 14,000 New Zealanders and is a growing source of export revenue.</p>
        
            <p>"We must seek, surely, to double those outcomes as soon as possible, and in doing so match the outcomes already achieved by leading racing countries such as Ireland."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand's racing industry could compete on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our bloodstock industry continues to be the source of champions to the world - we grow the most productive grass horses in the world," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some of the greatest young people and the keenest minds. New Zealand thoroughbreds consistently outperform their competition in every country they perform in."</p>

            <p>Peters said the increased stakes would open more opportunities for young people to enter the industry.</p>
        
            <p>He then took a moment to address critics.</p>
        
            <p>"For all those people worried about animal cruelty, horses love to race," he said, unprompted.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people need to understand what they're talking about before they rush to judgement and make all sorts of comments, as these trolls are wont to do."</p>
        
            <p>He said the new events were a "fresh start" for the racing industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone here wants New Zealand racing to get its mojo back and, with wise decision-making and a rationalisation of our resources across the country, that will happen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A for-far-too-long stalled industry can hopefully exhibit its real potential."</p>
