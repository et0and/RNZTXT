        <h2>Fast-track denied for controversial boat ramp</h2>
        <p>
It may be the final nail in the coffin of a a project that's sharply divided the small community for nearly five years.

            <p>A refusal to grant fast-track consent for a controversial Bay of Islands boat-launching facility could be the final nail in the coffin for the long-running project.</p>
        
            <p>The boat ramp and car park was proposed in 2020 and had sharply divided the small community at Rangitāne, about 13km from Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent version of the plan included a double-width ramp, a reconstructed jetty, a floating pontoon, a walkway, and a 7400 square-metre reclamation in Kerikeri Inlet for boat-trailer parking.</p>
        
            <p>The reclamation, which would have been about 150m long and 60m wide, proved the most contentious part of the plan.</p>
        
            <p>It was also the reason an expert panel refused, by two votes to one, to grant fast-tracked consent.</p>
        
            <p>The Far North District Council and Far North Holdings applied for consent under a previous version of the Fast-Track Consenting Act, introduced during the Covid pandemic in 2020, not under the current fast-track legislation.</p>
        
            <p>In a recently published decision, panel chairman Alan Webb said it had been "a difficult matter to resolve" due to the large reclamation required.</p>
        
            <p>While the panel appreciated the ongoing need for boat launching facilities in Northland, the proposal had to be considered against the relevant statutory and planning rules.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement said reclamations should be avoided, and approved only exceptionally if certain criteria were met.</p>
        
            <p>The other members of the panel were coastal consultant Juliane Chetham and Far North District councillor Felicity Foy.</p>

            <p>Webb noted the current boat ramp could be upgraded to double-width without the reclamation, which aimed to give people wanting to launch their boats at Rangitāne somewhere to park.</p>
        
            <p>He said the panel had "significant sympathy" for the application, and accepted that encouraging people to enjoy the Bay of Islands created positive effects for the community.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked the council and Far North Holdings whether they plan to appeal the decision.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal has been staunchly opposed from the get-go by the Rangitāne Residents Association - which raised the money for the original jetty - but strongly supported by another local group, the Rangitāne Recreation Association.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020 the Rangitāne project was granted $2.4 million from the Government's "shovel-ready" Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund, with the council committing another $1.2m.</p>
        
            <p>The project's many obstacles since then included having to commission a new cultural report after Ngāpuhi said the iwi hadn't been properly consulted, and a previous rejection of fast-tracked consent in April 2022, due to a legal ruling about wetlands in an unrelated court case.</p>
        
            <p>As of August 2022, $612,000 had been spent on planning and design, according to a council report.</p>
        
            <p>Another Far North Holdings boat ramp and car park, at Rangitoto/Windsor Landing on the opposite southern side of Kerikeri Inlet, faced stiff opposition at first but was completed in 2021.</p>
