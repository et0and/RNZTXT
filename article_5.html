            <p>The government will be supplying vaping starter kits to stop-smoking services around the country next week to help adults quit.</p>
        
            <p>The greater use of vaping starter kits is among the government's plans for a final push to achieve its Smokefree 2025 goal.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said clients would receive a vape device and a month's supply of nicotine pods each month over three months, with continuing support from a stop-smoking service.</p>
        
            <p>The kits would be free and available to adults who smoke, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that more people try and quit over Christmas and New Year and smoking cessation providers are getting more tools to help smokers quit," Costello said.</p>
        
            <p>"Vaping has played a key role in reducing smoking rates and the government supports adults switching to vaping because vaping is far less harmful than smoking cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>"Those using quit-smoking services are four times more likely to successfully stop smoking compared to those who receive no support, and this initiative provides the services with another tool."</p>

            <p>Costello said New Zealand needed to reinvigorate its stop smoking efforts and to target the right people, if the country was to get the smoking rate below 5 percent by the end of next year and achieve the Smokefree 2025 goals.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of that, a new 'That's Us, Smokefree 2025' marketing campaign has also been developed and is being launched today," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hāpai te Hauora developed the campaign which would target key audiences through social media and localised networks, Costello said.</p>
        
            <p>"We also want to ensure there's access to a range of effective products and tools - I'm hoping we can provide a new device to providers soon - and that the whole health sector works together to encourage referrals to stop smoking providers," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message for 2025 is that it's always worth trying to quit smoking - that tens of thousands of others have managed to do it - and that there are great people ready to help."</p>
