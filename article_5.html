            <p>The newly minted Health Minister says the buck will stop with him on delivering better healthcare for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown was handed the portfolio, often referred to as a poisoned chalice or hospital pass, by the Prime Minister in a new year reshuffle.</p>
        
            <p>He takes on the job from Dr Shane Reti - a Northland GP - who Brown says he respects and continues to seek advice from.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a lot I need to learn, obviously Shane is someone I'll be engaging with. I need to build my knowledge," Brown told RNZ in a sitdown interview this week.</p>
        
            <p>He sees the role as a "huge opportunity" and a portfolio that matters to every New Zealander.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a privilege and a huge responsibility to be appointed Minister of Health.</p>
        
            <p>"My real focus, as I've said, is to make sure we as a government can deliver timely and quality access to healthcare for all New Zealanders."</p>

            <p>A commissioner was put in at Health NZ under Reti's watch in July after several board members chose not to be reappointed and the books showed a significant deterioration in finances.</p>
        
            <p>Lester Levy, who had recently been appointed chair of Health NZ, was elevated to commissioner for a 12-month term.</p>
        
            <p>With his tenure coming to an end in July, Brown has to decide whether to keep him in the job or not.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's highly experienced and he understands health really well and it's a huge part of what government does.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a huge task ahead of him with his deputy commissioners."</p>
        
            <p>Brown told RNZ one of the key issues he needs to think about is what the governance of Health NZ looks like in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ chief executive Margie Apa has faced criticism in her role given how out of hand the deficit had got before ministers, or the board, were made aware.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said Apa's ongoing employment at Health NZ since July has been an issue for the commissioner, not the minister.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been clear about my views that there needs to be change across the leadership of health in New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Apa's term is due to end in June.</p>
        
            <p>While Brown says he doesn't have the medical knowledge of his predecessor Reti, he has experienced the healthcare system as a parent and patient, which is how he plans to prioritise fixing it.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got three young children so we use the health system on a regular basis. I'm also a local member of government and through that have helped a lot of people to get the access they need."</p>
        
            <p>He says he's seen the challenges and problems and "my focus is making sure the patients' view and concerns and needs are a top priority".</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest problems he's identified through the briefings he's had so far are how long patients are waiting in emergency departments to be seen.</p>
        
            <p>"When National was last in government I think it was consistently above 90 percent being seen within six hours, and now that's clearly down in the 70s, and that's not good enough."</p>
        
            <p>Brown also wants to shake up primary healthcare.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just about making sure the hospitals are there working, but how do we invest in prevention and get better access to GPs."</p>
        
            <p>Brown also wants more of the good health stories to be told.</p>
        
            <p>"There's hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who use the health system every year, whether it's hospital care or electives... we've made new treatments available through investment in cancer drugs.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of good stories around what that investment is doing, and I think we need to do that more, actually tell that story," he says.</p>
        
            <p>On the flipside Brown acknowledges an ageing population and workforce challenges put a negative spotlight on health.</p>
        
            <p>"Those issues are always going to mean there are challenges around increasing cost and our ability to deliver, and we have to be realistic."</p>
