            <p>Tributes are pouring in for Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins who is remembered as warm, kind, and an inspiration for Māori and Pasifika communities - particularly rangatahi.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā died after collapsing at a charity event in the Auckland CBD on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Community members say the 49-year-old left an enduring legacy for his South Auckland community - where he served three terms on the local board and as ward councillor before giving his maiden speech in Parliament just a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>In Ōtara where Fa'anānā was born, raised and served his community, his loss is deeply felt.</p>
        
            <p>University student Winiata Walker, who volunteers his time teaching music to kids in Ōtara, said Fa'anānā was always a role model.</p>
        
            <p>"Such a humble man, and from south Auckland to Parliament, that's such a big step for south Auckland," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said Fa'anānā death is a big loss for the communities that relied on him to have their voices heard.</p>
        
            <p>"As our community, we have to fight harder, because he was the change. He was someone we could look up to for change for our community, but since he passed away, I think we have to work together more and work harder for progress," he said.</p>

            <p>Twenty-five-year-old Terangi Parima who runs the Ōtara youth hub and Ōtara Kai Village said Fa'anānā was a valuable mentor for rangatahi.</p>
        
            <p>"Empowering our rangatahi to see themselves in spaces that he sat in.</p>
        
            <p>"Empowering our rangatahi to think beyond the lines that have been drawn out for us...he's a legend, an absolute legend," she said.</p>
        
            <p>
Terangi Parima says she will always remember how Fa'anānā encouraged young people to become leaders.

            <p>Parima said she will always remember how he encouraged youth to consider becoming leaders.</p>
        
            <p>"He actually was a significant part in supporting our rangatahi, our youngest rangatahi who ever went for a local board role, to actually step into those spaces, and encourage her," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Parima said it made a difference to have someone like Fa'anānā, who had been through disadvantaged communities like Ōtara, to be in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>She said he bridged the gaps between political spaces and communities.</p>
        
            <p>Parima said Fa'anānā departed in a way that embodied what he stood for.</p>
        
            <p>"He literally passed away [doing] exactly what he's always done, and what he loves, and that's serving his community and being purposeful," she said.</p>
