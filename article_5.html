            <p>New Zealanders will find out just how much they will pocket from the coalition government's tax cuts when the full 2024 budget is unveiled this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The government has already made a series of pre-budget announcements to clear the decks for today's tax relief set piece.</p>
        
            <p>National campaigned on giving families on average incomes with young children up to $250 a fortnight, but the exact detail of today's tax relief will depend on what the three coalition parties have also agreed.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has already confirmed changes to income tax brackets would be announced today.</p>
        
            <p>She has since said people will be happy with what they get, although voters RNZ has spoken to have a gloomier outlook.</p>
        
            <p>People in Whangārei, Auckland and Christchurch were skeptical about the tax cuts making a difference in their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely not. We have our own business. Moved back from Australia four years ago, and dying to get back there now," one man said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not much from this government, at all," a woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"I expect nothing and I'm sure I won't be disappointed," another man said.</p>
        
            <p>Almost everyone RNZ spoke too said things felt tough and many suggested the money for tax relief would be better spent on other things.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd far rather see hospitals, nurses, doctors, schools, rather than give us tax cut," one woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got rental property, but I don't want us to be better off, we're fine. I want people who are struggling to be better off," another woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be lovely if it could be going to those with the children who need it," another woman said.</p>
        
            <p>Both Labour and the Greens have raised concerns about the potential for further cuts in today's budget.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time they say we had to make tough choices, we had to cut this or we couldn't fund that, the real question is why was the $2.9 billion they prioritised for landlords more important than the things they've said they're not funding," Opposition leader Chris Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're making tough choices to hand $2.9 billion in tax cuts to landlords. That money could go a really long way to fixing our education, healthcare and housing systems," Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a lot of action both in and outside of Parliament today as Te Paati Māori organises a strike to protest the coalition's policies affecting Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"Thousands of people from all over the country will be turning up," co-leader Rawiri Waititi said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's mokopuna friendly and making sure that our people's voices are heard and we're looking forward to an awesome, positive day."</p>
        
            <p>Journalists and economists will get their first chance to look at the budget later this morning, before the details go public at 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has promised a tax calculator will go up on the Treasury website, so anyone can work out exactly how much they will get.</p>
