        <p>
Australian Defence officials have not ruled out that a nuclear-powered submarine might be with the three vessels in the Tasman Sea and could be gathering intelligence.

            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins says she's aware of suggestions the Chinese navy ships in the Tasman Sea might be accompanied by a nuclear submarine.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Defence officials have not ruled out that a nuclear-powered submarine might be with the three vessels and could be gathering intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>"I am aware of suggestions that this task group has been accompanied by a nuclear submarine," Collins told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"While Chinese task groups do occasionally deploy with submarines, I am not aware of any reports indicating that this is the case for this particular task group."</p>
        
            <p>She had previously said the weapons the ships have "are extremely capable".</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand spy agencies referred RNZ's queries - such as if they were liaising with Australian authorities about this - to Collins, who is also the minister for the GCSB and SIS. She did not comment on that.</p>
        
            <p>China said on Sunday that Australia's accusations over the ships not giving notice about live-fire drills had been hyped up.</p>
        
            <p>"We are astonished," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Thursday after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing, that lack of a sufficient warning from China about the live-fire exercises was a "failure" in the New Zealand-China relationship.</p>
