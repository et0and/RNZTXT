            <p>Te Whatu Ora/Health NZ is slashing the number of communication staff it employs - but there will still be 125 of them.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation has been thinning out roles that are duplicated since it merged 20 district health boards and five other health entities.</p>
        
            <p>It employed 173 people in its communications and engagement team a year ago, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>This month it was advertising for several positions - many of them roles in regional offices.</p>
        
            <p>It has cut 16 roles, with those staff encouraged to apply for the new jobs, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Other positions had not been filled after people left, they said.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation has drawn criticism for its large number of comms staff, but also for how much harder it was to get clear information.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Catherine Delore said Health NZ/Te Whatu Ora employed 90,000 people so needed the appropriate level of communications and engagement staff.</p>
        
            <p>The jobs that had gone were part of the "Unify to Simplify" process of merging the organisation which focused on reducing duplication across and making savings, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said of the 125 communications jobs remaining, four would be in its National Public Health Service.</p>
