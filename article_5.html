            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced additional sanctions on Russian entities, alongside further support for Ukraine's recovery and rebuild.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the world marks three years on Monday since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>The new sanctions target entities involved in Russia's military-industrial complex, its energy sector, North Korean support of Russia, and the forced relocation and re-education of Ukrainian children.</p>
        
            <p>"Russia's illegal invasion has brought three years of devastation to Ukraine's people, environment, and infrastructure," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The government will also make a $3 million contribution to the World Bank-administered Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fund supports the Government of Ukraine to maintain services, conduct relief efforts, and plan and implement recovery, reconstruction and reforms," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022, a month after the invasion, with New Zealand imposing sanctions on more than 1800 individuals and entities.</p>
        
            <p>These also include a ban on all Russian and Belarusian government and military aircraft and vessels from New Zealand, a ban on exports to Russian and Belarusian military and security forces, and a suspension of bilateral Foreign Ministry consultations with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>Several trade measures, including a 35 percent tariff on all Russian imports to New Zealand have also been imposed.</p>
