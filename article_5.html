            <p>The Prime Minister has confirmed he will join a 'Coalition of the Willing' phone call with other world leaders to discuss the potential deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>The call is being arranged by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand defence attache had already been participating in talks in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the Defence Minister earlier saying New Zealand had not been asked to join the phone call, on Friday afternoon Christopher Luxon said New Zealand had been extended the invite and had accepted.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a chance, really, for an update as to the different lines of diplomatic efforts that are going in across securing peace in Ukraine," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not my meeting, it's Keir's meeting, but I'm looking forward to participating in that tomorrow night."</p>
        
            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also confirmed he will join the call.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will join the call before he heads to India for his trade mission, where he is set to hold a bilateral meeting with Narendra Modi.</p>
