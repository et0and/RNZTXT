        <h2>Collins ponders NZ's part in AUKUS: 'You've got to bring your food to the party'</h2>

It's important New Zealand works out what it can contribute if it decides to join the military alliance, the defence minister says. Audio

            <p>It's important New Zealand works out what it can contribute if it decides to join the AUKUS military alliance, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.</p>
        
            <p>Her comments come after RNZ revealed on Thursday that Defence officials have been pitching the benefits of joining the international military alliance for months.</p>
        
            <p>An Official Information Act briefing to the previous defence minister lists eight opportunities for researchers and industry, but all are blanked out in documents released to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Collins is expected to raise the prospect of joining the non-nuclear part of the deal - called Pillar 2 - in talks with her counterpart in Melbourne on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Pillar two is focused on rapidly developing and sharing military technology among the AUKUS partners - Australia, the UK and the US - including drones and hypersonics.</p>
        
            <p>The US has said the door is open to New Zealand with politicians here welcoming the idea.</p>
        
            <p>However, critics say it would be a shift away from the current defence strategy where helping Pacific neighbours is key.</p>
        
            <p>Collins told Australian media on Wednesday New Zealand must not freeload and might even be able to help out through its space industry.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report on Thursday there would be implications that would need to be worked through if New Zealand and other countries were allowed to join the alliance.</p>
        
            <p>"It's still pretty early days when it comes to just what that means and obviously anything we do needs to be in New Zealand's best interests."</p>
        
            <p>There was a long way to go, she believed, and it depended on the willingness of the three existing members.</p>
        
            <p>While the US has been positive, New Zealand also needed to work out what it would bring to the alliance.</p>
        
            <p>"That is very important. You've got to bring your food to the party, don't you? And that's what we are working through."</p>
        
            <p>She believed New Zealand could offer work it had done in the area of technological advancement, especially in the space sector.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue is, is that what is wanted and also what is that cost ... It's just a very vague area at the moment while things are still getting worked through."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>It was not in the country's best interests to discuss the technology initiatives in an open forum and the discussions today would remain confidential, she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the government would ensure New Zealanders were made aware of the benefits and risks of joining AUKUS.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders need to know what that means and we're just still working through quite what that means because we've got to get a full understanding about what is wanted from us and what we can actually deliver."</p>
        
            <p>Collins was asked about the risks, particularly the possibility of offending China.</p>
        
            <p>She said the relationship was strong with China, particularly economically, and the government would be doing its best to continue to engage with it positively.</p>
        
            <p>However, there were other areas to be worked on, including defence capability.</p>
        
            <p>"Our defence has been absolutely gutted in the last three years and we've got to build that back."</p>
        
            <p>While defence would have to play its part in reining in expenditure, it was no secret that spending would need to be allocated this year particularly for capital.</p>
