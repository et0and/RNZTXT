            <p>The environment ministry has opened up detailed new climate projections to the public.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for the Environment is hosting a web page using NIWA data, which allows users to see climate projections for every five km2 of the country, apart from the Chatham Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone can visit the public database and select whether they are interested in drought, rainfall, wind or temperature, which season they are interested in and whether they would like to see projections for low, medium or high greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            <p>Dr Andrew Tait, Chief Scientist for Climate, Atmosphere and Hazards at NIWA, said the agency's supercomputer "ran hot for 12 months" to bring climate projections from six different global models down to the level of resolution needed to help New Zealand communities.</p>
        
            <p>By 2090, the climate projections say New Zealand could:</p>
