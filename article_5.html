            <p>Survivors of abuse will likely have to wait longer to read the report of the Royal Commission into Abuse in Care.</p>
        
            <p>The high-level inquiry into abuse that occurred in state and faith-based care was due to hand in its report on 28 March.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Internal Affairs secretary Paul James said his agency intended to ask for a third extension, when presenting to MPs on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>James said he had been responsible for providing administrative support for five Royal Commissions and "never managed to deliver one on time and on budget".</p>
        
            <p>"They are very complex and often put together under a real point of pressure; something's happened or there is an issue that needs the highest possible level of scrutiny outside of the court system."</p>
        
            <p>He cited the significant scale of the Abuse in Care inquiry and a legal hurdle were making it hard to meet the target date.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been a live legal challenge, a judicial review, running in respect of that Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse at the moment," James said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of those things make it hard to hit the reporting deadlines or stated budget."</p>
        
            <p>Inquiry chairperson Coral Shaw has previously said the scale of abuse is beyond what anyone had ever imagined at the start of the inquiry.</p>
