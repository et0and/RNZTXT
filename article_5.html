            <p>The Public Service Association says it is a "very short-sighted approach". Labour public services spokesperson Ayesha Verrall says the minister is "sneaking in larger cuts than she signalled before the election".</p>
        
            <p>Agencies have been asked to identify savings options of either 6.5 or 7.5 percent.</p>
