            <p>An eleventh-hour attempt by three Wellington City Councillors to stop the sale of the council's airport shares has failed.</p>
        
            <p>The attempt was made during the final vote on the capital's long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Nikau Wi Neera had tried to table an amendment to the plan calling for a full investigation of retaining ownership of the council's holding in Wellington International Airport Ltd.</p>
        
            <p>But after consulting with council officials, mayor Tory Whanau ruled out a vote on the amendment, saying the decision was the result of lengthy consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Her ruling was in turn challenged - half the 16-person council voted against it - but that did not meet the required 75 percent threshold.</p>
