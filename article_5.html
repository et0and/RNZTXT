        <h2>Survivors deflated as government misses abuse in care deadline</h2>
        <p>
The Royal Commission gave the government until last Sunday to publish responses to its 138 recommendations. That has now been and gone. Audio

            <p>Survivors of abuse in care are feeling deflated two weeks on from the Crown's national apology.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission gave the government until last Sunday (recommendation 131) to publish responses to each of the 138 recommendations in its report.</p>
        
            <p>That deadline has now been and gone, though lead coordination minister Erica Stanford said she had long signalled four months was not enough time.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the government had worked through 28 recommendations so far and the whole lot would be done this time next year.</p>
        
            <p>She did not accept that the delay would be a disappointment for survivors.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think so at all. Survivors should have every confidence in this government that we take the report seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"You saw that in the prime minister's very heartfelt and sincere apology, which was a monumental occasion. But also in the steps that we've taken in addressing those 28 recommendations."</p>

            <p>Tu Chapman, who is part of Te Whare Mōrehu, said the Crown keeping to deadlines was important to survivors.</p>
        
            <p>"It's compounding non-action upon non-action. It keeps happening again. I keep holding out hope they will actually come through.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to wait and the more we keep waiting the more distrusting we become of those who have been elected in the seats they sit in to represent us."</p>
        
            <p>Survivor Fete Taito, who was involved in organising the national apology, said he and many other survivors had returned to living in limbo after the apology.</p>
        
            <p>"The apology is hollow until I see what's behind those words and I think that's a fair indication of how a lot of survivors I know are feeling."</p>

            <p>Survivor and Dunedin prisoner David Bagley watched the Crown's apology on the 6pm news that day and said it felt like "lip service".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really believe that they brought closure for anybody. In fact, for me, it's just opened up old wounds."</p>
        
            <p>Bagley said he was incarcerated with other survivors - some who had spent time at Epuni Boys' Home - and believed many were feeling short-changed after the apology.</p>
        
            <p>"It's left a very distasteful impression on them. It's brought up the past for them and creates a lot of animosity towards the government.</p>
        
            <p>"We all initially have slipped through the cracks of the justice system and they've failed all of us and let us down. We're now reliving the past and it's painful."</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has just clocked its first year in power and asked what his most memorable day had been, the Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was the apology.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the actual national apology for me was pretty emotionally impactful," Luxon said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman said it was more words and no action.</p>

            <p>"Quite bluntly, his acknowledgement of the day and how he felt about it is worthless.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not attacking the person's level of empathy or sympathy, but you've got to follow it up with action and the words didn't speak louder than the actions this time, unfortunately.</p>
        
            <p>"So look, hats off to the prime minister for acknowledging this was a significant day for him, it wasn't for survivors."</p>
        
            <p>Taito said he was keen to see some artwork - presented on the day of the apology - travel around the country to connect with other survivors.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just shut it in a dark corner. It's too late. You can't do that to the taonga. It's got a mauri now, it's got a life force. You have to take it around to the regions. This is the conduit to connect us together, all the survivors."</p>
        
            <p>The government is yet to make any decisions about that request.</p>
