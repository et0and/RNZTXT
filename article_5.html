            <p>Fourteen government ministers and MPs have visited or will visit at least 18 countries in 22 trips this month, as they strive to "raise the energy" of diplomatic engagements.</p>
        
            <p>The promise was one of the points in the government's second-quarter plan unveiled at the start of the month.</p>
        
            <p>To "raise the energy New Zealand brings to key relationships through international engagements, focussing on our traditional partners, the Pacific, and South East and South Asia".</p>
        
            <p>This raising of energy is a goal that can be hard to quantify, but the government certainly seems committed to making a large number of visits.</p>
        
            <p>A two-week recess block - when Parliament is not sitting - in the middle of the month provided ample opportunity for ministers to spend some time abroad.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters was the most well travelled minister, stopping in six countries: Belgium, Egypt, Poland, Sweden, the United States and - representing New Zealand for Anzac Day - Turkey.</p>
        
            <p>It may be a quieter one than usual, with the NZDF's luggage including instruments and uniforms having been lost in transit.</p>
        
            <p>Several other government representatives are also attending Anzac Day commemorations, with Defence Minister Judith Collins paying respects to fallen New Zealand soldiers at the Dawn Service at Buttes New British Cemetery near Passchendaele in Belgium; Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith in London; Speaker Gerry Brownlee taking a delegation to Niue; and Parliamentary Undersecretary Jenny Marcroft heading to New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>Marcroft will participate in the Anzac Dawn Service at Place Bir Hakeim in Nouméa, and will attend a second service at the New Zealand War Cemetery on Friday in honour of the thousands of New Zealand military personnel based at the 3rd division's Bourail headquarters.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was of course joined by Climate Minister Simon Watts for his tour of Southeast Asia, as well as New Zealand's first Filipino MP Paulo Garcia. They travelled together to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>Each of the three joint statements Luxon released alongside his Southeast Asian counterparts highlighted the South China Sea and pointed specifically to concerns over recent developments there.</p>
        
            <p>They affirmed the right of freedom of navigation and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - saying all states should pursue peaceful resolution in accordance with international law - a statement pointed at China's increased presence in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The government's most visited country this month was the United States, with three ministers - Peters, Space Minister Judith Collins, and Finance Minister Nicola Willis - all attending separate engagements there at different times.</p>
        
            <p>With the US visits and the government's statements on the South China Sea, it makes sense that Trade Minister Todd McClay would spend six days shoring up New Zealand's relationship in China, our largest trading partner.</p>
        
            <p>With Marcroft's trip to New Caledonia and Brownlee's delegations to the Cook Islands and Niue, the Pacific is getting some face time. Peters' visit to Washington DC also resulted in joint investments with the United States of $8.2m to boost internet connectivity across the region with the Pacific Connect Cable, and a further $8.2m for an oceans and fisheries research vessel being primarily funded by Australia.</p>
        
            <p>That country was also visited by NZ First's Rural Communities and Associate Agriculture Minister Mark Patterson, promoting New Zealand wool at the International Wool Textile Organisation Congress in Adelaide, and visiting a zero carbon farm near Hamilton, Victoria. He promptly reopened the world's largest wool scouring facility in Napier after a $50 million refurbishment just a couple of days after returning.</p>
        
            <p>Plenty of energy certainly seemed to be put into the ministers' various social media accounts, with McClay posing with kiwifruit, Peters watching the solar eclipse and being presented with a birthday cake in the US, and Collins getting stuck in a packed lift in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon made the most of his trip for the socials too, having breakfast with a Singaporean influencer, taking a Tuk Tuk tour of Bangkok that Watts clearly enjoyed, and updating his bromance status with BongBong Marcos, the Philippines President.</p>
        
            <p>Whether the energy levels of the trip exceeded those of his predecessors is rather subjective, but Luxon absolutely rated his own success, saying he was returning home "excited and energised".</p>
