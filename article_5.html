        <h2>Ship engines may not be 'coping' with fuel additives, Shane Jones told</h2>
        <p>
Despite this, Resources Minister Shane Jones says Mobil told him there is no problem with the fuel itself.

            <p>Resources Minister Shane Jones says a major oil company has told him New Zealand ship engines may not be coping with a fuel additive - but it has assured him there is no problem with the fuel itself.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, RNZ revealed fuel problems were the likely cause of the Bluebridge Connemara losing power in the Cook Strait and drifting for more than two hours.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Maritime NZ, and Transport Minister Simeon Brown all confirmed Bluebridge owner StraitNZ advised it believed fuel issues may have been a contributing factor.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE said it had not been advised of any potential marine fuel problems by other operators.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones said the ministry was "doing a deep dive to make sure the quality of the fuel is not endangering any of our critical assets".</p>
        
            <p>Jones had senior Mobil representatives in his office on Tuesday morning for a separate matter but during the meeting, they assured him of the quality of their fuel, he said.</p>

            <p>"From their perspective the fuel they're bringing in passes muster, but there could be a problem with the application of an emulsifier into the fuel and that the engines in New Zealand are not actually coping.</p>
        
            <p>The country's fuel has been imported since the closure of Northland's Marsden Point refinery in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"In the absence of the refinery ... now we've got these fuel quality problems."</p>
        
            <p>Mobil said it did not supply fuel for Bluebridge ferries.</p>
        
            <p>It would not comment on its meeting with Jones, saying that it was confidential.</p>
        
            <p>"Mobil is just one of multiple suppliers, working to reliably deliver fuel from a wide range of sources to ports and customers across the country," it said.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE said it was looking into the fuel supplied to the Connemara, as part Maritime NZ's investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial testing has shown that there's no issue with the quality of the fuel supplied," said MBIE trading standards national manager Stephen O'Brien.</p>
        
            <p>"However, further testing is being conducted. If any issues are identified with the quality of the fuel supplied, we'd want to understand the source, how widespread it is and what the fuel supply companies were doing to resolve it."</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ said since the power loss StraitNZ has replaced the Connemara's fuel and cleaned its storage systems.</p>
        
            <p>"No issues have been identified with recent sampling of fuel supplied out of Wellington," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"If there were, appropriate people would have been notified."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First wanted the Marsden Point refinery reopened, and officials have received a draft report into re-establishing it.</p>
        
            <p>Macon Marine managing director and experienced maritime consultant John Riding said there was a common problem with imported fuel, which was more likely to become infected with bacteria.</p>
        
            <p>The bacteria can create a "sludgy" substance that clogs up fuel injectors, so fuel cannot get into the engine, he said.</p>
        
            <p>When the refinery was operating, New Zealand imported crude oil and processed it before it was used for ships and vehicles, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody's actually used to the problems of having to deal with [the bacteria], and that's the underlying problem that we're facing.</p>
        
            <p>"It won't go away whilst whilst we're having to buy product on the world market, it's something we're going to have to start dealing with as a country."</p>
        
            <p>Once fuel with the bacteria was used on board, ships would generally need a new set of fuel injectors and a fuel pump, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the problem could be managed with the right equipment and testing regimes.</p>
        
            <p>"The first thing we need to look at in New Zealand, and it will be in the distribution chain, is more testing."</p>
