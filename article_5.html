            <p>The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) is set to cut 85 to 90 jobs, the Public Service Association says.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed cut amounts to about 13 percent of Niwa's workforce.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty of the positions are currently vacant, the PSA said.</p>
        
            <p>It is the latest in a raft of ministries, agencies and Crown entities to announce job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"Niwa maintains this will have no impact on its core work and is driven by the need to remain financially viable," Public Service Association national secretary Duane Leo said."How does this make sense?"</p>
        
            <p>NIWA carried out critical research into the weather and climate, he said. "Why do this now when climate change is upon us, when the frequency of storm events is increasing rapidly, and our freshwater resources are in a fragile state?</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Tuesday RNZ reported dozens of jobs were to be axed at Commerce Commission.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands 35 to 40 jobs will be cut at the commission, about 10 percent of its staff.</p>
        
            <p>They are part of the government's directive to public services to cut costs by between 6.5 and 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday Ministry for the Environment called for voluntary redundancies, and about 30 science and engineering jobs at Callaghan Innovation were set to be cut.</p>
