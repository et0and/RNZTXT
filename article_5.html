Christopher Luxon says he will look at New Zealand First's "anti-woke" bill to see whether it could be incorporated in government plans to ensure the public service was a meritocracy.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has joined New Zealand First's anti-woke crusade, saying he's open to adopting some of his coalition partner's ideas.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First last week proposed new legislation which it said would end "woke left-wing social engineering and diversity targets" in the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon told reporters on Tuesday the government had plans to overhaul the Public Service Act to ensure it was a "meritocracy".</p>
        
            <p>He said he would look at New Zealand First's bill to see whether it could be incorporated.</p>
        
            <p>"When we took the keys to the place, it was pretty woke, and it's entirely appropriate that we actually look at, what else we can do to make sure the public service delivers."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said Public Service Minister Judith Collins was "definitely not woke".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media later, Collins agreed with Luxon's assessment, declaring herself to be "the least woke person" around.</p>
        
            <p>"People work really hard, in my experience, and they really do need to be looked at as humans, not just as putting labels on people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"People want respect. They don't want labels."</p>
        
            <p>NZ First's proposal is not a government bill, and will not be looked at by Parliament unless it is drawn randomly from the ballot.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal would remove requirements for public service employers to ensure their workforces reflected societal diversity.</p>
        
            <p>It would also scrap requirements for chief executives and boards to promote diversity and inclusiveness as part of being a 'good employer'," including specific references to MƒÅori involvement</p>
        
            <p>remove "mandates promoting diversity and inclusiveness in public service workplaces"</p>
        
            <p>The proposed legislation would end the "obligation for panels appointing chief executives to consider diversity and inclusiveness".</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service (Repeal of Diversity and Inclusiveness Requirements) Amendment Bill follows radical moves in the US by the second Trump administration to purge its public service of anything it deemed to be promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).</p>
