            <p>Wellington Central MP Tamatha Paul played songs protesting police at a festival over the weekend, after her critical comments of beat patrol officers.</p>
        
            <p>One of the capital's premier festivals, CubaDupa showcases music and food along the popular thoroughfare Cuba Street. At the event Tamatha Paul was part of a music set alongside local artists such as DJ Messie and beatboxer King Homeboy.</p>
        
            <p>During the set, songs such as 'Killing in the Name' by Rage Against the Machine and 'Sound of da Police' by KRS-One were played. Both songs focus on the issue of police brutality and racism.</p>
        
            <p>The performance came after the Green MP faced criticism for comments made at a panel discussion hosted by the University of Canterbury's Greens and Peace Action Ōtautahi.</p>
        
            <p>Paul told the event people in Wellington did not want to see police officers everywhere, and "for a lot of people, it makes them feel less safe".</p>
        
            <p>"It's that constant visual presence that tells you that you might not be safe there, if there's heaps of cops," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She also accused police of "waiting for homeless people to leave their spot, packing their stuff up and throwing it in the bin".</p>
        
            <p>The comments attracted criticism from National, ACT, New Zealand First and Labour.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon accused the Greens of being in "la-la land on law and order" and Police Minister Mark Mitchell called the comments "laughable".</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said "undermining confidence in the police" was not the way to have a discussion about police resourcing and preventing crime.</p>
