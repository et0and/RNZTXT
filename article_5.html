        <p>
Cost cutting necessary to fit within a new 'funding envelope,' the Institute of Environmental Science and Research says.

            <p>The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) is proposing to slash 51 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as part of public sector cost cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>The crown agency said it was consulting with staff on a plan to disestablish 76 roles - of which nine are currently vacant - and create 25 new ones.</p>
        
            <p>"ESR grew quickly during the Covid-19 pandemic with a significant but time-bound increase in funding to establish critical systems and services," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"With the acute phase of the pandemic now over, this funding level has been reviewed and, as anticipated, reduced."</p>
        
            <p>It needed to reduce costs "to live within the new funding envelope" which required job cuts, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Association (PSA) Assistant Secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said the proposed cuts were happening before a group backed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment provided advice on how to strengthen the science, innovation and technology sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Science System Advisory Group was yet to deliver the second part of its two-part report, which would give final recommendations and advice on longer-term changes to ensure the future success of the science system.</p>
        
            <p>The report was expected out at the end of October.</p>
        
            <p>Like other cuts to public funding of science, the proposed cuts at ESR were happening before that review was completed, Fitzsimons said.</p>
        
            <p>In September GNS Science confirmed it would cut 59 roles.</p>
        
            <p>"The PSA is concerned that any outcomes, even if positive, will be made more difficult to implement with cuts in the science sector now being locked in," Fitzsimons said.</p>
        
            <p>ESR staff undertook essential work supporting public health including monitoring diseases, preparing for pandemics, testing food and products, supporting the criminal justice system and examining water quality, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"ESR is losing scientists, technicians and other expertise as the Government continues to show how little it values the long-term benefits of science and research to improving the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders," she said.</p>
