            <p>New Zealand has continued its rise in a ranking of the world's most powerful passports.</p>
        
            <p>The Henley Passport Index, organised by a consulting firm that describes itself as "the global leader in residence and citizenship by investment," releases the list based on global travel freedoms using data from the International Air Transport Association.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is tied with several other nations in fifth place, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Portugal and Belgium.</p>
        
            <p>The ranking is the highest for New Zealand since 2017. It peaked at No. 4 in 2015 but dipped as low as 8th in 2018 and 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Holders of NZ passports can get visa-free access to 190 out of 227 destinations worldwide, according to the index.</p>
        
            <p>Singapore tops the list for the second year in the row. It has been first or second on the list for the last eight years.</p>
        
            <p>At the tail end of the list are countries including Yemen, Iran and Syria, with Afghanistan at the bottom ranked 106th, with only 26 countries allowing visa-free access.</p>
