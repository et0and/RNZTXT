            <p>A new fast consenting process has been set up to increase flood resilience in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell and Environment Minister Penny Simmonds announced the scheme on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The streamlined consenting would only be available to applications lodged by Hawke's Bay councils, and for eight specific locations in Awatoto, Havelock North, Omahu, Pakowhai, P≈çrangahau, Waiohiki, Wairoa, and Whirinaki.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay was hit hard by Cyclone Gabrielle, with widespread flooding and damage to properties and infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"Faster consenting means work to build stop banks, spillways and other infrastructure can get underway sooner, increasing flood protection for about 975 properties and their communities," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The works will also help protect the industrial area and Napier's wastewater treatment plant in Awatoto."</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds said the process would give affected people the certainty they need for the future of their homes and businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"The recently approved Order in Council makes temporary changes to the Resource Management Act to streamline consenting for this flood resilience work," she said.</p>
