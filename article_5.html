            <p>The coalition is establishing a $2 million dollar fund to honour those who died in care and are buried in unmarked graves.</p>
        
            <p>The dual purpose fund is part of the government's ongoing response to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care.</p>
        
            <p>Local authorities will be able to apply for up to $50,000 dollar lump sums to memorialise those buried in unmarked graves associated with psychiatric and psychopaedic sites</p>
        
            <p>"Authorities with sites in those areas can apply for funding to memorialise those who are buried, in ways their communities deem appropriate," Lead Coordination Minister Erica Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry identified at least 4000 unmarked graves in Auckland, Waikato, Nelson, Rangitīkei, Horowhenua, Porirua, Otago, Westland and Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>The $2 million dollars will also pay for community initiatives to deliver support and services to survivors of abuse in care.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes educational workshops, initiatives to promote awareness and prevention of abuse in care, navigation support, and individual and collective advocacy for survivors," Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>The fund will be administered by Community Operations Hāpai Hapori in partnership with the Crown Response Office (CRO).</p>
        
            <p>"We respect and recognise the significance of these sites, and the work that has gone on locally to ensure they can endure.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important survivors are enabled to identify the supports and solutions that are meaningful to them," Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Louise Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>The fund responds to recommendations 5, 19, and 20 of Whanaketia.</p>
        
            <p>Applications can be submitted at www.communitymatters.govt.nz.</p>
