            <p>Russia has banned a further 36 New Zealanders from entering its borders.</p>
        
            <p>Among them are journalists, scholars, defence personnel and public servants, as well as a number of mayors; Tory Whanau in Wellington, Kirsten Wise in Napier, Paula Southgate in Hamilton, Nick Smith in Nelson and Neil Holden in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said it was in response to the sanctions New Zealand had placed on Russia, and entry for these people should be "closed in perpetuity".</p>
        
            <p>"Considering that Wellington does not intend to renounce its anti-Russia policy and continues to approve new sanctions, the work to update the Russian stop list will be continued," it said.</p>
        
            <p>This was the fourth list of its kind, bringing the total number of banned individuals to 229.</p>
        
            <p>The first list, released in April 2022, included all 120 members of the Parliament of the day, and Governor-General Cindy Kiro.</p>
        
            <p>Further lists included senior executives at RNZ, Stuff and NZME, and the partner of then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern, Clarke Gayford.</p>
