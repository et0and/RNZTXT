            <p>The Mexican ambassador appears to have more influence over Winston Peters than the prime minister himself, a Green MP says.</p>
        
            <p>Ricardo Menéndez March says he has now been the subject of four Ministerial attacks because he is a migrant - yet Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has failed to make a stand.</p>
        
            <p>His comments came after New Zealand First MPs Winston Peters and Shane Jones again attacked Menéndez March's status as a migrant, this time because he referred to the country's name as Aotearoa in a question in the House.</p>
        
            <p>Peters asked the Speaker if someone who came to New Zealand in 2006 was allowed to ask a question that changed the country's name, without it going to a referendum.</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March, who was born in Mexico but is a New Zealand citizen, said Peters was being xenophobic.</p>
        
            <p>He also said Luxon hasn't yet responded to a letter the Greens wrote to him, when Shane Jones yelled 'send the Mexicans home' three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>The MP told Morning Report the deputy PM had made a career out of scapegoating migrant communities and the latest incident was the fourth time he had been attacked over his immigration status by a government minister.</p>
        
            <p>"And yet we have a prime minister who is showing absolutely no leadership and is unable to stamp it out because he's afraid to hold Winston to account."</p>
        
            <p>He said Luxon needed to make it clear that such behaviour was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March said the comments have hurt New Zealand's diplomacy efforts and harmed its relationship with Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>By doing nothing the prime minister had been seen to have less power than the Mexican ambassador whoreceived an apology from Peters over his remarks.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was allowing his Ministers "to run rings around him with anti-migrant sentiment".</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March said when political leaders attacked migrants in Parliament and undermined their ability to participate in democracy, it had flow-on effects outside Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"It gives the green light to people who wish to attack our migrant communities - we're seeing that on public transport, we're seeing that in other places."</p>
        
            <p>Peters denied to Morning Report that he had made the use of the word Aotearoa an immigration issue.</p>
        
            <p>He objected to the MP changing the country's name without any mandate or consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March had applied to move to New Zealand and should not have the "temerity" to refer to it as something else.</p>
        
            <p>"Have the New Zealand people ever been asked this question? No."</p>
        
            <p>Peters believed there was no debate about the country's name.</p>
        
            <p>In Parliament the name of the country was New Zealand and it would not change unless New Zealanders said that was what they wanted in a referendum.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's what democracy's about."</p>
