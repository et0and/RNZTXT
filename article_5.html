            <p>Travellers calling for non-stop flights between New Zealand and India now have a date on which to pin their hopes - but it is still more than three years away.</p>
        
            <p>The airline announcement was unveiled at a Tourism NZ reception attended by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon at Mumbai's grand Taj Mahal Palace Hotel early on Thursday morning NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also found time to meet with popular Bollywood stars Aamir Khan, Vidya Balan, producer Siddharth Roy Kapur, entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, and filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker.</p>
        
            <p>"The film scene brings money into our economy which creates jobs and grows income, and I want to see more of that. So, it was great to catch up with a few Bollywood stars to get their thoughts on what more we can do," he posted on Instagram.</p>

            <p>Earlier, outgoing Air NZ chief executive Greg Foran and Air India's Campbell Wilson signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) "with the objective of boosting air connectivity".</p>
        
            <p>The two agreed to a "codeshare partnership" making it easier for travellers to book connecting flights between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>On the prospect of that long-called-for direct route, the MoU states that the airlines will "explore" the possibility "by the end of 2028". The commitment is subject to new aircraft deliveries and regulatory approvals.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media in India, Foran said the delay was simply due to a shortage of suitable aircraft worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>"The airline ecosystem is still getting back on stream… Boeing is still getting up to speed. Airbus aren't quite hitting their production targets.</p>
        
            <p>"I've shared previously that Air New Zealand is waiting for planes. They're actually about five years late."</p>
        
            <p>Foran said the announcement should be seen as a signal that the intent and ambition were there.</p>
        
            <p>"A direct flight to New Zealand to give our customers a world class tourism experience is coming," he said.</p>

            <p>Separately, Luxon told reporters the government would play its part to get the route up and running.</p>
        
            <p>"This is really important. Yes, we've got the pacing item of access to aircraft, but we'll do everything from a government's point of view to make sure it's seamless, that nothing's getting stuck in any bureaucracy."</p>
        
            <p>A member of the community delegation, Ranjna Patel, told RNZ many would be disappointed by the lack of detail and the long lead time.</p>
        
            <p>"We see that the deal is done, and we want it yesterday."</p>
        
            <p>India NZ Business Council head Bharat Chawla told RNZ a direct flight was "top of the agenda" for the community.</p>
        
            <p>He was more understanding of the timeline, however, given the shortage of long-haul planes: "We've waited 10 years, at least we have hope now."</p>
        
            <p>For years, the Indian community in New Zealand has called for a direct flight given the existing journey requires at least one stopover en route, typically in Singapore.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, the National government - under Sir John Key - signed an air services agreement with India, billed as paving the way for direct flights.</p>
        
            <p>And in 2023, the Labour government further eased the way, signing an MoU allowing more co-operation in civil aviation between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Foran told RNZ's Checkpoint the airline wanted to explore more routes to India once it was through tough economic "headwinds".</p>
        
            <p>Tourism NZ also used the function to unveil a winter marketing campaign targeting Indian visitors.</p>
        
            <p>More than 80,000 international travellers arrived from India last year, 23 percent more than in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism NZ research found 18.3 million potential travellers across Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru were actively considering a visit to New Zealand, with 43 percent ranking New Zealand as their top destination choice.</p>

            <p>Luxon arrived in Mumbai late afternoon on Wednesday (NZT) to launch into the second leg of his India charm offensive.</p>
        
            <p>A more commercial focus saw Luxon straight off the Defence Force 757 and off to visit the chair of Tata Group, India's largest conglomerate.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was given a guided tour of Tata Consultancy Services campus and witnessed another MoU signing with Air New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>From there it was back into the bilateral meetings: Luxon sat down first with Maharashtra chief minister Shri Devendra Fadnavis, and then the governor Shri C P Radhakrishan.</p>
        
            <p>As well, he visited the Bombay Stock Exchange to hit the gong marking the end of the trading day.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was running late meaning the preceding speakers had to rattle through their speeches at pace while the clock ticked down to 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>The official photo recorded the time of impact at 5:03pm.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's energy levels seemed to be flagging on what is his third full day in India: a planned media stand-up was pushed back several hours to allow him to recharge.</p>
        
            <p>But Luxon denied the punishing programme was taking its toll: "All pacing great, energiser bunny, ready to go."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has one day remaining in Mumbai before departing. He is due back in New Zealand early on Saturday.</p>
