        <h2>Luxon comes to minister's defence over tobacco tax</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister has chalked up Casey Costello wrongly telling RNZ she had not sought advice on freezing increases in the tax as a possible mistake.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has come to the defence of the Associate Health Minister Casey Costello after she wrongly told RNZ she had not sought advice on freezing increases to tobacco tax.</p>
        
            <p>Documents show the New Zealand First minister did ask the Health Ministry for advice on that matter in late December.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has chalked it up as a possible mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the reality is that, you know, she asked for a range of advice, she gets a lot of advice. She's a new minister. And I just say to you, at the end of the day, we've got an increase in the excise tax exactly as we should have and in line with what we got."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would not characterise the error as dishonesty, and agreed it was "possibly the reality of it" that as a new minister she had simply got confused in an interview.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is, however, that the paper that came towards cabinet was very straightforward. It was very simple conversation. It was an increase in the excise tax, as you would expect, and as we've expected, in previous years."</p>
        
            <p>He told reporters his government would not be pausing increases to tobacco tax, and had increased it again in a decision before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a Cabinet Paper that came to Cabinet before Christmas, proposed an increase in excise tax," he said. "It was a pretty simple conversation - it was implemented, decided and done.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers get advice on lots of different things. They ask for advice on lots of different things. The bottom line is a paper came to Cabinet very, very quickly, in a matter of days, when it was needed. And we resolved it - sorted and done."</p>
