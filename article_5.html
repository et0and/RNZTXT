            <p>Wellington Water has revealed the price tag for two damning reports into the company was more than $300,000.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the summaries of two investigations by consultancy firms AECOM and Deloitte were made public.</p>
        
            <p>They found the capital's ratepayers were paying nearly three times more for unplanned water repairs than in other parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>The investigations also identified structual issues with oversight of its accounts, and an incident of alleged fraud which related to a worker who was no longer at the company.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed to RNZ they received a report which related to alleged fraud matters late last year, which would be assessed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ can reveal Wellington Water paid $332,000 for the AECOM and Deloitte reports.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water chief executive Pat Dougherty said the investigations and review process spanned months and included interviews with 38 staff members.</p>
        
            <p>"This investment has already paid dividends.</p>
        
            <p>"It's identified a lack of oversight, assurance, and weak financial processes and controls around how we manage our consultants and contractors, which opens us up to risks around fraud."</p>
        
            <p>
Wellington Water board chair Nick Leggett says he is "taking soundings" on whether he should resign after a scathing report.

            <p>Dougherty told RNZ he could not say how much money the company had overspent due to the company's lack of proper IT systems.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't supply this without a long manual process and detailed analysis, which would be time-consuming, costly, and take considerable resource.</p>
        
            <p>"What is clear is that we haven't delivered value for money, and that's not good enough."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City councillor Tim Brown told RNZ that he would instigate an effort for the council to take legal action against the directors of Wellington Water relating to how much money has been lost as a result of Wellington Water's over spend on water repairs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a large amount of money and it's a very consequential failure and there should be heads rolling and there should be legal accountability."</p>
