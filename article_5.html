            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill will be changed to include hapÅ« and iwi, but the Prime Minister says no changes will get National to support it.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet discussed the controversial legislation on Monday with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying ACT's David Seymour would have more to say on it soon.</p>
        
            <p>The final version will be considered again by Cabinet before it is introduced to Parliament in November.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Luxon is backing Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee despite questions being raised over changes to firearm reporting requirements made without any public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report the changes meant less onerous reporting requirements for volunteers running gun clubs.</p>
        
            <p>Reporting was still required for firearm and ammunition use outside of the clubs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What's happened is there are just very small, minor changes to annual reporting requirements."</p>
