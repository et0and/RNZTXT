        <h2>Watch: Luxon rules out reconsidering Māori Health Authority</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister says it is not true to say Maori were not consulted.
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister has ruled out Waitangi Tribunal recommendation for the government to reconsider scrapping the Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>The separtate entity was established in 2022 under Labour, but was disestablished earlier this year by the Coalition.</p>
        
            <p>A Tribunal report released today found that decision was ill-informed as it did not consult or engage with Māori or get substantive advice from officials.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon says it's not true to say Maori weren't consulted.</p>
        
            <p>"We campaigned very strongly on it, we had an election in New Zealand and as a result we formed a government and disestablished the Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not believe that approach was the right way forward, it had been available for 15 months from memory, pretty unsuccessful, not delivering outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon says his government is concentrating on partnering with iwi to achieve better outcomes for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The Minister of Health pushed back the release of the government's Māori Health Strategy to the first quarter of next year.</p>
        
            <p>Shane Reti also ruled out the Tribunal's recommendation to reinstate a stand-alone Māori health authority - but said the government was committed to improved consultation with Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi-Māori Partnership boards - which were given a broader remit when the Authority was axed - are making good progress, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm quite convinced that we will do a better for Māori and Māori health outcomes, furthermore the independent review review of the Māori Health Authority eight months after its establishment was not kind."</p>
        
            <p>Reti said he will take some time to digest the report.</p>
