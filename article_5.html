        <h2>New hospital shows private sector has 'key part' in health - health minister</h2>
        <p>
Heated flooring, 55-inch TVs and room service - Wellington's new hospital seems more like a five-star hotel than a health facility.

            <p>Heated flooring, 55-inch TVs and room service - Wellington's new $185m Wakefield Hospital redevelopment seems more like a five-star hotel than a health facility.</p>
        
            <p>However, patients languishing on elective surgery waiting lists in the public system could be in for this plush private treatment in future, according to Health Minister Simeon Brown, guest of honour at Thursday's grand opening.</p>
        
            <p>"Partnering with the private health sector is a key part of our plans to deliver for Kiwis," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Aside from ensuring our public systems are working as efficiently as possible, we also need to consider how we can make best use of the capacity and expertise the private health sector can offer."</p>
        
            <p>Longer-term contracts and agreements with private providers were "a key part of the strategy", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The minister demurred when asked by RNZ when the public could expect an official announcement on outsourcing to Wakefield, saying that was a question for Health NZ, which would be doing the actual negotiating.</p>

            <p>"But our expectation from the government perspective is we have set clear targets around our wait list and obviously the private sector plays a role and could play a greater role."</p>
        
            <p>Public health leaders, including Deputy Commissioner Ken Whelan and senior ACC executives, mingled with private health insurers, developers, hospital management and staff in surgical scrubs, who may have been mainly there for the canapes.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ deputy chief executive for the Central/Ikaroa region Robyn Shearer told RNZ a formal announcement regarding a contract with Wakefield was "in the wings".</p>
        
            <p>"This will support us with wait lists and getting public-private partnerships going. It's going to help patients in our community and take pressure off the system."</p>
        
            <p>The new five-storey hospital building adjoining the existing specialist centre included two cardiac cath labs, two endoscopy/operating theatres, seven fully-digital operating theatres, a 10-bed intensive care and high dependency unit ward and a 53-bed inpatient ward.</p>
        
            <p>Wakefield was operated by Evolution Healthcare, which runs five other hospitals, five specialist day hospitals, a maternity hospital and other specialist health services around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Evolution head of hospitals and day surgeries Michael Quirke said the extra operating theatres would boost capacity from 8000 to more than 10,000 patients annually.</p>
        
            <p>Wakefield general manager Carole Kaffes said consultants were queuing up to work in the world class facility.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the number of specialists approaching Wakefield Hospital for an opportunity to join, plans are already being developed for additional consulting and additional theatres."</p>

            <p>Evolution Group CEO Simon Keating said he had "recently formed a bit of a connection" with the new health minister.</p>
        
            <p>"I welcome his insights into the health system and I think it's in good hands."</p>
        
            <p>Private providers had "a vital role" in meeting the national health targets, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether that is elective surgery, cancer care or helping with our emergency care targets across the country through freeing up capacity with the facilities we build, we genuinely want to work in partnership with government and Health NZ to achieve that."</p>
        
            <p>The three-year development - initially scoped at $82m but ended up costing $185m - was 83 percent funded by Vital Healthcare Property Trust. The company was 70 percent owned by New Zealand investors, including ACC, which had an 8 percent stake.</p>
        
            <p>Fund manager Aaron Hockly said that meant every New Zealander could claim to be a shareholder in the Wakefield redevelopment.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's mixed public-private model provided universal access to basic healthcare "while also allowing individuals to opt for additional, potentially faster or more specialised care", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In this model, the private sector provides additional capacity to the health system, reduces the burden on public finances, and promotes improved accessibility, choice, and quality of healthcare."</p>
