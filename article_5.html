            <p>The government is celebrating plans to consult on increasing the speed limit for Kāpiti Expressway north of Wellington to 110km/h.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said he welcomed the news consultation on increasing the limit from the current 100km/h was set to begin in about two weeks, from 22 April.</p>
        
            <p>Transmission Gully would be exempt for now, with some works on that road still needing to be done, along with the Raumati Straights section of the Expressway which does not yet meet safety requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"The Mackays to Peka Peka and Peka Peka to Ōtaki Roads of National Significance (RoNS), which make up the Kāpiti Expressway, were started by the previous National Government and were designed and constructed to a high safety standard. Since these roads opened, no one has died in a crash," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased to see NZTA is also making good progress on the next phase of this important corridor, from Ōtaki to north of Levin, and I look forward to seeing similar speed limits set once construction is completed in coming years."</p>
