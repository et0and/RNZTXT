            <p>The prime ministers of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea have signed a new statement of partnership marking 50 years of bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>The document - which focuses on education, trade, security, agriculture and fisheries - was signed by Christopher Luxon and James Marape at the Beehive in Wellington this evening.</p>
        
            <p>It will govern the relationship between the two countries through until 2029 and replaces the last agreement signed by Marape in 2021 with then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>Marking the signing, Luxon announced $1 milllion would be allocated in response to Papua New Guinea's aspirations to strengthen public sector institutions.</p>
        
            <p>"That funding will be able to support initiatives like strengthen cooperation between disaster preparedness institutions and also exchanging expertise in the governance of state owned enterprises in particular," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>In his response Marape acknowledged the long enduring relationship between the government and peoples of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</p>

            <p>He said the new statement of partnership was an important blueprint on how the two countries would progress their relationship into the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Papua New Guinea brings to the table, as far as our relationship is concerned, our close proximity to Asia. We straddle the Pacific and Southeast Asia, we have an affinity to as much as our own affinity with our relations in the Pacific," Marape said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our dual presence at APEC continues to ring (sic) home the fact that we belong to a family of nations and we work back to back on many fronts."</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday Marape will meet with Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters and leader of the opposition Chris Hipkins.</p>
        
            <p>Later in the week Marape is scheduled to travel to Hamilton where he will meet with the New Zealand Papua New Guinea Business Council and with Papua New Guinea scholarship recipients at Waikato University.</p>
        
            <p>James Marape is accompanied by his spouse Rachael Marape and a ministerial delegation including Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko, Trade Minister Richard Maru, Minister for Livestock Seki Agisa and Higher Education Minister Kinoka Feo.</p>
        
            <p>This is Marape's first official visit to New Zealand following his re-election as prime minister in the last national elections in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>According to the PNG government, the visit signals a growing relationship between the two countries, especially in trade and investment, cultural exchange, and the newly-added Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme that New Zealand has extended to Papua New Guineans to work in Aotearoa.</p>
