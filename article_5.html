            <p>The man accused of murdering Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao has sacked his lawyers and is representing himself at his High Court trial.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao, 53, sat at a table between his former defence counsel and a trio of translators on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston told the jury Cao planned to conduct his own defence and that she believed it was in the interests of justice to proceed with the trial.</p>
        
            <p>His former defence lawyers, Colin Eason and Joshua Macleod, were appointed standby counsel.</p>
        
            <p>Preston told the jury that meant they could help Cao with a range of duties, such as cross-examining witnesses, and advising on questions of law and appropriate behaviour in court.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was no change in Cao's position from the beginning of his trial - that he says the evidence does not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown argued that Cao murdered Yanfei Bao on the day she vanished - 19 July, 2023 - after arranging to meet her at a home for sale in Hornby.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday morning, police dive squad member Seda Clayton-Greene gave evidence about searches following Bao's disappearance, including of an effluent pond at a Greenpark farm.</p>
        
            <p>Senior sergeant Paul Manhire later gave evidence about the discovery of Bao's body in a shallow grave along a treeline in July.</p>
        
            <p>The trial, which is in its third week at the High Court in Christchurch, has been punctuated by a number of adjournments. It was initially set down for six weeks.</p>
