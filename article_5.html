            <p>The Commissioner at Te Whatu Ora / Health NZ says there's a "cocktail of issues" at the agency that need dealing with but its "precarious" financial position isn't the most pressing.</p>
        
            <p>Lester Levy was appointed to the job two months ago after financial concerns were raised with Health Minister Shane Reti.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to MPs at Parliament's health select committee on Wednesday, Levy reiterated $130-$140 million deficits were being recorded each month and if they don't stabilise the agency was looking at a $1.4 billion deficit by the end of the financial year.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of attention has been focussed on financial issues, that is not the main show in town as far as we're concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"The main show in town is actually getting these waiting times down, ensuring the services are safe and of high quality and creating an environment within the organisation that is a rewarding environment for staff to work and we've got challenges across all these domains," he told MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Waiting times are "excessively long" according to Levy and have been for quite some time and have deteriorated over a number of years.</p>
        
            <p>He added productivity at Te Whatu Ora was also low.</p>
        
            <p>"So a lot to do but a high degree of optimism we can restore Health NZ to a highly functional organisation delivering the kind of results patients need and deserve."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall pressed Levy and Health NZ chief executive Margie Apa on the high number of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that have been signed at the agency since November.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 70 staff have NDAs, a practice that is usually rare given public service contracts already contain confidentiality clauses.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said she had seen some of the agreements signed.</p>
        
            <p>"They ask officials not to discuss their ideas - this is North Korean, get rid of it," she directed at Levy.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall added the Public Service Commissioner had asked her to raise the issue directly with Levy.</p>
        
            <p>"I have seen that request and I am responding to it, but I think I've made my position clear, it's not something I would ask for or necessarily do," Levy said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he wasn't aware of the NDAs when he took on the commissioner role and had been clear he doesn't agree with their use.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall also enquired whether a financial plan, which was required to be produced by the agency but was overdue, was near completion.</p>
        
            <p>Apa said the organisation was "weeks away" from finishing it but it would still need ministerial sign off and had to be audited before it was publicly released.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had advice that will take months so I'm proposing to get agreement from the minister to release it as an interim plan," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Levy confirmed Health NZ would return to producing monthly financial statements and while he hadn't contemplated publishing the minutes and agendas from his commissioner meetings, he said he'll give "strong consideration" to doing so.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins said Health NZ's new commissioner should give the health system "his undivided attention".</p>
        
            <p>As well as the commissioner role, Levy also works a second job - teaching two days a week at Auckland University of Technology.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the commissioner's sole focus should be running the country's hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's a part time role. I mean, he's now responsible for running the entire hospital system across the country; that is a full time job."</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's important for confidence in him as commissioner that he is seen to be giving this his undivided attention."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking after Select Committee this morning, Levy said he worked 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, for Te Whatu Ora.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he should hold a second job on top of this, he said there was "plenty of time to do everything".</p>
        
            <p>"I've always had an academic post. The courses that I teach are fully online... I'm not a classroom teacher. My students are post graduates, specialised, relatively small classes or PhD and there's plenty of time to do everything."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was comfortable with Levy holding a job outside of his role in the health system.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people in New Zealand do have two jobs and they work more than eight hours... a day. That's quite normal for many New Zealanders who are working incredibly hard. He is one of those hard working individuals who works seven days a week, juggling a lot of responsibility."</p>
