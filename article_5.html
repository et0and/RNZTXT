            <p>New Zealanders may vote on whether to extend political terms to four years at the next election.</p>
        
            <p>At the Bloomberg Address in Auckland Friday, Christopher Luxon said the coalition government planned to propose a referendum for 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the idea had cross-party support.</p>
        
            <p>"All three parties in government are fans of the four-year term and actually I think the other opposition parties are as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't kicked off that piece of work yet... But that will come onto our radar I imagine fairly shortly."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was critical of the current three-year term and said it pushed governments into short-term decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is a bit of an outlier with Australia for three-year terms... I think if a government isn't performing after four years you'd kick them out whereas with a three-year term you're often just getting going and then you're into an election year again.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we need to think about some of the scaffolding for longer term bipartisan decisions... So that irrespective of which government is in power that work is still carrying on."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was common for successive governments to scrap their predecessors' plans and start anew.</p>
        
            <p>"What you've seen is simple road extensions get on, off, on, off based on who's in power, and that's just dumb."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said any decisions about extending political terms would be through a referendum, which could come at the next election.</p>
        
            <p>"That's in our commitments to each other in our coalition agreement... To actually have a proposal on the table that we can take to the New Zealand people at the next election."</p>
        
            <p>Coalition partners NZ First and ACT have both called for four-year political terms in the past.</p>
        
            <p>In January, National said it has no position on a four-year term, despite committing to introduce legislation on it and such a move having broad support in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Under the coalition agreements, ACT leader David Seymour's Constitution (Enabling a 4-Year Term) Amendment Bill is set to pass its first reading within the government's first 15 months.</p>
        
            <p>"I think a lot of people agree that having three years is too short," Seymour told RNZ then. "We'd get careful, considered lawmaking more often if we had a four-year term."</p>
        
            <p>Of about 180 countries in the world that had some sort of Parliament, only nine of them worked on a three-year term, Seymour said.</p>
