            <p>The Transport Minister has laid out a vision for boosting Auckland's urban density in a speech to a business group.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to the Committee for Auckland today, the newly minted Transport Minister Chris Bishop started his speech by stating he makes "no apologies for being what is sometimes called an urbanist".</p>
        
            <p>His ideas for the city include reigning in congestion - with a Time of Use charging bill expected to get to select committee by the end of March - removing level crossings, encouraging transit-orientated development, and taking a "fresh look" at the city's viewshafts.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said Auckland's 73 viewshafts - which limit building above certain heights in the name of protecting views - have restricted the height of the city since the 1970s.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He said the viewshafts are potentially costing the city billions in lost development opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"Today I can tell you that Mayor Brown and I have had discussions on this issue, and he said he is open to a fresh look at Auckland's viewshaft settings in its Unitary Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We agree that the time is right to start the conversation. This is particularly relevant where the viewshafts impact the CBD and major transit corridors.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not proposing to remove these viewshafts. Rather, we are recognising that as the city changes, and there will be areas where the viewshafts should change with it."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the opening of City Rail Link in 2026 will bring a lot of change to the city, and to make the most of its opportunities, he wanted to see bigger buildings around major transport routes.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council is currently only required to zone for six-storey buildings around rapid transit stops.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to need to go much, much higher than that around the CRL stations if we truly want to feel the benefits of transit-oriented development. My aspiration is that in 10-20 years' time, we have 10-20 storey apartment blocks dotting the rail line as far west as Swanson and Ranui."</p>
        
            <p>He said the government will start by looking at short-term actions to enable development clusters around the inner core of City Rail Link stations.</p>

            <p>He also announced the government will be putting up another $200 million to remove seven level crossings in Takanini and Glen Innes, in time for the CRL.</p>
        
            <p>The government last allotted $200 million just a few months ago, to get rail network upgrades that could have de-railed the project completed in time for its opening - albeit with about 100 total days of closures scheduled for 2025 and 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the level crossings would have caused traffic nightmares as trains become more frequent with the City Rail Link.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a bit of money but it's going to end up [costing] more than that for all the rest of the level crossings. These are major intersections around Auckland and major projects but they have to be done to make CRL and the benefits that can come from CRL real for Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>"It also has massive safety benefits for Aucklanders both for people driving the trains but motorists as well."</p>
        
            <p>He said there have been almost 70 crashes at Auckland level crossings in the decade before 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said for every dollar invested in removing a level crossing, there is an economic return of at least $3.</p>
        
            <p>He said the $200,000 is coming from a capital contingency that Cabinet authorised to be drawn down at the end of last year.</p>
        
            <p>It will bring the total number of level crossings without a plan to be removed down to 35 - and those still threaten to disrupt traffic come City Rail Link.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown welcomed the funding boost.</p>
        
            <p>"This is great news for Auckland and will unlock congestion across the city, and enable better flow of traffic," Brown said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Once open next year, CRL will double Auckland's rail capacity and reduce congestion across the city, enabling Aucklanders to get to where they want to go faster."</p>
        
            <p>The seven priority level crossings for removal are at Spartan Road, Manuroa Road, Taka Street, Walters Road, Takaanini Station, Te Mahia Station and Glen Innes Station.</p>
