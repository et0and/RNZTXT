            <p>Wellington Central MP Tamatha Paul says public service job cuts are causing carnage in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has calculated nearly 5000 roles have been axed, or are proposed to go.</p>
        
            <p>And the government is not ruling out further job losses beyond what it calls its baseline savings exercise - directing ministries to save up to 7-and-a-half percent of their budgets.</p>
        
            <p>National's pledge to fund 13 cancer treatments from this year is looking increasingly shaky - with numerous ministers saying they cannot do everything in one Budget.</p>
