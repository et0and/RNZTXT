            <p>The finance minister's new indicator for measuring the budget has led to accusations of creative accounting from opposition parties.</p>
        
            <p>But the minister says including a long-term funded scheme in the government's short-term decision making process was not helping the government with its goal of getting the books back into shape.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's half-year economic and fiscal update (HYEFU) came alongside an announcement from Nicola Willis that the government would adopt a new measure of the operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL).</p>
        
            <p>Named OBEGALx, the new measure excludes revenue and expenses from the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).</p>
        
            <p>Despite the new measure, the return to surplus is still not forecast until 2028-29, one year later than May's forecast. With ACC still included in OBEGAL, the deficit would last even longer.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said there was good reason for removing ACC's revenue and expenses from OBEGAL.</p>
        
            <p>Essentially, as a long-term levy-funded scheme, Willis does not believe ACC deficits or surpluses are relevant to the government's short-term tax and spending decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"We were concerned that the self-funded nature of some entities would distract from really what the point of this intention is, which is to say 'are the government's spending and revenue decisions balanced over the short term?'," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury would continue to report the original OBEGAL - with ACC still included - in future forecasts and budgets. It did not support the new measure, over concerns about how it would be communicated.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition has seized on that, accusing Willis of shifting the goalposts.</p>
        
            <p>"She's adopting a measure entirely of her own creation in order to try and make the deteriorating financial situation that she has created look less bad than it is," Labour leader Chris Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"This appears to be an attempt at creative accounting, to make things appear better than they are, in terms of what the government's exploring there," said Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick.</p>
