            <p>National is down to its lowest support in 15 months, while Labour has had a jump, a new poll shows.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Taxpayers' Union-Curia poll has National on 34.9 percent, down 4.1 points on last month's poll.</p>
        
            <p>Labour meanwhile is up 3.6 points to 30.3 percent, its highest result in a TPU-Curia poll in 16 months.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens are down by 0.6 points to 10.4 percent, while ACT is up 0.9 points to 9.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First is on 7.6 percent, up by 0.8 points, and Te Pāti Māori is down 2 points to 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of Parliament, TOP is on 2.5 percent, while the combined total for other parties is 1.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>While National would lose four seats and Labour would gain five, it would not be enough to unseat the coalition.</p>
        
            <p>National's 44 seats, ACT's 12 seats, and New Zealand First's 9 seats means the coalition would have a total of 65.</p>
        
            <p>Labour would have 38, the Greens 13, and Te Pāti Māori 6.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon has also taken a hit as preferred prime minister, dropping five points to 27.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>But he is still ahead of Labour's Chris Hipkins, who is on 16.9 percent (up 4.3 points). Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick is in third place at 9.9 percent (up 2.7 points), followed by NZ First's Winston Peters on 8.4 percent (up 1.7 points).</p>
        
            <p>The poll was conducted by Curia Market Research for the Taxpayers' Union. It polled 1000 random adult New Zealanders by phone (landlines and mobile) and online between October 3-7, and has a maximum margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent. A total of 3.4 percent of people were undecided on the party vote question.</p>
        
            <p>Polls compare to the most recent poll by the same polling company, as different polls can use different methologies. They are intended to track trends in voting preferences, showing a snapshot in time, rather than be a completely accurate predictor of the final election result.</p>
