        <h2>Govt could use PPPs to build Defence infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
Using private sector financing would be contingent on companies meeting "rigorous security requirements", associate defence minister says.

            <p>The government could consider using private companies to build infrastructure at the Ōhakea Air Force base, but says security is still a top priority.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, RNZ revealed the Defence Force did not put a $200 million upgrade programme for the base up for consideration in this year's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>The programme includes a new accommodation block and explosive storage facility.</p>
        
            <p>The justification was that prioritisation was needed for other defence projects that were announced as part of a $571 million package in Budget 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Defence Minister Chris Penk told RNZ that public private partnerships were an option for financing new and regenerating existing infrastructure on the defence estate.</p>
        
            <p>He said preferred options would be looked at on a case-by-case basis as business cases were considered by the government, including in relation to work at Ōhakea and Linton army camp near Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>Penk could not confirm whether the $200 million Ōhakea Infrastructure Programme was specifically being considered to be funded via a PPP.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ he expected to announce further details about PPPs in relation to the defence estate and infrastructure in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>He said that security was a top priority when considering any decisions in that space.</p>
        
            <p>"Any decision to use private sector financing would be predicated on having absolute confidence that rigorous security requirements would be met."</p>
        
            <p>In June, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop signalled the government's intentions to pay for more major projects via private sector financing, such as PPPs.</p>
        
            <p>"The simple point is that we can't buy our way out of our infrastructure deficit. It's built up over many years," he said.</p>
