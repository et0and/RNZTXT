            <p>Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March says an apology from the trade minister over comments he made last week failed to acknowledge that what he said was racist.</p>
        
            <p>During Question Time last Tuesday, Menéndez March, who was born in Mexico, raised a point of order to say Todd McClay had said words to the effect of "you're not in Mexico now. We don't do things like that here".</p>
        
            <p>After a suggestion from the speaker that he withdraw and apologise, McClay did so.</p>
        
            <p>McClay has now written to Menéndez March personally to apologise, saying there was nothing intentionally meant by the comments.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a lot of respect for Ricardo, he's a very hard working MP. It was a little bit of friendly banter in the House which didn't land, which is the reason I was happy to stand up and apologise. But there's absolutely nothing personal about it," McClay said.</p>

            <p>Menéndez March said McClay's letter, which explained the comments were meant "in good humour", acknowledged that what he said was inappropriate.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the letter failed to explain why McClay made the comments in the first place, or acknowledge they could cause harm to migrant communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Discrimination towards migrant communities is no laughing matter, and the key thing I need him to understand is this is not about my feelings, or how he made me feel necessarily, but rather whether as a politician and as someone in a position of power, messages that so overtly racist and xenophobic are acceptable altogether," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Friendly banter does happen in the chamber, but we need to draw the line about things that are very explicitly racist and xenophobic, and it is concerning for a trade minister particularly to not be able to acknowledge when something was racist."</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March said on the day the comments were made, his mentions on X were full of people who felt "emboldened" by McClay's comments.</p>
