        <h2>Free cervical screening for at-risk women to continue</h2>
        <p>
Women who are unscreened or under-screened are at greater risk of developing cervical cancer, the government says.

            <p>Cervical screening for women at higher risk of developing the cancer will remain free, Health Minister Shane Reti has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said the government was "committed to achieving better cancer outcomes" and screening programmes were a critical part of early diagnosis and timely treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of last year's election, Labour promised to make cervical screening free for anyone aged between 25 and 69, a policy which was supported by health experts.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said continuing funding screening for women more likely to develop cervical cancer, coupled with the introduction of self-tests for HPV, had already "significantly" improved screening rates.</p>

            <p>"Cervical screening and HPV immunisations provide significant protection against cervical cancer. Since the National Cervical Screening Programme was established in 1990, the incidence of cervical cancer in New Zealand has reduced by 50 percent and deaths from cervical cancer have reduced by around 60 percent."</p>
        
            <p>Women who were unscreened or under-screened were at much greater risk of developing cervical cancer, Reti said, with approximately 85 percent of all cervical cancers found in that group.</p>
        
            <p>"Cost can be a barrier for screening for those on lower incomes, which is why community service card holders are also eligible for free screening under this initiative."</p>
        
            <p>Funding was targeted towards the groups with the greatest need and highest clinical risk, Reti said, which included MƒÅori and Pacific women.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are due for your regular cervical screening, I encourage you to participate. It's quicker and easier than ever, with the option to self-test.</p>
        
            <p>"Screening allows for early detection, follow-up testing and treatment. It finds early warning signs before they become cancer."</p>
        
            <p>The zero fees cervical screening programme is funded by Health New Zealand.</p>
