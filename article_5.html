            <p>Cabinet has approved a new way of delivering water services after it unwound the previous Labour government's Three Waters reforms.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown has announced council-controlled organisations - known as CCOs - will immediately be able to borrow for water infrastructure through the Local Government Funding Agency.</p>
        
            <p>The first Local Water Done Well bill is expected to pass in Parliament this month.</p>
        
            <p>After that, councils will have a year to provide plans setting out the funding they need and how they will ensure financial sustainability for water services into the future - including through CCOs, joint-council arrangements for funding water services.</p>
        
            <p>The funding collected through specific water rates would be ring-fenced for use on water infrastructure, and bolstered by borrowing from the LGFA, which was set up under the Local Government Borrowing Act 2011 in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
        
            <p>It is also a CCO, and was developed as a way of allowing councils to borrow at cheaper rates than they could otherwise. It has 31 shareholders, which includes 30 councils and the government.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said CCOs through the LGFA would be able to borrow up to five times what they took in through water rates - about twice what they could borrow on their own - subject to "prudent credit criteria".</p>
        
            <p>He said the government and the funding agency were also exploring increasing debt limits, potentially up to 350 percent of revenue, for high-growth councils, and allowing lending to CCOs not supported by parent councils.</p>
        
            <p>"This will enable councils to better manage debt and make essential infrastructure investments without drastic rate hikes," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our expectation is that councils will now use this certainty and the additional borrowing capacity to reduce pressure on ratepayers while being able to invest in the critical water infrastructure New Zealand needs."</p>
        
            <p>The government is also looking at setting up an economic regulation regime under the Commerce Commission, similar to what Labour had proposed.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet also agreed to a shift in water quality standards from the Water Services Authority, Taumata Arowai.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the changes would remove barriers for the regulator.</p>
        
            <p>The changes include:</p>
