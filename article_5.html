            <p>Kiribati has been receiving increased aid from China in recent years and its leader, President Taneti Maamau, called off a meeting with Foreign Minister Winston Peters a week out.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' office says says with $100 million spent 2021, New Zealand must ensure value for money.</p>
