            <p>Christopher Luxon said the relationship between New Zealand and the US has strong foundations and was bound by history and shared values.</p>

            <p>Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has congratulated JD Vance on being sworn in as the new vice president.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he looked forward to working together to further deepen the relationship between New Zealand and the US.</p>
        
            <p>He added the two countries were two of the world's great, longest-running democracies.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins congratulated Trump on his inauguration, saying the party wished him and the American people success.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said the important thing for New Zealand after Trump's inauguration was the peaceful transfer of power.</p>
        
            <p>He takes over as deputy prime minister in May and said he had been focused on New Zealand, but the new US regime could mean changes in trade and defence.</p>
        
            <p>He said the decisive result and the departing leaders' commitment to graciously conceding helped avoid the kind of tensions seen after the 2020 election.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens said Trump's inauguration would require New Zealand to show leadership in tackling climate change.</p>
        
            <p>The new president's policy of abandoning the Paris Agreement would see the US join Iran, Libya and Yemen as being among the few nations not involved.</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Chloe Swarbrick said New Zealand's prime minister had talked up working with like-minded nations, and this was an opportunity to do so.</p>
        
            <p>She said failing to address the climate crisis would mean more and worse weather events like the Los Angeles fires, Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in the North Island in 2023.</p>
