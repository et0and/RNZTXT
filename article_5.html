            <p>Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says it's a "real privilege" to attend the US Democratic National Convention.</p>
        
            <p>The four-day convention in Chicago is celebrating the official nomination of Vice-President Kamala Harris as presidential candidate in the November election.</p>
        
            <p>President Joe Biden was the keynote speaker on the first night, capping a handover to Harris after he was pressured to quit the race last month by party leaders worried the 81-year-old incumbent was too old to win or serve another four years.</p>
        
            <p>Harris made a surprise appearance on the first night, drawing cheers from the crowd as she vowed to defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the election.</p>
        
            <p>Ardern will be in the arena when former US President Barack Obama, and former First Lady Michelle Obama make their keynote speeches on the second evening.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a real privilege to be able to witness this moment in time," Ardern said.</p>
        
            <p>" You could see from the room a number of international guests and I think in part that's because of how important this election is, but also because it feels like a historic moment."</p>
        
            <p>Ardern told a meeting of Democrats on the sidelines of the convention that people were seeking a new kind of politics.</p>
        
            <p>"If there's any lesson I learned while in politics, it was that ultimately the politics of any country is for that nation to decide, and for that people to decide.</p>
        
            <p>"But I certainly get asked a lot generally about politics at the moment - the global state of politics.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think if you look around the world there is a call from voters to see that positivity from politicians to try and reduce that sense of division.</p>
        
            <p>"And so that's something I have an interest in now in my life post-politics. That's one of the reasons I started the Field Fellowship. "</p>
        
            <p>As well as attending the event Ardern was participating in a panel event to discuss policy ideas alongside other current and former international leaders.</p>
