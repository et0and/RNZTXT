            <p>New Zealand plans to invest $20.5 million into a new, large-scale, renewable energy project in Niue, reducing the island nation's reliance on diesel.</p>
        
            <p>The project will bring Niue's renewable generation to 80 percent.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will also commit $2 million to the Niue Ocean Wide Trust, which aims to develop a blue economy and ensure long-term ocean conservation and climate resilience.</p>
        
            <p>It comes alongside the announcement of an agreement to enhance the relationship between the two countries, and in recognition of the 50 years of Niue's self-government in free association with New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The funding for the initiatives comes from New Zealand's International Development Cooperation programme.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon made the announcements on the first leg of his first trip to the Pacific as New Zealand's prime minister, in a joint media statement alongside Niue's Premier Dalton Tagelagi.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the two countries shared a close bond.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been great to sit down with Premier Tagelagi to discuss areas of cooperation and our mutual priorities," he said. "Our work with Niue extends across sectors including health, education, and infrastructure resilience."</p>
        
            <p>The pair held formal talks earlier in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said they spoke about the importance of a resilient energy system that could reduce the cost of living for Niueans and bring down greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>"This project will achieve that and ensure better energy security in the face of more destructive weather events," Luxon said.</p>
