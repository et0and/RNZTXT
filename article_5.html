            <p>China says the joint statement made after a meeting between New Zealand and Australia's foreign and defence ministers contains groundless accusations about China's internal affairs.</p>
        
            <p>The Chinese embassy in Wellington has now released a statement saying they "strongly deplore and firmly oppose" the statement.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters and Defence Minister Judith Collins met with their Australian counterparts in Melbourne on Wednesday for the inaugural Australia and New Zealand Foreign and Defence Ministers' Meeting (ANZMIN).</p>
        
            <p>The four ministers issued a joint statement on Thursday expressing "grave concerns about human rights violations in Xinjiang".</p>
        
            <p>"They also expressed deep concerns about the erosion of religious, cultural, educational and linguistic rights and freedoms in Tibet, and the continuing systemic erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy, freedom, rights and democratic processes, including through the imposition of national security legislation," the statement said.</p>

            <p>The statement also acknowledged Australia's commitment to "responsible nuclear stewardship" and nuclear powered submarines under the AUKUS partnership the country has with the United States.</p>
        
            <p>In response, the Chinese embassy statement rejected any "external interference" in its affairs.</p>
        
            <p>"Matters related to Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are purely China's internal affairs which bear on China's core interests, and brook no external interference."</p>
        
            <p>It said in recent years economic and social development had achieved "great leaps forwards" which had "received wide recognition by the international community".</p>
        
            <p>"A Hong Kong with long-term stability, prosperity and stability is an integral part of the overall stable economic and social development of China," it said.</p>
        
            <p>In regards to Taiwan, the statement said the "One-China Principle is the strongest and best safeguard of peace and stability in Taiwan Straits".</p>
        
            <p>The statement went on to say that China hoped countries, including New Zealand, would uphold the One-China Principle and refrain from any official interaction with Taiwanese authorities.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said China had serious concerns about AUKUS saying that it ran "counter to the letter and spirit of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime".</p>
