            <p>Two new Te Pāti Māori MPs have made their debut in Parliament, promising to defend mokopuna Māori from attacks on their language and culture.</p>
        
            <p>Hauraki-Waikato MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke and Te Tai Tonga MP Tākuta Ferris gave bilingual maiden speeches on Tuesday which appeared to be a deliberate demonstration their ability to "sail in both worlds" as they transitioned comfortably between te reo Māori and English.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking first, Maipi-Clarke began by quoting a tongikura (proverb) of King Tāwhiao, acknowledging each of his successors, with a final mihi dedicated to King Tūheitia.</p>
        
            <p>She recalled her speech at the 50th anniversary of the Māori Language Petition just last year, where she asked then Finance Minister Grant Robertson, "Aotearoa, te Whare Paremata, are you ready?"</p>
        
            <p>"We are here, we are navigating just like our ancestors once did in the biggest ocean in the world Te Moana Nui a Kiwa. Even though some others aren't even jumping on the 'waka kotahi'."</p>
        
            <p>Becoming an MP at 21 years of age was never her plan.</p>
        
            <p>"I was perfectly fine growing my kumara and learning maramataka (Māori lunar calendar), but this House kept tampering with things they shouldn't be touching, and that's why I left the mārā (garden) to come here."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was advised "not to take anything personally" before entering Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Well speaker, I can't help but take everything personally that has been said in this chamber... In only 14 days this government has attacked my whole world from every corner, health, taiao, wai, whenua, natural resources, Māori wards, reo tamariki, and the right for me and you to be in this country.</p>
        
            <p>"How can I not take anything personally when it feels like these policies were made about me?"</p>
        
            <p>Maipi-Clarke made it clear she was not intimidated or afraid of Parliament or the debate chamber.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not fearful of this place or this debating chamber - trust me, I've been to marae AGMs all my life. I will not say which marae either."</p>
        
            <p>That moment drew a laugh from her supporters and other MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Maipi-Clarke shared her thanks and acknowledged former Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta for leading the way and showing young women in te ao Māori what was possible.</p>
        
            <p>She acknowledged her entire whānau and her fellow Te Pāti Māori MPs and spoke tearfully about mokopuna Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"No matter what comes out of this government I will make sure our kids hear us. Never fit in - you are perfect, you are the perfect fit."</p>
        
            <p>Maipi-Clarke ended with a challenge to the new government.</p>
        
            <p>"See you at Tūrangawaewae on the 20th." The Māori King, Kīngi Tūheitia, is hosting a national hui for unity at Tūrangawaewae Marae on 20 January.</p>

            <p>Tākuta Ferris echoed his colleague's sentiments, saying he was not there to service the needs of the House - he was there to contest it.</p>
        
            <p>He provided a detailed timeline and described in detail the wording included in 'He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni' (The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand) and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>He advised those wanting to dispute his historical timeline to visit Archives New Zealand, where an exhibition was currently displaying those documents alongside the women's suffrage bill.</p>
        
            <p>The new MP for Te Tai Tonga said Te Pāti Māori spoke from a purely Māori perspective, but did not presume to speak for all Māori.</p>
        
            <p>He said coalition government policies attacking the language and culture of Māori would only inspire more to take a stand.</p>
        
            <p>"We go to raise an army of voters, young voters, young Māori and non-Māori voters, tangata whenua, tangata tiriti alike who will arrive in their ever increasing numbers into the future, numbers great enough to contest this democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"To all our whanau, to all our people, stand up, stand up and be the lights, be the light for your whanau, be the light for your communities".</p>
