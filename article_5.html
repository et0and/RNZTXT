            <p>The government is allocating almost $17 million of Budget 2024 to support councils and speed up recovery efforts from Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>The $16.8m is part of the Cyclone Recovery Capability fund announced in this year's budget and will be given to 12 councils for 50 separate projects to help their communities.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell said councils need extra support to get a move on with progress in their areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes additional geotechnical expertise to speed up decision-making on landslide-affected properties, as well as resources to accelerate roading recovery, bridge repairs and flood protection projects in affected regions," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government is committed to helping councils and communities during their rebuild and recovery process after the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle which destroyed thousands of homes.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been clear we want the recovery projects to be completed faster, and we want communities to have certainty about their future."</p>
        
            <p>"Strengthening resilience is also the focus for a number of these projects to reduce the impact from future weather events and protect communities from future flooding," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged councils are working hard to get the right aid and implement the necessary measures to help with recovery efforts in their territory.</p>
