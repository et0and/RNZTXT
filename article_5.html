            <p>The incoming finance minister has admitted that New Zealand's world-first smokefree laws have been scrapped to fund tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>National's coalition deal with New Zealand First - released yesterday - says it will repeal amendments to the Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products Act 1990 and regulations before March 2024</p>
        
            <p>These changes would remove requirements for denicotisation and remove the reduction in retail outlets and the generation ban, while also amending vaping product requirements and taxing smoked products only.</p>
        
            <p>Under the coalition, National could no longer fund its promised tax cuts through a tax on foreign buyers, and had to look elsewhere for revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis told TV3's Newshub Nation that New Zealand First and Act were "insistent" the smoke-free legislation be reversed.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to remember that the changes to the smokefree legislation had a significant impact on the government books, with about a billion dollars there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Public health experts said legislation could have saved the health system $1.3b over 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>Health Coalition Aotearoa co-chair Professor Lisa Te Morenga said scrapping the legislation would cost thousands of lives, with the worst impact on MƒÅori.</p>
        
            <p>She said health professionals were shocked at the news.</p>
        
            <p>"We had believed that Shane Reti supported the Smokefree legislation ... so to hear they're going to repeal it is really a gut punch."</p>
        
            <p>National said in a statement it remains committed to reducing smoking rates.</p>
        
            <p>National's health spokesperson Dr Shane Reti said responsibility for implementing the new regulations are still to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said the work will likely sit with associate health minister Casey Costello.</p>
        
            <p>Te Morenga said the legislation could have saved the health system $1.3 billion dollars over the next 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"This is seen as world-leading legislation and some of our closest friends are looking to emulate the work," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So to repeal it just seems a completely backwards step."</p>
        
            <p>Te Morenga said the laws would have created a smokefree generation, who would never have had to deal with addiction or health loss caused by smoking.</p>
        
            <p>The new government has also vowed to reform the regulation of vaping, smokeless tobacco and oral nicotine products while banning disposable vaping products, consider requiring a liquor license to sell vapes and increase penalties for illegal sales to those under 18.</p>
