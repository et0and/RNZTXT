            <p>The Government plans to simplify consumer credit rules and regulation of the financial sector.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly said the current rules for consumer lending were too complicated and had resulted in creditworthy people being denied loans.</p>
        
            <p>In a speech to the Financial Services Council on Wednesday morning, Bayly said the criteria for lower risk lending would be relaxed as a priority, with a more detailed review of penalties and disclosure rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Financial Markets Authority will take over responsibility for consumer finance laws from the Commerce Commission, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Among other planned changes are streamlining the regulation of financial service companies to remove duplication and lower compliance costs.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes are not about lessening requirements for appropriate conduct.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about ensuring that financial institutions have clear guidance from the FMA, and take responsibility to meet their obligations more effectively without compromising on conduct standards."</p>
        
            <p>Bayly also said the Government planned to review the Companies Act and Kiwisaver settings.</p>
        
            <p>"The Companies Act is an important piece of legislation... But it's now 30 years old. I think aspects of it are out of date and could be improved."</p>
        
            <p>He said that was a longer term project.</p>
