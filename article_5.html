            <p>The election process has officially come to an end with the return of the writ.</p>
        
            <p>Issued by the governor-general on 10 September, the writ directs the Electoral Commission to conduct the election.</p>
        
            <p>It shows the names of the successful electorate candidates, while successful list candidates have been published in the Gazette.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament must be opened within six weeks of the return of the writ, with the governor-general summoning the MPs to the House to be sworn in and elect the speaker, known as the Commission Opening of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The following day is the official State Opening of Parliament, when the governor-general delivers a Speech from the Throne. So far under MMP no Parliament has been without a government by the time of the speech.</p>
        
            <p>Clerk of the House David Wilson said preparations were under way for the opening, and dates for the Commission and State Openings would be released when available.</p>
