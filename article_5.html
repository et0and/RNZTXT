        <p>
Labour and the Greens are concerned the government is "pulling away" from existing services, but minister says that's not the case.

            <p>Labour and the Greens are concerned a review of spending to tackle family and sexual violence could lead to reduced funding for some services.</p>
        
            <p>But the minister responsible says the review is not a cost-cutting exercise, rather an opportunity to look at what programmes are making a difference.</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced the second Te Aorerekura Action Plan, which will include a review of the $1.3b spent on family and sexual violence services and contracts.</p>
        
            <p>The first plan started the conversation, and now the focus was on streamlining, the minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence, Karen Chhour, said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're focused on doing a smaller number of things, but doing them more effectively. This plan will enable us to make an immediate difference, and also learn and adapt as we go, taking the opportunities to do more of what works."</p>
        
            <p>The was a need for government agencies such as police, Corrections, Oranga Tamariki, and ACC to work better and closer together through Te Puna Aonui business unit, as well as the responsible ministers, Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>"We sit around the table as ministers, and we're setting the direction for our agencies. And it's really quite a thing to have every minister on the same page. That's what this Action Plan is about, a commitment from all agencies that we're going to work in this space together."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's spokesperson for the prevention of family and sexual violence Ginny Andersen said the plan's use of social investment to prioritise investments was a "red flag", as it was a good way to measure outcomes but less effective at quantifying prevention.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a concern that they're using social investment as a tool, and they've used language to say they'll focus on those most at risk. We've always known if we want to seriously reduce family violence, we need to continue to invest in prevention services. The concern is they're pulling away from that."</p>
        
            <p>Andersen was also disappointed the second plan did not contain an explanation of the progress on the 40 deliverables from the first plan.</p>
        
            <p>"There is language that says they want to improve on prevention, and there are some programmes listed there that were already being delivered... but there is no further detail on how they intend to further expand prevention programmes."</p>

            <p>The plan was "absolutely not" a cost-cutting exercise, Chhour said. Communities and NGOs wanted to know that what they were doing was making a difference, and if it was not, what they could be doing to make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about going in there and saying 'you're rubbish, and you're not making a difference.' It's about 'what are you doing that really does make a difference, and how can we boost that, and how can we put more resources into that space to make sure we're supporting you well in what you're doing?'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>The strategy was originally launched by Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson under the last government.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens' acting family and sexual violence prevention spokesperson Kahurangi Carter said while she welcomed the commitment from the government to continue Te Aorerekura, she questioned the removal of a te ao Māori framework from the second plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The first plan was to really work with communities across so many sectors and across government, and was based in a te ao Māori framework, and you can see that has been taken out of the second one, which is not surprising from this government but is concerning for us."</p>
        
            <p>Carter was also concerned that some programmes, such as Family Start, which provides support to families under two, had already had funding cut due to budget constraints.</p>
        
            <p>"It's leaving people, particularly vulnerable families in rural areas, without this prevention support around them. For me, that does cast doubt on the commitment of this government to Te Aorerekura when they're committing to this plan but also cutting prevention services across the board."</p>
