        <h2>10,000 join hīkoi as Treaty bill protest heads south</h2>
        <p>
Hīkoi mo te Tiriti participants have turned out in force on foot and horseback in central Rotorua.
</p>
        
            <p>An estimated 10,000 people have marched through Rotorua today as part of Hīkoi mō te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the size of the group, Fenton Street was blocked temporarily as the hīkoi went through, police say.</p>
        
            <p>It is anticipated that on Friday afternoon the main hīkoi will travel via Taupō to Hastings, where participants will stay overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in Gisborne, a smaller hīkoi of around 80 people left Te Poho-O-Rāwiri Marae this morning heading south, accompanied by several vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>There have been no problems reported at any of these locations.</p>
