            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters says he's spoken with his Israeli counterpart about the importance of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Both ministers had posted to social media, confirming they shared a phone call on Thursday morning about the situation in Gaza and other regional developments.</p>
        
            <p>In his statement, Peters said they discussed "the importance of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and the need for its full implementation".</p>
        
            <p>"This includes the release of all hostages in Gaza and a surge of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians," his X account said.</p>
        
            <p>The first phase of the ceasefire agreement was due to expire next month.</p>
        
            <p>But Israel's security cabinet on Wednesday said if Hamas did not release more hostages as planned this weekend, it would resume fighting in the Palestinian territory.</p>
        
            <p>Hamas earlier said it was halting releases because it said Israel had breached the terms of the deal, something Israel denied.</p>
        
            <p>Peters also reiterated New Zealand's "long-standing call" for all parties to "take meaningful steps towards a two-state solution".</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] the only option for achieving lasting peace," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In his post, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said he thanked Peters for New Zealand designating Hamas and Yemen's Houthis as terrorist organisations.</p>
        
            <p>"I emphasized our commitment to release our hostages, who face torture and starvation," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope to strengthen bilateral relations and invited my counterpart to visit Israel."</p>
