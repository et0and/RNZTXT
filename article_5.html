            <p>The government is allowing migrant school leavers to get part-time jobs while they wait for the outcomes of their parents' residency applications.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration minister Erica Stanford said many young people who were part of a family residence application process were unable to work.</p>
        
            <p>"They can remain on visitor visas for long periods of time because they can't afford international student fees and can't qualify for a skilled work visa," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to ensure that migrants aged 17-24 who are onshore, have completed secondary school and applied for residence can continue to contribute and live a meaningful life in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>In order to be eligible, the migrant must already have left high school, and already lodged an application for a skilled residence visa application or dependent child residence visa.</p>
        
            <p>They must also hold an eligible visitor visa, and be a dependent child of a work visa holder or New Zealand citizen or resident.</p>
        
            <p>The change, which is due to be implemented by the end of October, will allow migrant school leavers to work 20 hours a week during the school year, and 40 hours a week over the summer holiday period, in line with the work rights available to Year 12 and 13 students on a dependent child student visa.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration New Zealand will provide further details on how to apply, and the exact implementation date, by 30 August.</p>
