            <p>A Treasury report puts the cost of the preferred option for a second Waitematā Harbour crossing at between $23 and $27 billion.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency and Auckland authorities had been looking at, and bickering over, what to do about relieving pressure on the Harbour Bridge for years.</p>
        
            <p>A business case was completed several months ago, and it's current recommended option included both a tunnel and second bridge, according to a newly released Treasury investment report.</p>
        
            <p>It also encompassed upgrades to the Northern Busway, Harbour Bridge and State Highway One.</p>
        
            <p>"The total cost of Stage 1 capex [capital expense] is $22.9- 27.2 billion," it said.</p>
        
            <p>The government rejected a plan hatched under it's predecessor costed at over $50 billion.</p>
        
            <p>"To ensure that the project achieves value for money, I have directed NZTA to refine the scope of the crossing and develop a more detailed understanding of the costs, risks, trade-offs, and assumptions for the tunnel and an equivalent bridge option, prior to seeking a decision from ministers on which option to progress," Transport Minister Simeon Brown told RNZ in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Auckland's mayor Wayne Brown recently urged the government to abandon the tunnel option completely. A second bridge was "hugely cheaper, massively cheaper", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The new investigations would take 12-18 months, NZTA Waka Kotahi said, which would include sounding out potential partners on what they prefer, and taking "market sounding to understand market appetite for options".</p>
        
            <p>It had yet to do a geotechnical study either - Brown said this might start as soon as the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The agenda must also update consenting pathways and protect the route, and look into funding and contract options, Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>All major highways must now consider charging tolls. Public-private partnerships - PPPs - were also much more on the table.</p>
        
            <p>A detailed business case may begin next year, with the construction itself from 2029-40, the Treasury report said.</p>
        
            <p>So far, at least $36m had been spent on the preliminary business case, three quarters of that on consultants.</p>
