        <h2>GCSB completes audit of foreign partners' capabilities</h2>
        <p>
The audit was recommended after it was revealed an unnamed foreign agency was allowed too much leeway inside the bureau for years.

            <p>The Government Communications Security Bureau has just finished a full audit of its systems, including of the capabilities of any of its foreign partners.</p>
        
            <p>The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security recommended the audit after revealing an unnamed foreign agency was allowed far too much leeway for years within the GCSB.</p>
        
            <p>That report in March pushed for organisational improvements, as well five other moves, such as registers and reviews to reduce the risk of any repeat.</p>
        
            <p>"The GCSB accepted all recommendations in my report on its hosting of a foreign capability," the inspector Brendan Horsley told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The agency recently completed the full audit of all systems, which was his third recommendation.</p>
        
            <p>"This supports work under way on the other recommendations and I am satisfied with progress so far," he said in a statement.</p>
