        <h2>Christchurch's Brougham Street announced as 'Road of Regional Significance'</h2>
        <p>
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is in Christchurch for a transport announcement.
</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch's Brougham Street will be prioritised for upgrades as a 'Road of Regional Significance' by the government, the prime minister has announced.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the brakes were put on $90 million plans to improve one of the city's busiest roads.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Christopher Luxon revealed the government would prioritise upgrades to State Highway 76 (Brougham Street ), which will include an overbridge between Collins and Simeon Streets.</p>
        
            <p>The upgrades to State Highway 76 as a road of regional significance would include an overbridge between Collins and Simeon Streets, with overall funding to be confirmed once a contractor was appointed.</p>
        
            <p>In May last year the government said the project would not receive new money because the Coalition was not funding the $8.7 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme it was part of.</p>
        
            <p>Then-Transport minister Simeon Brown instead announced Labour's programme would be replaced by its "roads of regional significance", and Brougham Street upgrades would only proceed if there were remaining funds in the $6.5 billion allocated to the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA).</p>

            <p>In Christchurch on Wednesday Transport Minister Chris Bishop said the government wanted to deliver transport infrastructure that boosted economic growth and productivity, reduced congestion, and created a safer and more reliable transport network for people, vehicles, and freight.</p>
        
            <p>"Carrying over 45,000 vehicles per day, SH76 Brougham Street is a critical route servicing the commercial, industrial, and residential areas south of Christchurch. It is also the main freight route to the South Island's largest port at Lyttleton," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In May last year, the government confirmed funding for the pre-implementation phase only for this project. This funding ensured a no-frills and value for money approach to design could be completed by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA), and strategic property purchases and consenting work could continue in parallel.</p>
        
            <p>"Cabinet has now confirmed funding will be provided by the Crown to NZTA to deliver this important Road of Regional Significance, with construction to begin by mid-2025, subject to statutory approvals. The overbridge is expected to be completed within two years, and wider improvements started once property and consenting requirements are completed.</p>
        
            <p>"The intersection upgrades and other interventions along the corridor will improve efficiency and safety as well as making travel times more reliable.</p>
        
            <p>"Once completed, the overbridge will enable local residents and school children to safely cross over the highway, rather than using the existing level crossing, as well as improving travel time reliability for freight going to and from the port."</p>
