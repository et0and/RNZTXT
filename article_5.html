        <h2>Government asks Sport NZ to update trans inclusive community sport guidelines</h2>
        <p>
"Sport at a community level should not just be focused on diversity, inclusion and equity - but also prioritise fairness and safety," Chris Bishop says.

            <p>The government has asked Sport New Zealand to review and update its guidelines for the inclusion of transgender people in community sport.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after more than 50 local Olympians and sports representatives signed an open letter, saying the current advice disrespected the principles of fairness and safety.</p>
        
            <p>Gender Minorities Aotearoa believed the current guidelines for community sports did not need a review, and said Save Women's Sport Australasia was an anti-trans group.</p>
        
            <p>Sports Minister Chris Bishop on Thursday said he's met with a range of individuals and groups, and sought advice from Sport New Zealand, over the course of this year.</p>
        
            <p>He has now told the sporting body to review and update its Guiding Principles for the Inclusion of Transgender People in Community Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"I have come to the view that the Guiding Principles do not reflect legitimate community expectations that sport at a community level should not just be focused on diversity, inclusion and equity - but also prioritise fairness and safety."</p>
        
            <p>National promised to "ensure publicly funded sporting bodies support fair competition that is not compromised by rules relating to gender" in its coalition agreement with New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the guiding principles, published in 2022, were a helpful guide for sporting bodies grappling with "a tricky issue" and were intended to be voluntary, not mandatory.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that transgender people feel able to participate in community sport - but there are obviously difficult issues for sporting bodies to grapple with around fairness and safety as a result of that participation.</p>
        
            <p>The minister has now written to Sport New Zealand's chief executive Raelene Castle to ask her to review and update the guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>He expects to receive an update on progress in the coming months.</p>
