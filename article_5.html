            <p>The government says it will rewrite the relationships and sexuality education curriculum for the first time in nearly 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>A critical Education Review Office report published on Tuesday says there is too much inconsistency in what schools teach.</p>
        
            <p>It also warned that requiring schools to consult on the content of the lessons exposed schools to misinformation, bigotry and threats.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford said it was clear the status quo was not working.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to give teachers certainty in what they're teaching in the classroom and parents clarity on what their child is learning so they can make informed decisions about their education.</p>
        
            <p>"The RSE Curriculum will be refreshed for the first time in nearly 20 years, in that time society has shifted significantly. The Ministry of Education will convene a group of curriculum writers with expertise in RSE to develop a new curriculum which explicitly lays out what gets taught and when," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"A draft of the topic areas to be taught will be available from Term 1 with consultation open later in 2025. This will coincide with the current gender, sexuality and relationship-based education guidelines being removed by the end of the first term. This will meet a coalition commitment between National and New Zealand First."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said relationships and sexuality education had an important part to play in ensuring young people were equipped with the knowledge and skills they needed to thrive and interact positively and respectfully with others.</p>
        
            <p>The Post Primary Teachers Association supported the call for a more structured approach to teaching the subject.</p>
        
            <p>"RSE is too important to be left to chance, and often much of the material is outside of the lived experience of those delivering the curriculum. A structured approach ensures age-appropriate, identity-affirming information is delivered across the board," union president Chris Abercrombie said.</p>
        
            <p>Abercrombie said the union also supported ERO's recommendation that schools no longer be required to consult on relationships and sexuality education (RSE) every two years because it could be difficult and divisive.</p>
        
            <p>He said ensuring parents knew what was being taught would allow them to decide whether to allow their students to attend the lessons.</p>
        
            <p>"For the minority that want less RSE, they would be better able to identity the lessons they wish to withdraw from, and the same would be true for those who wish to know more. With a clear understanding of what is not being taught, they can supplement the learning in their own homes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that often there is a narrow view of what RSE is. In most cases it is about helping young people understand how to navigate friendships and thinking about others in an inclusive way. These are key skills for being an active member of your community and wider society."</p>
