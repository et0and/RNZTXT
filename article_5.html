            <p>Whangārei District councillors have voted down a motion to abolish their Māori ward in a two-hour, often emotional debate marked by waiata and a celebratory haka from supporters gathered outside.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, Whangārei District Council became the third of Northland's four local authorities to vote on the future of its Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>A new law that came into effect last month required councils to choose, by 6 September, between abolishing their Māori wards or holding a binding poll alongside next year's local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 200 people, including many Pākehā, gathered outside the council offices on Rust Avenue to show their support for the district's two Māori ward councillors. Only about half could fit inside the chamber, with the rest forced to follow the meeting on screens in the foyer.</p>
        
            <p>Another group remained outside waving flags outside the chamber windows.</p>

            <p>The initial motion, proposed by councillor Paul Yovich and seconded by Marie Olsen, was to disestablish the Whangārei District Māori Ward and revert to the electoral system used in the 2019 election, before the ward was introduced.</p>
        
            <p>That option would have avoided the requirement for a poll or a fresh representation review to adjust ward boundaries or councillor numbers.</p>
        
            <p>It was eventually defeated four votes to nine, sparking cheers inside the chamber and a rousing haka outside.</p>
        
            <p>A follow-up motion, put by councillor Nicholas Connop, called on the council to retain its Māori ward at the 2025 election and hold a referendum to decide the ward's future in the 2028 and 2031 elections. That was carried by 12 votes to one.</p>
        
            <p>At times mayor Vince Cocurullo seemed close to losing his patience with councillors who addressed the public instead of their fellow councillors, and interjections from the public gallery.</p>

            <p>Despite the charged topic - at least two councillors appeared to fight back tears - it remained a respectful meeting in which every speaker was given a fair hearing.</p>

            <p>Yovich said the council had a chance to listen to the community when Māori wards were last debated, but chose not to have a poll at that time.</p>
        
            <p>He also spoke of his Dalmatian ancestors who were discriminated against when they arrived in New Zealand but had worked hard and gained respect.</p>
        
            <p>"We know what it's like to be despised, and no way do we want to see our community ripped apart … Let's build a country together because we want to, not because we must."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Marie Olsen supported the motion to abolish the ward because she had been elected on a platform of no co-governance, no Three Waters, and no Māori seats, and her stance had not changed.</p>
        
            <p>She believed, however, the motion would be defeated: "Let it go to a referendum, let the public speak, and let's put this to rest once and for all."</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix Ruka said his opposition to scrapping the ward was not about protecting his job, or that of fellow Māori ward councillor Deb Harding.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a generational decision, it's not about me and Deb. It's for our mokopuna."</p>
        
            <p>He also hit back at speakers who talked about wanting New Zealanders to be one people.</p>

            <p>"If you really want us to be one, you would take time to learn our reo, as we have learnt yours."</p>
        
            <p>Connop spoke of the deluge of emails, 340 at last count, he had received urging him to vote one way or the other.</p>
        
            <p>"As Pākehā, I know what's good for Māori is good for all of us. Let's not get led up the garden path by fearmongering and lies."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Patrick Holmes said having a Māori ward had enriched the council, and it would be a "great shame" if the council were to go backwards now - a theme repeated by councillor Scott McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>"[Local Government Minister] Simeon Brown was on the TV at the weekend and he said, 'All we're doing is going back to how it was in Helen Clark's time'. Well, we don't want to go back 20 years. We want to create a better and fairer democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Ken Couper, meanwhile, described Thursday's debate as "momentous" and "wonderful".</p>
        
            <p>"The drama, the passion … it happens sometimes in this chamber, but not often to the extent we've seen today."</p>

            <p>The meeting started with Ngā Hāpū o Whangārei representative Delaraine Armstrong and Tim Howard calling on the council to retain the Māori ward - and even follow the Northland Regional council's lead by pushing back against the government's directive to hold a binding poll - while Democracy Northlander founder John Bain and Frank Newman argued the Māori ward was not needed and based on the "lie" that Māori were under-represented in local government.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Northland Regional Council went a step further, with councillors voting 8-1 to retain their two-seat Te Raki Māori ward, and 6-3 to seek advice on the consequences of not holding a poll at the 2025 elections.</p>
        
            <p>During a fiery meeting earlier this month, the Kaipara District Council leapt in the opposite direction, voting 6-3 to disestablish its Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first council in the country to use the new law to abolish a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara's decision was however being challenged by Ngāti Whatua, which has requested a judicial review.</p>
        
            <p>Far North District councillors have already indicated they intend to retain the four-seat Ngā Tai o Tokerau Māori Ward. They are due to hold a formal vote on 5 September.</p>
