            <p>The government does not plan to launch sanctions against China after confirming a cyberattack targeted two Parliamentary agencies in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Counsel Office were targeted in a China-linked 2021 cyberattack, the spy agencies' minister Judith Collins says.</p>
        
            <p>Judith Collins - the Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS - revealed in a statement on Tuesday morning, New Zealand's Parliamentary Service and Parliamentary Counsel Office were targeted in a China-linked 2021 cyberattack.</p>
        
            <p>Her office clarified the malicious activity was contained and the actor behind it was removed shortly after accessing the networks.</p>
        
            <p>They also confirmed the hack was different from the one revealed by then-Minister Andrew Little.</p>
        
            <p>Then-Minister Andrew Little had that year linked a separate attack to China-sponsored hacker group Advanced Persistent Threat 40 (APT40), saying they had exploited Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.</p>
        
            <p>The news follows the UK and US announcing sanctions against China over its alleged cyber activity.</p>
        
            <p>They claimed a sweeping cyberespionage campaign targeting millions of people - including White House staffers, US Senators, British parliamentarians, government officials across the world and lawmakers, academics, journalists.</p>
        
            <p>The US and UK said the attack was led by the APT31 hacker group, which they said was an arm of China's Ministry of State of Security.</p>
        
            <p>In her statement, Collins said New Zealand stood with the UK, and the "use of cyberespionage operations to interfere with democratic institutions and processes anywhere is unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>"The GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) completed a robust technical assessment following a compromise of the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Parliamentary Service in 2021, and has attributed this activity to a PRC state-sponsored group known as APT40," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately, in this instance, the NCSC worked with the impacted organisations to contain the activity and remove the actor shortly after they were able to access the network."</p>
        
            <p>She told reporters at Parliament New Zealand's democratic institutions were "sacrosanct" and said New Zealand was working alongside partners and supporting the UK.</p>
        
            <p>She said this was the first attack on New Zealand's democratic institutions she was aware of.</p>
        
            <p>Asked why New Zealand had not announced sanctions, she said it was not part of the government's legislative agenda. Because New Zealand does not have broader law allowing for autonomous sanctions, legislation would be required before sanctions can be laid.</p>
        
            <p>The Parliamentary Service provides administrative and support services to Parliament and its MPs, while the Parliamentary Counsel Office is responsible for drafting and publishing legislation.</p>
