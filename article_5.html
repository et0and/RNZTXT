        <h2>PM a 'drop-nuts' if he doesn't attend Waitangi - Rawiri Waititi</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister not attending Waitangi Day would show he "has no balls and may be a drop-nuts", Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi says.

            <p>The prime minister not attending Waitangi Day would show he "has no balls and may be a drop-nuts", Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi says.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi said Labour's claim it might be unsafe for the government to turn up to the Northland town - and other rhetoric suggesting Māori spaces are not safe - was unhelpful.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon on Monday said he was yet to make a decision about attending, having received invitations from various iwi around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he hoped Luxon would front up, given the government policies affecting Māori including ACT's Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're doing something that's controversial, that's upset a lot of people, it's more important than ever that you show up and talk about it," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Willie Jackson agreed, but said he had also heard "off the grapevine that they're very worried about the safety of some of the MPs".</p>

            <p>"I've picked that up ... I can understand why they would be worried, that's why they're probably taking their time in terms of whether they accept the invitation."</p>
        
            <p>Pressed for details, Jackson said people were "still very very angry at this government. While 95 percent of people will be fine up there, you just never know so I can understand why there'd be some trepidation".</p>
        
            <p>"Māori are angry, Māori are furious, and we saw that with the hīkoi, but at least it was a very peaceful hīkoi but if I was part of the government I'd be worried going up there too."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson refused to say where this information had come from.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi said comments like that were unhelpful.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not helpful and I don't agree," he said. "I haven't heard anything like that."</p>
        
            <p>"Here is the problem is that you've got people who continue to push the rhetoric that people are unsafe in Māori spaces. I can tell you what - we're unsafe going to the BP just to go and get a coffee just because we've got a racist Pākehā coming out and accosting us."</p>
        
            <p>That was a reference to a police report the party filed for co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, saying a man at a Whanganui fuel station had yelled abusive slurs at her and saying she "deserves all that's coming to her".</p>
        
            <p>Waititi said the government's policies had emboldened such attacks.</p>

            <p>"Divisive policies that this government has been an even embolden that type of behaviour. And I won't accept that people have a safety issue in Māori spaces any more.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the same with our hīkoi, there was this huge police presence, we had the police minister come out and say people will be arrested for disorderly behaviour - Māori have been marching since 1972 when we brought the reo petition here, 1975 with the land march, even in 2004 with the foreshore and seabed: Māori know how to do a hīkoi."</p>
        
            <p>Waititi said the prime minister not attending Waitangi would show "that he's got no balls and may be a drop-nuts in terms of facing the people. And I don't use those words lightly, I will stand by those. He just needs to front up."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted the Prime Minister's Office for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka committed to going to Waitangi, but said the prime minister would decide his own plans.</p>
        
            <p>"That's up to the prime minister to explain. I know I'll be there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As you know, I'm pretty committed to the kaupapa, the whakapapa, and the kotahitanga that comes with Waitangi."</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said he was certain Waitangi would deliver robust conversation next year, but noted the peaceful nature of the recent hīkoi to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a real sense of pride, whakahīhī you might call it, but also commitment to kaitiakitanga [guardianship] that many of the engagements have had.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really enthused by the level of rangimārie or peacefulness at the hīkoi recently. That was absolutely outstanding and a credit to those people who led that."</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said the party would be attending Waitangi, and the prime minister should stand by his rhetoric.</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister has made quite a lot of noise about the fact that he stands in opposition ot the treaty principles bill and that he wants to uphold Te Tiriti o Waitangi so I think that all politicians who say those things should walk the talk."</p>
