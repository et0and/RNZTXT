        <h2>Nurses tell health minister targets not possible without more funding</h2>
        <p>
In response Shane Reti said they had more funding than ever, and now needed "bold new thinking".

            <p>Nurses have told the health minister they need more staff and more funding if the sector is going to meet the government's targets.</p>
        
            <p>Shane Reti gave a speech at the New Zealand Nurses Organisation's annual conference at TƒÅkina in Wellington on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In her introductory remarks, union president Anne Daniels laid down the gauntlet: "You have said a number of times that you are looking to make a difference."</p>
        
            <p>"All these targets need more nurses and more funding," she said. "And we need pay parity."</p>
        
            <p>She said every day, nurses were being asked to do more with less: "I believe every delegate in this room will be able to tell you a story about what that looks like."</p>
        
            <p>The government's five health targets were first announced six months ago: faster cancer treatment, improved immunisation for kids, shorter stays in emergency departments, as well as shorter wait times for specialist appointments and treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"Targets save lives," Reti told the conference, and nurses were part of the "that very important front line".</p>
        
            <p>The health system had more funding than ever with more than $30 billion a year in Budget 2024 - the largest investment in health, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There were now more nurses employed in hospitals than ever before, he said, with 29,404 full-time equivalent nurses across the country at the end of March - an additional 1198 compared to the previous quarter, and an overall increase of 2900 over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said "bold new thinking" was needed, and he would soon begin a review of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act "to make sure it is fit for purpose".</p>
        
            <p>The minister left straight after his speech and was not available for questions from the media.</p>
