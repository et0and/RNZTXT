            <p>Labour says it does not support the private ownership of core infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and prisons.</p>
        
            <p>At the first day of the Infrastructure Investment Summit on Thursday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government wanted private investment into "anything and everything" and was pushing for bipartisan support.</p>
        
            <p>Representatives of more than 100 companies from 15 countries have gathered in Auckland for the summit, between them controlling $6 trillion in assets and funds.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Simeon Brown said in his speech the government was "explicitly" open to public-private partnerships to build health infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Labour MPs were attending the summit. Leader Chris Hipkins was not there, but said his colleagues were making clear what the party's priorities would be when it returned to government.</p>
        
            <p>"A bottom line for us is things like hospitals, schools, prisons for example, the bottom line is we don't support the private sector building and operating those things - those are public institutions."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said Labour did explore public-private partnerships when last in government for Auckland light rail, and public transport was another area they could work in.</p>
        
            <p>He said more transparency was needed from the government on what was up for auction.</p>

            <p>Luxon said New Zealand had some very successful public-private partnerships.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't set a set number [of partnerships], but we're just making sure we're open and up for anything and everything because at the end of the day... we care about infrastructure getting built. Why do we care about that? It's fundamentally so that New Zealanders can actually get more money into their pocket."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the Waikato Expressway, for example, had led to economic and social benefits as it enabled people to work longer and get home faster.</p>
