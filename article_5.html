            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency is getting rid of its dedicated road safety policy team, replacing it with a safety director but no specialised staff.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, NZTA Waka Kotahi said 84 positions would be disestablished in its system leadership group as part of the government's cost-cutting drive.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty of those roles, six of which were vacancies, were in the dedicated road safety policy team.</p>
        
            <p>Total job losses from the agency's cost-cutting drive tally 183.</p>
        
            <p>The new structure will see the position of a safety director established.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, NZTA said it was confident it would have enough road safety knowledge under the new structure.</p>
        
            <p>"While the team will no longer be organised around the individual outcome area of road safety, new positions in the confirmed structure require a mix of subject matter and generalist expertise, meaning an appropriate level of road safety knowledge will be retained to support NZTA and road safety outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>The new structure would also replace the solely focused environment team, shifting to work that achieved "multiple outcomes", the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>It could not confirm how many people from the original road safety policy team would remain.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the structure of NZTA was ultimately a matter for the board, but he was confident that road safety expertise would remain.</p>
        
            <p>"They've still got a number of people working in road safety, it's one of the four key priorities within the government policy statement on transport," he said.</p>
