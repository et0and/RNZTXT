            <p>Porirua's mayor hopes the Wellington region will be the next part of the country to secure a water deal with the government.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Local Government Simeon Brown announced on Sunday that a deal had been inked with Auckland Council that would allow the city's water provider, Watercare, to borrow money for infrastructure separately from council.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government claimed it meant council rates would only increase by 7.2 percent instead of a previously projected 25.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It came as councils from Horowhenua, Kāpiti, Wairarapa, the Hutt Valley, Porirua and Wellington City prepare to meet this Friday to work together on a plan for a Greater Wellington region water deal.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting of council representatives will be chaired by former Wellington Mayor Dame Kerry Prendergast.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua Mayor Anita Baker told RNZ the Auckland deal was awesome and reflected her calls for budget sheet separation between councils and water providers.</p>
        
            <p>"It shows the government's serious obviously, and can pass legislation to get that financial independence, so for Wellington I think it's really exciting."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said she wanted their region to get its act together and be the next to get a deal.</p>
        
            <p>She said it would help councils in the Wellington region facing high rates.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau told RNZ while the details around the Auckland deal were not clear, it sounded positive.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with other regional councils towards a new model for Wellington that we hope can achieve a similar outcome for our residents."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said she had made it clear to the local government minister what legislation was required for them to achieve balance sheet separation like Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>A bill to introduce the necessary changes in legislation to allow the Auckland water deal to go ahead will be introduced later this month.</p>
