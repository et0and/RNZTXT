            <p>John Richard Allen is likely to take over the role of chief ombudsman from Peter Boshier, who still has the job despite a law requiring his resignation at age 72.</p>
        
            <p>Boshier resigned after his 72nd birthday on 16 March last year, but was asked to stay on while a replacement was found.</p>
        
            <p>The Officers of Parliament Committee had recommended Allen as a replacement in the role, which was an independent position tasked with investigating complaints about administrative actions at all levels of government and ensuring proper public access to official information.</p>
        
            <p>The committee is made up of MPs from all parties in Parliament, and Allen's appointment had unanimous support.</p>
        
            <p>He is Victoria University of Wellington's chancellor, and was previously chief executive at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Post, WellingtonNZ, and the New Zealand Racing Board.</p>
        
            <p>The members thanked Boshier for his many years of public service and wished him all the best for his retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Boshier told RNZ last year he was loving the job and did not feel his age was a factor.</p>
        
            <p>Partners in Change consultancy's managing director Geoff Pearman had earlier said the age limit in the law appeared discriminatory.</p>
        
            <p>The governor-general formally appoints the chief ombudsman, on the recommendation of Parliament.</p>
