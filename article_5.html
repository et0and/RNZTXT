        <h2>'It's a wake-up call': Defence Minister on Chinese naval ships in Tasman</h2>
        <p>
The vessels could sail near Auckland or Wellington in the next few days and would be entitled under UN law to do so, Judith Collins says. Audio

            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins says the presence of three Chinese naval ships off Australia is a wake-up call for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>She says people can no longer rely on feeling safe because this country is geographically isolated from the rest of the world.</p>
        
            <p>She was commenting after revealing earlier that New Zealand received no notice from China that it would be sending three naval ships to the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>Defence forces in New Zealand and Australia are scrutinising the movements of the ships that have arrived unannounced in the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>Collins told Morning Report on Friday the ships were about 130km to 150m off the coast of Sydney and were complying with international law.</p>
        
            <p>"They are the most significant and sophisticated [vessels] that we have seen this far south."</p>
        
            <p>She believed it was China's government sending a message to both the New Zealand and Australian governments that they could maintain a presence in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an unusual move."</p>
        
            <p>However, when pressed she refused to call it a show of force by China.</p>

            <p>New Zealand and Australian vessels operated in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and China was showing it could do the same.</p>
        
            <p>The government had been aware "for a few days" of the presence of the ships in the area, Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>She was unaware of any high-level contact between the government and China over the situation.</p>
        
            <p>As far as monitoring went, New Zealand had HSS Te Kaha and a P-8 Poseidon aircraft involved plus the government was liaising with Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a wake-up call isn't it. New Zealanders have been told for years by the political classes that they can rest easy, do nothing on defence and expect that our distance from much of the world will protect us."</p>
        
            <p>The presence of the ships as well as the firing of an intercontinental ballistic weapon last October were clear signs this was no longer the case.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very important to understand that our distance means little to nothing and people need to realise we cannot do anything just by ourselves.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be working always with the Australians and like-minded friends. We cannot do it by ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if it was possible the ships could sail close to Auckland or Wellington in the next few days, she said it was always "possible" and under UN law "would be legal".</p>
        
            <p>On Ukraine and the dispute that has erupted between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, Collins said she did not agree with Trump's claim that Zelensky was "a dictator".</p>
        
            <p>Russia had invaded Ukraine three years ago and no country interrupted a war to hold an election, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't agree with him [Trump], let's put it that way."</p>
