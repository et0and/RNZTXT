            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) spent nearly half a million dollars on an operation to kill one stoat.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2022 a male stoat was identified on Chalky Island/Te Kākahu-O-Tamatea, in Fiordland which has been predator-free since 1999.</p>
        
            <p>Select committee documents show from the time the animal was detected to its capture eight months later DOC spent $483,260.</p>
        
            <p>These include costs such as incident management team costs, staff time, conservation dog handlers, helicopter and boat expenses.</p>
        
            <p>The Government agency spent just over another $210,000 on ensuring the island was pest free by installing surveillance systems and doing biosecurity planning.</p>
        
            <p>In the documents DOC explained that had the stoat not been caught it could have killed Kākāpō chicks, nationally endangered Ted Te Kākahu skinks and Little Spotted Kiwi chicks.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland University Professor of Conservation Biology, James Russell told RNZ the fact Kākāpō have been reintroduced to the island makes it a "precious place."</p>
        
            <p>"That isolation that has protected the birds is also what makes some of these operations so expensive such as doing a predator incursion response."</p>
        
            <p>Russell said he supported DOC's decision to spend the money on the stoat eradication.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to decide, do we want to keep investing in this and push through these reinvasions and hopefully work towards a predator free New Zealand or will we just kind of draw the line and say we're not willing to spend any more money on these predator incursion responses."</p>
        
            <p>He said islands around the country have seen similar stoat incursions.</p>
        
            <p>"On Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands in the Hauraki Gulf they had no less than four stoat incursions over a year in 2021."</p>
        
            <p>Russell said the animal can swim or hitchhike on peoples' boats.</p>
        
            <p>He said half a million dollars does sound like a lot of money but people should remember that DOC manages 33 percent of the country on half a percent of the government's budget.</p>
        
            <p>"When we are looking at some of the challenges and the responsibilities we have to our native birds and reptiles of New Zealand I think we really should feel that DOC's pretty hard done by."</p>
        
            <p>Russell told RNZ with government departments facing restructures they should be trying to help DOC as much as possible.</p>
        
            <p>The Conservation Minister has been approached for comment.</p>
