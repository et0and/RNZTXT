            <p>The Kiribati government, has for the first time, commented on its diplomatic rift with Aotearoa, stating that the "New Zealand government cancelled its own proposed visit".</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced he was reviewing development aid to the Kiribati in light of the lack of high-level political engagement.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement published on Monday, the Kiribati President's Office said the Micronesian island nation "recognises the long-cordial relationship with New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>However, it "was surprised to learn" media reports about Peters' visit to the island "which was still under active negotiations based on the understanding that alternative dates were to be explored".</p>
        
            <p>"In the diplomatic world, grievances are handled with the exchange of letters and most likely the two parties involved will resolve the matter amicably. However, this was not the case and is very unfortunate," the statement said.</p>

            <p>It said Peters' proposed visit to the country was raised with the Kiribati government in 2024, but it was not possible because its Cabinet had gone into caretaker mode after parliament dissolved in May 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"...then general elections and presidential elections for the rest of the year including the parliament session in December where the new government will submit its budget for its first financial year of the new term.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said, like New Zealand, other diplomatic partners were also waiting to come to Kiribati for high-level engagements.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiribati sincerely acknowledges their understanding and patience. It would be highly beneficial if high-level dignitaries have dialogues with the new government rather than the caretaker government.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiribati government has decided to have these high-level visits starting from January 2025 which was demonstrated by the successful visit of the Australian Deputy Prime Minister, it statement added.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kiribati Government was advised by New Zealand High Commission in Kiribati on the proposed dates 21-22 January and the response was positive.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand was advised that the President [Taneti Maamau] was still on the outer islands in the southern part of the Gilbert group attending a national commitment and will not be in Tarawa on the proposed dates.</p>
        
            <p>"Tentative preparations started right away with excitement to receive New Zealand's DPM, just three days after the Australian DPM successful visit to Kiribati to commission Kiribati's second patrol boat provided through Australia's aid grant to Kiribati.</p>
        
            <p>"A day later, the New Zealand government cancelled its own proposed visit stating that alternative dates were to be explored."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiribati government said that news of Peters' disappointment came at the start of Maamau's state visit to Fiji, enroute to attend Nauru's 57th Independence Day.</p>
        
            <p>"The Government of Kiribati remains convinced that, despite this media issue, the strong bonds between Kiribati and New Zealand will enable a resolution to this unfortunate standoff for the benefit of both countries and their peoples.</p>
