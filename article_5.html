            <p>A unanimous vote has locked in South Wairarapa's Māori ward for the 2025 triennium.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors heard from those for and against the ward at Wednesday's Strategy Working Committee, and were unwavering on their decision last year to establish one.</p>
        
            <p>Under direction from the government, the council must now also run a binding poll to determine the future of the Māori ward for 2028 and 2031.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to take this opportunity to level the harshest possible criticism I can to our central government for putting us in this position," Councillor Rebecca Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Melissa Sadler-Futter said she was disappointed the council had been forced to relitigate decisions it made last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Regardless of which side of the debate you sit on, if you feel disappointed or angry, I suggest you should be disappointed and angry with our central government, not this committee table."</p>
        
            <p>She said if people were cross at the $20,000 cost to run a binding poll, "be cross at the right people, and be cross at the central government".</p>
        
            <p>Herewini Ammunson, of Papawai Marae and Ngāti Moe, told elected members that establishing a Māori ward was a step towards the fulfilment of Māori rights under Te Tiriti o Waitangi, "specifically partnership, embodied in a seat at the governance table".</p>
        
            <p>Andrea Rutene of the council's Māori Standing Committee implored elected members to "uphold the mana" of the decision they made last year to establish a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel we have a right to have a voice of significance that can contribute in a way that is meaningful," she said. "We want you to vote on the right side of history."</p>
        
            <p>On the other side of the issue, resident John Errington urged council to rescind their decision and said there was nothing to suggest the district as a whole had been disadvantaged by not having a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>He said councillors must be "individually very sure" that a binding poll would be in favour of a Māori ward, "otherwise they are just wasting our money".</p>
        
            <p>He said historically binding polls to establish a Māori ward had not been successful for other councils.</p>

            <p>'Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi' ('Stand Together People') was sung at the end of public participation, bringing some to tears.</p>
        
            <p>The unanimous decision to retain the Māori ward for the 2025 election was ratified at a full extraordinary council meeting in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Martin Connelly said it was unfortunate that the decision would come at a cost to ratepayers due to the poll "but be very aware of who has imposed that cost - the coalition Government".</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Aaron Woodcock and Alistair Plimmer were not in attendance.</p>
