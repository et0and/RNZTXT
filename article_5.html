            <p>Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok could all be restricted for young Australians if the government has its way.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he was open to looking at a similar approach in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is proposing a minimum age to use social media platforms, though the exact age is still up for debate with the government consulting on between 14 and 16-years-old.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins told Morning Report he was interested to see what happened in Australia and open to adopting something similar in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>That's provided there was evidence it would make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"I can tell you as a parent I use the tools that are available to restrict my young children's access to content online but they're not foolproof, there are ways around them."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said it was important to educate young people about how to keep themselves safe online.</p>
        
            <p>"The online environment can be very harmful to kids.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really interested in seeing what the Aussies are doing, I'm open to backing that, I want to see evidence first."</p>
        
            <p>Keeping children safe online was likely to become an increasing problem, he said.</p>
