            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his travelling delegation has touched down in New Delhi, greeted by the heat and a colourful cultural display.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was first off the Defence Force 757 and met by the High Commissioner and one of the Indian government's junior ministers.</p>
        
            <p>Together they watched a group of traditional folk dancers as blaring music competed with plane noise.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon - and the rest of the delegation - then departed for their accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister is in India for a four-day charm offensive to sweeten relations with the eventual hope of securing a free trade deal.</p>
