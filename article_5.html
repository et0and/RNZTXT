            <p>New Police Commissioner Richard Chambers and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon have announced a new 24/7 police station for central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police already use two storeys at the 210 Federal Street building, but have signed a lease to gradually take over the other two floors in stages starting in January.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Richard Chambers said it would make responding to crime in the CBD faster and more effective.</p>
        
            <p>"A 24/7 police base in the central business district will go a long way to address crime in central Auckland," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently, the 24/7 public counter for the Auckland City District is located at College Hill, approximately two kilometres away from the city centre. Relocating the 24/7 public counter will also provide a better service to the community."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said police were aiming to have the station open to public 24/7 by mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>He said they would be adding 21 new staff, along with 30 being brought into the station from elsewhere. Eight were yet to be recruited.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of the move was still secret as it was subject to commercial negotiation, but the old Vincent Street station was still up for sale "so, taking bids," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no doubt that we willl see an improvement in trust and confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a fantastic location for us to be, we are very central right here, we are very proximate to the transport network, to K Road, Aotea Square ... it's at the centre of all the activity that we should be focused on as well.</p>
        
            <p>The previous Fort Street police station closed under the last National government in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about what's changed to allow the police station, RC says they "have a very supportive government here that is very keen to support our build-out presence in cities across the country".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the new station was "really necessary".</p>
        
            <p>"It's exactly what we want to see: police being highly visible and surprise surprise the relationships get deeper and the crime comes down. That's what we've got to see a lot more of."</p>

            <p>Mitchell said it would mean more visibility of police officers in the city - paired with the city's beat team - to ensure the public feels safer.</p>
        
            <p>"Public safety is at the heart of this government's law-and-order programme, and increasing police visibility across our main CBDs is a key part of that," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will enable police to respond more quickly to crime and ensure the public feel safer when going about their daily business."</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief exectutive Viv Beck has also welcomed having a permanent police station in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>"With overall crime trending down over the last year, this is a key piece of the safety solution we have been seeking," she said. "It will enable a faster and more effective response to crime in the city centre, act as a deterrent and provide a place people can go to report crime in person.</p>
        
            <p>"With pedestrian counts of around a million here each week and growth forecast ahead, it's important to keep a strong focus on safety improvements as we strive to be a vibrant, safe 24/7 international city. And with the City Rail Link due to open in 2026, with its own specialised safety needs underground, this central location will be well placed to service the city centre and meet these changing needs."</p>
        
            <p>Beck added that "It's very heartening to hear from the new police commissioner indicating that this move will continue to build greater police presence and increase the provision of services for our city centre community."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said he had set his priorities for police when he became minister: gangs and organised crime, tackling youth crime, stronger policing in communities, and backing the front line.</p>
        
            <p>"Gangs no longer take over towns during tangi. Police have been proactive in managing these events, and I am confident the public feel safer because of it," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was pleased with progress on all four priorities, highlighting public feedback from the gang patch ban coming into effect, the work of the gang units, the creation of military-style academies or 'boot camps', the Beat Teams, and the funding provided to recruit an additional 500 officers.</p>
        
            <p>However, recruitment numbers are still well short of where they need to be to meet the target, and the boot camps recorded their first recidivist offence last week.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, police announced they had arrested three more people as part of a crackdown on the display of gang insignia.</p>
        
            <p>This followed the seizure of a gang chapter president's patch in the first 24 hours of the ban.</p>
        
            <p>The Gangs Act - which came into force last week - bans the display of gang patches in public places.</p>
