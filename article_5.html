            <p>Christopher Luxon says he simply does not know how many more public sector job cuts are coming.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ's Morning Report, the prime minister said it was tough that people were facing losing their jobs, but Kiwis across the country had been "tightening their belts" and it was only fair the government did the same thing.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent advice now shows around 4000 jobs are set to go - and the number of jobs created is still changing. RNZ's tracking of announcements by ministries puts it at about 5000 so far.</p>
