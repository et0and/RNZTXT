            <p>Prime Minister Mark Brown has survived a motion in parliament aimed at ousting his government, the second Pacific Island leader to face a no-confidence vote this week.</p>
        
            <p>In a vote on Wednesday afternoon (Tuesday, Cook Islands time), the man who has been at the centre to controversy in the past few weeks, deated the motion by 13 votes to 9. Two government ministers were absent for the vote.</p>
        
            <p>The motion was put forward by the opposition MP Teariki Heather, the leader of the Cook Islands United Party.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the vote, Heather acknowledged that Brown had majority support in parliament.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said he was moving the motion on principle after recent decisions by Brown, including a proposal to create a Cook Islands passport and shunning New Zealand from deals it made with China, which has divided Cook Islanders.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the merits that I am presenting before this House. We have the support of our people and those living outside the country, and so it is my challenge. Where do you stand in this House?" Heather said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said his country has been so successful in its development in recent years that it graduated to first world status in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to stand on our own two feet, and we need to engage with our partners on an equal footing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Economic and financial independence must come first before political independence, and that was what I discussed and made clear when I met with the New Zealand prime minister and deputy prime minister in Wellington in November."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the issues Cook Islanders faced today were not just about passports and agreements but about Cook Islands expressing its self-determination.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not about consultation. This is about control"</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot compete with New Zealand. When their one-sided messaging is so compelling that even our opposition members will be swayed.</p>
        
            <p>"We never once talked to the New Zealand government about cutting our ties with New Zealand but the message our people received was that we were cutting our ties with New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been discussing the comprehensive partnership with New Zealand for months. But the messaging that got out is that we have not consulted.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a partner in the relationship with New Zealand. We are not a child."</p>
        
            <p>He said the motion of no confidence had been built on misinformation to the extent that the mover of the motion has stated publicly that he is moving this motion is support of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The influence of New Zealand in this motion of no confidence should be of concern to all Cook Islands who value....who value our country.</p>
        
            <p>"My job is not to fly the New Zealand flag. My job is to fly my own countries flag."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, hundreds of Cook Islanders opposing Brown's political decisions rallied in Avarua, demanding that he step down for damaging the relationship between Aotearoa and Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand. It part of the Realm of New Zealand, sharing the same Head of State.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the island marks its 60th year of self-governance.</p>
        
            <p>According to Cook Islands 2021 Census, its population is less than 15,000.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand remains the largest home to the Cook Islands community, with over 80,000 Cook Islands MƒÅori, while about 28,000 living in Australia.</p>
