            <p>Wayne Brown is set to announce he is standing for re-election as mayor of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Brown, 78, is due to make the announcement at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron on Auckland's waterfront on Wednesday afternoon, his campaign manager confirmed to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor was elected as leader of the super city in October 2022 after beating Labour- and Green-endorsed candidate, the Faʻanānā Efeso Collins, by roughly 57,000 votes.</p>
        
            <p>Kerrin Leoni was the only Auckland councillor to put her name forward for the city's top job so far, and would run as an independent candidate.</p>
        
            <p>It has been speculated Brown's own deputy, Desley Simpson, could challenge him for the job after the domain name "DesleyforMayor.co.nz'' was registered by Simpson's son in December.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ last month she had "not yet made a decision about what I intend to to this year".</p>
