        <h2>From Manchester to Glasgow - here is how 'regional deals' work</h2>
        <p>
The new regional deals announced by the government have some major differences from some of the overseas cities they're modelled on.

            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown on Thursday unveiled a framework for regional deals that would see high-growth investment plans developed for five regions.</p>
        
            <p>They're based on a successful overseas model, but what's proposed is a little different.</p>
        
            <p>The deals would aim to power up core infrastructure: roads, public transport, housing and economic growth - through long-term agreements between central and local government.</p>
        
            <p>The government's high-level framework set out strategic objectives, an oversight bodies, and a ministerial group, with further oversight provided by the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
        
            <p>The deals are modelled on a similar approach seen overseas in the UK and Australia, each one unique.</p>
        
            <p>Much has been made of the success of Manchester's deal from 2011 - a community-led banding together of 10 councils that has led to improved health and social care, active travel and municipal regional bus management.</p>
        
            <p>It's funded through the collection of 100 percent of local business rates tax revenue.</p>
        
            <p>In Glasgow, eight regional authorities signed a deal in 2014 aimed at boosting infrastructure, research, business innovation and employment.</p>
        
            <p>Sally Loudon spoke at yesterday's conference as the former chief executive of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities - a representative group like Local Government New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Glasgow deal had been a success, but could be very different to those proposed in New Zealand, with the UK and Scottish governments each investing £500 million, and the councils themselves putting forward £130m.</p>
        
            <p>That money is spent on things like harbour, bridge and road improvements to connect people to jobs and bring more people and investment in.</p>
        
            <p>A little different, then, to the prime minister's approach - who yesterday said there would be no "magic money tree" in Wellington for councils.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, private businesses and iwi would be welcomed to invest, and other funding could come from new targeted rates or user charges.</p>
        
            <p>It's also being led by the government, rather than the councils themselves: invitations will be sent to five hand-picked regions - focusing on high-growth zones that are ready to deliver - with the paperwork eventually going to Cabinet for final signoff.</p>
