        <h2>Law change makes those running outdoor activities responsible for injuries</h2>
        <p>
The change to the Health and Safety at Work Act would mean the land owner would still be responsible for risks where their work is in the immediate vicinity, but not from the activity itself.

Workplace Safety Minister Brooke van Velden said the change would get rid of "overcompliance".

            <p>A law change will mean those running outdoor activities - not the land owners - will be held responsible for injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Workplace Safety Minister Brooke van Velden said it was not reasonable for councils, farmers and landowners who allowed access to their land for hunting, fishing, mountain biking and horse trekking to be held responsible if someone was injured.</p>
        
            <p>The change to the Health and Safety at Work Act would mean the land owner would still be responsible for risks where their work was in the immediate vicinity, but not from the activity itself.</p>
        
            <p>"We all know that recreational activities aren't without some risk, and sometimes it's the risk that makes it fun. I want Kiwis to be able to hunt, fish, hike, climb, mountain bike, kayak and so much more without being caught up in health and safety red tape," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, New Zealand's work health and safety settings have reduced the appetite to allow these activities, inadvertently creating a culture of fear amongst landowners who are now worried about their legal liability if someone gets hurt.</p>
        
            <p>"Health and safety responsibilities will lie squarely on the organisation running the activities."</p>
        
            <p>She said the change would get rid of overcompliance and give more clarity on the health and safety responsibilities borne by businesses, employers, and workers.</p>
        
            <p>"We want all New Zealanders to return home safely after every working day."</p>
        
            <p>The change would apply to public and private land including farms, forestry, school grounds, council land, and regional and national parks, and would cover land owners and managers, like the Department of Conservation and councils.</p>
        
            <p>It would still be up to the landowner to grant access to the land if they wished, and the change would not impact private property rights, the minister said..</p>
