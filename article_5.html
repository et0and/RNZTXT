            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown has directed officials to work with the Wellington region's councils on a better funding model for water infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water has recommended the city's council spend $2.5 billion over a decade to fix its leaky water network. It had previously said $10b would be needed, but chief executive Tonia Haskell there were restraints on contractor availability, staff capacity and an acceptable level of disruption in the city.</p>
        
            <p>Brown on Tuesday said the government was "working at pace" on implementing the Local Water Done Well Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Policy work would ensure that councils had more tools around financial sustainability, including some changes to the Council Controlled Organisation (CCO) model, he said.</p>
        
            <p>An example of a CCO includes the current model for Wellington Water - a water provider that manages council water assets in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently working through the policy decisions on that, and we'll have more to announce, I think, in March."</p>
        
            <p>Work was being done by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA). Brown confirmed the government department was working with leaders in Wellington, Hutt Valley and Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>"I have asked officials at DIA to start talking and working with the mayors in Wellington around what the future looks like for water services and delivery of water infrastructure in Wellington water now."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said they need a financially sustainable model including an entity structure that can provide ring fenced revenue and the ability to attract long-term funding and financing.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Brown met with Upper Hutt Mayor Wayne Guppy and Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau on Monday to discuss Wellington, Porirua and the Hutt Valley's water pipe woes.</p>
        
            <p>Guppy described their meeting as "straightforward", involving discussion of the issues facing Wellington and the country, and possible models for change".</p>
        
            <p>The $2.5b figure was how much Wellington Water believed it could deliver in the city over the next 10 years, Haskell said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to build capability ... it does take awhile to do that, as I say we have been doing that steadily for the past few years."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he was focused on ensuring the Wellington and Upper Hutt city councils were taking their responsibilities around water service delivery seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"There is significant leakage from their pipes, and I want to have assurances that everything is being done to avoid a water emergency here in Wellington."</p>
