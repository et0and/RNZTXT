            <p>The Foreign Minister says no one is challenging the right of the Cook Islands people to determine their own destination.</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown is travelling to China soon where he is expected to discuss and potentially sign an agreement on closer cooperation with Beijing.</p>
        
            <p>But Winston Peters said neither New Zealand nor the Cook Island people know what is in that agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we've been not told what the nature of the arrangements that they seek in Beijing might be," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"And instead of the arrangements being organised and in the public before they go, it is being said that he will announce it...when it's completed. Well, there's your answer to your question."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the issue is not with the Cook Islands seeking a new pathway to economic growth, but rather the process for how that is achieved.</p>
        
            <p>Peter said New Zealand have exercised every opportunity to engage with the Cook Islands, and that will be incontestable when the facts are known.</p>
        
            <p>"When things happen that we have no idea about, then our duty is to ensure being accountable to the New Zealand people and New Zealand taxpayer and the New Zealand parliament that we are informed of it and that we, make our people aware of what we're doing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Peter said New Zealand is determined to ensure their relationship with the Cook Islands continues in the same fashion it was first agreed upon.</p>
        
            <p>It also comes after a proposal by the Realm country to create its own separate passport, a move Peters said blindsided "very concerned" Cook Islands citizens.</p>
        
            <p>"To do that, then your relationship with New Zealand has to be changed, and that will require us to consult with all the Cook Island people in the Cook Islands and living abroad as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's our constitutional requirement for that to happen. It's what we would do as a country ourselves on such a major issue.</p>
        
            <p>"And now, of course, it's waved into a new economical, political, or otherwise arrangement that details, shape, and framework we have no idea of with, China. But that wasn't where it started from."</p>
        
            <p>Brown has since confirmed the proposal will not proceed, and rejected suggestions his country's relationship with New Zealand had broken down.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Cook Islands News, he said although they have had disagreements over a couple of issues, the relationship remains "very strong" and is one that the Cook Islands' values.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, Brown said the Cook Islands will now look at an identity card, something that's more acceptable to New Zealand.</p>
