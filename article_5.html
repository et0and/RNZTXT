            <p>Directors and management of businesses are doubling up duties to ensure compliance with unclear health and safety regulations, the Workplace Relations and Safety Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke van Velden said legislation needed to clarify the distinction between the health and safety responsibilities of operational management verses the governance of large and small businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Throughout the public consultation and the roadshow on the health and safety law, I heard from business owners and company directors that they are unclear about their health and safety duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act in both large and small businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Feedback shared by many is that there is overcompliance as many directors think they need to do more than they should, and directors and management are also duplicating work," van Velden said.</p>
        
            <p>She said amended legislation would ensure the "day to day management of health and safety risks" was left up to managers so directors and boards were freed up to focus on the guidance and oversight of their businesses.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement was the third tranch of proposed changes to the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 put forward by van Velden this week.</p>
        
            <p>She said the changes were a part of wider health and safety system reform that would be progressed through changes to legislation later this year.</p>
