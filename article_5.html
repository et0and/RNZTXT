            <p>A bill unwinding changes that made it easier for iwi to be granted customary marine title has passed its first reading in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Amendments to the Marine and Coastal Area Act will now go to the justice select committee for consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Treaty Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith, who is responsible for the bill, said the government intends to pass the legislation before the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>A high test for customary title was set in 2011 by the then-National government.</p>
        
            <p>However, the previous Labour government eased the threshold after a decision by the Court of Appeal last year.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said that decision changed the nature of the test and materially reduced the threshold.</p>
