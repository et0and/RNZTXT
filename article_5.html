            <p>The children's minister says she and colleagues decided against officials' advice about the best way to combat serious youth offending.</p>
        
            <p>Papers show Oranga Tamariki warning that using legislation to set up a new 'Young Serious Offender' category is complicated, inflexible and risks teenagers glorifying the YSO label.</p>
        
            <p>"A legislative YSO category may result in delayed court proceedings; young people glorifying the 'YSO' label (this occurred in Australia); and restricting or delaying the ability of the police and courts to access any strengthened powers to a narrow 'YSO cohort'," warned a single-page advisory from Oranga Tamariki (OT), which has been proactively released.</p>
        
            <p>This would also require "significant and complicated legislative changes", and fixed criteria set in law for declaring a YSO - based on the risk of future reoffending - would likely be "too narrow and miss a high-risk cohort of young people".</p>
        
            <p>Instead, they recommended a non-legislative approach would be more effective and work on more offenders.</p>
        
            <p>But Karen Chhour told RNZ ministers rejected that.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers decided that a non-legislative approach did not provide the level of response necessary to address serious recidivist youth offending," she said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation coming in would let the police apply for a YSO declaration on teens who could then be sentenced to a boot camp.</p>
