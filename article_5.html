            <p>The legislation requiring light electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids to pay road user charges has passed its third reading in Parliament ahead of the scheme starting on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The charges for plug-in hybrids will be cheaper than initially planned after the government decided to accept an amendment proposed by the opposition.</p>
        
            <p>The changes mean EV owners will pay $76 per 1000km driven - the same as diesel vehicles - and plug-in hybrid owners $38 - down from the $42 that had been proposed - on a pre-pay basis.</p>
        
            <p>An admin fee of $13.71 - or $12.44 if bought online - also applies to those buying RUC licences.</p>
        
            <p>Making EV and plug-in hybrid owners contribute to the RUCs - which contribute to the funding of roads through the National Land Transport Fund - is a move multiple governments have committed to, having set the target of EVs accounting for 2 percent of light vehicles on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>They had been exempt from the scheme since 2009. Diesel vehicle owners also pay RUC charges, while petrol vehicle owners pay towards the NLTF through petrol excise taxes.</p>
        
            <p>National's Transport Minister Simeon Brown has spoken before about making all vehicle owners pay road user charges instead of petrol tax, and such a move was committed to in the National-ACT coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The previous Labour government began consultation on the change in 2022 and supported the move, while warning the change came alongside the removal of incentives for people to buy EVs.</p>
        
            <p>But Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter said the "practical consequence of this bill is more emissions, more pollution contributing to greenhouse gases".</p>
        
            <p>Some submitters to the select committee had been frustrated by the cost of the new charges for EVs, saying it was unfair and a "penalty on a plug".</p>
        
            <p>The difference in tax paid between some similar-model petrol and electric cars was about $500 a year, with EV users paying about four times as much as the carbon price paid by the petrol car's driver, for carbon pollution, they said.</p>
