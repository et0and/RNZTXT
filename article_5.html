        <h2>Watch live: King Charles to deliver speech as CHOGM officially opens</h2>
        <p>
The King is expected to deliver an address to the 56 member nations at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Friday.

            <p>King Charles is expected to deliver an address to the 56 member nations at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting's official opening.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was greeted by High Commissioner Si'alei van Toor and Second Secretary Jonathan Lee after the Defence Force 757 successfully completed its journey from Wellington, just in time for a heavy downpour in Apia.</p>
        
            <p>Immediately afterwards, Luxon was taken to the headquarters of the Operation Resolution team dealing with the sinking of the navy ship Manawanui.</p>
        
            <p>He praised the team's efforts and said it was valuable to be on the ground and speaking to those - including the Samoans providing support - who were pushing ahead with the cleanup and potential salvage of the wreck.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon committed to supporting an oceans declaration from the grouping, but was uncertain whether he would be visiting those suffering the effects of environmental damage caused by the wreck - and would not commit to providing further compensation.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had been getting regular briefings - up to four times a day - on the status of the operation since the ship sank, including images from a drone being used to surveil the site.</p>

            <p>"[It] wasn't a surprise to me, but actually what's been really impressive is to see the way that the Samoan authorities and the New Zealand team are actually working together really constructively. It's also been really encouraging to see even the engagement with villagers on shorelines and just actually that communication and that outreach to them."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon then met with UK counterpart Keir Starmer at the Taumeasina resort in a closed one-on-one meeting. While the details of that meeting are not yet clear, Luxon had earlier highlighted the free trade agreement between the two countries, as well as support for Ukraine and discussion of the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>Friday will be largely ceremonial. Luxon plans to visit the HMNZS Canterbury - a New Zealand Navy ship moored north of the island supporting CHOGM - in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Then, representatives of the 56 Commonwealth nations will gather for the official opening ceremony where King Charles will deliver a speech, and later host a dinner.</p>
        
            <p>The main action is on Saturday, when the heads of state will meet behind closed doors for six hours.</p>
