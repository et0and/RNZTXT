            <p>Some former greyhound racing dogs will be rehomed overseas, Racing Minister Winston Peters says.</p>
        
            <p>The minister announced on Tuesday the government was banning greyhound racing and legislation was passed under urgency to prevent any dogs from being unnecessarily killed as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the industry learnt of the ban at the same time as the public.</p>
        
            <p>Peters told Morning Report it was an "agonising" decision to make, but the right one.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad, it's difficult to make this decision but we have to do what was right and I'm pleased Parliament agreed."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said three reports have showed unacceptable levels of dangerous injuries in racing.</p>
        
            <p>A committee has been set up to help manage a 20-month transition, including rehoming the roughly 2900 racing greyhounds in the country.</p>
        
            <p>The Greyhound Adoption Programme says rehoming the dogs will be a tall order.</p>
        
            <p>General manager Alistair Donald said there were already many more greyhounds than people waiting to adopt them, with people unable to afford the upfront and ongoing costs of dog ownership.</p>
        
            <p>But Peters said the dogs could be rehomed here or overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course I think we can do it and we'll make it a special project."</p>
        
            <p>Donald said there might need to be incentives for greyhound adoptions, while ensuring the dogs go to homes that can properly care for them.</p>
        
            <p>The SPCA said some greyhounds will find homes in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Arnja Dale said she wasn't concerned there will be too many dogs to rehome.</p>
        
            <p>Evidence from other countries that banned racing shows the public is enthusiastic about adopting dogs, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated to take two years to rehome greyhounds in some places but only took six months, she said.</p>

            <p>Greyhound Racing New Zealand chief executive Edward Rennell said the rate of euthanasia on race days was lower than the horse racing industry.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said "they're wrong".</p>
        
            <p>"...I'd say they're different animals and I'd also say that as someone who is interested in the freedom of racing and the fact that dogs do like to run, that we have had enormous patience."</p>
