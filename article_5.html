            <p>The Green Building Council is fielding calls every two weeks about newly consented buildings dramatically overheating.</p>
        
            <p>It said this issue was the perfect thing for the government to consider when it overhauls the building consents process and replaces the more than 60 Building Consent Authorities across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The government is currently investigating three options.</p>
        
            <p>Green Building Council chief executive Andrew Eagles told Midday Report it was positive the government was reviewing the consenting process "because we all want consistent, faster ways to get homes built".</p>
        
            <p>But he also wanted the government to look at better ways of building homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Every two weeks we are getting someone call us, saying their apartment or home is massively overheating, so if we're doing a big review of consenting, let's think about how we can improve that and get consistency for healthier homes in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Eagles also said there were concerns around how flooding was dealt with.</p>
        
            <p>"As we move to a hotter, more climate impacted environment, it's really important that we incentivise and drive forward lower carbon, more resilient homes and buildings as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Through the review, we can factor in how we can drive forward homes that don't overheat, homes that are lower carbon and healthier for New Zealand. The average home we build at the moment is five times our carbon budget. We really need to consider that."</p>
        
            <p>Eagles said New Zealand was lagging internationally when it came to the quality of homes and buildings - and the country had "really important" emissions budgets it needed to hit by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>"Construction and building are 20 percent of our carbon emissions and this provides an opportunity for this government to factor that in.</p>
        
            <p>"When we align consenting with that initiative, we can deliver for New Zealanders homes that cost less to run, homes that are more resilient and quicker consenting process."</p>
