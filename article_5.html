        <h2>Advisory group backs Crown Research Institutes merger, union raises concerns</h2>
        <p>
While the committee is pleased with the changes, a union is calling for a guarantee no science roles will be lost.

            <p>The group advising the government on its overhaul of the science sector is pleased most of its recommendations are being implemented.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon revealed that the country's seven Crown Research Institutes would be merged into three entities.</p>
        
            <p>The changes follow a long-awaited first report by the Science System Advisory Group.</p>
        
            <p>The committee was "delighted" by the government's announcement, chair Sir Peter Gluckman said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a very strong alignment between what we've suggested and ... what Cabinet's approved, so I feel that the effort that the panel has put in and the hundreds of submissions we've read and heard from have been listened to by the government."</p>
        
            <p>Now that Cabinet had decided on the "architecture" of the system, Gluckman said the group would begin to look at the finer details as early as Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason we have not progressed the work in recent months is simply that we needed Cabinet decisions on the overall direction before we could move forward."</p>
        
            <p>The group's second report would be ready by mid-year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>While the sector clearly needed reform, those changes should have come with a guarantee that no jobs would be lost, the Public Service Association said.</p>
        
            <p>Workers at Callaghan Innovation - which is set to be disestablished - were shocked and distressed, acting national secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reforms announced [on Thursday] have been done in a chaotic and uncoordinated way, with many science workers asking whether they will have a job.</p>
        
            <p>"If the government is committed to science, it should have guaranteed all the jobs, and committed to the increased investment that New Zealand needs in our science sector."</p>
        
            <p>Increased funding was needed to attract and retain scientists. Instead the current plan risked losing experts to overseas, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It came on top of the 500 scientist and researcher roles which had already been axed across various agencies last year, she said.</p>
