            <p>The government is considering raising the threshold for a defendant to choose a jury trial, in a bid to speed up the court system.</p>
        
            <p>The number of active jury trials climbed from about 2000 six years ago to about 3400 last year, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said in a statement. The average duration of a case climbed from 349 days to 498 days over the same period.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, defendants can choose to face a jury - rather than a judge alone - when charged with a criminal offence carrying a maximum prison sentence of two years or more.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said he was seeking feedback on a proposal to increase that threshold, saying jury trials were one of the biggest drivers of delays.</p>
        
            <p>"This government is committed to reducing delays in the courts, so people can access timely and fair justice, and move on with their lives."</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said he was also proposing allowing defendants more time to make their decision.</p>
        
            <p>"Some defendants are also electing jury trials by default because it is easier to change their mind later in the process, but may not necessarily be the best option for their case.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to seriously consider these changes as if enacted, all those involved in trials will not have to wait as long for cases to be resolved, allowing them to move on with their lives sooner."</p>
        
            <p>The public could provide feedback at the Justice Ministry's website over the next three weeks.</p>
