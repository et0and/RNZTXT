            <p>Protestors have been chanting "Treaty Principles Bill Nehua" or "bury the bill".</p>
        
            <p>Toitū te Tiriti spokesperson Eru Kapa-Kingi says it's been a beautiful day despite the rainy weather.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're at Day 6 now and it has not let up, the sheer masses of people turning up at every location, but also all of the in-between as well driving from one part of the rohe to the other there's whānau all over the roads on every corner flying their flags, it's unfathomable."</p>

            <p>Hīkoi organisers are encouraging participants to make sure they enrol to vote in the next election.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi said if supporters were not enrolled to vote, nothing would change.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now 20 percent of the population - we are a million people in this country. That should translate into 19 to 20 seats. We should be determining who the government is every election - that's the strategy. Everybody on the Māori roll."</p>

            <p>The lead convoy of about 300 to 400 people moved next to Heretaunga / Hastings, where they spent the night.</p>
