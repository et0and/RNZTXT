        <h2>'Delusional': ED head slams funding for specialist doctors and nurses</h2>
        <p>
Dr Norman Gray said it only added up to $4 per New Zealander. Audio

            <p>Just $4 per Kiwi - that's what one of the country's top health leaders has to say of the government's funding for new senior doctors and nurses.</p>
        
            <p>The government today announced it will be funding 50 new senior doctors, and more nurses, to fix critical shortages in rural, mental health, maternity and critical care specialities.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand estimated the new frontline doctors would cost $20 million, depending on the specialities of the doctors and their experience. Funding of $10m will be made available for new nurses. A separate $12m fund is being set up to pay for minor repairs, replacement appliances, and new books and toys for children undergoing treatment.</p>
        
            <p>But the clinical head of Wairarapa Hospital's Emergency Department told Checkpoint that was not enough.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Norman Gray said it only came to an investment of $4 per New Zealander.</p>
        
            <p>"The amount of money is negligible," he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably need more like $800 million, not $20 million."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Gray added that the announcement was no different to previous ones.</p>
        
            <p>"They have the right information, the Minister [Shane Reti] and [Health NZ commissioner] Lester Levy - but their response is almost delusional in response to the reality.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't retain people. We can't recruit people. And the amount of money they're talking about is minimalistic compared to the need that the country has."</p>
