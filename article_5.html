        <p>
The leaders said that new partners could contribute to the so-called AUKUS "Pillar Two", which does not involve nuclear submarines.

            <p>AUKUS partners Australia, Britain and the United States said on Wednesday they are in discussions with Canada, Japan and New Zealand about potential collaboration on defence technology projects.</p>
        
            <p>The AUKUS defence technology partnership will deliver nuclear-powered submarines to Australia next decade, and is collaborating on other advanced weapons development they say will boost deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, amid concern over China's naval build-up.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian, British and US leaders said that new partners could contribute to the so-called AUKUS "Pillar Two", which does not involve nuclear submarines.</p>
        
            <p>"We are consulting with Canada, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea to identify possibilities for collaboration on advanced capabilities under AUKUS Pillar II," the leaders said in a joint statement to mark the third AUKUS anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said this month on a visit to Tokyo that Canada was in talks with AUKUS about joining projects, but did not give details.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the consultation is "a continuation of New Zealand's careful, deliberate exploration under successive governments of what engaging with AUKUS Pillar 2 would mean for us as a country in strategic and economic terms".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has a long history of being nuclear-free.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to have an open and transparent discussion with New Zealanders about the issues at stake," Peters posted on his X account on Wednesday.</p>
