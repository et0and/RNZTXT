        <h2>Protesters block Jones' bus ahead of mining announcement</h2>
        <p>
The government hopes its new mining plan will create 2500 jobs and be worth $3b in exports. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Resources Minister Shane Jones announced the government's final mining strategy half an hour late after protesters blocked the bus he arrived on.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the days of "woke-riddled intimidation" of the mining sector are over - specifically criticising banks that refuse to work with fossil fuel companies.</p>
        
            <p>Jones released the mining strategy, including a list of minerals the government believed were critical to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Gold and metallurgical coal have been added to the Critical Minerals List, which now covers a total of 37 minerals after a consultation period that started in September.</p>
        
            <p>The list, released Friday morning alongside a strategy document, outlines the government's plan to double mineral sector exports to $3 billion by 2035 - up from the previous target of $2 billion, thanks to revised export statistics from Stats NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Jones hoped to boost mining to stimulate economic growth, and was eying up Department of Conservation (DOC) land to do so.</p>
        
            <p>In a speech at OceanaGold's Waihi Operation in Hauraki on Wednesday morning, Jones said further mining projects would be enabled by the Fast-track Approvals Act.</p>
        
            <p>Jones made an impassioned pitch for more mining in Waihi, using his 30 minute speech to acknowledge both the fierce opposition to it and lay out his rationale for why it was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the key areas I see this process improving is concessions for land access. An array of high-value mining and quarrying projects are already approved to travel this consenting pathway," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Officials estimate the number of jobs across the mining projects listed in Schedule 2 of the Fast-track Approvals Act at over 2500 direct full-time jobs at peak production. Many of these roles will be well-paying regional jobs with significant opportunities for training and growing skills."</p>
        
            <p>He said he campaigned on using the country's fossil fuels, pointing out they were already in use, and they were absolutely necessary to keep the lights on.</p>
        
            <p>"We rely upon the gas in Taranaki to keep our lights on. We profit from the sale of coal that makes some of the finest steel in the world," he said.</p>

            <p>"It is a fallacy. It is hypocrisy to say that New Zealand, at our point in the cycle of our modern industrial civilization, do not rely on fossil fuels.</p>
        
            <p>"We have them, we will use them, and there will be appropriate guard rails to ensure that as the transition takes place, we do not bankrupt communities, we do not destroy the employment prospects of the generations coming through."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said he had promised to cut barriers to mining but it was clear not all were imposed by government.</p>
        
            <p>He also argued that if it was good enough for New Zealand to be debating the Treaty of Waitangi right now, it was good enough to have a similar debate about the balance between growing the economy and protecting the environment.</p>
        
            <p>The government's Fast Track Approvals legislation would help the mining sector go about its work more effectively but it would not be a free for all, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't mean that approvals will be signed on the back of a cigarette pack but it means it'll be a lot more efficient and we will focus on the principle of managing risks in a proportionate manner, attaching conditions that are proportionate to the risk that you managing."</p>
        
            <p>Jones ended his speech saying he hoped he didn't "get shot" for promoting mining, arguing it could be the economic lifeline the country needs.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released alongside the updated list, Jones said a lack of long-term strategic direction had hindered New Zealand's ability to reap the economic benefits of its natural resources.</p>
        
            <p>"I am delighted to say that that ends now," he said. "With the increasing demand and volatility in international markets, I want New Zealand to contribute to the growing critical minerals market as a trusted and reliable partner."</p>
        
            <p>Of the 37 minerals on the list, Jones said 21 could be produced in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a prospective destination for sought-after minerals like antimony and we have operators working rare earth, vanadium and titanium projects, which I note are all ways for New Zealand to support a transition to a clean energy future.</p>
        
            <p>"Our minerals sector will increase national and regional prosperity, strengthen critical supply chains, and leverage our relationships and international partnerships to drive economic benefits for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>He said the final plan had addressed feedback received during consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our three key outcomes [have been] refocused around productivity, value, and resilience, guided by overarching principles to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and responsible practices."</p>
        
            <p>Jones' speech was also highly critical of banks that refused to work with fossil fuel companies.</p>
        
            <p>"This malevolence flows from cult like accords fostered within the UN where banks and their sustainability units foolishly believe they can change the weather.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand banks should abandon such agreements as the Net Zero Banking Alliance.</p>
        
            <p>"These instruments are alien and represent a foreign threat to regional development," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones revealed New Zealand First would introduce a bill that would give regulators power to remove a bank's operating license if it refused to do business with mineral firms.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the banks should be made to reappear before the Finance and Expenditure Committee's banking inquiry to explain themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Jones told Morning Report he hoped the announcement would encourage international companies to set up mines in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"If one was to check the share registry on a number of existing entities on the West Coast, you'll see that American capital is already being invested," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the reason they're doing that is because we now have a very rational regime. The gatekeepers hiding behind the Wildlife Act, the people trying to turn DOC into some sort of preservationist state and deny New Zealanders a livelihood... they're going to be marginalised."</p>
        
            <p>The mining industry says government reform of the mining sector will enable the industry to double the value of exports and contribute to economic growth, jobs, and regional development.</p>
        
            <p>Minerals industry organisation Straterra said the strategy recognises mining's growing contribution to the economy with the release of a minerals strategy and critical minerals list.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is listening, so this is a good day - not just for miners, but also all the businesses that make mining possible, including those producing mining equipment, technology, and services," Straterra chief executive Josie Vidal said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is great to see facts, evidence, and science being used in decision making to further develop mining. Let's be clear, that is not at the expense of the environment and there won't be a mine on every corner."</p>
        
            <p>She said the industry was attracting investment but also needed other support, such as regulatory and financial services, such as banking and insurance.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] is disappointing to see debanking of coal mining in New Zealand due to arbitrary moral judgements. If banks start making 'moral' judgements, where does that end? I fail to see how banks can refuse to do business with legal and legitimate business entities," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We must not go backwards now on political whims. The foundations are starting to form to enable the mining sector to double the value of exports and contribute to economic growth, jobs, and regional development and to do what benefits New Zealanders."</p>
