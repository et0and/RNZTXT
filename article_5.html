            <p>The Minister for Oceans and Fisheries has closed the inner Hauraki Gulf to fishing of spiny rock lobster for three years.</p>
        
            <p>Shane Jones says the closure, starting from April 1, is to allow the lobster population to restore itself.</p>
        
            <p>"Locals have raised serious concerns about the decline of spiny rock lobster in the inner Hauraki Gulf, and this has been backed up by fishery-independent research. I share these concerns and to help the lobster population recover I've decided to stop spiny rock lobster fishing in the inner Gulf," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>The closure extends from the Okakari Point Marine Reserve at Cape Rodney, north of Leigh, to Point Jackson Bay on the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>"I have decided not to increase catch limits for the rest of the Hauraki Gulf rock lobster fishery. Under the current settings the stock is expected to increase, and this will further support the recovery of rock lobster throughout the fishery," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have also adjusted catch settings for Otago rock lobster, taking a cautious approach to ensure long-term sustainability of this fishery."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was important to restore the lobster population, as they can help keep kina barrens from forming - an barren area of underfloor sea, with large kina numbers destroying important marine habitat.</p>
        
            <p>Rock lobsters prey on kinas, and keep their populations under control, preventing kina barrens from forming.</p>
        
            <p>The catch limits for Pacific bluefin tuna, which is managed internationally throughout the Pacific Ocean by the Western Central Pacific Commission (WCPFC), were increased earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>"These tuna are doing well throughout the Pacific, and we're seeing more of these fish in our waters. The WCPFC has agreed to increase New Zealand's catch allocation, and I have changed catch settings to reflect this," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have increased the total catch limit by 84 tonnes for the remainder of this fishing year to reflect the health of the stock and address concerns from commercial fishers who have been seeing increasing amounts of bycatch of Pacific bluefin tuna when targeting other fish."</p>
        
            <p>For the fishing year starting on 1 October, the total catch limit will be increased a further 6.5 tonnes.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to acknowledge everyone who provided feedback on the proposals. The many submissions we received from tangata whenua, recreational and commercial fishers, environmental groups, and the public played an important part in the advice I received from officials, and the decisions I made," Jones said.</p>
