            <p>New Zealand's new High Commissioner to India, Patrick Rata, has launched his India stint with a video series titled 'Dil se Dilli' (Delhi from the heart), aimed at exploring opportunities for collaboration between India and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Rata, who began his tenure earlier this year, succeeded David Pine, who served in New Delhi since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Rata has a distinguished diplomatic career, having previously been the acting high commissioner to Sri Lanka, New Zealand's ambassador to the Republic of Korea, and ambassador to Italy.</p>
        
            <p>He also served as New Zealand's permanent representative to several Rome-based UN agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Programme.</p>
        
            <p>The "Dil se Dilli" video series opens with Rata at the iconic India Gate in New Delhi, where he introduces himself to viewers in Hindi.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm finding Delhi to be an exciting place-dynamic, vibrant, full of contrasts, but exciting," Rata says in the first episode.</p>
        
            <p>In the series, Rata highlights India's significance to New Zealand and shares the coalition government's commitment to enhancing the relationship between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>He notes that one of the ways to achieve this is through high-level diplomatic engagement.</p>
        
            <p>Since coming to office, Trade Minister Todd McClay has visited India three times, and has met India's Trade Minister, Piyush Goyal, six times in total.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters also visited India in March, and New Zealand recently hosted Indian President Droupadi Murmu in August.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the East Asia Summit in Laos.</p>
        
            <p>Modi there extended an official invitation to the PM for visiting India.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party had campaigned on securing a free trade agreement (FTA) with India in its first term, though experts have called this pledge "highly ambitious" due to significant differences, particularly over dairy.</p>
        
            <p>However, Luxon told RNZ his commitment to securing an FTA remains unchanged.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, in the video series, Rata also highlighted other areas of potential collaboration, particularly in education and tourism.</p>
        
            <p>He expressed New Zealand's desire to welcome more Indian students to its educational institutions and attract Indian tourists to experience New Zealand's natural beauty.</p>
        
            <p>The High Commissioner's video series also delves into the culinary culture of Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>In one episode, Rata explores the city's vibrant street food scene, trying staples such as chole bhature, Mango lassi, jalebi, and tea.</p>
        
            <p>While discussing trade between the two nations, he mentioned that India imports products like kiwifruit, apples, avocado, and lamb from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that while I'm here and working together with New Zealand's different agencies, we can provide more opportunities for Indians to enjoy New Zealand produce," Rata said.</p>
        
            <p>The series also features India's Unified Payment Interface (UPI), an instant bank payment system that was highlighted during the first round of free-trade negotiations between New Zealand and India in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Rata also took a ride in an electric rickshaw to Lodhi Art District, where he showcased a mural by Kiwi artist Aaron Glasson titled "The Sacrosanct Whole".</p>
        
            <p>Rata emphasised that both countries could achieve significant progress by collaborating on ocean and energy issues, areas where their shared interests can drive innovation and mutual growth.</p>
        
            <p>In the final episode, Rata visits Dilli Haat, an arts and crafts centre in Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>While exploring different stores, he noted similarities between the Māori and Indian cultures, particularly with Māori carvings and walking sticks.</p>
        
            <p>"We call them Tokotoko," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>"There are lots of opportunities for collaboration between New Zealand and India in arts and culture-through exhibitions, collaborative activities between artists and filmmakers, or residencies," Rata said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade described the "Dil se Dilli" series as a digital diplomacy initiative, intended to introduce Rata to India via social media while conveying key messages about New Zealand's value proposition and bilateral relationship with India.</p>
        
            <p>It was also to demonstrate the New Zealand diplomat's interest in India and integration into the Indian culture, according to the spokesperson.</p>
