            <p>The government is committing $90 million to redevelop specialist facilities and increase satellite classrooms for students with high needs, Education Erica Stanford has announced.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to parents and teachers at Sommerville School in Auckland's Panmure this morning, Stanford said a report recently released by the Education Review Office (ERO) had highlighted that some of the most vulnerable learners were in classrooms that were in a terrible condition.</p>
        
            <p>"I was horrified to learn about the unacceptable state of specialist school property and the long wait lists of more than 650 children, following significant underinvestment in maintenance and growth."</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Finance Nicola Willis said half of the new funding would go towards maintenance and repairs to existing schools throughout New Zealand, including Sommerville School.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the money would repair run-down facilities and $26m would pay for 17 new satellite classrooms in regular schools.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford also announced that Sommerville would be one of three schools to be entirely redeveloped.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, the school reported it had leaking sewage, with mould and mushrooms growing on classroom walls.</p>

            <p>Stanford said construction would begin early next year and would last 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement signalled the government's "firm commitment" to specialist schools who did "incredible work for young people with the highest needs", she said.</p>
        
            <p>But a group supporting children with disabilities has condemned the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Brown from the Inclusive Education Action Group told RNZ it was "absolutely not" the best use of the money.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're talking about here is $90m that could have gone into the general education system to enable disabled kids and non-disabled kids to be able to be educated together at their local schools," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It perpetuates a system which segregates disabled children out of the mainstream."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said nobody wanted children in a mouldy classroom, whether it was a special school or a local school, but building new special school satellite classrooms took the education system back decades.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Education Ministry's guidance about inclusive education.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said families used special schools as a last resort when mainstream schools had let them down.</p>
        
            <p>"It's usually when there's a failure in the mainstream local school," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said mainstream schools were under-resourced in terms of support for children with disabilities and that was partly because money was spent on special schools.</p>
