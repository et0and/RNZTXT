            <p>A 1News-Verian poll suggests more New Zealanders oppose the Treaty Principles Bill than support it.</p>
        
            <p>The poll showed just 23 percent of respondents backed the bill, while 36 percent were opposed, but even more - 39 percent - said they did not know enough about it.</p>
        
            <p>Only 2 percent refused to give an answer.</p>
        
            <p>The poll also looked at how supportive of the bill different groups of voters were, with ACT supporters by far the most likely to be in favour: 77 percent.</p>
        
            <p>On the other side of the ledger, Greens supporters and Māori were most likely to oppose the bill, at 68 and 67 percent respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Labour supporters were 52 percent opposed, while National supporters and NZ First supporters were 30 percent and 48 percent in support.</p>
        
            <p>The poll surveyed 1006 eligible voters and was weighted for demographics, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval. It was conducted between 30 November and 4 December.</p>
        
            <p>That was after the hīkoi mō te Tiriti, which saw tens of thousands arrive at Parliament in support of te Tiriti o Waitangi in Wellington on Tuesday 19 November.</p>
