            <p>The government is opening procurement for a public private partnership to build and run the new Northland Expressway.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop said registrations of interest would open this week for the four-lane Road of National Significance between Warkworth and Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>The first stage of the project - from Warkworth to Te Hana - will include an 850m tunnel bored through the Dome Valley, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>Shortlisted bidders will be invited to submit formal expressions of interest in the middle of the year. The winner should be revealed early next year, with a contract finalised mid-2026 and construction starting later that year.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been extensive market engagement by NZTA over the last few months and big international interest in the Warkworth to Te Hana project. Cabinet has now approved NZTA to move to the next stage of procurement, and agreed that the project will be delivered as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"NZTA is progressing planning and design for the remaining sections of the corridor. Decisions on the emerging preferred corridor for Sections 2 and 3, including an alternative to the Brynderwyn Hills, will be announced soon."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Registrations of Interest would be formally opened at the NZ Investment Summit starting on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"The Northland Expressway is expected to make use of the Fast-track Approvals Act as well as the Public Works Act changes for critical infrastructure announced yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"Today is a great milestone for going for growth in Northland. This investment will not only unlock Northland's economic potential but also provide long-term opportunities for the infrastructure sector, helping to build a stronger, more resilient supply chain for New Zealand."</p>
