            <p>From Jacinda Ardern and John Key to Christopher Luxon, Chlöe Swarbrick and David Seymour, praise has poured in for the former National deputy leader, who has died after a long battle with cancer, at age 44.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood she died at the weekend. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 at 36 years old.</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Kaye worked incredibly hard, cared passionately about her electorate, and was always willing to agree an idea was good, or bad, based on her values rather than just politics.</p>
        
            <p>"We may have been opponents, but there were so many things I admired about Nikki. She worked incredibly hard, cared passionately about her electorate, and she was always willing to agree an idea was good, or bad, based on her values rather than just politics.</p>
        
            <p>"We laughed a lot over the years, and while we may have had some decent debates, nothing ever felt genuinely personal. I'm sorry that I never knew Nikki was unwell again, if I had, I'd liked to have talked with her just one more time."</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Helen Clark said she was "deeply saddened" to learn of Kaye's death after her "courageous battle against cancer over many years".</p>
        
            <p>"As an MP, Nikki was able to work across party lines and was respected for her intelligence amd abilities. Deepest sympathies to family and friends."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said "Nikki's contribution to our party, her community, and New Zealand has left an indelible mark. Her tireless dedication, sharp intellect, and tenacity earned her the respect of people across the political spectrum".</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki was a remarkable person and a crusader for what she believed in, and her contribution has left our country in a better place."</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Sir John Key revealed her cancer diagnosis was much poorer than either of them let on publicly in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Sir John said returning to work despite her poor health was important to Kaye and gave her a purpose, which helped her survive almost another decade.</p>
        
            <p>"She needed a purpose and she's always had that in her life and it helped a lot. While it's incredibly sad we've been robbed of someone at just 44 years of age, on the other side of the coin I'd say it's very true she measured the life out of the years not the years out of the life. She achieved a remarkable amount in 44 years."</p>
        
            <p>Sir John had a long catch-up with Kaye three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"She described herself as quite a spiritual person, she felt very much at peace with her life and what she'd achieved and she was in a good space ... but that doesn't make it any easier for those of us who knew her well who are going to miss her deeply."</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said he was saddened, saying he had worked closely with Kaye on charter schools.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki was resolute in securing backing from her National Party colleagues for the End of Life Choice Act. Her personal battle with breast cancer added powerful sincerity to the debate.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki was a tenacious electorate MP in Auckland Central and a dedicated door-knocker. Her efforts, which saw her win her seat twice against Jacinda Ardern, set a benchmark for local representation. She touched many lives and will be widely missed."</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Marama Davidson said Kaye was among the first people she shared her own breast cancer diagnosis with.</p>
        
            <p>"You put your lunch down, stood up and just walked over to the other side of the table and hugged me silently for what seemed like the longest of time.</p>
        
            <p>"We stayed in very close contact ever since and got to know each other in a way I never expected."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said Kaye would remain in her heart forever.</p>
        
            <p>"You were a beautiful human. I'll be keeping you and your people in my heart. He pouri, he mamae, ka tangi."</p>
        
            <p>Long-time friend Michelle Boag, is remembering Kaye as a "strongly determined" and "principled" woman who "always put others above herself".</p>
        
            <p>Boag, a former National Party president, was once described by Kaye as her "second mum".</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a very good relationship," Boag said, admitting they would argue about things "because some of her views were much more green than mine".</p>
        
            <p>"But she always held her ground."</p>
        
            <p>Boag said Kaye would help anyone - "it didn't matter what their political colour was".</p>
        
            <p>"In a way, Nikki was very non-political, because she treated everybody the same. She wasn't the least bit tribal, but she understood politics really well, so she understood how far she could push things when she was advocating for a cause."</p>
        
            <p>Boag thought her understanding of people and politics was "huge", but she herself was "not innately political".</p>
        
            <p>"She would deal with anybody, treat everyone the same. It didn't matter who you were, what political colour you were, especially when it came to her constituents, she would work incredibly hard, harder than anyone I've ever seen in politics.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact is, she achieved more in her short life than many people would in 10 lives."</p>
        
            <p>Kaye's former colleague, Maggie Barry, posted a photo of the pair on Facebook with the caption "farewell my friend".</p>
        
            <p>Others have also chimed in to praise Kaye, National's deputy leader under Todd Muller, for her "tireless dedication" to her work.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki's contribution to our party, her community, and New Zealand has left an indelible mark," Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and deputy National Party leader Nicola Willis said in a joint statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki was a remarkable person and a crusader for what she believed in, and her contribution has left our country in a better place."</p>
        
            <p>Before giving a speech to farmers near Hamilton, Luxon on Tuesday paid tribute to Kaye, saying she had incredible enthusiasm, energy, intelligence and determination.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said Kaye was one of the bravest Parliamentarians New Zealand had seen.</p>
        
            <p>"She was not only a colleague, but a brilliant friend to many of us. She was fiercely committed to her constituents and her values and she contributed so much of her soul to this country and our party.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>Devastating news. Nikki was one of the bravest parliamentarians New Zealand has had, fiercely advancing the liberal values and causes she believed in. She loved the National Party and contributed so much of her soul to it. I will be forever grateful for the contribution she made…</p>
        
            <p>Willis told Midday Report that Kaye was a true champion for her values and a fierce fighter for her constituents.</p>
        
            <p>"There was something that burned in her to help others, and she went to great lengths to do so, even when it was against her personal or political interests to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"Her starting place was always, 'well if we're motivated by the same thing, how can we work together to get there?', and she had a special quality, I think, of being prepared to fight for her values even when it wasn't politically expedient to do so. She was brave."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said Kaye worked hard for education, gay marriage and adoption, and the environment while in politics, even crossing the floor to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"She crossed the floor over the issue of mining on Great Barrier Island, she cared deeply for the natural world and the blue-green movement within the National Party."</p>
        
            <p>"She prided herself on replying to every email, helping with everything she could help with. She viewed her role as the Auckland Central MP as one in which she was the advocate who could make a difference to individuals and their families."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said today's news was incredibly sad.</p>
        
            <p>"Nikki Kaye and I were opposite numbers at Parliament in the Education portfolio, and I would describe us very fondly as frenemies," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a lot of respect for her and how she went about her work.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't agree with all of her decisions, but found her immensely reasonable. She poured her heart and soul into the electorate and she always pushed for better for children and young people."</p>
        
            <p>Others also posted to social media to pay tribute:</p>
        
            <p>I’m so saddened to hear of the passing of friend Nikki Kaye, former National Party MP and Minister at only 44 from a long battle with cancer. I have lots of happy memories of times with her.</p>
        
            <p>RIP Nikki Kaye.  You achieved more in 44 years than most would do in twice that. You will be missed.</p>
        
            <p>Such sad news - @nikkikaye was the most phenomenally, hardworking Minister who was so passionate about innovation in education and continued leading in this space globally after leaving parliament. A huge loss ❤️ https://t.co/CyWdE3TpsW pic.twitter.com/GV7eGCsuAo</p>
        
            <p>Kaye had openly spoken about her health before retiring from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>She was in Parliament for 12 years, entering in 2008 (aged 28), before announcing in July 2020 she wouldn't contest the upcoming election.</p>
