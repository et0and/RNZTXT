            <p>A snub by the Cook Islands prime minister will be watched by any nations keen to see how deep New Zealand's partnerships in the region really are, an expert on geopolitics in the Pacific says.</p>
        
            <p>The Foreign Minister's office says Mark Brown headed to Beijing on Sunday without "properly consulting" New Zealand about agreements he plans to sign with China.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands operates in free association with New Zealand. It means the island nation conducts its own affairs, but Aotearoa needs to assist when it comes to foreign affairs, disasters, and defence.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is asking for more consultation over what is in the China deal.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters said neither New Zealand nor the Cook Island people knew what was in the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we've been not told(sic) what the nature of the arrangements that they seek in Beijing might be," he told Morning Report on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Massey University's Dr Anna Powles said the relationship was "incredibly important to New Zealand, and incredibly important to get right".</p>
        
            <p>"It will be seen as a barometer in the region for how it engages with other Pacific Forum country members."</p>
        
            <p>There had always been natural tensions between Aotearoa and the Cook Islands over free association independence, but Brown's tactics would be "raising deep concerns in Wellington", Powles said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is obviously a significant agreement, it doesn't necessarily have the support of the Cook Islands people, and it speaks to some friction within the relationship between New Zealand the Cook Islands."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, a spokesperson from the Foreign Minister's office said the lack of consultation in particular was "a matter of significant concern to the New Zealand government".</p>
        
            <p>"We look forward to continuing discussions with the government of the Cooks Islands on this important matter in the coming days and weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson also said New Zealand deeply values its relationship with the government and people of the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>"Cook Islanders are treasured members of the New Zealand family. The Deputy Prime Minister will continue to defend and protect the interests of Cook Islanders, in the context of New Zealand protecting the security and prosperity of all New Zealand citizens and of the Realm of New Zealand."</p>
