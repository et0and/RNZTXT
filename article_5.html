        <h2>Watch: Health Minister announces details on government's new health targets</h2>
        <p>
Shane Reti has laid out a plan for achieving the government's big health goals.
</p>
        
            <p>The new commissioner of Health NZ has assured the government that its health targets can and will be achieved with the current resources.</p>
        
            <p>Those targets were announced in May - promising a focus on cancer treatment, immunisation rates, emergency department stays, and wait times.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti has this morning laid out a plan for achieving those goals, including setting up more community infusion centres for chemotherapy.</p>
        
            <p>He has promised more beds and operating theatre space in public hospitals, as well more use of private hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said efforts will also be made to keep acute care and planned care separate.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the coalition replaced Health NZ's board with a sole commissioner - Lester Levy.</p>
        
            <p>Reti is speaking to media from Hutt Hospital and it is being livestreamed at the top of this page.</p>
