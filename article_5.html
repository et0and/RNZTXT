        <h2>Watch: Treaty Principles Bill hearings resume</h2>
        <p>
The committee will hear from organisations including YouthLaw Aotearoa, Te Hunga Roia Maori o Aotearoa and the Council of Medical Colleges.
</p>
        
            <p>More oral hearings will take place on Thursday on the Treaty Principles Bill, as the Justice Committee continues to make its way through 80 hours in total of listening to submitters.</p>
        
            <p>A full day of submissions took place on Monday, hearing from a range of legal and acedemic experts - and the Minister in charge of the Bill, David Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>Today the hearings will run for two hours.</p>
        
            <p>The full video of Thursday's hearings are the top of this page.</p>
        
            <p>The committee will hear from organisations such as YouthLaw Aotearoa, Te Hunga Roia Maori o Aotearoa and the Council of Medical Colleges.</p>
        
            <p>The former minister of Justice Kiritapu Allan will also be making a submission, and former National MP Sandra Goudie. Lorraine Toki of the Iwi Leaders Forum is presenting too.</p>
        
            <p>Maringi James - who helped coordinate a petition against the Bill - will be appearing, as well as iwi organisation and social service provider Te RÅ«nanga o Whaingaroa.</p>

            <p>Economics professor Ananish Chaudhuri and retired District Court Judge David Harvey are up today as well, alongside John Milne, an Accredited Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Directors.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chair James Meager said the committee had worked to ensure there was a broad range of views heard in the first sessions.</p>
        
            <p>Every political party representative on the committee was able to put forward submitters they knew had made submissions, or whose submissions had been processed.</p>
        
            <p>The approach around how the rest of the oral submissions are selected will be confirmed later today.</p>
        
            <p>The committee aims to finish hearing all oral submissions by the end of February.</p>
