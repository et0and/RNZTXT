            <p>The government has put out its framework for developing and using artificial intelligence across the public service.</p>
        
            <p>Several government agencies including ACC have recently been trialling the use of AI in non-public facing work.</p>
        
            <p>The new framework puts efficiency, transparency and safety to the fore.</p>
        
            <p>"AI is evolving rapidly and if inaccuracy or misuse were to cause failure in public service delivery, the consequences could be serious," the framework said.</p>
        
            <p>"Privacy, security and ethical risks need to be carefully considered."</p>
        
            <p>Among the framework's principles, that draw from work by the OECD, are that agencies must publicly disclose how the use of AI affects any outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>Also, public service workers have a right to be consulted about changes from AI in how they work.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Digitising Government Judith Collins has been pushing for more use of AI and the Cabinet has agreed to light touch regulating of it.</p>
        
            <p>Updated guidance on the use of generative AI is due out soon.</p>
        
            <p>The existing guidance recommends not using it for any data classified sensitive or above, or for critical operations, and to avoid where possible putting any personal data into GenAI tools.</p>
