            <p>The government is celebrating the start of processing for its fast-track infrastructure regime, and has appointed conveners to set up expert panels.</p>
        
            <p>The contentious fast-track law passed late last year allows developers to skip normal consenting, including environmental and Treaty of Waitangi hurdles.</p>
        
            <p>From Friday, developers can lodge applications for projects through a new government website, fasttrack.govt.nz, while those projects already listed in legislation can submit for consideration by expert panels.</p>
        
            <p>The panels will have the power to decide whether or not each project receives approval, and attach any necessary conditions that must be fulfilled.</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones announced former Environment Court judge Jane Borthwick as convener, with Helen Atkins and Jennifer Caldwell named as associate conveners.</p>
        
            <p>They will be tasked with setting up the expert panels - including their timeframes for considering projects - and can request reports from relevant agencies and individuals.</p>

            <p>Bishop said Borthwick had a wealth of experience in environmental and resource management litigation and had worked with industry in cases with considerable public interest.</p>
        
            <p>She has been a mediator, lawyer and judge for 15 years, including in the Environment Court, with a particular focus on freshwater management in public policy and consenting. She returned to practising law after retiring from the judiciary last year.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said Atkins and Caldwell "have both had oversight and leadership on a mixed range of complex projects".</p>
        
            <p>Atkins had been practising in environmental, local government, and public law for over 30 years. Caldwell had held legal leadership roles including as an expert panel chair for the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the EPA was seeking applicants for fast-track expert panel members via the new website.</p>
