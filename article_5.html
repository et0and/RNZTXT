            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown has issued a directive to Waka Kotahi and councils around the country to cease blanket speed limit reductions.</p>
        
            <p>This week, the coalition has removed the mandatory requirement and deadline for authorities to submit and then implement speed management plans.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Brown said work would begin on a new policy ensuring speed limits took into account travel times and the views of local communities as well as safety.</p>

            <p>"Our coalition government wants to see a transport system that boosts productivity and economic growth and allows New Zealanders to get to where they want to go, faster and safer."</p>
        
            <p>Variable speed limits would be allowed on roads approaching schools during pick-up and drop-off times, rather than permanent reductions, Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am writing to Road Controlling Authorities throughout the country to notify them of the changes and to advise them that work has begun on the new [policy].</p>
        
            <p>"This allows them to stop work on current speed management plans until the [policy] is put in place."</p>
        
            <p>Brown later told Checkpoint there were a range of factors that went into making a road safer, including testing for intoxicated drivers or drug testing as well as fixing and building infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed the Waikato Expressway, with a limit of 110km/h, was "the safest road" in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Research from Austroads - the Association of Australian and New Zealand Road Transport and Traffic Authorities - shows the risk of death increased from 10 percent if a car was travelling at 30km/h and collided with a human to 80 percent if a car was going at 50km/h.</p>
        
            <p>While variable speed limits would be allowed around schools during drop-off and pick-up times, local authorities would be allowed to apply that to all roads all the time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government wanted a "proper and consistent" benefit-cost ratio applied when local road authorities considered speed limits, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at what Wellington City Council did ... they actually did a full economic analysis of their proposal of 30km/h - the only council in the country which actually did a full economic analysis when they're not required to - actually found that that [reducing the speed to 30km/h] was actually going to have far greater costs than benefits to the city."</p>
