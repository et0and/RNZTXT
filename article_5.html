            <p>The government is expected to unveil its long-awaited plan for replacing the Interislander ferries today.</p>
        
            <p>There had been reports it would buy two smaller ships for $900 million - much more than the $551m Labour's paid.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition ditched the previous iRex replacement project because the two mega ferries needed major terminal and port upgrades at Wellington and Picton, which would have pushed the overall cost to $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Interislander and its competitor Bluebridge have faced recurring mechanical challenges, with sailings cancelled and passengers reporting difficulty getting alternative bookings.</p>
        
            <p>The government had said its version would be cheaper, even after taking into account the cancellation fees for the former contract.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>Under the new plan, ports may be asked to bear more of the cost, potentially increasing prices for passengers and freight, and the Interislander service may shift to a new Crown-owned company.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Finance Nicola Willis told Parliament she stood by the decision not to increase funding for the project.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident that the government's alternative ferry solution for the Cook Strait will cost less than the i-Rex project that was started under the previous government, and which blew out to a cost of at least $3 billion."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Infrastructure New Zealand chief executive Nick Leggett said it wanted a Cook Strait ferry service that was reliable and safe, but he was not too concerned about roll-on roll-off rail capability.</p>
        
            <p>Leggett told Morning Report the most important thing was a trustworthy inter-island connection that would protect economic productivity.</p>
        
            <p>The cancellation had impacted the transport and infrastructure sector, but it remained to be seen who would pay for the new ports, and he suggested the private sector could get involved.</p>
        
            <p>"People ... understand the importance of this link - it carries $30 billion of freight across Cook Strait every year, hundreds of thousands of people and tourists - it's a vital link to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"How we set it up is really important to the supply chain and to every Kiwi - [when] we think about perishable food that keeps us going, as well as export goods - we need this to be safe and secure."</p>
        
            <p>There had been an "undue fixation" on rail enablement of the key ports in the iRex project, as freight goods carried by rail - as opposed to by road - accounted for only 7 percent of the total, he said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was the only country in world procuring rail ferries from new at the time the iRex boats were in production, he added.</p>
        
            <p>A "fast turnaround" was more important for the New Zealand economy, and Leggett suggested that private sector funding might help deliver that, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd be looking today to see some innovation in the way not only the boats are procured but actually how the Cook Strait KiwiRail service is run, and that might mean private sector involvement as well."</p>
