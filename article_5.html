            <p>The Transport Minister says he is appalled by the stabbing of a taxi driver in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>It's thought the driver, who was taken to hospital with critical injuries on Thursday night, was likely an independent operator. A 46-year-old woman was arrested on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The Small Passenger Service Association said they were at the highest risk of violent attacks, because they did not have any back up, and it wanted to see security cameras in all small passenger vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Transport Simeon Brown said taxi drivers and public transport workers should be able to go about their jobs without fear of violence.</p>
        
            <p>He said proposed changes to legislation would lead to harsher penalties for those who target taxi and bus drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"I recently announced, alongside Minister of Justice Paul Goldsmith that the Government will make changes to the Sentencing Act.</p>
        
            <p>"This will include introducing new aggravating factors at sentencing for offences against sole charge and public transport workers, which includes both taxi and bus drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"These new aggravating factors will send a clear message that there will be tougher consequences for offenders."</p>
        
            <p>The driver went to a fast food restaurant on Memorial Avenue at about 10.30pm on Thursday to find help after being stabbed several times.</p>
        
            <p>The restaurant owner said staff administered first aid until emergency services arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Colin Baillie said police weren't seeking anyone else, and did not believe there's an ongoing risk to the public.</p>
        
            <p>Legislation introduced in 2011 required cameras to be installed in all taxis, following the murders of two taxi drivers in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
