            <p>The latest Health Survey shows more children are going hungry and wait times for GPs continue to increase, along with rates of mental distress.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said the findings from the annual snapshot highlighted "the need to continue driving better health outcomes for New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>The survey of 9719 adults and 3062 children in 2023/24 found:</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said while this year's figure was still too high, he was "pleased to see the rate of growth slow after such significant mismanagement under the previous government".</p>
        
            <p>"I am fully committed to strengthening the health workforce, particularly by training more doctors and primary care specialists, so we can shorten these wait times for appointments.</p>
        
            <p>"We want people to be able to access primary care, so they're not having to visit emergency departments in the first place, and we can reduce pressure on our hospital system."</p>
        
            <p>By growing the broader economy and driving down inflation, the government was working to make it easier for New Zealanders to afford GP visits and buy food, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand has faced a particularly challenging time during this survey period. I am encouraged to see that overall, 85.4 percent of New Zealanders report being in good health, and I acknowledge Health NZ's role in helping support that.</p>
        
            <p>"I will continue working with associate ministers and agencies to address the challenges this survey identifies, and capitalise on the successes we see such as continued low smoking rates."</p>
