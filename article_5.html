        <h2>US tariff 'will have an impact on New Zealand exports', McClay says</h2>

            <p>Trade Minister Todd McClay has confirmed New Zealand exporters will face a 10 percent tariff on all goods to the United States, from this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>There is no indication at this stage there will be any change or duties imposed on New Zealand services.</p>
        
            <p>President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would instigate reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing duties on other countries - including responding to what he said was a 20 percent tariff on US goods from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>McClay has confirmed New Zealand does not have a 20 percent tariff rate that it subjects US exports too.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand officials would be tasked with passing on that message to US counterparts, who McClay said were possibly assuming New Zealand applies 20 percent due to a rate connected to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
        
            <p>In reality, New Zealand applied a much lower rate for US exports into New Zealand, McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has already claimed credit for New Zealand exporters being hit with a lower tariff rate than predicted by commentators.</p>
        
            <p>He took to social media to say: "The purpose of our mission (to the US) has been achieved. Indeed, New Zealand companies, who were fearing much worse, are well positioned compared to exporters from other countries."</p>
        
            <p>We went to Washington DC to get the best possible result for New Zealand in the circumstances, by making strong, genuine, in-person connections with the US Administration. The purpose of our mission has been achieved. Indeed, New Zealand companies, who were fearing much worse,…</p>
        
            <p>Peters travelled to the US last month where he met with his counterpart Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to get more information about any potential tariff hikes and advocate for New Zealand to not be too heavily stung.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past few days McClay has spoken with a number of businesses who export to the US and they have told him they "still see opportunity for them" in that market.</p>
        
            <p>He added, it was "important to note many other countries around the world are facing much higher tariffs".</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst not unexpected, it will have an impact on New Zealand exports."</p>

            <p>McClay told reporters at Parliament on Thursday morning, there was no sense of relief in only 10 percent being applied because tariffs were "not good for trade, so we're not feeling relieved".</p>
        
            <p>"Although I think there is recognition that New Zealand isn't seen as one of the countries that has an unbalanced trading relationship with the US."</p>
        
            <p>He said it wasn't surprising to be captured by the tariffs in one way or another, and regardless, New Zealand will continue to have a "constructive and very positive relationship" with America.</p>
        
            <p>Trade officials are also clarifying with the US whether the 10 percent is in addition to tariffs already paid.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears it is a blanket tariff but we're looking to clarify that quickly."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has no plans to retaliate against the US tariffs because that would "put up prices on New Zealand consumers and be inflationary," he said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand exports about $9 billion worth of goods to the US, so the cost of a 10 percent tariff would be about $900 million to exporters.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there is some pretty clear evidence that will be worn by US consumers, not New Zealand exporters," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>As for what New Zealand's average tariff rate is on the US, McClay said it was around 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That figure, and how low it is, is a point that has been made to the US in talks between the two countries, he said.</p>
