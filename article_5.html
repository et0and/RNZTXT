            <p>The government has launched a new phone-based case management system that hopes to provide 4000 more job seekers with support.</p>
        
            <p>The service would target job seekers ready for work, aged between 18 to 24 years old, providing them with a case manager to assist them in finding employment.</p>
        
            <p>Social Development and Employment Minister, Louise Upston, said the service was expected to increase the number of engagements the ministry had with job seekers by about 50,000 annually.</p>
        
            <p>Phone-based case management began at the start of July with 1500 job seekers, and would expand to 4000 within roughly two months.</p>
        
            <p>The new service would increase the number of job seekers receiving case management at any one time from about 53,000 to 57,000.</p>
        
            <p>Upston said under 25s on jobseeker support were forecast to spend nearly 20 years of their working lives on welfare, something she said the government would not accept.</p>
        
            <p>"We are targeting young job seekers because helping them back into work is critical for their long-term prospects," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"MSD (Ministry of Social Development) case managers provide valuable support to help people into work, but less than a third of those receiving the jobseeker support benefit currently receive this service."</p>
        
            <p>Upston said it was important the welfare system responded to the current economic climate by directly engaging with as many job seekers as it could.</p>
        
            <p>The minister said the government had a target of reducing the number of people on jobseeker support by 50,000 over the next six years.</p>
        
            <p>She said this would be done by several measures including: Making it clear that benefit sanctions should be fully applied, introducing work seminars that job seekers must attend within two weeks of receiving support, introducing work check-ins on job seekers after attending six months on a job, and a continued investment of $1.1 billion into the MSD's frontline employment programmes and financial supports.</p>
        
            <p>Upston said the obligations for those taking part in phone-based case management would be the same as any others, and that those who missed appointments without a good reason may face sanctions.</p>
