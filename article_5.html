            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti has refused to answer questions about how his replacement for Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority, will work - saying he prefers to explain that in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>With Parliament sitting under urgency in part to introduce and pass the bill through all stages, Dr Reti says he does not expect he will be able to speak to reporters about it until after the bill has gone through.</p>
        
            <p>The government has been facing criticism over its plan to abolish the authority, particularly as this is expected to be done ahead of an urgent claim at the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>Reti, however, would not provide details about the replacement for the authority until the bill's first reading.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you'll be pleased ... I'd actually prefer to portray it into the House in the first reading, where I can give it depth and volume and lustre around what the alternative plan is," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like oratory, I like adding context and contour to the statements I'm going to make. So I'd rather deliver all of that in the first reading."</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, he did offer some hints.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll see this, through the legislation, that there are parts of the pae ora which I have retained - like the Hauora Māori Advisory Committee, whose counsel I have found wise to date, already, actually, and in fact I'll be powering them up to do even more."</p>
        
            <p>Reti said he could not commit to speaking to reporters about it after the bill was introduced, as he expected to pass it through all stages in the same sitting.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't make a commitment to that, I envisage being in the House all of the time through until when the third reading is completed so we'll just have to see how that goes."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the funding for Māori health would remain the same, "and how that's distributed - through clinical or non-clinical frontline, backline, that's what's under discussion".</p>
        
            <p>"With the frailties in pae ora that we've seen over the past year or so - maybe even longer - that opportunity to craft and create something different, a different journey - yeah, that's a privilege and I respect the privilege that I have, doing this."</p>
        
            <p>Reti had earlier released a statement confirming the bill would transfer all remaining roles and functions from Te Aka Whai Ora to Health NZ Te Whatu Ora, and the Ministry of Health, by the end of March.</p>
        
            <p>"The narrow focus on disestablishment doesn't mean an end to our focus on Māori health for those who need it. We know the solutions for Māori communities come from Māori communities - not a centralised Wellington hub," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to finding more efficient ways to work together to deliver those solutions, as well as savings which can go back into better health outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>It confirmed Iwi Māori Partnership Boards and the Hauora Māori Advisory Committee would remain, and that the government "intends to shift decision-making closer to communities to allow the people who know their communities best to guide service design and commissioning".</p>
        
            <p>It said the government would "chart a new direction for Māori health" - but confirmed official documents relating to the bill would not be available until 4pm - and gave no further details about what would replace Te Aka Whai Ora.</p>

            <p>Te Pāti Māori in an earlier statement said it had requested with the Speaker a debate about the "use and abuse of urgency", including about the disestablishment of the Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>"The governments use and abuse of urgency has created a dictatorship in what should be a Tiriti-led democratic state," the statement in the name of co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said.</p>
        
            <p>"Urgency deprives both legislators and the public of adequate time for scrutiny and deliberation on significant legislative measures such as the disestablishment of the Māori Health Authority and abolishment of Smokefree legislation."</p>
        
            <p>Co-leader Rawiri Waititi - ahead of the bill's introduction - moved for such a debate to take place, and moved that the bill not be read because of the Tribunal hearing.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Speaker ruled against those as a matter of procedure.</p>
