            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has hinted that New Zealand may soon announce the start of long-anticipated trade deal negotiations with India.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at the India New Zealand Business Council's annual address in Auckland, Peters expressed optimism about advancing relations between the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a chance that we will be announcing the beginning of negotiations on that [trade deal] matter," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand began negotiating a trade agreement with India in 2010, under the leadership of Sir John Key.</p>
        
            <p>However, talks stalled after five years, and progress has remained stagnant ever since.</p>
        
            <p>Peters acknowledged the need for greater effort to strengthen ties with India, emphasising the government's commitment to fostering deeper connections with the world's largest democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"India has always been an important partner … When we came to government just over a year ago, it was obvious that a clearer, more determined, and more vigourous approach was required," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The foreign affairs minister highlighted recent diplomatic strides, including his trip to India in March 2024 and New Zealand's hosting of Indian President Droupadi Murmu in August 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Minister Todd McClay has also been active, visiting India three times this year and meeting his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal, on three other occasions abroad.</p>
        
            <p>Business leaders welcomed these developments but emphasised the need for tangible outcomes.</p>

            <p>"What this government is doing is what we want, but we need more momentum," said Bharat Chawla, chair of the India New Zealand Business Council.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to set a short-term goal before aiming for a long-term goal of a free trade deal. We don't want to wait another 10 years," Chawla added.</p>
        
            <p>Sunil Kaushal, general manager of the council, agreed, noting that while the high-level political visits are promising, more action is needed.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has come a long way, and there are good signals from both the New Zealand and Indian governments," Kaushal said.</p>
        
            <p>He emphasised that while challenges remained, the government should allocate more resources to accelerate progress.</p>
        
            <p>Peters also revealed plans to further solidify relations by confirming Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's trip to India in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
