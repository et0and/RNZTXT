        <h2>'I always agree with the prime minister' - Watts on possible Wellington interventions</h2>
        <p>
Simon Watts says he is concerned about Wellington Water, and the lack of a City and Regional Deal proposal which prompted the PM to call the councils "lame-o".

            <p>The Local Government Minister says he's looking at further intervention options around Wellington's councils.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon earlier said Wellington's councils were "lame-o" for not putting in a bid for a city or regional deal before the deadline.</p>
        
            <p>Regional Council chairperson Daran Ponter this morning told RNZ the Leadership Committee had come to the conclusion it needed more time, as the regional council did not want to rush a proposal through.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about that, the minister, Simon Watts, said he was also concerned about the recent reports from Wellington Water.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually met with the Wellington Water board chair, CEO and water board yesterday. I made my concerns clear them that obviously the feedback that we've seen from the reports is not meeting expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm considering intervention options that I have as minister in regards to that and I'll be making further decisions this week.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll be aware that I currently have an observer that sits on the Wellington Council, I'm currently looking at what options I have available... I'm just waiting on that advice at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Watts' predecessor in the role, Simeon Brown, had appointed the Crown Observer Lindsay McKenzie in October after Wellington City Council chose to rewrite its long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie reported in January a combination of issues had caused disruption, saying "it is surprising that the organisation hasn't totally wilted under the pressure".</p>
        
            <p>Watts said he has not spoken to Luxon about "the specific topic area" around the city and regional deals, "but I do share his concerns absolutely that Wellington ratepayers are very concerned about the situation".</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Luxon's characterisation of the councils as "lame-o", he said it was important to transition to the Local Water Done Well model.</p>
        
            <p>"I always agree with the prime minister," he said.</p>
