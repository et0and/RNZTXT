            <p>The Office for Māori-Crown relations, Te Arawhiti, has changed its name to reflect its smaller role.</p>
        
            <p>Minister Tama Potaka announced in August a rescoping of Te Arawhiti, which would no longer do the monitoring and reporting on Treaty settlement implementation and lead post-settlement relationships.</p>
        
            <p>That work would instead be picked up by the Māori Development Ministry, Te Puni Kōkiri. That change was confirmed in October.</p>
        
            <p>In December, the office confirmed it would disestablish 49 roles, 28 of which were already vacant.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, Te Arawhiti will now be known as Te Tari Whakatau, the Office of Treaty Settlements and Takutai Moana.</p>
        
            <p>Interim chief executive Anaru Mill, who took over the role left vacant when Lil Anderson joined private consultancy Te Amokura, said the name change would take a few weeks to complete.</p>
        
            <p>"The departmental agency has a sharpened focus on completing historical Treaty settlements and supporting Takutai Moana determinations. It's appropriate that we have a new name that reflects the significant changes in our responsibilities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Cabinet approved the new name the Office of Treaty Settlements and Takutai Moana: Te Tari Whakatau on 24 February to replace its current name."</p>
        
            <p>He said "te tari" translated to "office" and "whakatau" to "where things are settled or determined".</p>
        
            <p>"This applies equally to the work we do in negotiating Treaty settlements and supporting Takutai Moana applicants."</p>
        
            <p>The office had worked with Len Hetet (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Te Ātiawa, Ngāti Apa) - who developed the original branding - to create updated designs.</p>
        
            <p>"We have registered the name whakatau.govt.nz and updated our website URL ... it will take a few weeks for us to switch out the name and logo across all our communications including our email addresses, so we ask for patience."</p>
