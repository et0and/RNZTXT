        <h2>Winston Peters to 'fix' MFAT job listing for tikanga lead</h2>
        <p>
Winston Peters says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advertising a job for a 'tikanga lead' is a case of a bad idea getting "dug in deeper than ticks on a hound".

            <p>Winston Peters says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advertising a job for a 'tikanga lead' is a case of a bad idea getting "dug in deeper than ticks on a hound".</p>
        
            <p>The foreign affairs minister told reporters today it was his job to "fix", and the advertisement would be pulled down.</p>
        
            <p>The role was advertised on Wednesday morning, despite the government previously sending a clear message against such hires - something Peters said he expected the ministry to follow through on.</p>
        
            <p>Peters questioned what the purpose of the role would even be.</p>
        
            <p>"They were told that the previous administration 2023 is over, and we're going to spend our money - hard earned money and hard fought in terms of getting it from the minister of finance - on the right purpose."</p>
        
            <p>Another role being advertised - senior advisor for Māori engagement - was different, according to Peters, who had no issue with that position.</p>
        
            <p>The tikanga lead job was advertised on Seek. The advertisement said the successful applicant would lead the provision of tikanga advice for the ministry and also advise staff offshore.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a new position at the ministry and plays a critical role in Manatū Aorere's continued uplift of Mātauranga Māori. As tikanga lead, you will lead the tikanga team in Houtina - Māori division," the advertisement said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' frustration with his ministry's advertisement comes after New Zealand First last week proposed new legislation that would eliminate the likes of "mandates promoting diversity and inclusiveness in public service workplaces".</p>
        
            <p>The private member's bill would need to be drawn from the ballot to be considered by Parliament. However, on Tuesday the prime minister told RNZ he was open to adopting some of it.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon said he had tasked minister Judith Collins with overhauling the Public Service Act to ensure it was a "meritocracy".</p>
        
            <p>Peters told Morning Report on Wednesday morning he was adamant diversity was being preferred over merit for people getting jobs in the public sector.</p>
