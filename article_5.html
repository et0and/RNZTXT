        <h2>Government to review fire safety provisions in Building Code</h2>
        <p>
The full review - the first in over a decade - comes 18 months after five people died in a blaze at Wellington's Loafers Lodge.
</p>
        
            <p>The government plans to investigate fire safety provisions in the Building Code - the first full review in more than a decade.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after all fire safety recommendations from the review following the fatal Loafers Lodge fire in 2023 were completed.</p>
        
            <p>Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk said it was an important milestone, "which will reduce the chances of a tragedy like that happening again".</p>
        
            <p>Five people were killed and five injured in the fire at the Wellington boarding house, which was not protected with sprinklers - and did not legally have to be.</p>
        
            <p>It had originally been constructed as a warehouse, before undergoing multiple changes in use.</p>
        
            <p>After the incident, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment inspected similar properties throughout the country, finding almost all buildings had at least one fire safety issue.</p>

            <p>These included:</p>
        
            <p>Penk said the government was now prioritising a full review to improve fire safety in all buildings.</p>
        
            <p>It wanted to ensure the fire safety provisions in the Building Code "keep pace with changes in urban design and modern methods of construction", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we build has changed significantly in the last decade.</p>
        
            <p>"Newly evolving products and technologies are adding complexities to buildings, which have implications for fire safety and firefighting."</p>
        
            <p>A discussion document has been released and submissions close at 5pm on 6 December.</p>
