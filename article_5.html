            <p>The District Court has formally received applications for judicial recounts in three knife-edge electorates.</p>
        
            <p>Following the return of the special votes last week, National indicated it would ask for recounts in two seats, while Labour would seek a recount in one seat.</p>
        
            <p>In the Māori electorate of Tāmaki Makaurau, Te Pāti Māori's Takutai Tarsh Kemp leads Labour's Peeni Henare by four votes.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Helen White is 20 votes ahead of National's Melissa Lee in Mt Albert.</p>
        
            <p>In Nelson, Labour's Rachel Boyack, the electorate's incumbent, is leading National's newcomer Blair Cameron by 29 votes.</p>
        
            <p>The District Court said applicants had three working days following the public declaration of the election to file for a judicial recount. That deadline was Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Nelson recount will begin at 11am Thursday morning, while the Mt Albert and Tāmaki Makaurau recounts will start at 9am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Each candidate is entitled to a scrutineer to observe the recounts. No timeframe has been given for how long they will take.</p>
        
            <p>If a judge finds the results from the public declaration were incorrect, they will order the Electoral Commission to give an amended declaration.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their losses, National's Melissa Lee and Labour's Peeni Henare returned to Parliament as list MPs.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Lee told RNZ it was "incredible" she had cut Labour's majority from 21,000 to 20.</p>
        
            <p>She said she enjoyed serving the area as a list MP, but becoming the electorate MP would allow her to better serve the community.</p>
        
            <p>"With such a slim majority, it's only fair to the voters in Mount Albert that we actually go and double-check the result," she said.</p>
