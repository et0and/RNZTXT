            <p>The government says more eviction warnings and shorter complaint wait times show its crackdown on Kāinga Ora tenants is working.</p>
        
            <p>The state landlord has issued 553 "Section 55A notices" since July 2024, up from 41 issued during the same period the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>Around 40 percent were first time warnings, 16 percent second time warnings and 2 percent final notices, which allow landlords to apply to terminate a tenancy.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop said government action taken in March 2024 - cracking down on unruly behaviour - was working.</p>
        
            <p>"Neighbours of Kāinga Ora residents, frequently KO tenants themselves, were tired of having to put up with people who abused the privilege of a taxpayer-funded home - so Ministers declared enough was enough, and instructed the agency to take a stronger approach to managing disruptive tenants," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm particularly pleased to see that this early intervention is helping spark behaviour change among those tenants who have previously been disruptive."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said people were also waiting less time for complaints about disruptive behaviour to be resolved - an average of 15 business days by December 2024.</p>
        
            <p>This time last year Kāinga Ora had more than 500 complaints that had been open for nearly 60 days, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora is also continuing to use relocations to a different KO property to prompt behaviour change where there is conflict between neighbouring tenants,</p>
        
            <p>Relocations have taken place 101 times in the period between July and November, and in two-thirds of these cases, Kāinga Ora has not received further complaints about behaviour from these tenants in their new homes," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to emphasise that the strengthened approach does not have any impact on the significant majority of Kāinga Ora tenants who already do the right thing. In fact, I hope that it has made their lives easier knowing that they don't need to put up with disruptive behaviour from their neighbours,</p>
        
            <p>"I also want to thank Kāinga Ora staff for their hard work to ensure disruptive behaviour is managed quickly and effectively."</p>
