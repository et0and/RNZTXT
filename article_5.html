            <p>The Property Investors Federation says the government's move to restore tax deductions for interest on residential investment properties will improve the rental market.</p>
        
            <p>President Sue Harrison told Morning Report the change would increase the supply of rental properties by the "mum and dad" investors she represents.</p>
        
            <p>"They're at the coal face. They're working with people in the small towns and the big towns and they're trying to provide properties - 85 percent of property is in private hands in New Zealand so it's a public-private partnership and there has to be balance in that relationship to make it work at all levels, whether it's suppliers, developers, builders, or the people who own the property [and]... we need to make it work for the renters."</p>
        
            <p>The tax break was a "normal business expense", Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good tax practice and [its removal] was brought in by stealth through the last government... but the restriction in supply has gone the other way for renters because, inevitably, everything ends up down at the bottom.</p>
        
            <p>"The person who's [supplying] that property is trying to survive themselves so the costs have to come from somewhere."</p>
        
            <p>She said the change to tax deductibility would hopefully increase the supply of rental properties.</p>
        
            <p>"We have people trying to do the numbers on their retirement and working backwards, and thinking if we supply a property into the rental market these are the numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"But suddenly interest rates have increased on them and there's a new tax that wasn't even in the budget when they began, so they're trying to survive with that."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on the show, Revenue Minister Simon Watts said the tax reversal would be a "win-win" situation for investors and renters alike.</p>
        
            <p>However, an advocate for tenants does not believe anything will change for them once the tax breaks return.</p>
        
            <p>Renters United spokesman Luke Somervell told Morning Report the savings would not be passed on to renters, and would be a "cash handout for landlords".</p>
        
            <p>"Rents are high because we don't have enough houses, and there are enough desperate people, unfortunately, who will pay for them. I'm one of those desperate people, in fact."</p>
        
            <p>He doubted it would impact on supply.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just going to be a cash handout for landlords who rent the same old homes at a greater profit every year."</p>
        
            <p>Somervell disputed statements by the Revenue Minister that it would reduce rents as there was no incentive for landlords to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"They are making record profits, rents keep going up, more people are looking for homes so I don't really see why there is any incentive for them to do that."</p>
        
            <p>The new policy was designed to insulate the market from risk and encourage the "feeding frenzy" of property speculation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just going to prop up the status quo that's given us the housing crisis in the first place."</p>
        
            <p>He called for more new homes to be built - whether they were rented out or bought by first-home buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a decaying housing stock that's a national embarrassment and we need to have meaningful enforcement through the Tenancy Tribunal... of Healthy Homes specifications.</p>
        
            <p>"The government is saying that they're trying to help out renters - but then they've got no-cause evictions that are going to boot renters out of their homes.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the minister should come clean and admit that there's nothing here for renters and stop trying to pull the wool over our eyes."</p>
