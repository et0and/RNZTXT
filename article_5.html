        <h2>Live exports a bad look for NZ, port workers union says</h2>
        <p>
The Maritime Union also has zero faith in government assurances of a gold standard for ships used for the trade. Audio

            <p>The union for port workers is joining opposition to the government's plans for resuming live animal exports.</p>
        
            <p>The trade was banned last year over welfare concerns and the 2020 sinking near Japan, of Gulf Livestock 1 that had sailed from Napier on its way to China. Forty-one men and nearly 6000 live cattle died.</p>
        
            <p>The government has delayed the release of a public discussion document on the issue until next year but remains committed to reinstating the trade that was worth $374 million in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>This time around, it is promising the highest standards of animal welfare and gold standard transport ships - but has not provided specifics.</p>
        
            <p>The Maritime Union, which represents watersiders and stevedores who have in the past loaded freighters including the ill-fated Gulf Livestock 1, has voted to oppose their return.</p>

            <p>Victor Billott from the Maritime Union, said in addition to animal welfare and cruelty concerns, live exports were not a good look for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We just think New Zealand would benefit from being seen as a kind of modern and progressive exporter that doesn't carry out such bad practices that have grown to be unpopular."</p>
        
            <p>In the past the live animals trade was not a huge amount of work for waterfront workers.</p>
        
            <p>"The jobs aren't really there, the money's going to a relatively small number of people and the downside really outweighs the upside."</p>
        
            <p>The investigation of the capsize of the Gulf Livestock 1 had revealed the vessel's "poor conditions", Billot said.</p>
        
            <p>The government was now promising the trade would resume to a gold standard for the ships being used, however, it had little credibility because in the past several vessels had been poor quality, he said.</p>
        
            <p>They used flags of convenience which meant vessels could be registered to a country with low standards and no enforcement of any laws.</p>
        
            <p>"We're kind of hamstrung in dealing with the conditions on those ships in terms of their seaworthiness and also the conditions crews have to put up with and sometimes the livestock."</p>
        
            <p>Billot said he had no confidence in the government's assurances of top quality vessels being used for the live exports once it resumed.</p>
        
            <p>If a disaster happened, it would emerge once again that New Zealand did not have adequate laws that governed shipping in this country "that really guarantee any kind of standards, let alone a gold standard on these vessels".</p>
        
            <p>Health and safety concerns would be grounds for not working on a ship in New Zealand, however, employment law meant union members would usually have to abide by what the companies wanted.</p>
        
            <p>That was partly why the union was speaking out against a law change.</p>
        
            <p>"We just think it should stay like that and it solves a problem."</p>
