            <p>Two new political polls show the left bloc has the numbers to form a government if an election was held today.</p>
        
            <p>Support for National dropped three points to 34 percent in tonight's 1News-Verian poll.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT party had a one-point bump to 9 percent while New Zealand First dropped one point to 5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Labour is up four points to 33 percent, the Greens are steady on 10 percent and Te Pāti Māori is down three points to 4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>On these results, the left bloc would have 61 seats, the minimum level of support required to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>The results also surveyed economic optimisim, finding it dropped 5 points to 36 percent, compared to Verian's December poll.</p>
        
            <p>Economic pessimism rose three points to 25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Of those polled, 39 percent said the government was heading in the right direction and 50 percent said the government was going in the wrong direction.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining 11 percent did not know or preferred not to say.</p>
        
            <p>On the preferred prime minister stakes, National's Christopher Luxon dropped two points to 22 percent - his lowest result since taking the top job.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Chris Hipkins rose two points to 17 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the leaders were steady with David Seymour and Chlöe Swarbrick on 6 percent, and Winston Peters on 5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Tonight's 1News Verian poll, taken between 3 and 7 February, surveyed 1000 eligible voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a Taxpayers' Union-Curia Poll out this afternoon, which also showed the left bloc is in a position to hold power if an election was held today.</p>
        
            <p>The poll, conducted between 2 and 4 February, had National ever so slightly ahead of Labour - up 2.3 points to 31.9 percent, while Labour is up 0.4 points to 31.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens have done the heavy-lifting getting the centre-bloc into a position to govern for the first time since March 2022, up 3.7 points to 13.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ACT and New Zealand First were both down to 10 and 6.4 percent respectively, while Te Pāti Māori had a slight dip to 4.4 percentage points.</p>
        
            <p>The Curia poll surveyed 1000 adults with a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Curia is a longstanding polling company but is no longer a member of the Research Association NZ body.</p>
