            <p>New catch limits in Fiordland from 25 April mean recreational fishers will be only able to take smaller bags of finfish and shellfish.</p>
        
            <p>The rule changes are in response to fish stock pressures of popular species in the area, including rāwaru/-lue cod, hāpuku-groper, pāua and scallops.</p>
        
            <p>Government-appointed Fiordland Marine Guardians said new recreational fishing rules would address pressure on stock levels in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A particular focus for the Guardians was to reduce fishing in the vulnerable inner fiords and also the entrances to them, where stocks appear depleted.</p>
        
            <p>Fiordland Marine Guardians chair Rebecca McLeod told RNZ's Nine to Noon that reducing the overall level of fishing pressure ensured stocks could be rebuilt.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the fishers out there to act responsibly and to follow the rules because they are invested in the future of Fiordland and the mission that the Guardians are on."</p>
        
            <p>Fishers are being encouraged to move to the outer waters.</p>
        
            <p>"They were able to take a bag limit of 30 finfish throughout Fiordland, and now we're reducing that to a total of 20 if you're on that open coast, and if you're inside the fiords, 10," McLeod said.</p>
        
            <p>The daily limit for blue cod on the open coast is 10, and inside the fiords is one.</p>
        
            <p>For pāua, the daily limit on the open coast is five, and inside the fiords is two.</p>
        
            <p>The changes also include the closure of scallop and oyster fisheries throughout the Fiordland Marine Area, and of hāpuku/groper/bass fishing in the innermost parts of all fiords.</p>
        
            <p>No changes have been made to rock lobster limits.</p>
        
            <p>"Fiordland is a unique and treasured part of New Zealand and is home to many fish species. I want to keep it that way," Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"As well as catch limits being reduced for species such as blue cod, hāpuku/bass and pāua, the boundary line for lower daily limits for some species has been moved further out to shift fishing to more productive areas."</p>
        
            <p>In the Chatham Islands, there will also be reduced recreational catch limits for most fish species from Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"The Chatham Islands are known for being rich in kaimoana, attracting fishers seeking some of New Zealand's most sought-after fish species," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>Also coming into effect on 25 April is the catch limit for quinnat salmon caught from the ocean - it will reduce to one fish per person per day, nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>It was in line with the limit for rivers and freshwater, Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said decisions were made based on local concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"What's clear is that we all want our fisheries to be healthy and sustainable so they continue to provide now and in the future," Jones said.</p>
