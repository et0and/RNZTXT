            <p>Health staff owed billions of dollars for botched Holidays Act calculations say they are being "doubly punished", as Health New Zealand makes savage budget cuts to pay for them.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora's latest quarterly report, released on Thursday, shows the cost of Holidays Act breaches and untaken long service leave has now hit $3.6 billion - up from $3.2b in December.</p>
        
            <p>What it owes - and the cost of fixing the problem - rose another $170 million in the quarter to the end of June, as the total (unaudited) deficit for the year neared $1b ($934m).</p>
        
            <p>Nurses Organisation chief executive Paul Goulter said much of the so-called "unbudgeted" staffing costs blamed for Te Whatu Ora's worsening financial outlook should not have been a surprise to health officials - or the government.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a self-inflicted wound by Cabinet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as we can tell, it is due to the failure of Cabinet to approve the full pay equity payout - and that left Te Whatu Ora carrying a large chunk of it on its balance sheet - round about half a billion dollars."</p>
        
            <p>The holiday pay "fiasco" had been dragging on for years, Goulter said.</p>
        
            <p>In August he wrote to Health NZ chief executive Margie Apa on behalf of his members to protest repeated delays in making agreed payments - and the agency's recent decision to "pause" the approval of consultants to fix payroll systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite frankly, what our members are saying 'We still haven't even got it - so why is this being brought into account when we haven't got the money?'.</p>
        
            <p>"And they're increasingly angry about Te Whatu Ora's inability to pay what's owed."</p>
        
            <p>The multiple payroll systems still used by the former district health boards were "incapable of doing the job", Goulter said.</p>
        
            <p>"But the point is, this has been around for many years. These workers are still largely waiting for their money.</p>
        
            <p>"And now they're being doubly punished for it because they're being told there's this massive deficit and they're going to have to make cutbacks."</p>
