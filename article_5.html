            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says the Defence Force "advised" on the new boot camp course being set up for young offenders, but Oranga Tamariki will be leading them.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after it was revealed Defence Force staff running the six-week Limited Service Volunteer course suffered serious mental distress after struggling to deal with violent and at-risk youth.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report the new course would take the best parts of successful existing programmes and do a better job in areas that had failed previously.</p>
        
            <p>"We're putting together a pilot in July with 10 young people to see if you can get a programme that actually works."</p>
        
            <p>It would be led by Oranga Tamariki, he said. Though the Defence Force had been involved in early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"They've advised into programme development, particularly the residential component as to what sort of things are needed there, as have the police, as have many other community organisations that are doing some good work in that space."</p>
