            <p>Ministers have announced an extension to New Zealand's deployment of Defence Force personnel in the Red Sea, which had been due to end this month.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Defence Minister Judith Collins and Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced New Zealand's six personnel deployed to the US-led coalition working to uphold maritime security in the Red Sea would be extended to 31 January next year.</p>
        
            <p>The deployment - to the coalition's headquarters - aimed to strike against Houthi military targets that had attacked commercial and naval vessels, and had been expected to end on 31 July.</p>
        
            <p>The Houthis have claimed to be carrying out their activities in protest against the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the decision to extend the deployment was "reflective of the continued need to partner and act in line with New Zealand's values, something we have done regularly in support of Middle East maritime security".</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping "are illegal, against our values and continue to affect New Zealand's economy".</p>
        
            <p>"This decision demonstrates our support to the international rules-based system and freedom of navigation."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has contributed to international efforts to improve maritime security in the Middle East since the mid-1990s. There are currently up to 26 NZDF personnel deployed to various coalitions and commands in the region.</p>
