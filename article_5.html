            <p>New police commissioner Richard Chambers wants to reduce the size of the police executive - proposing to cut 17 roles in total.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said he "clearly signalled" his intent in November - when he was appointed - to restructure the "highest-ranking levels of our organisation".</p>
        
            <p>A consultation document includes disestablishing 37 executive and support service positions, as well as creating 20 new positions - a potential net reduction of 17 roles.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said he wanted to ensure the executive was "fit-for-purpose, provides strong, clear leadership to the frontline, and delivers on the priorities I have set".</p>
        
            <p>He reiterated his commitment to boosting the frontline, and said redundancy was "not available to constabulary employees."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers sent the proposal to affected staff on Tuesday, and feedback is open until 10 February.</p>
        
            <p>"All feedback will be reviewed and carefully considered before final decisions are made in late February," he said.</p>
