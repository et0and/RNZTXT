        <p>
The decision by Joe Biden to back out of the US presidential race shows Biden is able to put the good of the country above his own ego, says former NZ Labour Party leader Andrew Little. Audio

            <p>The decision by Joe Biden to back out of the US presidential race shows Biden is able to put the good of the country above his own ego, says former NZ Labour Party leader Andrew Little.</p>
        
            <p>Little was leader of the Labour Party from 2014 to 2017 and stepped down shortly before that year's election, with Jacinda Ardern taking on the role, and leading the party into government.</p>
        
            <p>His case has parallels with the US Presidential race, with current vice president Kamala Harris expected to contest the presidency after Biden announced earlier this week that he would not be in the race.</p>
        
            <p>Little resigned from politics after last year's general election, but told RNZ Nights he had been closely following the latest developments in the US presidential race.</p>
        
            <p>"How could you not? It's a fascinating, if somewhat disturbing, political environment there and the contest there at the moment is riveting."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were quite a few differences between the position Biden was in and his situation in 2017 - with Biden serving four years in the top job while Little was leader of the opposition - but they did have some things in common.</p>
        
            <p>"What is similar between what he has done and the situation I was in, was making the calculation about what was right for your party, but also about what your view over what is in the best interests of the country.</p>
        
            <p>"I was committed to our platform for the future of New Zealand and wanted it to be implemented. I had to think very carefully about what was going to happen and whether I was going to be the best person to front that, so that's what had to be weighed up. And Biden has got a whole lot of other issues going on too, he's had to weigh all those things up."</p>
        
            <p>He said Harris now had a big challenge ahead of her to gain the US presidency, but she now had a chance to reach the politically disenfranchised, and he was confident she could do it.</p>

            <p>Little told RNZ Nights that is was vital to have the self-belief and conviction that you were the right person for the top job in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to have an ego to be in politics. I think the challenge is making sure it doesn't get out of control and it doesn't distort your judgement.</p>
        
            <p>"But while ego is important, it can't be everything."</p>
        
            <p>He said while he was convinced he was the best person to take up the leadership of the party at the end of 2014, three years later he was getting the feedback that he just was not connecting with enough New Zealanders,</p>
        
            <p>"It is difficult, because in politics this all plays out in the glare of publicity.</p>
        
            <p>"But in the end, I had to be true to myself."</p>
        
            <p>Little said making that kind of judgement about yourself did not mean you were consigning yourself ot the dustbin of history.</p>
        
            <p>"I was still convinced that if I stepped aside and Jacinda stood up and formed a government, I would have a contribution to make. And I backed myself in any role she gave me."</p>
