            <p>Wellington City Council's chief financial officer Andrea Reeves says it is important the community are aware that both the sale and a partial sale of Wellington Airport are still on table.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the council voted against selling its airport shares and must now find a different way to pay for its long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>Following the vote, Wellington mayor Tory Whanau told the councillors there would have to be cuts to the council's capital programme.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff had warned in documents prior to the vote that if the council stopped the sale it would have to consider two scenarios.</p>
        
            <p>One would be almost doubling their debt ceiling from $272 million to $500m and cutting capital project spend by $400m; the other would be tripling the council's debt ceiling to $750m and slashing capital spend by $600m.</p>
        
            <p>City councillor Sarah Free, who supports the sale, asked if a partial sale option was still a consideration at a briefing on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said that would be confirmed in the new year, as councillors consider which options to put out for public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>She said it would still be stressed selling the shares was not the council's preferred option, and the reasons why, but it was important to highlight a full or partial sale of shares were still "reasonable options".</p>
        
            <p>The council's new Crown observer Lindsay Mckenzie starts work on Wednesday. He was not at the meeting, but told RNZ he sat in on some of it remotely.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, Finance Minister Nicola Willis said Wellington's council was a "shambles".</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and the thresholds for action against the city council.</p>
