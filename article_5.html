            <p>National MP Andrew Bayly has won Port Waikato's by-election, with NZ First's candidate - the only major party to contest the seat - conceding.</p>
        
            <p>With 100 percent of the vote counted, Bayly has won by a margin of 11,245 votes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First candidate Casey Costello, the only other major party candidate, had 2778 votes.</p>
        
            <p>Costello told RNZ on Saturday night that she concedes the race.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew it was a National stronghold but we weren't going to walk away.</p>
        
            <p>"We just think it is important for democracy that voters have some choice so we were committed to making sure that Port Waikato had a choice.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a great experience. The extra campaign, a lot more connections, a lot more people to talk to, a lot more door-knocking."</p>
        
            <p>The campaign has been great, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is my home town and I really wanted to make sure that I got to connect with as many people as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Bayly's win brings Nancy Lu into Parliament on the National Party list.</p>
        
            <p>Lu will be the 123rd MP, the most New Zealand has ever had in one Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Labour, the Greens and the ACT Party were not standing for the seat.</p>
        
            <p>A variety of small minor parties were also standing.</p>
        
            <p>Voting closed at 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>More than 12,000 people had turned out to vote with two hours to go before voting stations shut.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 37 voting places open for the by-election.</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission said the stations have been operating with no issues to report.</p>
        
            <p>The by-election was sparked by the death of ACT candidate Neil Christensen just before the general election on 14 October.</p>
        
            <p>The seat has long been a National Party stronghold. At number 15 on the party list, Bayly is an MP no matter what the results are today, as is Costello, who is number 3 on NZ First's list.</p>

            <p>Former Labour MP Sue Moroney said adding a few more MPs won't change too much.</p>
        
            <p>"Doesn't necessarily change the way in which Parliament operates. It simply changes the numbers available for voting and of course increases the cost to the taxpayer slightly.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's something that should be brought in mind when the new government thinks about how they address this for the future."</p>
        
            <p>There had been concerns over voter turnout, with public confusion over another election being held just six weeks after the general election.</p>
        
            <p>The official results, including special and overseas votes, will be released on 6 December.</p>
