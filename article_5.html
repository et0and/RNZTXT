        <h2>Child poverty rates stall, government misses targets</h2>
        <p>
There has been no significant change in the percentage of children living in poverty and the government has missed all its child poverty targets, new figures show.

            <p>There has been no significant change in the percentage of children living in poverty and the government has missed all its child poverty targets, new figures show.</p>
        
            <p>StatsNZ data released on Thursday showed the number of children living in material hardship grew from 144,100 (12.5 percent) in 2023 to 156,600 (13.4 percent) in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The number of children living in low income households also grew.</p>
        
            <p>StatsNZ said the increases across those measures were not statistically significant.</p>
        
            <p>But it confirmed the government missed its targets across the three primary measures of child poverty.</p>
        
            <p>The "true rate" of child poverty was somewhere between 11.7 and 13.7 percent, household financial statistics senior insights analyst Ryan Sutcliffe said.</p>
        
            <p>That level of uncertainty existed because just 19,000 of approximately 2 million households were surveyed. However the sample was designed so it was broadly representative of the country's demographic makeup, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Renters and homeowners were struggling to make ends meet with rising housing costs, the data showed.</p>
        
            <p>While the average household income increased 6.5 percent, it was not enough to keep up with rent and mortgage payments.</p>
        
            <p>A third of low-income households spent more than 40 percent of their income on housing.</p>
        
            <p>Across all households an average of $22.20 per $100 of income was spent on housing costs - up from $20.80 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Average rent payments jumped 9 percent from $427.20 in 2023 to $465.50 last year. More than half of renters felt their income was not enough, or only just enough, to meet their every day needs.</p>
        
            <p>For homeowners, mortgage payments also jumped nearly 9 percent, from $605.50 to $658.20.</p>
        
            <p>"Although incomes increased, these statistics show that people spent a higher proportion of their money on housing costs than they had in the past," household financial statistics spokesperson Chris Pooch said.</p>
        
            <p>"This creates further pressure on a household's budget, along with things like groceries and petrol getting more expensive over the same time period."</p>
