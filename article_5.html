            <p>Political parties are largely unfazed by the results of the latest 1 News Verian poll, which showed a slight boost for the government, but small dips for the opposition parties.</p>
        
            <p>The poll, which was captured between 15 and 19 June, was 1 News' first since the Budget, but governing parties have not experienced a significant bump in response.</p>
        
            <p>1 News' previous poll, conducted in April, showed New Zealand First dropping below the 5 percent threshold, and would have meant the opposition parties were able to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>But the latest poll has New Zealand First back above the threshold, and the coalition government able to hold on.</p>
        
            <p>The preferred prime minister stakes showed Labour leader Chris Hipkins gaining ground on Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>ACT party leader David Seymour said the poll was largely unchanged, and the government was putting its heads down and doing the work.</p>
        
            <p>"People are very focused on 'can I get to the next pay-day with my head above water, is it going to get better?' And right now you've got gloomy weather and a gloomy economy, and so as a result people are more focused on their own outlook rather than politics. Nonetheless, I'm a big believer that if you do the work, you get recognised."</p>
        
            <p>He said ACT was in a healthy position, and future polling may reflect recent ACT-led policies like the boost to Pharmac and the next phase of the Royal Commission into Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>He also said one of the most important things the government did in the Budget was the tax cuts, which do not kick in until the end of July.</p>
        
            <p>"When people finally see the tangible reward of keeping more of their own money after the government decided to take a slightly smaller slice for itself, then that's got to lift a bit of the winter gloom. But in the meantime it's head-down, bum-up, and grinding it through."</p>
        
            <p>Opposition parties were also not reading too much into the result.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the changes were within the margin of error, and was encouraged that Labour's support had increased since the election.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government would likely be disappointed it had not received a bigger post-Budget boost.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say the government threw everything they had at the Budget, and I think they'll be disappointed they haven't had a bigger lift in support as a result of the Budget. Really, they're polling at or below what they got on election day, and for a new government I think they'll find that pretty disappointing," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the polls often bounced around this soon after an election, and voters were unlikely to have changed their minds that quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"The work we have to do over the next two-and-a-half years is to make sure we're in a position to win at the next election," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said she was reluctant to read the tea leaves of one poll, but also the said the government was not seeing the post-Budget bump it may have liked.</p>
        
            <p>"That probably reflects the feeling and sentiment that we're hearing and seeing out there in the general public. Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have mobilised in a mass-movement in opposition to this government's archaic, anti-environment, anti-Māori, and anti-people agenda. So it's the role of the Greens and indeed all opposition parties to continue to fight this front."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick acknowledged the Greens have had a difficult year, and was encouraged the poll showed them with one extra seat.</p>
        
            <p>"One poll is just one poll, and I always say to look at the trends, but nonetheless we've been really forthright about the fact that it's obviously been a rough year. And what I am proud of is that we have a caucus that's remained focused on the issues that matter throughout that."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer did not believe the poll accurately captured support for her party.</p>
        
            <p>"If you remember Rawiri [Waititi] was never meant to get in, I was going to lose by heaps and we were never going to get six seats. I guess the frustration of these types of polls is that they don't accurately describe what's going on in Māori communities."</p>
        
            <p>Neither New Zealand First leader Winston Peters nor National leader Christopher Luxon were available for comment.</p>
