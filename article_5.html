            <p>Christopher Luxon has joined with Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in calling again for an end to the conflict in Gaza and voicing support for US President Joe Biden's ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>The three leaders jointly issued a statement on the need for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza and the risk of expanded conflict between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon and Israel.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders called the human suffering in Gaza "unacceptable" and the situation there "catastrophic."</p>
        
            <p>The statement condemned Hamas for the 7 October attacks in Israel but also listed concerns about the humanitarian toll in the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"Israel must listen to the concerns of the international community," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"The protection of civilians is paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas. It must end.</p>
        
            <p>"An immediate ceasefire is needed desperately."</p>
        
            <p>Biden has been meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week to push for his proposed peace deal.</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli prime minister faces increased pressure to end the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month.</p>
        
            <p>"We fully stand behind the comprehensive ceasefire deal, outlined by President Biden and endorsed by the UN Security Council," the leaders said.</p>
        
            <p>"We call on parties to the conflict to agree to the deal. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to working towards an irreversible path to achieving a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live securely within internationally recognised borders. This is the only realistic option to achieve a just and enduring peace."</p>
        
            <p>The leaders pointed to the escalation in fighting on the Lebanon border, warning "further hostilities put tens of thousands of civilians in Lebanon and Israel at risk".</p>
        
            <p>"We are gravely concerned about the prospect of further escalation across the region."</p>
        
            <p>The trio also previously spoke out in February against Israel expanding the conflict into Rafah and called for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire.</p>
