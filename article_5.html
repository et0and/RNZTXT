            <p>A rally and march led by Hīkoi mō te Tiriti will take place in Hastings on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi, making its way to Wellington protesting government policies including the Treaty Principles Bill, is due at Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi convoy will on Saturday make its way to the rally point from Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngāti Kahungunu.</p>
        
            <p>Another group of supporters has joined the main convoy, which travelled from Gisborne on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Hīkoi organisers are encouraging participants to make sure they enrol to vote in the next election.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi said if supporters were not enrolled to vote, nothing would change.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now 20 percent of the population - we are a million people in this country. That should translate into 19 to 20 seats. We should be determining who the government is every election - that's the strategy. Everybody on the Māori roll."</p>

            <p>Police reminded drivers to expect delays and congestion as Hastings prepared to host the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>About 10,000 people marched in Rotorua on Friday, and were addressed by Te Pāti co-leader Rawiri Waititi, who said there was strength in numbers.</p>
        
            <p>The lead convoy of about 300 to 400 people moved next to Heretaunga / Hastings, where they spent the night.</p>
        
            <p>A march will be held through the town on Saturday morning, beginning at the clock tower at 10am.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi will travel to Palmerston North on Saturday evening, and was expected in Wellington on Monday .</p>
