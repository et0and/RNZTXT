            <p>There has been no head of the public service for seven months, and RNZ understands there is now just one name lined up for the top job.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Brian Roche - a respected business executive and public servant - is tipped to be the next public service commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>It has been nearly 13 months since Peter Hughes announced his retirement from the commissioner role.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes had held various roles in the public service for 43 years - seven and a half as commissioner - when he finished in February.</p>
        
            <p>Since then Heather Baggott, one of two deputy commissioners, has been doing the job in an acting capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Roche has been a go-to over the years for successive governments when appointing chairs and commissioners for various senior roles.</p>
        
            <p>He was the inaugural chairman of both the Auckland Regional Transport Authority and the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>He has also held roles at Hawke's Bay District Health Board, and NZ Post's chief executive for seven years.</p>
        
            <p>He was recognised for his services to state and business with a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Most recently he led a group set up by the Labour-New Zealand First government in 2020 to support and improve the country's Covid-19 border security.</p>
        
            <p>Roche has been spotted at Parliament in recent weeks, heading to meetings in the Beehive.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage a Cabinet paper has not been taken to ministers for final sign-off, meaning the appointment has not yet been locked in.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked Roche if he was the main contender for the job, he responded saying he did not have anything to add, and as he understood it "the process is ongoing".</p>
        
            <p>Other senior public servants and business leaders were shortlisted for the commissioner role, but RNZ understands the coalition government could not get consensus from all three governing parties on them.</p>
        
            <p>Former chief executive at the Ministry of Social Development Brendan Boyle, former Worksafe interim chief executive Steve Haszard and former Secretary of Defence Andrew Bridgeman were all considered as part of the process.</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Minister Nicola Willis told RNZ the appointment process was still ongoing and announcements will be made when it was complete.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked the prime minister two weeks ago if he would like a public service commissioner to be announced this month.</p>
        
            <p>He said: "We are working our way through that, so we'll have something to say about that hopefully shortly."</p>
