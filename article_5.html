            <p>Land Information New Zealand has proposed to make a net reduction of 57 jobs to meet the government's demands to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>The department in charge of handling land titles and managing Crown property has already disestablished 53 vacant positions, including leadership roles.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said it was currently consulting with staff over cutting another five jobs.</p>
        
            <p>They said since October 2023, contractor and consultant numbers have reduced and only high priority roles have been recruited for.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said discretionary spending such as travel, training and catering has been halved.</p>
        
            <p>LINZ has not called for voluntary redundancies.</p>
