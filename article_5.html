            <p>Joining the second pillar of the AUKUS agreement could blur the country's international brand, an Otago University International Relations professor says.</p>
        
            <p>Australian officials will travel to New Zealand to brief the government on the advanced technology phase of AUKUS, the security partnership between Australia, the US and UK.</p>
        
            <p>The deal will see Australia eventually supplied with nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Robert Patman told Morning Report the nuclear nature of the agreement could look like a back-tracking of New Zealand's commitment to a nuclear-free country.</p>
        
            <p>"While New Zealand may say it's staying absolutely true to its non-nuclear security approach, nevertheless, pillar two is part of an agreement in which nuclear powered submarines are being transferred to Australia," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The second pillar of the agreement aims to rapidly develop advanced military technology including drones.</p>
        
            <p>The UK has stressed the need for speed. The core AUKUS partners - the US, UK and Australia - have talked up the threat of China.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Defence Force has just done a multi-million-dollar deal for dozens of new, much more high-tech drones, some able to help artillery target the enemy.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins has been in Melbourne this week to meet with her Australian counterpart, discussing the prospect of joining the non-nuclear part of the deal.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said New Zealand still needed to work out what it could add to the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Patman said the move could be a diplomatic blow to the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Our brand globally, since 1985, has been to champion non-nuclear security," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would look like New Zealand is back-tracking..."</p>
        
            <p>Patman said the move could look to other countries in the Indo-Pacific as though New Zealand was retreating to a tight alliance of english speaking countries.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a momentus decision for this country going forward," he said.</p>
