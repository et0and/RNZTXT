            <p>Talks are continuing with New Zealand's Five Eyes partners about if and when they will share details of their citizens' criminal offending.</p>
        
            <p>The Migration 5 countries - New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the US and Britain - already work together on border policies, migrant data-sharing and technology.</p>
        
            <p>The Criminal Database Checking group is due to meet online again at the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>Data released under the Official Information Act showed it had eight online meetings last year, and its first face-to-face meeting in March, in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand currently chairs Migration 5.</p>
        
            <p>The group shares details of migrants' travel records and visas, but at present, not their own citizens' data.</p>
        
            <p>A recent document request in the UK confirms the group was already sharing data on citizens of other M5 countries when they apply for visas.</p>
        
            <p>"The bilateral arrangements for fingerprint checking with all M5 partners enable the sharing of information about all third country nationals. Therefore, if a fingerprint match is found to a national of Australia, Canada or New Zealand the biometric transaction history and biographic immigration history of that individual will be shared with the US."</p>
        
            <p>It means a New Zealander for example travelling to Canada can have information provided by Australia, the US and Britain to Canada.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand does not ask who each country on-shares the information with, nor do the agreements with M5 partners require them to say.</p>
        
            <p>The UK said Migration 5 had no current plans to create a "Single Window" system enabling member countries to directly access each other's immigration data.</p>
