        <h2>New Auckland training facility hoped to boost police recruit numbers</h2>
        <p>
Recruits in the Auckland wing would be able to stay at their own home during training, rather than spending months in Porirua.

            <p>Police say a training facility for new recruits in Auckland will open this year.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said the extra training facility, alongside the Police College in Porirua, was a step towards delivering on a target of 500 extra officers.</p>
        
            <p>He made the announcement after running in Auckland's Round the Bays run on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a training wing open in Auckland is an important part of our plan," he said. "We know that being away from home for 20 weeks has been a deterrent for many people wanting to join police."</p>
        
            <p>Police had been working to reduce the time between applying for a role and entering recruit training.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said the Auckland base should speed things up further.</p>
        
            <p>People in the Auckland wing would be able to stay at their own home during training.</p>
        
            <p>From Monday, recruits will have the option of selecting Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the number of police graduates had been hit by an increase in the length of training introduced in early 2024.</p>
        
            <p>From July to December 2024, police received 5277 applications - more than double the same period for 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Police Minister Casey Costello said it was hoped the Auckland centre would attract new officers from the country's largest city and supplement work in the Police College.</p>
        
            <p>"We want police to do all that they can to drive recruitment, increase the number of police and to make our communities safer and that's exactly what they're doing."</p>
