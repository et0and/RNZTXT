        <h2>'Horrific': Luxon lashes Health NZ over mistaken identity</h2>
        <p>
An 11-year-old was taken to a mental health facility after being mistaken for a 20-year-old. The PM wants to know why it took two weeks to tell the minister.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described the case of an 11-year-old being mistaken as a 20-year-old and put in a mental health unit as "extremely distressing" and wants to know why officials took two weeks to tell the minister in charge.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ has apologised after an was mistaken for a 20-year-old woman by police officers and admitted to a mental health facility. The girl was handcuffed by police.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported the girl was autistic and non-verbal, and injected with medication at the hospital. Te Whatu Ora said a review would be carried out to see if any medication had been given to the girl.</p>
        
            <p>"As a parent, you identify with what is a horrific set of circumstances ... it's just incredibly distressing and concerning," Luxon told reporters at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Massive amounts of empathy and concern for her and her family."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was unacceptable that Health NZ took two weeks before informing the minister.</p>

            <p>"There's now an inquiry under way, I know it's got the full attention of Simeon Brown, he's all over it."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether heads should roll, Luxon said: "By all means, there should be accountability in the system."</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey said the first he became aware of the incident was on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed I wasn't informed until late in the piece," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've made my expectation very clear that there needs to be a serious incident review [and] that's under way now."</p>
        
            <p>He said when there was a serious incident his expectation is that as the Mental Health Minister he would be informed.</p>
        
            <p>"They explained to me that under normal protocol I should have been informed and the person who was responsible for doing that failed to inform my office."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said what had happened to the 11-year-old girl was "hugely concerning".</p>
        
            <p>"It's every parent's worst nightmare."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he would not be politicising the case as the government-of-the-day is not responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clearly a major mistake ... this could've happened under any government," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's utterly unacceptable, and I do think they need to get the bottom of exactly what happened as quickly as they can and provide some reassurance to the New Zealand public that this won't happen again."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said it was "very concerning" that ministers were not advised by their officials more promptly.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd be having some very stern words with a range of government departments, be pulling them all in actually to find out exactly how this happened."</p>
