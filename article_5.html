        <h2>Live: Treaty Principles Bill debate will be divisive - Luxon</h2>
        <p>
Meanwhile, Nicola Willis says the introduction to Parliament is as far as National's commitment to the ACT Party legislation goes.

            <p>Following Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's speech at Koroneihana at T큰rangawaewae marae in Ng훮ruaw훮hia on Monday and the likelihood the Treaty Principles Bill is dead in the water, the government's relationship with M훮ori is once again in focus.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after coalition partner ACT wasn't invited to attend Koroneihana.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis told First Up New Zealanders were intelligent enough to understand that MMP governments required compromise.</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition agreement reflects a compromise which was not to agree to pass that law or make that law, but instead to allow that bill to have a hearing through a first reading and select committee process which falls way short of it becoming law."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the government's changes to emergency housing rules.</p>
