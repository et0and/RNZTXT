        <h2>Avondale community group to engage Racing Minister over local racecourse housing plans</h2>
        <p>
In March last year the 135-year-old racecourse moved to change the entire 35 hectares to a terrace and apartment buildings zone under Council's PC78 Intensification process.

There were four people who spoke on behalf of the community group I Love Avondale, raising concerns around the cultural, environment and social impacts the loss the area could have.

            <p>An Auckland community group say they're taking their push to protect Avondale Racecourse land to Parliament, as they look to maintain a community green space.</p>
        
            <p>The I Love Avondale team presented to Auckland Council's policy and planning committee on Thursday in front of a packed public gallery, raising concerns about potential development of the entire piece of land.</p>
        
            <p>In March last year the Avondale Jockey club, who own the 135-year-old racecourse, moved to change the entire 35 hectares to a terrace and apartment buildings zone under Council's PC78 Intensification process.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, locals said the Avondale Jockey club's plans caught them unaware.</p>
        
            <p>More than 20,000 attend the Avondale Markets every Sunday which has been held since the 1970s, while the land is also leased by Auckland Council every year for local sports clubs.</p>
        
            <p>There were four people who spoke on behalf of the community group, raising concerns around the cultural, environment and social impacts the loss the area could have.</p>
        
            <p>I Love Avondale's team leader Jaclyn Bonnici said she was encouraged by the response from councillors.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we got our main points across well and now I look forward to the next steps," Bonnici said.</p>
        
            <p>Those next steps include taking the issue to Parliament and the Racing Minister Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"We have always intended to speak with the Minister and engage with central government, but as representatives of Tāmaki Makaurau we thought it best to come to our council first.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually find our local and council look to people to inform them and so then we can mobilise together.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly, we will be going next to Wellington," Bonnici said.</p>
        
            <p>I Love Avondale said they're not against the land being developed for housing, but it was important to define "for who and by who" this housing would be for.</p>
        
            <p>"More than the fear of the loss, we're trying to focus on the ambition and opportunity of what could be possible for a regional park of the scale in terms of urban ngahere (bush), markets and high-quality housing," Bonnici said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sports fields, we need to own them, it's ridiculous that Auckland Council have been paying year on year for those sports fields, they should be in community ownership, it should be a fully community owned asset.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just another beginning, hopefully a few more ears have opened and hopefully a few more doors for people to take us seriously as a united front," Bonnici said.</p>
