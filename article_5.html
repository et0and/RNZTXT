            <p>Dwindling food supplies and the inability to get to the airport are the main concerns for two New Zealanders stranded in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>Five people are now dead after officials confirmed the death of a second police officer. Although RNZ Pacific understands it was an accidental killing which occurred as troops were preparing to leave the barracks.</p>
        
            <p>France has said it would send an additional 1000 security personnel to the French territory where deadly riots erupted in protest of voting reforms.</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency was declared on the island, at least 10 people were under house arrest, and TikTok has been banned.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific said there were food and fuel shortages as well as problems accessing medications and healthcare services.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington researcher Barbara Graham had been in Nouméa for five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>She said many New Zealanders were booked on a flight due to leave Saturday, although they were not convinced it would be able to depart, or that they could get to the airport.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is that its quite unlikely that that flight would go. So we're all looking into other options, later flights.</p>
        
            <p>"The main issue really is not the flight...it's the road to the airport that is and I understand it still impassable because of the danger there, the roadblocks and the violent groups of people."</p>
        
            <p>Airlines were looking to taking bigger planes to get more people out and were working with the airport to ensure the ground crew were also available, Graham said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was reasonably separate from the violence but had seen the devastation when moving accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonian Emma Royland was staying at the University of New Caledonia and hoped to wait out the civil unrest, if she could procure enough food.</p>
        
            <p>"Ideally the university will step in to take care of us, ideally although we must admit that the university themselves are also under a lot of hardship and they also will be having difficulties sourcing the food."</p>
        
            <p>The couple of hundred students at the university were provided with instant noodles, chips and biscuits, Royland said.</p>
        
            <p>She went into town to try and find food but there were shortages and long queues, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably is one of my biggest concerns is actually being able to get into the city, as I stand here I can see the smoke obscuring the city from last nights riots and it is a very big concern of being able to get that food, that would be the only reason that I would have to leave New Caledonia."</p>
        
            <p>The Government was considering all possibilities to help New Zealanders stranded in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters told Morning Report it was a fluid and alarming situation and government officials had been working on an "hourly basis" to see what could be done to help New Zealanders wanting to leave.</p>
        
            <p>That included the Airforce or using a commercial airline.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Government is doing all it can to ensure that if we can help, we will."</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 New Zealanders were registered as being in the country, his advice to them was to stay in place and keep in contact.</p>
        
            <p>Peters was in Tuvalu, he cancelled his stop in New Caledonia due to the civil unrest.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade representatives had been in contact with Nouméa and Paris but it was not for New Zealand to intervene in the situation, Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he, and other Pacific leaders, wanted a peaceful resolution now.</p>
        
            <p>"This is time now for caution and wisdom and to ensure that the alarming circumstances that could potentially develop from here don't get totally out of hand.</p>
        
            <p>"The arguments and debates and the criticisms can come later, but right here right now it's people and their security that we're concerned about."</p>
