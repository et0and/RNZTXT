        <h2>Minister unveils details of long-promised speed camera signs</h2>
        <p>
The AA says the sign rollout is a win-win as the minister announces the details of the change.
</p>
        
            <p>The Automobile Association (AA) says the long-promised rollout of new speed camera signs for Northland and Auckland in the coming weeks is a win-win for everybody.</p>
        
            <p>The operation of over 100 fixed speed cameras across the country will transfer from police to NZTA in the coming year, and each will get a warning sign, starting with those in the north.</p>
        
            <p>"Providing Kiwis with an opportunity to check their speed and slow down in high-crash areas where speed cameras are located will avoid speeding tickets and the more tragic consequences of speeding," Transport Minister Simeon Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Speed cameras should be about improving safety, not raising revenue. And that's why they should be sign-posted so Kiwis have a fair warning to slow down and avoid a ticket. It's the right thing to do."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said more cameras would also be rolled out over time.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's another 50 camera sites being installed which will increase the number to about 150, and each one of them will be signposted, whether that's a fixed camera like this or whether it's the point-to-point cameras that are also being installed in some areas of the country as well."</p>
        
            <p>The other part of the changes was the NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi taking over the speed camera systems from the police.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the transfer would cost a total of about $100m.</p>
        
            <p>"About $100 million dollars, it's a major tech upgrade, that includes new cameras, that includes the signage obviously, it also includes some infrastructure upgrades around those cameras as well."</p>
        
            <p>AA says the signs will get drivers checking their speeds, improve road safety overall and help people avoid speeding tickets.</p>
        
            <p>The association said the government is making good on a promise made by Labour while in office more than five years ago. No new warning signs at all had been installed since the promise was made in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"We're only talking about permanent speed cameras here, so those are the ones that you know are in place at all times. We're not talking about mobile cameras. They will continue to operate without signs," spokesperson Dylan Thomsen told Morning Report.</p>

            <p>"But by 12 months' time, the middle of next year, all about 100 permanent speed cameras in New Zealand are going to have some white signs with a camera image on them saying 'safety camera area'. when you're approaching a camera, we think that's going to be a really good change."</p>
        
            <p>Mobile speed cameras will remain sign-free.</p>
        
            <p>Fines collected from fixed speed cameras in recent years has been lower than before Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>Thomsen said the evidence was that sign-posted cameras did collect less revenue than those without signs - but also big reductions in speeding.</p>
        
            <p>"It is going to give people the opportunity to check their speed. It's basically going to give them an incentive to check their speed and if they need to slow down - and we've seen some really good evidence to show that what that means is we actually see a big reduction in people speeding at those permanent camera sites, which are high-risk locations."</p>

            <p>He said while there would be some drivers who only slow down to get past the camera without being ticketed and then speed up again, most were trying to stick to the limit and would appreciate the reminder to slow down so they could avoid a ticket.</p>
        
            <p>"These are high-risk locations with a history of crashes, so we want more people to be travelling at a safe speed in those locations, and I don't think for a lot of people it's going to mean that they just use them to slow down and then speed up again."</p>
        
            <p>A trial in Northland saw tickets reduced by more than 50 percent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the rollout would be complete by June 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government is focused on improving road safety by deterring those breaking the law and targeting the highest contributing factors to fatal road crashes, including alcohol and drugs."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA's plan was to dramatically increase the number of fixed speed cameras to around 800 over the coming years, but that has since been put in doubt.</p>
        
            <p>The latest moves comes amid moves from the government to remove blanket speed limits imposed by councils, which some councils have rejected, citing safety improvements.</p>
