        <h2>Widespread disruption expected when hīkoi reaches capital</h2>
        <p>
Wellingtonians are being asked to plan ahead, while the PM says he'll "wait and see" as to whether he meets hīkoi participants.

            <p>The hīkoi against the Treaty Principles Bill could be one of the largest rallies that the capital has seen for years, Wellington City Council says.</p>
        
            <p>The Hīkoi mō te Tiriti will arrive in Wellington on Tuesday, and locals are being warned to expect disruption and plan ahead.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, about 5000 people filled the square in Palmerston North before the convoy headed south, stopping for a rally in Levin.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of supporters were then welcomed at Takapūwāhia Marae, in Porirua, north of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>They would have a rest day in Porirua on Monday before gathering at Wellington's Waitangi Park on Tuesday morning, and converging on Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"There is likely to be some disruption to roads and highways," the council said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Please plan ahead if travelling by road or rail on Tuesday 19 November as delays are possible."</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi would start at 6am, travelling from Porirua to Waitangi Park, where it would arrive at 9am.</p>
        
            <p>It would then depart the park at 10am, travelling along the Golden Mile to Parliament, where it would arrive at midday.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi would return to Waitangi Park at 4pm for a concert, karakia, and farewell.</p>
        
            <p>State Highways 1 and 2 were expected to be busier than normal.</p>
        
            <p>Police said no significant issues had been reported as a result of the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>A traffic management plan would be in place for its arrival into Wellington, with heavier than usual traffic anticipated, particularly in the Hutt Valley early Tuesday morning, and on SH2 between Lower Hutt and Wellington city.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone living or working in the city should plan accordingly, Wellington District Commander Superintendent Corrie Parnell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have been working closely with iwi and hīkoi organisers, and our engagement has been positive.</p>
        
            <p>"The event as it has moved down the country has been conducted peacefully, and we have every reason to believe this will continue.</p>
        
            <p>"In saying that, disruption is expected through the city centre as the hīkoi makes its way from Waitangi Park to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"We've planned ahead with NZTA, Wellington City Council, Greater Wellington Regional Council, local schools, retailers and other stakeholders to mitigate this as best possible, but Wellingtonians should be prepared for Tuesday to look a little different."</p>

            <p>Wellington Station bus hub would be closed, with buses diverted to nearby locations.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink had also added extra capacity to trains outside of peak times (9am-3pm).</p>
        
            <p>Parking was expected to be extremely difficult to come by on Tuesday, especially around the bus hub, Lambton Quay and Parliament grounds, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians were being to exercise patience, particularly on busy roads, Parnell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask you to allow more time than normal to get where you are going. Plan ahead by looking at how road closures and public transport changes might affect you, and expect that there will be delays at some point throughout the day."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was playing his approach to the hīkoi by ear.</p>
        
            <p>He has been at his first APEC meeting in Peru, but would arrive back in New Zealand on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>He was open to speaking with members of the hīkoi on Tuesday, but no plans had been made as yet, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't made a decision. We'll wait and see, but I'm very open to meeting, in some form or another.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously building as it walks through the country and gets to Wellington, and we'll just wait and see and take it as it comes."</p>
