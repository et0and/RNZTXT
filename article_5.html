            <p>New Zealand is boosting the number of its troops stationed in the Republic of Korea as part of the United Nations Command.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) is sending up to 41 more personnel - to join the 12 already there - and has extended its deployment until September 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Six of the new roles will join the United Nation's Honour Guard - with the rest joining the security battalion operating in the Korean Demilitarised Zone.</p>
        
            <p>They will work alongside military from other nations, including the Republic of Korea, the US, Australia, Canada, the UK and the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>"Substantially increasing the size of our deployment to the Republic of Korea reflects the importance New Zealand places on collective security efforts that support peace and stability and the international rules-based system in the Indo-Pacific region, and on the Korean Peninsula in particular," Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins said the deployment would help support peace and stability in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"This deployment is an excellent opportunity for our NZDF personnel to utilise their skills, leadership and experience in a multinational environment."</p>
        
            <p>Last month the government extended Defence Force deployments to Africa and the Middle East, including supporting United Nations efforts on contested Israel and Arab country borders.</p>
