        <p>
Hipkins used his first speech of the 54th Parliament to accuse the new government of "trashing" NZ's reputation, while Luxon called him an "arsonist".

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has used his first speech of the 54th Parliament to accuse the new government of "trashing New Zealand's international reputation" by adopting Covid-19 conspiracies as policies.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wondered why the Labour caucus had not rolled Hipkins, saying he squandered the party's historic 2020 majority.</p>
        
            <p>The party leaders on Wednesday squared off in the House for the first time in the new term, with the Address in Reply debate to the Speech from the Throne.</p>
        
            <p>The speech, delivered by the governor-general on Wednesday morning, set out the government's priorities. Parties were invited to respond, but usually used it as an opportunity to trade barbs.</p>
        
            <p>While Hipkins and Luxon frequently faced off last term, they now sat in different seats.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking first, Hipkins spoke of the drawn-out process to form the coalition government, as well as the move to roll back anti-smoking legislation which had made international headlines.</p>
        
            <p>"This could well be the most shambolic beginning of any government in New Zealand's history," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins accused the government of leaning on plans to repeal, replace and disestablish laws, instead of focusing on taking New Zealand forward.</p>
        
            <p>He further said the government had taken a "massive step backwards" by questioning the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
        
            <p>"I say to the members opposite who have pledged to end all Covid-19 mandates, can they name one that's still in place? Can they name one? I hear crickets on the Treasury benches, speaker, because there aren't any. They want to buy into the conspiracy theorists' view."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the new government would send New Zealand backwards on issues of climate change, gender diversity and workers' rights.</p>
        
            <p>"We leave government proud of our track record, committed to holding the incoming government to account, concerned about the direction that they are taking New Zealand in, which is backwards on all of the important measures that should be important to New Zealand's future, and absolutely resolved that for the first time in New Zealand's history, this will be a one-term National government."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon meanwhile said New Zealand was "under new management," prompting applause from his side of the House.</p>

            <p>"Just like there are laws of nature, and just like there are laws of physics, there are laws of politics. Because if you want lower taxes, you vote for us. If you want the government books managed well, you vote for us. And if you want to create more opportunities for everyone, you vote for us."</p>
        
            <p>Describing Hipkins as "bitter, twisted, and negative," Luxon attacked Labour for failing to set up a political dynasty.</p>
        
            <p>"No reason they shouldn't have been in power for 10 or 12 years, they didn't make it. They squandered the opportunity that they got."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon described Hipkins as an arsonist continuing to loiter around the scene of the crime, with the rest of the caucus having survivors' guilt.</p>
        
            <p>"How has he survived, when nearly half of his caucus lost their jobs under his leadership? Why is he still here?"</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the public voted Labour out because it prioritised ideology over New Zealand's interests.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour earned its loss, it worked hard for it. Labour wasted time, they squandered public money, and they made this great country and its people miss out on opportunities."</p>

            <p>Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said the National and Labour leaders spent more time on the campaign telling people who not to vote for, than they did talking about the future.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson celebrated the growth of the Greens' caucus, including victories in the seats of Wellington Central and Rongotai, and told the coalition leaders to reflect on their journeys to work.</p>
        
            <p>"There is not a street, not a single street, from here to the airport that is not represented by a proud Green MP."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the Speech from the Throne was a "random, visionless, and harmful grab-bag of laws" that were more about pet projects and petty grievances.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to give it everything that we've got, absolutely everything, because everything that a government does is a matter of political choice."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson was one of the first to fall afoul of the new speaker's chair, with Winston Peters raising a point of order after she called him "Uncle Winston."</p>
        
            <p>Peters, asking the speaker to correct the record, said "that relationship is not true, and it's obvious from the speech it's not true. I am not her uncle."</p>
        
            <p>Proclaiming "New Zealand First is back," Peters did not appear to refer to any notes during his speech, which he used to attack the left and the media.</p>
        
            <p>He bemoaned the lack of coverage he got, in contrast to coverage the Greens' received.</p>
        
            <p>"They go down to the beach, get a few starfish and then they're headlining the 6pm news," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, he said there was no coverage of his public meetings.</p>
        
            <p>"Do you think that's fair? They said 'We sent somebody'. No, you didn't."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ covered a number of New Zealand First's public meetings.</p>

            <p>Peters also took aim at Te Pāti Māori, saying co-leader Rawiri Waititi was "so decolonised he wears a cowboy hat".</p>
        
            <p>He rejected Te Pāti Māori's claims of racism against New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of us have done far more for Māoridom than you will ever do."</p>
        
            <p>Waititi sparred back at the veteran.</p>
        
            <p>"You're going to see this moko and this hat for a long, long time Winston, so you better get used to it."</p>
        
            <p>The government was taking its policies back to the 19th century, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This government has opened the floodgates of hatred towards Māori."</p>
        
            <p>His co-leader, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, said the government's attacks on Māori had only encouraged them to unite.</p>
        
            <p>"Your attacks on our culture has motivated our standing and our solidarity for ourselves. Your calls to take us back have been a drive to advance."</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said the new government was "clumsily coming through" and pretending it knew what was best for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not be bullied or stood over by men on that side of the House, who embarrass themselves, who ridicule our culture. I wish you healing."</p>
        
            <p>She also sarcastically congratulated the government for being awarded Fossil of the Day at COP28.</p>
        
            <p>"How awesome are you guys?"</p>
        
            <p>Like Christopher Luxon, ACT leader David Seymour singled out Chris Hipkins and Grant Robertson for criticism in his speech.</p>
        
            <p>"They had no idea how to transform an economy, but they inadvertently transformed it to have some of the highest inflation in living memory."</p>
        
            <p>He also took aim at Labour's depleted caucus.</p>
        
            <p>"They return today so run down and clapped-out, that if this Labour Party was a used car it would be illegal to import them to New Zealand. They just don't go anymore."</p>
