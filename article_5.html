            <p>Social Investment Minister Nicola Willis has announced the members of the Social Investment Board, who will provide advice on the Social Investment approach.</p>
        
            <p>It aims at using data, analytics and evidence to figure out the best way of intervening early in the lives of society's most vulnerable, and thereby also reducing the burden on the taxpayer.</p>
        
            <p>A Cabinet paper from May reveals Willis planned the board to be a Ministerial Advisory Group reporting directly to her, replacing the former Social Wellbeing Board made up of chief executives across several government departments and agencies.</p>
        
            <p>They would not be responsible for developing policy or implementing initiatives, instead offering feedback to the Social Investment Agency and other government bodies on proposals, and offering advice to ministers.</p>
        
            <p>The Agency has been powered up again after being scaled back and renamed as the Social Wellbeing Agency under the previous Labour government, and is set to be led by outgoing Police Commissioner Andrew Coster.</p>
        
            <p>The board members were proposed to be paid in line with the Cabinet Fees Framework: between $319 and $616 a day, with the Chair paid between $429 and $974 a day.</p>
        
            <p>Terms of Reference for the board show that between them, they must have a broad range of knowledge and skills including on social investment, public finance, commissioning models, social sciences, data and evidence, how to contract for social outcomes, connection with or experience of vulnerable communities, Te Tiriti o Waitangi and knowledge of mātauranga Māori.</p>
        
            <p>They will be led by Dr Graham Scott, who was Treasury Secretary from 1986 to 1993 and headed the Health Funding Authority and Central Region Health Authority, and stood unsuccessfully on the ACT Party's list in 2005.</p>
        
            <p>The following information was provided in a government media release:</p>
        
            <p>Dr Graham Scott - Wellington</p>
