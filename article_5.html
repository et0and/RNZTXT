        <h2>ACT wants police recruits to have wider religious options</h2>
        <p>
Asking graduates to choose between an oath of allegiance or an affirmation is out of step with a modern, multicultural police force, the party says.

            <p>ACT's ethnic communities spokesperson and Indian-origin list MP Parmjeet Parmar has asked the government to give Royal New Zealand Police College graduates greater choice in terms of the religious texts they use when taking their oaths.</p>
        
            <p>"Under current legislation, the option of taking an oath on a religious text is only available for those willing to swear on a Bible," Parmar said in a letter to Police Minister Mark Mitchell dated 30 July. "This seems inconsistent with the multicultural makeup of the modern police force."</p>
        
            <p>Parmar said multiple options existed for the chosen book of scripture when swearing an oath in Parliament or the judiciary.</p>
        
            <p>"Former judge Ajit Swaran Singh took his oath on the Sikh holy book when he was appointed to Manukau District Court in 2002," Parmar said Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>According to the rules of Parliament, new MPs must be sworn in before they can speak, sit, vote or serve in select committees.</p>
        
            <p>"An MP can be sworn in by either taking an oath of allegiance or an affirmation," according to guidance on the New Zealand Parliament website. "Those taking the oath can do so while holding a Bible or other holy book, or in any other way they declare to be binding on them."</p>
        
            <p>Former Labour MP Ashraf Choudhary took an oath on the Qur'an - Islam's holy book - in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>"I am aware of cases where [police] graduates have requested to take the oath on an alternative religious text, but were instructed they must instead take the standard constable's affirmation," Parmar said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is safe to assume many more graduates would take up the opportunity to swear on a religious text relevant to their faith if they were given the opportunity," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have drafted a bill to extend the available religious texts to include the Bible, New Testament, Old Testament, Gita, Gutka Sahib, Qur'an and others," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have requested this be adopted by the government to avoid the delays and uncertainty associated with a member's ballot process."</p>
        
            <p>Police told ACT MP Todd Stephenson earlier this year they had received at least one request to take an oath on a religious text other than the Bible every year.</p>
        
            <p>"Our practice is that there are two options for graduating recruits to choose from: they can choose to swear the constable's oath on a Bible, or they can take the constable's affirmation," said Nessa Lynch, then-academic director of the Royal New Zealand Police College.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had one such request in 2023 and an average of one per year in previous years. These graduating recruits have taken the constable's affirmation."</p>
        
            <p>Police have promised to review the procedures surrounding oaths and affirmations, ensuring all legislative requirements were met.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not yet have a firm date for when this review will be concluded," Lynch said in January.</p>
        
            <p>Parmar said legislation was needed to resolve the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"While [the proposed amendment] would only be a minor change, the issue is of greater importance right now as the government seeks to boost police recruitment," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Considering the recent decision to open police recruitment to residence visa holders, which has the potential to draw recruits from different faiths, ... the current rules for oaths risk sending an unwelcoming message."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell told RNZ he would consider the proposal after he returned from an overseas trip next week.</p>
