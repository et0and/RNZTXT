            <p>David Seymour's hapū, Ngāti Rēhia, has formally requested he not attend Waitangi commemorations in Northland, due to his ongoing support of the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter sent to the ACT Party Leader on Tuesday, Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Rēhia chairperson William Skipper (Kipa) Munro, said the bill has been highly contentious, divisive and is seen by many as a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi itself.</p>
        
            <p>The letter continued to say Waitangi was a special time of year for the iwi of Te Tai Tokerau and that the mana of Te Tiriti and rights of te iwi Māori were being threatened due to Seymour's bill.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation - which aimed to redefine the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and enshrine them in law - has attracted widespread opposition and criticism.</p>
        
            <p>Tens of thousands of people marched against the bill last year, resulting in what was believed to be the biggest protest to ever arrive at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Your hapū have supported your attendance at Waitangi in the past but, with respect, our advice this year is that while this bill is still being progressed and you are still actively supporting it, we do not believe it would be an appropriate decision to attend Waitangi." the letter said.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has whakapapa links to the Ngāpuhi hapū, Ngāti Rēhia, through his mother.</p>
        
            <p>At Waitangi commemorations in 2023, hapū members supported Seymour with a waiata tautoko after he stood to speak and recited his pepeha.</p>
        
            <p>But, at Waitangi last year protesters attempted to drown out Seymour with waiata as he spoke.</p>
        
            <p>"While it will ultimately be the decision of the taumata on the day as to how best to uphold the operations of our tikanga, it is our responsibility to tender our advice and suggest you might consider celebrating the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi at a different venue this year."</p>
        
            <p>"We have written to you previously with our concerns and to ensure you are aware that your hapū do not support your actions. Unfortunately, our concerns have not changed your views and position on this take (topic)." the letter said.</p>
        
            <p>The hapū asked Seymour to consider putting the concerns of his hapū at the forefront, "while making your decision around attendance this year."</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions from RNZ, Seymour confirmed he would attend Waitangi to celebrate the signing of the Treaty and take part in discussion of what it means for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be attending as a member of the government, which is obliged to serve all New Zealanders equally.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be wrong to say I was attending on behalf of one hapū. By the same token, I wouldn't not attend due to one hapū."</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Rēhia had Seymour's personal number, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They could easily have picked up the phone regarding these concerns but instead chose to write a letter that almost immediately ended up in the media. That is very disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"What has caused division is successive governments treating New Zealanders based on their ethnicity, which is the problem the Treaty Principles Bill seeks to solve."</p>
        
            <p>Late last year Christopher Luxon announced he turned down the opportunity to join the national Waitangi events in Paihia.</p>
        
            <p>His decision was met with mixed emotions from Māori, with some calling it a missed opportunity, and others pleased.</p>
