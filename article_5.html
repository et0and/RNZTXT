        <h2>Darleen Tana saga set to loom as Green Party meets</h2>
        <p>
A Green Party member is concerned that proper process will not be followed - but the party's co-leader says a vote will not be forced.

            <p>Green Party members are gathering in Christchurch this weekend for the party's annual general meeting, with the fate of former MP Darleen Tana set to play a big part in the agenda.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was ousted by the Greens and asked to quit politics altogether this month after an independent investigation found the MP likely knew about allegations of worker exploitation at husband Christian Hoff-Nielsen's business, and did not disclose them to the party until after last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>But while the issue of whether to use the party-hopping legislation to remove Tana from Parliament would be discussed at the AGM on Saturday, co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said a vote would not be forced.</p>
        
            <p>Despite swallowing a dead rat and voting for the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act in 2018, the Greens have long made their opposition to the legislation clear.</p>
        
            <p>However, with Tana determined to stay in Parliament, and the Greens' proportionality now affected, Swarbrick said the party would now formally explore other avenues at the AGM.</p>
        
            <p>"We are opening discussions this weekend on this issue, and being really clear with our membership about where our Parliamentary caucus sits in terms of being clear about the fact that we do not believe that the behaviour that has been exhibited by Darleen Tana is something that reflects somebody who is fit to be a member of Parliament," Swarbrick said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really as simple as that. We're simply opening the discussion, and moving through democratically and deliberatively, what the next steps look like for us as a party."</p>
        
            <p>Any policy position the party takes always has to go to its wider membership. Green MPs have frequently touted the strength of the party's member-led decision-making, sometimes to the bemusement of outsiders. Former prime minister Dame Jacinda Ardern compared the Greens' processes to the TV show Squid Game at her valedictory speech in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>But a Green Party member who spoke to RNZ under the condition of anonymity was concerned that proper process was not being followed, and the Parliamentary wing of the party was directing members towards the outcome it wanted: to get rid of Tana.</p>
        
            <p>"It could very easily tear us into little factions and little pieces even further than we already are," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The member had concerns that the member-led decision-making process was being undermined.</p>
        
            <p>"Pressure gets put on in the way that things are phrased, in the way that communications go out, in the way that MPs talk about things in the media, in the way that options are presented to the party that makes the decision-making really difficult to do anything other than what has been put out as the default answer," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's being presented as a fait accompli, it's being presented as 'this is the only decision that can be made.'"</p>

            <p>Swarbrick maintained that the processes would be properly respected, and nobody would be pressured into any outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"We are but one element, the Parliamentary wing, of a far bigger activist movement. And I've said time and again that we would not entertain using that legislation or going to the point of the conclusion of that legislation, were it not to be with the endorsement of the party."</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's musterer (the Greens' equivalent of a whip) Ricardo Menéndez March said he expected the membership would be direct with MPs.</p>
        
            <p>"No doubt we'll be having robust conversations with members, and we will be led by members when it comes to decisions we take following the recent news that Darleen intends to remain in Parliament," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Green Party members have been discussing this issue for many years, and part of us being a democratic party is enabling our members to have space to have robust conversations."</p>
        
            <p>With co-leader Marama Davidson on leave while she undergoes treatment for breast cancer, Swarbrick will deliver the keynote speeches on both Saturday and Sunday, at her first AGM since becoming co-leader.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said she was in frequent contact with Davidson, and would take "her love for compassion and justice" into the AGM with her.</p>
        
            <p>She said her first speech would focus on the reality of what had been a tough year for the Greens, and where the party could go from here.</p>
        
            <p>Not only has there been the lingering issue of Tana, but also the resignation of Golriz Ghahraman, the retirement of James Shaw, and Julie Anne Genter's referral to the Privileges Committee. The circumstances of Elizabeth Kerekere's resignation in 2023 also remain a sore point with some parts of the membership, as does a feeling the Greens did not go hard or fast enough in government.</p>
        
            <p>The party was also rocked by the death of Faʻanānā Efeso Collins and Davidson's cancer diagnosis. Swarbrick said that despite the challenges, the caucus was "forged in fire" and unified.</p>

            <p>"I'll be making a speech which will reflect on our history, and be honest about the fact that we're presently going through some pretty interesting growing pains, and the fact that if we want to grow into our political ambitions. And that requires us reaching outside of ourselves, and getting uncomfortable and bringing in different perspectives, and making the space and time to move forward together and to grow our movement," Swarbrick said.</p>
        
            <p>Her Sunday speech would reflect on the more immediate and urgent climate and inequality challenges the country was facing, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I will be really clear about the immediate challenges we face with this government, and the absolute disregard for people and planet."</p>
        
            <p>As the first AGM of the new Parliamentary cycle, it is unlikely to come with significant new policy announcements, although Swarbrick said as a party full of "policy wonks" there would be policy discussions and strategy for opposition.</p>
        
            <p>There was also likely to be some constitutional crossing of t's and dotting of i's, and some preparation ahead of next year's local government elections.</p>
        
            <p>And, as with all Green AGMs, the co-leadership positions would go to a vote.</p>
        
            <p>When announcing her cancer diagnosis, Davidson said she would seek the support of delegates to retain her position.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens' constitution allows for nominations to be re-opened if at least 25 percent of votes choose that option.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick was confident she and Davidson would be re-confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"That would be my hope. But look, we're a democratic party, and 'stranger things', right?"</p>
