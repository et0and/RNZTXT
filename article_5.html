            <p>The first arrest was made just three minutes after the law came into effect on Thursday, with police reporting 12 people have been caught out on the first day of the new gang patch ban.</p>
        
            <p>The new law, which bans gang patches in public places, came into force just after midnight Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Paul Basham said there had been multiple arrests and charges in the first 24 hours of the ban, with Prime Minister Chirstopher Luxon calling it "fantastic".</p>
        
            <p>"What I was super impressed about is three minutes after 12 we have our first arrest," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said police were "quite capable" of enforcing the law and he thought they were doing a good job.</p>
        
            <p>"They're doing a great job, great start ... I make no apologies for going after gang life."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, gang members were already adapting their insignia to get around the ban, while others warned of potential violence.</p>
        
            <p>But police and the government were adamant the ban will work and make things safer.</p>
