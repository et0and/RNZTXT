            <p>ACT leader David Seymour is playing down reported complaints from volunteers about his party's culture.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Stuff reported claims of volunteers leaving the party, expressing no confidence in the board and raising concerns about the party's treatment of women.</p>
        
            <p>The reports said sources close to the party accused its campaign leadership of creating a "culture of fear".</p>
        
            <p>But leader David Seymour has brushed off the reports, saying they are not representative of ACT as a whole.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's contrary to the overwhelming experience that people have had."</p>
        
            <p>He also said campaigning was tough.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time you have an election, people come and they find that maybe politics is not for them. They get disappointed, I've watched it for eight election cycles."</p>
        
            <p>The party has a regular post-election review, which Seymour said aimed to inform the board and party management how to run a better campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a professional do in-depth interviews with 61 different people who were in different ways engaged in the campaign.</p>
        
            <p>"They've produced a report of, I think, 36 recommendations."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he suspected the party would adopt all the recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>ACT held its annual rally in Auckland on Sunday, to a crowd of more than 500 people.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said the party's support had grown by 1,000 percent in five years and set a goal of reaching 15 percent of the vote at the next election.</p>
        
            <p>"It would complete ACT's transformation from an insurgent small party to the small large party you are helping us build."</p>
        
            <p>He said his party was able to influence "real change".</p>
        
            <p>"We have the most ambitious government in half a lifetime and it's the first time ACT's been in cabinet. That is no coincidence."</p>
        
            <p>Much of Seymour's speech on Sunday focussed on the opposition, attacking Te Pāti Māori, the Greens, and Labour.</p>
        
            <p>But Labour leader Chris Hipkins responded by saying the government was an "absolute shambles".</p>
        
            <p>"I think the only thing that seems to be uniting them is they want to tear everything down," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when even (former Labour finance minister) Roger Douglas says the ACT party has become the party of entrenched privilege, I think it's time for the ACT party to have a rethink."</p>
