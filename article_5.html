            <p>Hospitals around the country are not allowed to make a single hiring decision without the approval of Te Whatu Ora's head office, including for cleaners and administration staff.</p>
        
            <p>It means if somewhere like Southland Hospital wants to replace a nurse, that decision has to go a long way up the chain - and the country - for approval.</p>
        
            <p>It is the same for every hospital and clinic in the huge organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief of people Andrew Slater said the process was "short-term", as part of its efforts to stay within budget to the end of the financial year.</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand/Te Whatu Ora has a workforce of over 90,000 and it is important that we direct our resources to the areas where there is the greatest demand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the former chair Rob Campbell said that was no way to run such a big organisation.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's bosses should set rules and guidelines then trust local management and people on the ground to make the specific decisions, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no way you can be sitting in Wellington or TƒÅmaki and make rational decisions for someone in Invercargill or Kaikohe, it just doesn't make any sense," he said.</p>
        
            <p>When Te Whatu Ora replaced 20 district health boards, some feared there would be over-centralisation, with power and decision making taken away from communties.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said it was sad to see the latest policy.</p>
        
            <p>"It does feed in to that narrative that this was always about centralisation which it certainly never had to be," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What happens in these cost cutting exercises is sometimes they go to extreme levels and this would be an example of that."</p>
        
            <p>Slater said Te Whatu Ora was still hiring staff.</p>
        
            <p>In the weekend ending 15 April, the Hospital and Specialist Services division had given approval for 360 jobs, he said.</p>
