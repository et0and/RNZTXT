        <h2>Environmental groups express concerns over mining exports plan</h2>
        <p>
The plan involves more mining, including of gold and coal, and forcing banks to finance fossil fuel expansion.

            <p>Environmental groups have expressed concern about the government's final mining strategy which aims to double mineral sector exports by 2035.</p>
        
            <p>The plan, announced by Resources Minister Shane Jones on Friday, involves more mining, including of gold and coal, and forcing banks to finance fossil fuel expansion.</p>
        
            <p>Jones was half an hour late to his announcement in Waihi, after about 100 protesters blocked a bus carrying officials.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Coromandel Watchdog chairperson Catherine Delahunty, who said they wanted to show their strength of feeling about mining.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a desperate strategy to think that the economy, which also includes the environment, is going to be saved by doubling mining activity," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at mining in Waihi here, it'll be gone in 10 years' time."</p>
        
            <p>Delahunty said people travelled from across the region to be in Waihi for the demonstration.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been doing this 45 years and there's people here from places people might not have heard of, KÅ«aotunu, Maratoto, Whenuakite, Karangahake, Waikino."</p>
        
            <p>Jones made an impassioned pitch for more mining in Waihi - saying the country simply cannot afford not "use nature's bounty".</p>
        
            <p>"We have them, we will use them and there will be appropriate guardrails to ensure that as the transition takes place we do not bankrupt communities, we do not destroy the employment prospects of the generations coming through."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the coalition supports environmentally approved mining on stewardship land but national parks are off the table.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace is concerned that overseas-based fossil fuel companies will walk away with profits, while New Zealanders will be left to pay the clean-up costs.</p>
        
            <p>Its executive director Russel Norman said the government released an updated Paris Climate Target on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"The Luxon Government wants to fast track coal mining and restart oil and gas exploration, which is a complete contradiction to the objectives of the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said force banks to finance fossil fuel expansion would be a mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"Overseas-based fossil fuel companies will walk away with profits while New Zealanders will be left to pay the clean-up costs."</p>
        
            <p>Forest and Bird chief executive Nicola Toki said the royalties the government collected from coal mining last year did not even cover the clean up costs for Stockton mine on the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>She said fast-tracking coal mining, and restarting oil and gas exploration contradicts international climate change guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>"The international energy agency, in 2021, made it very clear to policymakers across the world that there can be no more coal mining if we are to maintain our climate in a survivable state and keep our commitments internationally without sanctions."</p>
        
            <p>But Jones said there will be environmental safeguards and the economic benefits, especially for the regions, cannot be missed.</p>
        
            <p>"It can offer a reason as to why our families can remain in regional New Zealand, live in a high quality form of household and at the same time enjoy what you and I take for granted as our birthright - a place where you can work in a mine, go for a surf and shoot a deer all in one day."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said banks will be forced to finance fossil fuel expansion, with New Zealand First introducing a bill giving regulators power to remove a bank's operating license if it refused to do business with mineral firms.</p>
        
            <p>He ended today's speech saying more mining could be the economic lifeline the country needs.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope this strategy gives you a level of confidence and it does not result in the matua being shot."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's energy spokesperson Megan Woods said the mining strategy is shortsighted environmentally reckless, and a giveaway to private mining interests.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not against mining as long as it is done in an environmentally sustainable way," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Under the Labour government, we were also doing work on critical minerals that would help us decarbonise and move away from fossil fuels like coal in a way that ensures jobs in the long term."</p>
        
            <p>Woods said the government's plans, combined with the Fast Track law, could lead to greater environmental risks with no public scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>"This government wants New Zealanders to believe mining is essential for the energy transition, but what they won't tell you is that gold mining has nothing to do with renewable energy and fossil fuels are the most expensive energy source that we have."</p>
        
            <p>She said more mining would result in private profits being shipped offshore while Kiwis are left with the environmental damage.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis deserve an energy strategy that moves us forward, one that invests in wind, solar, and storage, creates sustainable jobs, and puts people before corporate profits."</p>
