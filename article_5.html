            <p>Wellington Water will ask the council on Tuesday afternoon for more money than it has been budgeted for the next financial year.</p>
        
            <p>City councillors are in for a flurry for briefings on property values, their annual budget and water.</p>
        
            <p>The first briefing at 1:30pm will be on the results of a new QV report which will state what each of the capital's homes are worth.</p>
        
            <p>The second meeting at 2pm will be on the annual plan - Wellington City Council's annual budget for the next financial year.</p>
        
            <p>At 3pm and 4pm they will be discussing water, first on the new water entity as part of the government's 'Local Water Done Well' reforms and then on a request from Wellington Water for more money.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington Water spokesperson confirmed to RNZ it would be asking for additional funding through the council's annual planning process.</p>
        
            <p>They would not provide any further details prior to Tuesday's meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The meetings come as councillors get ready for a busy year ahead and the looming local elections.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported on the intentions of each of the Wellington metropolitan region's mayors on Tuesday morning.</p>
