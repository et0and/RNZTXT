            <p>Auckland's water provider Watercare is warning water rates may need to increase by as much as 25 percent to run the business, while keeping to the council's borrowing limit.</p>
        
            <p>Water charges increased by 9.5 percent last July, while infrastructure growth charges rose by 8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>This meant the average household paid about $2.20 more per week.</p>
        
            <p>In its recent newsletter, Watercare advised customers of a potential price rise of 25.8 percent from July.</p>
        
            <p>It said the rise was to "run our business while sticking to Auckland Council's borrowing limit".</p>
        
            <p>Watercare said if the proposed rise went ahead the average customer bill would increase by roughly $29 a month. That's $348 annually.</p>
        
            <p>The potential increase was included in the consultation document for Auckland Council's 10-year budget.</p>
        
            <p>In the document, council said the increase in rates was to support a significant increase in capital investment across the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare said the 25.8 percent rise could also apply to infrastructure growth charges.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, chair Margaret Devlin said the board had to balance the vital need to invest in new water and wastewater infrastructure with council's directives to maintain a debt-to-revenue ratio of 340 percent, as well as ensuring growth funded growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We know many Aucklanders are struggling with the cost of living and we understand the news of this projected price rise will not be welcome," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to reassure them that central and local government want to avoid significant price rises for Auckland; and they are working together to achieve a financially sustainable water model."</p>
        
            <p>Devlin said they understood the ongoing conversations between central government and council were positive.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare will give residents at least 10 days' notice of a potential price rise.</p>
