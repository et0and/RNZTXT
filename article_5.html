            <p>The death of Hone Kay-Selwyn, who was involved in the Ponsonby shooting, is not being treated as suspicious, police say.</p>
        
            <p>It has been referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Kay-Selwyn's body was found at a rural address in the Broadlands area near Taup≈ç on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Revealed to be a Killer Beez gang member, he was wanted for the fatal shooting of Robert Horne on Ponsonby Road on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police are monitoring gang movements between Auckland and the Bay of Plenty since his death.</p>
        
            <p>His body was released to a funeral director at Rotorua Hospital on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The motivation behind the shooting remains unclear, and police know of no links between Horne and any criminal groups.</p>
        
            <p>Police are not aware of any issues arising from the gang convoy at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware that gang members had earlier travelled south to Rotorua, and we are continuing to monitor their movements through the Auckland region," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be police resource deployed where available to monitor activity, including the Police Air Support Unit."</p>
        
            <p>They say motorists should report any concerning behaviour to the authorities.</p>
