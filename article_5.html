            <p>The prime minister is backing Corrections Minister Mark Mitchell after a confusing media conference announcing planned prison spending.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement promised a $1.9 billion investment in Corrections over the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>In the near 40-minute media conference Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Mitchell at times contradicted each other and repeatedly provided incorrect information.</p>
        
            <p>Both claimed some of the money would go towards an 810-bed extension to Waikeria prison but then said that included 600 beds already funded and previously announced by Labour. Shortly after the conference ended, a correction was sent out saying the new beds would actually be in addition to those 600 already under construction.</p>

            <p>Luxon told Morning Report Corrections Minister Mark Mitchell got "mixed up" at the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"He got it mixed up yesterday in the moment," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a quick chat on the way out of the press conference and he very quickly clarified the numbers immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell earlier told the programme he "muddied the waters a bit" because he'd been so focused on the 'here and now' in terms of building capacity into the prison system that he went into "far too much detail".</p>
        
            <p>He said he went on to talk about issues such as work being done to bring decommissioned Waikeria prison beds back online, rather than the announcement of the day on an additional 810 beds.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon backed the minister who he said was doing a great job strongly advocating for restoring law and order.</p>
        
            <p>"He cares about the front line police, he cares about the front line Corrections officers, he's done a good job on emergency management and recovery and he's doing a good job."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said said the facts on the prison spending were straightforward.</p>
        
            <p>"There's 455 beds today, there's 600 going in next year and there's another 810 coming with this funding."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon denied the announcement was rushed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a serious investment: $1.9 billion. We are determined to make sure we recruit more front line Corrections staff, we want to make sure they get funding for pay increases. We want to expand the prison capacity at Waikeria and we want to also spend $80 million getting rehabilitation programmesâ€¦ to remand prisoners which, you know, in New Zealand is 45 percent of our prison population at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's important we get those services to prisoners quicker so they can turn their lives around faster."</p>
