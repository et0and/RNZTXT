            <p>Christopher Luxon has been officially sworn in as New Zealand's 42nd prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Following a karakia and the national anthem, Luxon confirmed to the Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro he had the confidence to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Cindy also appointed the rest of the executive council, which includes 20 Cabinet ministers, eight ministers outside Cabinet, and two Parliamentary under-secretaries.</p>
        
            <p>Holding a Bible, Luxon swore allegiance to King Charles III, his heirs, and successors, before signing his oaths.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters also chose to swear on a Bible, though ACT leader David Seymour opted not to.</p>

            <p>New Zealand First minister Shane Jones was the first to deliver his oath and affirmation in te reo Māori. National's Tama Potaka, who delivered a karakia on behalf of the executive council, also delivered his oath and affirmation in te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Following her oath and affirmation in English, National's Melissa Lee delivered hers in Korean, the first time this had ever been done.</p>
        
            <p>After the signing of the warrants, Luxon addressed the Governor-General and his new ministerial colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>"You have been entrusted with a massive responsibility," he told ministers.</p>
        
            <p>"I ask that you never lose sight of one thing, which is why we came to Parliament in the first place, and that is to do public service.</p>
        
            <p>"Public service is a tremendous privilege, because what it comes with is a government of relatively few people making sure that they are there each and every day to improve the lives of Kiwis."</p>
        
            <p>He asked them to think about that "as we work together to improve this great nation of ours".</p>
        
            <p>"We now have a responsibility to deliver for New Zealanders, to give them clear, demonstrable and measurable improvements in the quality of their lives."</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to working with each and every one of you to make a positive difference as we drive out this agenda of our government."</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps due to the nerves and auspiciousness of the occasion, there were a few fumbles.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon pronounced heirs as "hairs", while National's Mark Mitchell accidentally introduced himself as Park Matrick Mitchell, before correcting himself.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Labour leader Chris Hipkins congratulated Luxon on his appointment as prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has been through some tough times but we are seeing the economy turning, wages growing, and climate emissions reducing. I hope this progress continues."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins also encouraged the new government to commit to funding public services.</p>
        
            <p>He officially resigned as prime minister to the Governor-General at 9.30am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The swearing-in follows weeks of coalition talks between National, ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon, Seymour and Peters fronted media last Friday to confirm how the new government would look and policies it would be delivering.</p>
