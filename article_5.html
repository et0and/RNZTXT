            <p>The education minister only found out school lunch provider Libelle was going into liquidation through media reports, as the associate education minister decided not to tell her.</p>
        
            <p>Written Parliamentary Questions from the Green Party show David Seymour found out there was a possibility of Libelle's liquidation on 6 March.</p>
        
            <p>Libelle was officially placed into liquidation on 11 March, and it was only then that Erica Stanford found out.</p>
        
            <p>According to the first report by liquidators Deloitte, Libelle exhausted its cash reserves on 6 March, after paying employees' wages.</p>
        
            <p>It was no longer able to purchase essential goods and services to enable ongoing trading.</p>
        
            <p>Libelle approached Deloitte on the evening on 6 March, seeking its consent to act as liquidators.</p>
        
            <p>Deloitte spent until 10 March planning for the insolvency appointment, to ensure there was a strategy for the ongoing supply of lunches once the liquidation was made official.</p>
        
            <p>Deloitte then publicly announced Libelle was being placed into liquidation on 11 March.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's education spokesperson Lawrence Xu-Nan asked the Education Minister, Associate Education Minister and Prime Minister when they were first made aware that Libelle was going into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>He also asked the Education Minister and Prime Minister who informed them of the liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour told Xu-Nan that Ministry of Education officials verbally briefed him on 6 March of the possibility of Libelle going into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>"I was kept abreast of developments until the liquidator was appointed on Tuesday 11 March 2025, as I was focussed on continuity of supply," his reply said.</p>
        
            <p>
The Prime Minister says his office was told about the liquidation on 7 March.

            <p>The Prime Minister said Seymour's office told his office on 7 March.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford, however, told Xu-Nan she was "informed via the media that the Libelle Group had been placed into liquidation."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour told RNZ as the responsible minister, his duty was to make sure the programme delivered.</p>
        
            <p>"Updating other ministers on every development would be nice, but I think they would rather I fix the problems," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In this instance my office made sure that the Prime Minister's office was kept informed of developments, as is appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>Lawrence Xu-Nan said it reinforced the need to return to the original school lunch model, and expand it.</p>
        
            <p>"If we had good and well-funded, nutritious, warm, locally-made lunches that are resilient and aren't going to have all of these issues, we wouldn't have this in the first place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Erica Stanford's office told RNZ they would not be commenting further.</p>
