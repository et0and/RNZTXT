            <p>The government is cutting teams responsible for [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/515677/dia-proposes-cutting-eight-roles-relating-to-information-security-union-says safeguarding privacy and digitising public services[ at the same time as the sector is calling for urgent upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Public Service Association, the Department of Internal Affairs has confirmed plans to axe 17 roles in the Digital Public Service Group and the government's Chief Privacy Officer function.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant secretary for the union, Fleur Fitzsimons, said the cuts would compromise the security and privacy of New Zealanders' personal data.</p>

            <p>"New Zealanders trust the public service with deeply personal and sensitive information, this is at risk with the decimation of the privacy function," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These public servants provide critical oversight of how the public service protects the personal information of millions of New Zealanders. The loss of this leadership for the public sector is dangerous."</p>
        
            <p>The government claimed it wanted more digital government services and for people to access information and services faster - but was dismissing the very workers making that possible, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Minister for Digitising Government Judith Collins says they want a 'customer focused digital government service for New Zealanders'. So why lay off the very people doing this work? Ministers have gone through these decisions 'line by line' so we can only conclude she is happy with these cuts."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Technology Users Association, which represents 170 large and small technology companies, released its 2024 Digital Priorities Report, calling on the government to "create a clear strategy and plan for digital transformation of public services".</p>
        
            <p>One expert - Massey University's Jason Lewis - said the longer New Zealand held onto "legacy technology" in public sector environments and infrastructure, the more it would create "a bigger divide between New Zealand and the rest of the world".</p>
        
            <p>"The government maintains it listens to business in other areas, so it should listen to business on this vital issue if it wants to keep up with the world and help business harness digital opportunities. Digitising public services plays a key role in this," Fitzsimons said.</p>
        
            <p>"This just undermines the very priorities it has set for itself."</p>
