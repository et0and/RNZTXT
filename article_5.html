            <p>Public Service Minister Nicola Willis has directed department bosses to tighten up on working-from-home arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>A union says the move is a distraction and it's the government's public sector job cuts that have caused woe for Wellington's retail and hospitality sectors.</p>
        
            <p>However the Wellington Chamber of Commerce wants the city council to follow the government's lead and encourage more people to stop working from home.</p>
