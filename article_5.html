            <p>Jobs could be on the line at KiwiRail as the state-owned enterprise confirms it is consulting on proposals for change.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail has been dealing with multiple ferry failures, including the grounding of the Aratere last month and the Kaitaki losing power in 2023 with nearly 900 people on board.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown has raised serious concerns about its fleet maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's chief people and communications officer Andrew Norton said the changes were only proposals at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our transformation programme is underway, and at this stage we are in the process of consulting on proposals for change in some corporate areas," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As these are proposals only it is not possible to comment on the number of roles that will be affected until we have completed our consultation processes."</p>
