            <p>Peter Kaye, the father of former MP Nikki Kaye, has died just days after his daughter.</p>
        
            <p>Nikki Kaye, 44, died on Saturday following a long battle with cancer. The former Auckland Central MP also served for a time as deputy leader of the National Party.</p>
        
            <p>A friend of the family confirmed on Friday that Peter Kaye, a prominent lawyer, had died this week.</p>
        
            <p>He had been in poor health.</p>
        
            <p>Friend and former colleague Paul Dacre said Peter Kaye was one of the great advocates of his generation.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a mentor to a number of lawyers, I think a number of senior lawyers throughout the country owe a lot of training and support from him, and I think he made a great contribution to the profession.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he was a very good friend to a lot of people ... and most of all - and as far as I'm concerned, he was an extremely good friend."</p>
        
            <p>Dacre said it had been a tragic week for the Kaye family.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of Nikki, she was an extremely special person to a lot of people, but obviously she didn't mean anything more to anybody rather than her father and mother," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Peter was not in good health so obviously it overwhelmed him."</p>
