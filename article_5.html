            <p>Actor Sam Neill has called proposed cutbacks to the Dunedin Hospital "short-sighted, careless, heartless, ruthless".</p>
        
            <p>In September the government announced the planned redevelopment of the hospital, which is already underway, would either need to be reduced, or done in stages.</p>
        
            <p>The costs had blown out and the planned hospital was simply unaffordable, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>There has been strong local backlash from people who believe the region needs the new hospital and that the government went back on its campaign promise to build it.</p>
        
            <p>Now actor Sam Neill has joined the fray.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint Facebook post with the Save Our Southern Hospital campaign, Neill said he was angry.</p>
        
            <p>"I am unsurprised to hear that (Prime Minister Christopher) Luxon and his gang have broken their word and made fatal cuts to our Dunedin Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Short sighted, careless, heartless, ruthless. Government by the Cruel. That's how it feels," Neill said.</p>
        
            <p>Neill, who has a home in Central Otago, has spoken publicly about his own recent health battle with cancer.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the health minister, Dr Shane Reti, said the minister recognised the passion reflected in both Dunedin and the wider region, and insisted the government was committed to building a new hospital in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"Far from 'cuts,' the government has significantly increased funding for the new Dunedin Hospital by hundreds of millions of dollars. We promised $30 million during the campaign, and we've now set aside $290m in government to keep the project alive," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This difficult announcement has had to be made to ensure we can support other important builds across the hospital system. Hospitals in Nelson, Whangārei, Hawke's Bay, Palmerston North and Tauranga could be at risk if Dunedin continues to go so far over budget."</p>
