            <p>Advocacy groups for people living with cancer are calling on the government to make funding 13 promised treatments a priority to "stop lives being lost".</p>
        
            <p>Last August, National promised to spend $280 million on 13 new cancer treatments that would have helped fight bladder, bowel, liver, lung, kidney and head and neck cancers in addition to melanoma.</p>
        
            <p>It was to be funded by reinstating the $5 prescription payment.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, after funding was not allocated in last week's Budget, cancer patients and organisations have called for assurances the funding will still go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>A group of cancer organisations, including Patient Voice Aotearoa, Cancer Society, Lung Foundation NZ, Bowel Cancer NZ, Gut Cancer Foundation NZ and Head and Neck Cancer Support Network, have penned an open letter to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Finance Minister Nicola Willis and the associate minister of health, David Seymour, urging them to "make good" on their promises.</p>
        
            <p>"Cancer patients and advocates sat in disbelief when the budget was announced," the letter said, "we have now learnt these medicines may not be funded for at least a year. Patients don't have a year to wait and will sadly have to look at the heartbreaking scenarios your party wanted to put an end to."</p>
        
            <p>The letter noted lives would be lost if the medicines were not funded with the utmost urgency and it implored the government to deliver on its commitment.</p>
        
            <p>Patient Voice Aotearoa chairperson Dr Malcolm Mullholland said he and other organisations had been called by patients following the Budget asking what was going on.</p>
        
            <p>"I, like everyone else, was in shock, disbelief and heartbreak listening to the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>"We were all watching and eager with anticipation to hear more about the funding and now it's delayed for an unknown time."</p>
        
            <p>Both Willis and Health Minister Shane Reti have said the drugs would eventually be funded, it just could not happen in this Budget.</p>
        
            <p>The government was ending free prescriptions for millions of people from July and that money would be put back into Pharmac, Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Willis told First Up the government would honour its campaign promise.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the urgency and our message to them [advocates] is we're working on it with the urgency it deserves."</p>

            <p>Comments made by Willis about the funding over the weekend seem like a "backflip", Mullholland said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the government didn't expect there to be as much backlash about the lack of funding as there has been. This is one of the worst things they can do - we're talking about people with terminal cancer.</p>
        
            <p>"Patients had been waiting for July 1, when they believed funding would begin and now they've gone back on their word."</p>
        
            <p>The government needed to act now, Mullholland said, and a timeframe needed to be publicly released showing when decisions would be made.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to be crystal clear with that," Mullholland said.</p>
