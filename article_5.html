            <p>Half of the $1.5 billion the government said would go towards building and repairing school facilities and classrooms in Budget 2024 will be directed towards maintenance needed at existing schools, Minister of Finance Nicola Willis says.</p>
        
            <p>She made the announcement to parents and teachers at Sommerville School in Auckland's Panmure this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year the school reported it had leaking sewage, with mould and mushrooms growing on classroom walls.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said half of the new funding would go towards maintenance and repairs to existing schools throughout New Zealand, including Sommerville School.</p>
        
            <p>$ 63 million of that would be spent on rebuilding three unsafe and unhealthy schools</p>
        
            <p>The rest would be used for new classrooms.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Education Erica Stanford also announced Sommerville would be one of three schools to be entirely redeveloped.</p>
        
            <p>She said construction would begin early next year and would last 18 months.</p>
