            <p>Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick is expected to announce she intends to contest the vacant co-leader position.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, James Shaw announced he would step down from the role in March, but planned to stay in Parliament to progress a member's bill in his name.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick is holding a media conference at Parliament at 11am on Friday, where RNZ expects she will announce her bid for the job.</p>
        
            <p>Any Green member can contest the position, Aneven if they are not an MP.</p>
        
            <p>A number of Green MPs have already ruled themselves out of going for the role, including newcomer Steve Abel, and Ricardo Menéndez March, who said his focus was supporting the current caucus and future co-leadership team in his role as musterer.</p>
        
            <p>Nominations close for the role on 14 February, and the party has said it expected to announce the new co-leader on 10 March.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw has held the role since 2015.</p>
