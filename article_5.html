            <p>A poll has shown large opposition to the government's proposal to remove the Living Wage requirement from the updated procurement rules.</p>
        
            <p>The poll, commissioned by worker's union E tū, found 62 percent of people were against removing Living Wage requirements for government-contracted cleaners, security guards and catering.</p>
        
            <p>Comparatively, 23 percent supported the government proposal.</p>
        
            <p>The poll was from a sample of 1116 people in a Talbot Mills research online survey of over-18s.</p>
        
            <p>E tū National Secretary Rachel Mackintosh said she was not surprised by the poll result.</p>
        
            <p>"It shows people recognise the value of the work that security guards, cleaners and catering workers do and appreciate that the Living Wage is reasonable.</p>
        
            <p>"People are decent and recognise that it's not extravagant it's a perfectly reasonable thing to expect to be paid enough to live on if you're working," said Mackintosh.</p>
        
            <p>The government plans to scale back the number of rules agencies must follow when tendering contracts, which it said would make it easier for New Zealand businesses to access government contracts worth $50 billion a year.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Economic Growth Nicola Willis wants to axe one third of 71 rules which included paying the Living Wage in contracts for cleaning, catering and security guard services.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, the Living Wage is $27.80 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>The poll revealed 31 percent men and 17 percent of women supported the removal of the Living Wage requirement while 57 percent of men and 66 percent of women opposed it.</p>
        
            <p>The data also showed 39 percent of National and 40 percent of ACT voters supported scrapping the Living Wage requirement, but that 44 percent of voters from both parties wanted the rules retained.</p>
        
            <p>Mackintosh said while ACT and National voters were more likely to support the government's proposal, a greater number of their voters were against it.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really hopeful that the government listen, this was not only left-wing voters this was voters who vote National and Act who recognise that it is reasonable to pay a reasonable wage to workers.</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows how universal the acceptance is that a Living Wage is reasonable and decent and that it's not okay to take it away, especially not okay to take it away and say that you're doing it improve jobs and income.</p>
        
            <p>"It shows that people don't think working people are bottom feeders, that it's only reasonable to be paid enough to live on."</p>
        
            <p>The E tū National Secretary said she hoped the poll got the government's attention.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the whole of society that think this is the wrong move; the government should reconsider, and they should reverse their proposal. They should keep the Living Wage as a requirement for contracted workers to the government," Mackintosh said.</p>
        
            <p>The Talbot Mills Research poll which was commissioned by E tū was conducted between 14 - 24 March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The online survey sampled 1116 respondents over the age of 18 and it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.</p>
