            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman will find out her fate today, with her sentence for shoplifting to be revealed at the Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old was convicted in March on four charges of shoplifting, which led to her downfall from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>At the sentencing hearing on Monday, Judge June Jelas reserved her decision to consider the submissions from the prosecution and defence.</p>
        
            <p>Jelas told the court Ghahraman would be receiving a non-custodial sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's lawyer Annabel Cresswell has sought a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Cresswell said the offending was a result of trauma from her early life escaping war in Iran, and a clear mental health crisis caused by the pressures of life in Parliament and constant threats to her life and safety while an MP.</p>
        
            <p>A discharge without conviction would mean Ghahraman would have no criminal record.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's early acceptance of responsibility, show of remorse and low likelihood of re-offending should be considered in sentencing, Cresswell said.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock contested Ghahraman's mental health being a direct cause of her shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock said the mental health report submitted indicated there was a possibility of a link between Gharaman's undiagnosed PTSD and the offending.</p>
        
            <p>But she said that link was tenuous and tempered the extent to which this could be used to lower her culpability.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock put Ghahraman's culpability at medium-to-high gravity of offending.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman plead guilty to the theft of thousands of dollars worth of clothing at the Auckland District Court in March.</p>
        
            <p>The former politician was charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx Store on 22 October 2023, and a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket on 22 December.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with two counts of shoplifting from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby - $5773 of items on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods on 23 December.</p>
