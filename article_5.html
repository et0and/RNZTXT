            <p>From Whangārei to Invercargill, thousands were expected to take to the streets in Friday's climate strike.</p>
        
            <p>But it is not just about the climate crisis: The event is led by a coalition including Toitū Te Tiriti, Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa, and School Strike 4 Climate.</p>
        
            <p>They have six demands. To keep the ban on oil and gas exploration, end the Fast Track Approvals Bill, toitū te Tiriti o Waitangi, climate education for all, lower the voting age to 16 and to "free Palestine".</p>
        
            <p>Recap the protests with RNZ's blog:</p>
