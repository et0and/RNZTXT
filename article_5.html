        <h2>'Horrific': Luxon lashes Health NZ over mistaken identity</h2>
        <p>
An 11-year-old was taken to a mental health facility after being mistaken for a 20-year-old. The PM wants to know why it took two weeks to tell the minister.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described the case of an 11-year-old being mistaken as a 20-year-old and put in a mental health unit as "extremely distressing" and wants to know why officials took two weeks to tell the minister in charge.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ has apologised after an was mistaken for a 20-year-old woman by police officers and admitted to a mental health facility. The girl was handcuffed by police.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported the girl was autistic and non-verbal, and injected with medication at the hospital. Te Whatu Ora said a review would be carried out to see if any medication had been given to the girl.</p>
        
            <p>"As a parent, you identify with what is a horrific set of circumstances ... it's just incredibly distressing and concerning," Luxon told reporters at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Massive amounts of empathy and concern for her and her family."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was unacceptable that Health NZ took two weeks before informing the minister.</p>

            <p>"There's now an inquiry under way, I know it's got the full attention of Simeon Brown, he's all over it."</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether heads should roll, Luxon said: "By all means, there should be accountability in the system."</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey said the first he became aware of the incident was on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed I wasn't informed until late in the piece," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've made my expectation very clear that there needs to be a serious incident review [and] that's under way now."</p>
        
            <p>He said when there was a serious incident his expectation is that as the Mental Health Minister he would be informed.</p>
        
            <p>"They explained to me that under normal protocol I should have been informed and the person who was responsible for doing that failed to inform my office."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said what had happened to the 11-year-old girl was "hugely concerning".</p>
        
            <p>"It's every parent's worst nightmare."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora deputy chief executive for Te Manawa Taki Cath Cronin told Midday Report it was not going to shy away from any review that was needed, and would do everything to ensure this did not happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, I think that this is a case of mistaken identity. So we need to understand what happened, not only with the police and their process, but also our process."</p>
        
            <p>Cronin said a review would be released to the public in a matter of days.</p>
        
            <p>"We're taking this incredibly seriously, and I've got to pull all the facts together and get the review from our clinical experts and the external experts that are looking at this, and we won't shy away from what the review told us."</p>
        
            <p>"We will, as much as we can, depending on, again, the welfare of the girl and her family, share what we find in the review.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, we are all extremely disappointed and extremely upset that this has happened to a child that was in our care. As I said, we're taking this seriously. We're going to get to the facts."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said he would not be politicising the case as the government-of-the-day is not responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clearly a major mistake ... this could've happened under any government," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's utterly unacceptable, and I do think they need to get the bottom of exactly what happened as quickly as they can and provide some reassurance to the New Zealand public that this won't happen again."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said it was "very concerning" that ministers were not advised by their officials more promptly.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd be having some very stern words with a range of government departments, be pulling them all in actually to find out exactly how this happened."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said officers were "doing the best that they could".</p>
        
            <p>"All our police officers were trying to do was care for an 11-year-old that was out on the streets, that was non-verbal, that was standing on a bridge with who knows what the intent was.</p>
        
            <p>"The police, unfortunately, throughout the process, have misidentified her, but make no mistake, they were doing the best that they could to look after her and to support her."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said he expected police to carry out their own review of the mistake, as well as taking part in a separate Health NZ review.</p>
        
            <p>The Chief Children's Commissioner Dr Claire Achmad said she was very concerned to hear about this case on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>She said was thinking of the 11-year-old girl and her whānau while they navigated the aftermath of what has occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"Every child in our country has a right to be safe in our communities. As the independent advocate for all children in our country, I am seeking information from relevant agencies about how this situation occurred, and also about how the rights and wellbeing of this child are being kept at the forefront."</p>
        
            <p>Achmad said she was pleased to see that both the police and Health New Zealand had acknowledged mistakes and committed to a full review.</p>
        
            <p>"It is essential that any review and response puts this child's rights and specific needs, wellbeing and interests at the centre, and supports her active participation.</p>
        
            <p>"As Chief Children's Commissioner, I will be paying close attention any to information that agencies are able to provide me on this situation, and remain ready to provide independent children's rights advice. I will keep advocating for the rights and interests of this child to remain the priority."</p>
