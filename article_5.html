            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced $6 million in humanitarian aid to those affected by conflict in Gaza and Sudan during his visit to Egypt.</p>
        
            <p>"There are huge and urgent humanitarian needs in both Gaza and Sudan, and it is important that New Zealand continues to make its contribution to international efforts to meet them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit in Cairo and announced a further $2 million to the United Nations 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, which maximises the impact of aid flows into Gaza to help meet urgent needs.</p>
        
            <p>He also announced $4m to support humanitarian protection and assistance for Sudanese communities affected by conflict and its neighbouring countries, including Egypt.</p>
        
            <p>"My discussions in Cairo with the Egyptian government and the Arab League have underscored the urgency of coordinated international action to push for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and ensure a rapid, massive and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in desperate need.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand stands with Egypt, the Arab League and the overwhelming consensus of the international community in calling on all parties to comply with last week's UNSC resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand and Egypt celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2024 and Peters said it was an honour to be in Cairo to mark the anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>"Egypt is also an important trading partner, our second largest market in Africa with two-way trade worth more than $350m a year.</p>
        
            <p>"We also appreciated the opportunity to visit the Arab League headquarters, and hold discussions with Secretary General Aboul Gheit to gain a richer understanding of the broader Arab world's priorities and perspectives, including when it comes to achieving a sustainable, two-state solution."</p>
        
            <p>The additional $2m announced for Gaza brings the total amount of aid New Zealand has sent to the war-torn region to address urgent humanitarian needs since October 2023 to $17m.</p>
