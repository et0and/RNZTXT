            <p>New Zealand has signed a free-trade deal with the United Arab Emirates - the fastest agreement the country has ever struck.</p>
        
            <p>The deal lifts duties on 98.5 percent of New Zealand's exports immediately on entry into force, rising to 99 percent within three years.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa exports amount to more than $1 billion dollars across the dairy, red meat, industrial products, horticulture and tourism sectors.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Minister Todd McCay announced the deal with his UAE counterpart Minister of State for Foreign Trade Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi in Wellington this morning.</p>
        
            <p>He said the UAE was one of New Zealand's most important trading partners in the Gulf region and today's deal would boost Kiwi exports and strengthen supply chains.</p>

            <p>Al Zeyoudi said New Zealand was a long-standing and highly valued trade partner of the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>"The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement will further strengthen our bilateral relations and boost private-sector opportunity in both nations.</p>
        
            <p>"The conclusion of our CEPA is also an important step forward in realizing our shared ambition to secure long-term prosperity for our peoples and nations alike."</p>
        
            <p>The new trade deal was struck just four months after negotiations first began in May.</p>
        
            <p>Two-way trade with the UAE, one of New Zealand's top 20 export markets, is valued at $1.3 billion dollars a year.</p>
