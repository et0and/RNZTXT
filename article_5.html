            <p>A group of more than 20 Wellington students is marching from Victoria University to Parliament in opposition to the Fast Track Approvals bill.</p>
        
            <p>The new legislation is awaiting its third reading, and is expected to pass into law by the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Led by Victoria University Students Association and the Climate Action and Resistance club, the group planned to march down The Terrace during rush hour traffic, heading to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Nineteen-year-old student and protest organiser Colden Sapir said the bill would allow the government to make decisions about the sustainability of young people's futures without giving them a say.</p>
        
            <p>"The bill will give the green light to seabed mining off the coast of Taranaki, a project that was previously struck down by Aotearoa's Supreme Court.</p>
        
            <p>"Other projects include open-cast coal mines on conservation land, a waste incinerator in Waimate, and doubling the capacity of Auckland prison to put more people in cages."</p>
        
            <p>He said the bill disregarded and undermined the country's democratic processes.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to keep the pressure on politicians to do right by tangata whenua, the environment, and the youth of Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"Politicians continuing to put profit over people will cause young people to inherit a world of climate chaos, and we cannot let that happen. "</p>
