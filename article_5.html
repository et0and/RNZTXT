            <p>Pharmac will next year fully fund a cream to treat fungal skin infections which it says will benefit almost 800 people.</p>
        
            <p>Econazole nitrate 1 percent cream - branded as Pevaryl - can be rubbed onto skin to treat fungal skin infections affecting small areas of the body, like toes.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect about 780 people to benefit from it being fully funded in the first year," Pharmac senior therapeutic group manager Logan Heyes said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a small step to help people treat and heal from their skin infections so they can continue with their daily lives."</p>
        
            <p>There was previously a part charge on the medicine when people picked it up from pharmacies, but it will be fully funded from 1 January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Removing part-charges on medicines make it easier for people to access treatment," Heyes said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are always looking at ways to improve access to the medicines that we fund."</p>
        
            <p>The government in June announced a $604 million budget boost for the health buying agency, to fund new medicines and widen access to medicines that are already funded.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, funding for a range of medicines has been announced, including those that treat cancer, ADHD and heart failure.</p>
