        <h2>Fewer than 1000 families living in emergency accommodation</h2>
        <p>
The government says the drop is positive, but Labour says the need hasn't dropped - just the number of applicants.

            <p>There are now fewer than 1000 households living in emergency housing - a 68 percent drop since December, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of last year there were 3141 households in emergency housing, and that plummeted to 993 by the end of October.</p>
        
            <p>Spending on emergency housing had also reduced from $31.6 million in October last year to $10.7m in October this year.</p>
        
            <p>"National campaigned on a promise to deliver real change for people stuck in emergency housing and we are delivering on that promise," Potaka said.</p>
        
            <p>The progress was down to the introduction of a new 'Priority One' fast track policy in April that saw households with children move to the top of the social housing waitlist, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then, 786 households including 1608 tamariki who were in emergency housing have been placed in social housing through the Priority One pathway."</p>
        
            <p>The government also made changes in August that made emergency housing harder to get into, and harder to stay in.</p>
        
            <p>People must now prove they meet the criteria for the housing, and meet certain obligations while they are living there.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty argued that was the reason for the drop in emergency housing numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"The need hasn't reduced, but applications have," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People don't tend to apply if they know they won't qualify under the new rules."</p>
        
            <p>The rate of applications being declined had also spiked.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2019 and the end of last year, the percentage declined in a month had never been higher than 3.8 percent - but it leapt to 10 percent in August.</p>
