        <h2>Key says Kaye's diagnosis was worse than they let on</h2>
        <p>
Nikki Kaye took time away from Parliament to be treated for breast cancer in 2016, but Sir John Key says they both knew the cancer had already spread much more widely.

            <p>Sir John Key has revealed Nikki Kaye's cancer diagnosis was much worse than either of them let on publicly in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Kaye - who has died at the age of 44 - took time away from Parliament to be treated for breast cancer, but Sir John, who was prime minister at the time, said in reality the cancer had already spread much more widely.</p>
        
            <p>"That was part of the reason why Nikki had suggested she might leave," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I said, no you're not going to do that, if you had a young family and a husband or something I'd probably go and tell you to spend that time, but your life has been a dedication to politics and I think that will give you the strength to get through what you're going to face over the next six or 12 months of treatment and then come back," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that was the right call."</p>
        
            <p>Sir John said returning to work despite her poor health was important to Kaye and gave her a purpose, which helped her survive almost another decade.</p>
        
            <p>"She needed a purpose and she's always had that in her life and it helped a lot. While it's incredibly sad we've been robbed of someone at just 44 years of age, on the other side of the coin I'd say it's very true she measured the life out of the years not the years out of the life. She achieved a remarkable amount in 44 years."</p>

            <p>Sir John had a long catch-up with Kaye three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"She described herself as quite a spiritual person, she felt very much at peace with her life and what she'd achieved and she was in a good space...but that doesn't make it any easier for those of us who knew her well who are going to miss her deeply."</p>
        
            <p>On Kaye winning the Auckland Central seat, the first National MP to do so, Sir John said he always thought if anyone could, she could.</p>
        
            <p>"Her personal beliefs were aligned to a lot of the voters in that electorate. Her electorate work was phenomenal and she just worked morning, noon, and night.</p>
        
            <p>"I think many of the voters who voted for her didn't give their party vote to National, I think they voted for Nikki Kaye not because of our government but in spite of it."</p>
        
            <p>Leaders from across the political spectrum have paid tribute to Kaye for her work ethic, passion, loyalty, caring nature and ability to reach across the aisle.</p>
