            <p>A former National prime minister says the ACT party has "zero" chance of getting a referendum on the Treaty of Waitangi through government negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>ACT has staunchly lobbied for a constitutional overhaul; pitching for the Treaty principles to be rewritten, legislated and ratified by the public.</p>
        
            <p>Leader David Seymour says he is "optimistic" he can persuade National to agree with this policy in negotiations but others put his chances at nil.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see the National Party agreeing to it," former National prime minister Jim Bolger said.</p>
        
            <p>"National did a lot of work and made huge progress on resolving Treaty issues. They're not going to tear that up because David Seymour wants to. No, it won't and shouldn't happen."</p>
        
            <p>Former National Party cabinet minister in charge of Treaty negotiations Sir Douglas Graham said he could not see any sense in the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [Christopher Luxon's] made it pretty clear he doesn't favour the idea and I can understand why. So I would think it's dead in the water and thank heavens for that."</p>
        
            <p>ACT wants to introduce a new law - a Treaty rewrite - that states all New Zealand citizens have the same rights and discrimination based on ethnicity is illegal.</p>
        
            <p>This legislation would be subject to the usual process of debate and public submissions before the public would be asked to ratify it through a yes or no vote.</p>
        
            <p>Incoming prime minister Christopher Luxon has stopped short of categorically ruling out a referendum though he has distanced his party from the policy.</p>
        
            <p>"Our view through the campaign is well understood. We think a referendum would be divisive and unhelpful," he told Morning Report on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Both Bolger and Graham have been critical of Labour's handling of co-governance policy; Bolger last year challenged then prime minister Jacinda Ardern to provide clarity about the government's intentions.</p>
        
            <p>Bolger stands by this criticism, saying co-governance was "an appalling piece of policy", but said ACT's proposed referendum on the Treaty was quite separate from it.</p>
        
            <p>"These are sensitive issues. If they're going to be considered at all they have to be considered in a calm and reasonable way and referendums are not there for calm and reasonable discussion."</p>
        
            <p>Senior MƒÅori Labour MP Willie Jackson went as far as saying a Treaty referendum risked a repeat of the civil unrest seen during the 1981 Springbok tour on TVNZ's Q&A at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Political commentator Peter Dunne did not agree the backlash would go that far but said it would be controversial and not in Luxon's best interests.</p>
        
            <p>"He's going to have a difficult enough task, as it is, on two fronts. One, managing a three-way coalition. And secondly with only 38 percent of the vote this time around, he really needs to add another 7 or 8 percent to National's vote to be confident about a second term.</p>
        
            <p>"Governments don't normally add to their vote during their term so he's got a massive task, even on that front, without any external contention like a referendum or all of the divisive debate that that would cause."</p>
        
            <p>Dunne said ACT might instead be offered up a "halfway" solution, such as putting a stop to Treaty principle clauses in new legislation or walking back existing clauses.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about his thoughts on a compromise on the ACT's referendum policy, Seymour said he saw addressing the principles of the Treaty as "critical".</p>
        
            <p>He would not let on where his party's proposed referendum has landed in negotiations, only saying he was "happy with the engagement" to date.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Aotearoa's constitutional arrangements must "enjoy broad support" to be sustainable and it's only democratic his Treaty proposal be put to a referendum.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe it's time to close the loop and allow Parliament, and ultimately the people of New Zealand, to have a say on what those Treaty principles mean," he said.</p>
