            <p>New Local Government minister Simon Watts announced to councils across the country today to speak up if they are struggling or facing challenges.</p>
        
            <p>Watts' comments came at a Local Government meeting in Wellington where it is the first time he has laid out his priorities in the role and how he wants to work with the sector.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged councils to get in touch before submissions were needed for each council's Water Services Delivery Plan on 3 September.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not about waiting till the third of September, to be honest you've had 15 months."</p>
        
            <p>"So if you do need help, your hand should be going up and I have instructed my officials to work closely with you. We have to work together in order to achieve this and I've given my commitment to you that I will do that."</p>
        
            <p>"Do not wait a month before the due date and go 'Minister I'm in a bit of trouble I need an extension', sort of like homework conversation," Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged there were a lot of burdens the central government placed on local governments, including water reforms.</p>
        
            <p>One of the major challenges he was aware a lot of councils were facing was funding and finance, and water services legislation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to make sure that we are working now, the next 30 days are critical in terms of making sure that your counsellors, your teams, have a good, thorough understanding of the impacts of economics regulation and what that actually means in practice."</p>
        
            <p>"The worst thing we can do is be uninformed in regards to the implications of economic regulation," Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most exciting things from central government to local government would be city regional deals with the aim of increasing economic growth, productivity and jobs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"City regional deal framework has many advantages, but its basic advantage is that it provides a 10 year certainty in terms of what we're going to do, how we're going to do it and who's going to do it."</p>
        
            <p>"If you think about the status quo and the fact that local government and central government, Iwi Māori, private sector, NGO, community sector, are actually all around the table working together in the same direction, I mean that sort of sounds like utopia doesn't it," Watts said.</p>

            <p>The model had been used in the UK for 15 years and in Australia for almost a decade which showed it was enduring.</p>
        
            <p>However, not every council would get a deal within the next 18 months, Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Deputy Mayor Jen Scoular told Simon Watts both herself and Mayor Mahé Drysdale were keen to raise their hands.</p>
        
            <p>"Really like your comments about the fact central government needs to understand the burden they put on local government ... I'm a newbie to local government but we're certainly feeling that and I'm sure I'm not alone in that," Scoular said.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council wanted to talk about implementing collaboration within the region, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council will not be taking part in this years local government elections.</p>
