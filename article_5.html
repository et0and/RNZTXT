            <p>Gore District Council has a new chief executive, after a fraught period in which the mayor and CEO had to enter mediation in a bid to mend their fractured relationship.</p>
        
            <p>She is Debbie Lascelles, currently executive manager strategy and transformation at South Waikato District Council.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year, Gore chief executive Stephen Parry resigned after 22 years in the role, but then stepped in as interim chief executive after the deputy CEO also resigned.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2023 it was revealed that he and Mayor Ben Bell had not spoken in months. They then entered into mediation, but that quickly fell apart.</p>
        
            <p>In May that year, a group of councillors called on the 24-year-old mayor to resign, and then in June a ratepayer started a petition calling for Parry to resign in response.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, the council announced Debbie Lascelles was Parry's replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Lascelles said she had no concerns about the previous issues at the council.</p>
        
            <p>"We do see these issues in local politics. The organisation has a really good reputation. Certainly my experience during the interview process was that I was treated with considerable hospitality and respect.</p>
        
            <p>" met the executive team, met the mayor, met all the councillors. I have absolutely no concerns."</p>
        
            <p>Lascelles said Gore District Council was a good-sized organisation for her.</p>
        
            <p>"Gore has absolutely fantastic community facilities, which is a real bonus for working in a small community, so that really appealed too."</p>
        
            <p>Lascelles said she would be moving to Gore, and would assume the role in June.</p>
