        <h2>Nearly 200 police support roles cut as govt boosts front-line officers</h2>
        <p>
The staff cuts - which could include 111 operators - could result in more pressure on sworn officers, union says.

            <p>The loss of nearly 200 support roles could have a knock-on effect on front-line policing, the Police Association says.</p>
        
            <p>The government's Budget, released on Thursday, committed more than $220 million to train 500 new officers by the end of next year.</p>
        
            <p>But Police Commissioner Andrew Coster told staff - in an email sent on the release of the Budget - that 175 non-sworn jobs would go to satisfy the government's demand for $55 million in savings.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association vice-president Paul Ormerod said that could be bad news for policing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's concerning to us, It's concerning to our members that any loss in back office workers will result in either the front line doing more work or a reduction in efficiency to respond to calls."</p>
        
            <p>Ormerod said the staff who could be at risk of losing their jobs included 111 operators, along with various other roles that supported sworn officers.</p>

            <p>In his message to staff, Coster acknowledged the backroom work of support staff was crucial in enabling front-line officers to work "quickly, effectively and safely".</p>
        
            <p>He said further information on the staff cuts would be made available after "detailed design work" had been completed in August.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point, we've only been able to undertake a very high-level analysis," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know this will be an unsettling time for staff and I thank you for your continued patience and dedication as we work through this."</p>
        
            <p>Coster's email said the $226 million boost meant the force would be funded for 10,711 full-time constables, which would allow for the replacement of any officers who left the force during that period and boost front-line staff by 500 more constables than were in place on 27 November 2023, when the Government was formed.</p>
        
            <p>"These 500 additional roles will be deployed to bolster front-line policing services, including visible community reassurance and tackling public concerns around gangs, violent crime and persistent youth offending," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>The funding would also provide for the training, tools, technology, cars and equipment needed to accommodate the additional staff.</p>
        
            <p>Another $63 million would go towards the annual replacement of up to 650 vehicles each year, as well as the replacement of utility vehicles for rural areas and specialist Armed Offenders Squad and Special Tactics Group vehicles, heavy vehicles, and covert surveillance vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>"This is welcome news to make sure we continue to have the tools we need to do our job on a day-to-day basis, and comes after rapidly escalating capital costs in this area in the last few years," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>A one-off payment of $120 million would allow "breathing room" to cover growing cost pressures such as a $10 million annual increase in fuel and vehicle maintenance costs and a $17 million increase in rates, utilities and maintenance costs per year.</p>
        
            <p>He said the funding would allow the organisation to work to achieve "fiscal sustainability in future years".</p>
