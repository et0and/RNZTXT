        <h2>Leaky school has rebuild delayed after found to be earthquake prone</h2>
        <p>
The Ministry of Education has flip-flopped for a decade between repair or rebuilding of a 15-year-old school that leaked from the start.

            <p>The rebuild of a majority Māori-student leaking school is now set for 2025, after officials belatedly realised it is also earthquake prone.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has flip-flopped for a decade between the repair or the rebuild of the 15-year-old Taihape Area School that began leaking from the start.</p>
        
            <p>Its classrooms have needed lots of extra heat pumps to stay warm, and its toilets have often backed up.</p>
        
            <p>It was poised for repairs in 2019, but that did not happen; then poised for a rebuild in 2022, when the ministry opted instead to try find cost savings.</p>
        
            <p>The MOE has now revealed to RNZ that just last year, engineers gave it more bad news: In January, they found the main teaching block and gym have just a 15 percent seismic rating (NBS, or New Building Standard).</p>
        
            <p>The new aim is to demolish and replace the main block, and strengthen the gym.</p>
        
            <p>A design is being finalised.</p>
        
            <p>"The design for the new facilities will need to continue to meet our value for money requirements," the ministry's leader of infrastructure and digital, Scott Evans, told RNZ on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The project remains a priority for investment and an amended scope has been confirmed."</p>
        
            <p>The school had a long wrangle with officials over an educational farm they took off it, despite a ministerial promise the school could keep it.</p>
        
            <p>While the school's other building problems have been extensively reported publicly, it was not till January last year that a detailed seismic assessment done for the ministry showed the structural flaws.</p>
        
            <p>The school got independent advice, then went ahead with some stop-gap strengthening work that was finished in September 2023, Evans said.</p>
        
            <p>The leaking roof - inverted like a 'V' in a snow zone - had been repaired, he added.</p>
        
            <p>A "substantial" number of heat pumps had been replaced and extras added, and the ventilation system worked on.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty percent of the school is Māori. The roll is forecast to grow to 320.</p>
        
            <p>A school spokesperson said they had assurances from officials the buildings were safe and that a phased rebuild would start some time next year.</p>
        
            <p>Plumbing work recently resolved the sewage smell, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Interim strengthening of structural weaknesses was done last year.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry had assured the board the school "remains a vital part of the schooling network for the wider Taihape area".</p>
