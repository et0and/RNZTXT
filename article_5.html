            <p>The government has unveiled its school lunches reboot, rolling out a new menu it says will save more than $130 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>The revamped programme includes butter chicken curry, chicken katsu, lasagne, chicken pasta salad and wraps at a cost of $3 each.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition announced plans to scale back the cost of the Ka ora, Ka ako free school lunch programme in intermediate and high schools in early May.</p>
        
            <p>Today, Associate Education Minister David Seymour took reporters through a 'show and tell' of the revamped programme at Parliament.</p>

            <p>He said the reboot saved more money than expected and had set a new standard for government working with businesses to achieve the best outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>"We have embraced commercial expertise, used government buying power, and generated supply chain efficiencies to realise over $130m of annual cost savings, even more than anticipated in Budget 2024."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said if Labour had run the school lunches programme like he was the party could have saved more than $800 million over the past five years.</p>

            <p>"Some suppliers in the existing programme will be affected and I appreciate this will be tough. However, the emphasis of the programme is to ensure students get good meals at an affordable cost to the taxpayer."</p>
        
            <p>All students in Years 0 to 8 would receive the same sized meals (240 grams) and older students would receive larger lunches (at least 300g), which will include additional items such as fruit, yoghurt or muesli bars.</p>
        
            <p>Schools who receive their lunches through the external model would continue to receive a variety of hot and cold meal delivered daily.</p>

            <p>Schools using the internal and iwi/hapÅ« model would have access to a range of government-negotiated wholesale ingredients and could continue to prepare meals internally.</p>
        
            <p>These schools will would receive a slight increase ($4 per meal) in per student funding to continue to employ people to prepare the meals.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he expected the programme would evolve over time but he, the School Lunch Collective, the Expert Advisory Group and the Ministry of Education were focused on a smooth transition for schools on day one of Term 1 2025.</p>

            <p>"I have met with our commercial partners, and they are committed to making this work for the children and the schools. I would like to thank the members of the Expert Advisory Group, the Ministry of Education, affected schools and suppliers for working together so hard, and effectively, to provide a fantastic solution for the kids."</p>
