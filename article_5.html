            <p>The government has announced further details of its plan to improve children's achievement in maths.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford said it would spend $2 million on a trial of catch-up maths lessons for children in Years 7-8 next year.</p>
        
            <p>"The trial will use small group tutoring and supervised online tuition for 30 minutes, up to four times a week for each child," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the initiative would be extended if it was successful.</p>
        
            <p>She also announced the government would spend $30m on resources and workbooks for every primary and intermediate school.</p>
        
            <p>The details followed the government's August announcement it would bring forward introduction of a new maths curriculum by one year to the start of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Initial testing indicated the new curriculum would be more challenging than the current document with about 22 percent of Year 8s expected to reach the expected level of achievement compared with 42 percent under the current curriculum.</p>
