            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown is celebrating what he says is a record investment in public transport.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency confirmed an indicative funding increase of 41 percent for public transport services and operations over the next three years, compared to the previous three.</p>
        
            <p>The previous allocation for the whole country was $1.38 billion.</p>
        
            <p>That will jump to $1.95b once final allocations are confirmed in late August.</p>
        
            <p>By region, Gisborne and Hawke's Bay are set to get the biggest boost with increases of 89 percent and 116 percent, respectively.</p>

            <p>That is from $1.95m to $3.69m for Gisborne and $8m to $17.5m for Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"This government is committed to supporting public transport to provide more travel choices for New Zealanders," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a record investment in public transport services and operations to deliver reliable services to commuters across the country."</p>
        
            <p>Brown also announced the roll-out of contactless debit and credit card payments for use on public transport, through the National Ticketing Solution.</p>
        
            <p>This will also include digital payment methods such as Apple Pay and Google Pay on phones and smart watches.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said this will make public transport services more convenient, easier to use, and deliver a consistent experience.</p>
        
            <p>"These methods are common elsewhere around the world, and it's time New Zealanders had access to the same standard of service."</p>
        
            <p>The service will be rolled out over the next two years, starting in Auckland later this year, Christchurch in early 2025 and all other regions by the end of 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Public transport users will still have the option of a pre-paid transit card.</p>
        
            <p>Labour transport spokesperson Tangi Utikere said the national ticketing system had been in the pipeline for some time so it made sense.</p>
        
            <p>"What does not make sense is the government making it harder for people to access public transport by slashing free and half-price travel during a cost-of-living crisis."</p>
