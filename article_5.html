            <p>On Monday, the government confirmed $604 million over four years in extra Pharmac funding to cover up to 54 new medicines, including 26 cancer drugs.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the newly funded cancer drugs should be available in the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>But it could be more than a year before all the newly-funded treatments are on the market, but cancer patients and advocates have told RNZ they want access as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago Professor of Oncology Chris Jackson said without an increase in staffing to oversee the roll-out there was the potential for huge waiting list issues in six months time. "Six months is a long time in terms of cancer treatments."</p>
