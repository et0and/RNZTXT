            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters and the United Nations Secretary-General discussed the Pacific region and Gaza during official talks overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The pair met in New York, following Peters address to the UN general assembly, in which he accused the Security Council of failing to act decisively in response to the conflict in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he and António Guterres discussed calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was committed to playing its part to aid Palestinians caught up in the conflict, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"UN agencies, including UNRWA, are playing a crucial role in delivering humanitarian assistance and other vital services to Gazans.</p>
        
            <p>"We discussed New Zealand's latest contributions to these efforts, the ongoing investigations into UNRWA, and New Zealand's next annual payment due in June," Peters said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Ealier in the year, New Zealand was among a number of countries reviewing future payments to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) following accusations by Israel that agency staff were involved in the Hamas' attacks on 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>Most have since resumed funding.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he and Guterres also discussed the crucial role the UN has in helping small Pacific states address problems like climate change and economic development.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is honoured to be playing a leadership role in the United Nations in preparing a High Level Meeting on sea level rise in September."</p>
        
            <p>Peters was due to meet with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington DC later in the week.</p>
