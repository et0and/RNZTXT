            <p>ACT leader David Seymour has described Te Pāti Māori as "race fanatics" after a MP told Minister Karen Chhour she did not understand the "essence" of being Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The Children's Minister was facing Parliament's Social Services and Community committee on Wednesday to answer questions about her Oranga Tamariki (Responding to Serious Youth Offending) bill.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation would allow the government to set up a young serious offender category and military-style academy order in the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Mariameno Kapa-Kingi raised concerns with Chhour over the legislation, as well as the minister's removal of Section 7AA from the Act.</p>
        
            <p>"Often in your rhetoric, you refer to ancestry cannot matter more than the safety of a mokopuna, which is absolutely abhorrent to tikanga, it is abhorrent to Māori, it is abhorrent through the way in which we see the world," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour, who is Māori, told Kapa-Kingi she disagreed with what she was saying.</p>
        
            <p>"Because you've got a gap of knowledge, Minister, you don't understand the essence of being Māori," Kapa-Kingi responded.</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first time Kapa-Kingi had directed such comments towards Chhour. Last May, she told Chhour she had been "made a puppet" by her party.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said attacking somebody for not understanding a particular cultural background came from an obsession with race.</p>
        
            <p>"I think when you attack a person and say their problem is they can't understand what it means to be a race, what you're really saying is to your supporters is their race is their most important characteristic and their problems are caused by a lack of primacy for that race. There's been a few political movements in history that have taken that approach, and it hasn't ended well."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said Kapa-Kingi had more experience than anybody else to speak about the inequities of Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"I get how it's seen out of context. But absolutely in context it's about ensuring the removal of 7AA, the way Oranga Tamariki has been a plight on te ao Māori, so I think that's what she's saying and that's the context that we support her in saying that as well," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Te Pāti Māori refused to accept they had done anything wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"That is my point, they are race fanatics, racial supremacists, people who believe that before you can talk about anything else you have to talk about your ethnic background."</p>
        
            <p>It comes as New Zealand First Ministers Shane Jones and Winston Peters made comments towards Green MPs, which resulted in Green musterer Ricardo Menéndez March writing to the Speaker.</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop said he had concerns about the decline of standards in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"We all need to be a bit more civil to each other. It's a serious place, we're sent here in serious economic times to improve the country, and we need a bit of civility in this Parliament."</p>
