            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Finance Minister Nicola Willis are promoting a new childcare rebate that took effect 1 October and urging families to register for payments.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the week that actually people who are struggling with early childcare costs get some relief," Luxon said after a visit to the Rising Stars Lynfield childcare centre.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 October, low-to-middle-income families with young children can register for the new FamilyBoost payment, which was introduced by the government earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Under the FamilyBoost scheme, eligible families earning up to $180,000 will be able to claim up to 25 percent of weekly childcare fees up to a maximum of $975 every three months.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the rebate would help families.</p>
        
            <p>"That help and that assistance is really going to be meaningful to them as they deal with the cost of living crisis and the challenges of running young families, balancing work and life in any given week."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said that applications are easy, although the government's preference would have been that the rebates were automatic.</p>
        
            <p>"We were advised by officials that that wasn't possible with their current systems, so we had a choice of either delaying this for a number of years or delivering on it this year."</p>
        
            <p>"My message to parents is, if you've got early childhood costs go on to the IRD site. I've spoken to parents who have, it's not too hard, and it's worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"Up to $975 in payment, and I want every parent who is eligible for this payment to get what they are entitled to."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said IRD reported that more than 30,000 people have already registered and payments are expected to begin next week.</p>
        
            <p>People can register via Inland Revenue's online system, myIR. Claims for the FamilyBoost payment can be submitted from 1 October for ECE fees invoiced between 1 July and 30 September 2024.</p>
