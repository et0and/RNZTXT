        <h2>Central Hawke's Bay District Council votes to keep Māori ward</h2>
        <p>
The public meeting was packed with people from all walks of life, and ended in a rousing haka when the majority of councillors cast their vote in favour.

            <p>Central Hawke's Bay District Council (CHBDC) has stood by its decision and reaffirmed a Māori ward for the district.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors voted at a meeting held in Waipawa on Thursday, passing a motion to reaffirm an earlier decision to establish a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>The public meeting was packed with people from all walks of life, and ended in a rousing haka when the majority of councillors cast their vote in favour.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, CHBDC voted in favour of introducing a Māori ward for the 2025 and 2028 elections. But a recent law change required councils to either disestablish their Māori wards or agree to a binding poll.</p>

            <p>Councils that established Māori wards without a referendum would have to hold a binding poll alongside the 2025 local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Alex Walker confirmed her support for Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>"Our manu whenua don't have a vote at this table today. We want to proceed and go head on into the consequences. If we don't do something now, the inequities of our structures are only going to get worse.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Kelly Annand also voted in favour.</p>
        
            <p>"How do our Māori feel about over 100 years of having to fight for a voice? But you still show up, and thank you so much for that."</p>
        
            <p>However, councillors Jerry Greer and Tim Aitken voted against the motion.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a substantial move that should go to the public as a referendum, It's not a decision for this council," said Aitken.</p>
        
            <p>"This whole process in New Zealand is creating division... a huge division. For me it's one of the worst things that's happened in this country, we're dividing ourselves on race. It should never have happened."</p>
        
            <p>A number of locals made submissions during the meeting - with a diverse range of opinions from those in support, to those who did not want Māori wards, and even people who were on the fence.</p>
        
            <p>Shelly Burne-Field urged the council to support Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>"I know some people feel a ward based on ethnicity is not something they can support, but I'd like you to think broader than that... think with your heart, think with your wairua.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an urban ward, and there's been no argument about a rural ward ever... I want you to question why we would argue about honouring local iwi with Māori ward."</p>

            <p>Roger Maaka was also calling for better Māori representation at the decision-making table.</p>
        
            <p>"Our voice is under threat," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Anne and Steven Hunt from Takapau were among several members of the public who told the council they did not support Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>"We're here because we have an issue with Māori wards. We feel there is enough segregation in New Zealand at the moment with everything happening... and that's just going to put them on the outer more," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We agree they need to have someone to stand up for them, but to have full a Māori ward doesn't seem to be way to go."</p>
        
            <p>Local business owner Stuart Alan Jane said he did not want Māori wards because of the cost.</p>
        
            <p>"My employees haven't got enough money to buy food… Having extra councillors will put extra costs on."</p>
        
            <p>While Chris Minehan felt discussion around whether to have Māori wards or not had not been thorough enough.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the whole thing has been a bit rushed… with pressure from outside, from central government. I'm not against Māori wards as such, but I don't think there's been enough consultation."</p>
