            <p>The Mexican ambassador is meeting with Foreign Minister Winston Peters in Waitangi, after controversial comments he and his second-in-command made last week.</p>
        
            <p>NZ First senior MP Shane Jones in Parliament last week yelled "send the Mexicans home", and Peters - the party's leader and the deputy prime minister - then said Green Party migrant MPs should "show some gratitude" for being in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens condemned the comments and asked Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Speaker of the House Gerry Brownlee to step in.</p>
        
            <p>Jones and Peters at first rejected criticism of the comments.</p>
        
            <p>However, after Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Bravo raised concerns, Peters acknowledged he could have expressed himself differently.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the minister said the pair would meet at Waitangi to discuss the matter, which would be followed up through diplomatic channels.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking briefly to reporters ahead of the meeting, the ambassador refused to give further details.</p>
        
            <p>"I have instructions from my government to not make comments about this, because… the government of Mexico is dealing with the issue, so we want to respect that."</p>
        
            <p>After a speech on mining, Jones separately said he also hoped to meet with the ambassador - brushing his comments off and saying he would "share a shot of tequila" with him.</p>
        
            <p>"I bear no malice to any Latin American, I've had some of the most exciting nocturnal experiences with the Latin American people," Jones said on Friday.</p>
