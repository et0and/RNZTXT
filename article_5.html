            <p>The three deputy commissioners trying to rescue the public health system are together being paid $650,000 a year in fees.</p>
        
            <p>Roger Jarrold and Ken Whelan were appointed to Te Whatu Ora in August, and Kylie Clegg in September.</p>
        
            <p>An Official Information Act response shows Jarrold's fee is $250,000, while the other two get $200,000.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Lester Levy is paid $320,000. Stuff revealed he also had a part-time academic job.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said Levy's fee, agreed by Cabinet, reflected "the unique and significant demands of this governance role".</p>
        
            <p>It set the fees in consultation with the Ministry of Health.</p>
        
            <p>It also has a chief executive and four new regional deputy chief executives, after scrapping several other senior jobs.</p>
