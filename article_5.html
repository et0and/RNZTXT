        <h2>Live: Stanford won't say if she backs Seymour to fix school lunches</h2>
        <p>
A planned meeting between the Education minister and her associate to discuss the school lunches programme has been delayed, but will rescheduled at the "earliest convenience". Audio
</p>
        
            <p>A planned meeting between the Education Minister and her associate never went ahead after Caucus gatherings this morning ran late.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters ahead of the meeting, Erica Stanford would not say whether she had confidence David Seymour could fix the lunch problems.</p>
        
            <p>She had put school lunches at the top of the agenda for her meeting with Seymour - a regular one between the pair - but that meeting has had to be rescheduled. It's unclear whether there will be time today, but Stanford has asked for the meeting to be rescheduled at the "earliest convenience".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, earlier on Tuesday Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said parents who are dissatisfied with the new school lunch programme should "make a marmite sandwich and put an apple in a bag".</p>
        
            <p>It comes after numerous problems were reported with the school lunches including most recently, plastic melted into the food.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon made the comments during an interview with Newstalk ZB on Tuesday, saying parents who were unhappy with the lunches should pack them themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are unhappy with it, for God's sake, go make a Marmite sandwich and put an apple in a bag just like you and I had."</p>
        
            <p>He said he'd rather have parents take responsibility for feeding their children rather than the government.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon had previously said he expected Associate Education Minister David Seymour to give the school lunch programme his "full attention" after Checkpoint revealed concerns from west Auckland schools about the lunches being late, inedible, repetitive, or failing to meet dietary restrictions.</p>
