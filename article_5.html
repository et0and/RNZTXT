        <h2>GCSB foreign spying capability under scrutiny</h2>
        <p>
The Government Communications Security Bureau denies hosting a foreign spying capability flagged by the watchdog, differentiating it from the system recently criticised.

            <p>The Government Communications Security Bureau says it did not host a foreign spying capability that has come to the watchdog's attention, prior to a system it did host and got castigated for by leading politicians.</p>
        
            <p>The electronic spy agency has also refused to answer questions made under the Official Information Act (OIA) about a third "partner" system that caused concerns four years ago, and what that system did, on security grounds.</p>
        
            <p>In March, the watchdog Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security revealed the GCSB hosted a spy operation under the control and direction of a foreign power without telling the government, from 2013 to 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Its report said there was also a "predecessor" capability that the GCSB was familiar with.</p>
        
            <p>In an Official Information Act response, the GCSB director-general Andrew Clark said: "I can advise that the predecessor capability was not hosted by the GCSB.</p>
        
            <p>"Accordingly, questions of approval or control are not relevant in this case."</p>
        
            <p>Clark withheld further details on the grounds it could prejudice New Zealand's security or defence, or prejudice how information was entrusted to the government by another government or foreign agency.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector-General Brendan Horsley in his report also talked about a third "partner system".</p>
        
            <p>It was internal concerns about this third system in 2020 that led to the hosted system - run since 2013 under foreign orders - being "rediscovered".</p>
        
            <p>There is evidence in GCSB documents that the system run since 2013 was a US one used for targeting in military capture-kill operations, though the agency's own patchy records obscured what went on, the Horsley report showed.</p>
        
            <p>In the OIA response, the GCSB refused to talk about this third "partner system", again on security grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Clark said only that "all systems that require authorisation have the appropriate authorisations in place".</p>
        
            <p>Horsley had noted that a decade ago, the GCSB was authorised to give data to the foreign system it hosted from 2013-20. However, he said: "The authorisation process for intelligence sharing at the time seems manifestly inadequate."</p>
        
            <p>He detailed how it had improved a lot, but also made five recommendations to bolster it further, including:</p>
        
            <p>"A centralised register would provide an important oversight safeguard" currently, Horsley said.</p>
        
            <p>It would have sped up his investigations into other foreign systems operating here, he added.</p>
        
            <p>His report shows the "predecessor" capability was used within the GCSB before; staff there looked into its operation, prior to signing the deal to host the targeting system.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear from records that from the outset the GCSB recognised legal and policy issues with hosting the capability [from 2013-2020], particularly its potential use for supporting military action. GCSB staff had in-depth knowledge of this and how the capability's predecessor had been used," his report said.</p>
        
            <p>Clark refused to detail how it "had been used", in response to the OIA.</p>
        
            <p>As for the third "partner system", Horsely stated that unidentified concerns with it woke up spy bosses to the other, hosted system:</p>
        
            <p>"After its installation, senior GCSB staff and the bureau's legal team lost sight of the capability and its operation. It was 'rediscovered' at a senior level following concerns being raised in 2020 about another partner system hosted by GCSB."</p>
        
            <p>It remains unclear what those concerns were, or if this partner system is still operating.</p>
