            <p>The Foreign Minister is adamant he hasn't changed his position on Aukus Pillar 2 and says he couldn't make a decision now because New Zealand hasn't been invited and doesn't know what it entails.</p>
        
            <p>In a speech on Wednesday night, Winston Peters addressed criticism of the trilateral partnership and said considering joining the second phase of the security pact was a long way off.</p>
        
            <p>Peters told Morning Report all he was doing was continuing work started by the previous government to consider it.</p>
        
            <p>"In the end it is a long trail of investigating, quite rightly, what it might mean and we are a long way from making any decisions here."</p>
        
            <p>Labour maintains that the government's language around Pillar 2 has changed from neutral to pro.</p>
        
            <p>That's partly due to Peters joint statement with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month which said: "We share the view that arrangements such as the Quad, AUKUS, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity contribute to peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and see powerful reasons for New Zealand engaging practically with them, as and when all parties deem it appropriate".</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he personally included the end of the sentence "when all parties deem it appropriate".</p>
        
            <p>"That's what I wanted to be sure, that first of all we knew what we were talking about, we had a discussion in the political system of this country, told the people of this country, after we had been even first of all invited.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the fact of this matter, you've got a whole lot of people way ahead of themselves, making ridiculous comments, they've never been part of any briefing on this matter."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said Pillar 2 could be about "whole lot of things" and that's what he was trying to find out.</p>
        
            <p>He still hoped a bipartisan approach could be reached when it did become time to decide.</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Helen Clark said the idea of joining Pillar 2 should have been dismissed "quite some time ago".</p>
        
            <p>"It's not clear that there is anything on offer that New Zealand A: Would want, and B: If it did want it, couldn't get through other relationships.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear that Aukus Pillar 1 is a nuclear submarine technology agreement which is aimed at containing China."</p>
        
            <p>Clark said it was a "pretty high risk game" to be following US foreign policy regarding China.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand should be a constructive voice for diplomacy and peace, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you keep poking your major trade partner in the eye with statements aligning with the otherside of a dispute that it's in, you do put yourself at some risk."</p>
        
            <p>Peters speech was defensive and he was trying to walk back the statements made in the US, Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you say there are 'powerful reasons' you owe to the New Zealand public to spell out what they are."</p>
