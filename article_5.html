            <p>The government says its emergency housing target has been reached five years early.</p>
        
            <p>But the whereabouts of 20 percent of those leaving emergency housing is still unknown.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, as one of its public service targets, the government aimed to reduce the number of households in emergency housing motels by 75 percent by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Associate housing minister Tama Potaka said on Friday that the target had already been met.</p>
        
            <p>In December 2023, there were 3141 households in motels. In December 2024, there were 591.</p>
        
            <p>"This means thousands of tamariki who were previously consigned with their whƒÅnau to grow up in dank motel rooms are now living in better homes. Homes where they have a better opportunity for regular school attendance, to maintain enrolment with local health services, and to enjoy all the other benefits of having a stable home in a community," Potaka said.</p>
        
            <p>The target had been met through a steady supply of social housing becoming available - with families that had children and had been in emergency housing for twelve weeks or more bumped to the top of the waitlist, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Emergency housing will always be available as a last resort for those who need it, and it's important we continue monitoring the availability and use of emergency housing to ensure we stay on target."</p>
        
            <p>The government had also tightened the criteria for accessing emergency housing, and introduced a warning system for those who did not meet their obligations while staying in emergency housing.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said the government knew about eighty percent of those leaving emergency housing had moved to social, transitional, or private housing with government support, such as the Accommodation Supplement.</p>
        
            <p>That meant one in five people leaving emergency housing were unaccounted for.</p>
        
            <p>In August, Potaka was unable to explain where they had gone, saying they did not have to tell providers where they were going.</p>
