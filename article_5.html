            <p>The Prime Minister heads to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) tomorrow to witness the signing of a new trade deal.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon said the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) cuts tariffs on more than 98 percent of New Zealand's exports to the UAE.</p>
        
            <p>"The UAE is a trusted partner for New Zealand," Luxon said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Our two governments cooperate across a range of shared interests, from expanding renewable energy generation in the Pacific to our desire to de-escalate conflict in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a country where 4000 Kiwis are living and working, and a key transport and logistics hub with more than half a million people coming to New Zealand through the UAE each year."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will witness the signing of the CEPA and accompanying investment agreement by Trade Minister Todd McClay.</p>
        
            <p>Trade between our two countries is currently valued at NZ$1.3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the agreement provides a springboard for New Zealand companies to increase trade and investment as part of the government's efforts to double the value of exports in 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>"While in the UAE, I'll be showcasing New Zealand as a globally connected trading nation, a sustainable technology innovator, and an attractive destination for investment," Luxon said.</p>
