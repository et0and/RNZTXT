            <p>Pharmac is looking to boost access to five more drugs to treat cancers and other conditions as it continues to spend its beefed-up budget.</p>
        
            <p>The drug-funding agency has just started two-weeks' public consultation on its proposal to fund lanreotide acetate for the first time for people with neuroendocrine cancer, cancer-related bowel obstruction, and growth disorder acromegaly.</p>
        
            <p>Director of pharmaceuticals Geraldine MacGibbon said lanreotide was easier to administer than other funded treatments.</p>
        
            <p>The agency was also planning to widen eligibility criteria for four other medicines to treat cancers of the blood, kidney and lung, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking to widen access to chemotherapy and a type of targeted cancer treatment for people who don't currently have any other treatment options available."</p>
        
            <p>The proposal includes:</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on Pharmac's funding proposal for these medicines is now open and will close at 9am on 29 July.</p>
        
            <p>If approved, changes for bendamustine and pemetrexed would take effect from 1 November 2024. The dates for availability of lanreotide and changes to eligibility for sunitinib and pazopanib is still to be confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the government pledged an extra $600 million Pharmac funding over the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>That followed widespread criticism of its failure to deliver National's pre-election promise to fund more cancer treatments.</p>
        
            <p>Not including the most recent cash injection, Pharmac's budget for medicines was set at $1.186 billion this year, and $1.245b next year.</p>
