            <p>Sending children to school when they're sick has consequences for everyone and keeping them home is the right thing to do, says Labour leader Chris Hipkins.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the Government's plan to improve school attendance was announced yesterday and included new public health guidance about when a student is well enough to go to school.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour said "not every ailment means that you should not attend school".</p>
        
            <p>But Hipkins, a former education minister, said as recently as last year principals were struggling to find enough well teachers after students went to school with Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of course what happens, the kid goes to school with Covid, they give it to other kids, they also give it to the teachers.</p>
        
            <p>"The teachers then stay home, because they need to isolate and they need to get better, and the principal says 'hang on a minute I've got kids turning up to school and I haven't got enough teachers to teach them'."</p>
        
            <p>Parents should send their children to school unless there was a good reason not to, Hipkins said. And that didn't include a holiday.</p>
        
            <p>"But if you're keeping your kids home for the right reason, because they're sick, then we should actually be saying to those parents that is a good thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"There's very good reasons why we still want parents to keep their kids home if their kids have got the flu, or a cold, or Covid... other kids get sick, teachers get sick, then other parents get sick and it has a flow on consequence for everybody," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to be saying to parents that you should send kids to school even when they're sick because they've already missed five days you're somehow going to become a bad parent because they get sick a second time in a school term."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins acknowledged there was a problem with school attendance, but said the Government targets wouldn't help address it.</p>
