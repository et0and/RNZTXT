            <p>The Midwifery Council has been directed to rethink controversial changes to its practice guidelines, which had aimed to make them more "inclusive".</p>
        
            <p>A draft version of the scope of practice released for consultation in 2022 replaced the words "woman" and "mother' with the broader term "whānau", which critics said was too ambiguous and took the focus away from the person actually giving birth and the baby.</p>
        
            <p>More than 7000 people signed a petition to Parliament last year opposing the changes.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's Regulation Review Committee received 12 complaints after the final version was published in April, of which it considered six met the threshold for investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Those complainants were mainly concerned that the revamped Scope - which came into effect in October 2024 - did not accurately reflect the role of midwives and could cause confusion, by removing previous references to the "care and treatment of pregnant women, new mothers and their newborn infants up to six weeks post-natal".</p>
        
            <p>"The 2024 Scope more broadly refers to meeting the 'varied health needs' of 'women/persons, babies and whānau'," the committee reported.</p>
        
            <p>"The complainants state that this appears to extend the practice and clientele of midwives beyond their current remit into areas of generalist health care.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, they argue that regulation of the profession may become 'impossible' and that other health care providers may face difficulties in understanding the boundaries of a midwife's role."</p>
        
            <p>Some complainants alleged the wording used in the Scope was "vague" and "ambiguous", and its use of some Māori words and phrases outside of their cultural contexts could result in differing interpretations and confusion.</p>
        
            <p>The Midwifery Council told MPs that the Scope is intended to recognise the increasingly complex role that midwives filled today, which could go "beyond women and their newborn babies" and that some midwives are qualified to provide care which was previously the responsibility of other health professionals.</p>
        
            <p>It said the language was intended to be "inclusive and enabling". It did not de-centre women and babies, but was intended to recognise the "contemporary needs of whānau".</p>
        
            <p>The council said did not want to go back to the "outdated" 2010 Scope, but it was willing to discuss possible changes to the wording.</p>
        
            <p>MPs have suggested making it clear that midwives can only prescribe treatments and medicines "within the scope of their own level of training and expertise".</p>
        
            <p>"References to 'physiological processes' and 'recognition of complexity' are vague and could be clarified by direct mention of pregnancy and childbirth. Similarly, we considered that the wording in clause 8 about midwives 'being responsive to meeting the varied health needs of women/persons, babies and whānau' is overly broad, and does not appear to add anything to the requirements and aims in the Scope."</p>
        
            <p>The committee said it also found the use of the word "persons" (as in "women/persons") was "unclear" in the Scope, and suggested replacing it with "clients" or "patients".</p>
        
            <p>"Although we understand the Council's intent to use inclusive language, we believe it is important to clarify that a midwife's primary role is to care for individuals capable of childbearing through the process of pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum recovery."</p>
        
            <p>The Midwifery Council said it "welcomes the Regulation Review Committees advice and recommendations that the Midwifery Scope of Practice should be amended to provide greater clarity for both midwives and the public".</p>
        
            <p>"The Council will shortly be embarking on a consultation with the midwifery profession and the public on proposed amendments to the Scope of Practice."</p>
