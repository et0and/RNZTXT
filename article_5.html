            <p>The senior official with oversight of the country's public health services has stepped down amid ongoing restructuring of the wider public health sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health has confirmed to RNZ that the Director of Public Health, Dr Nicholas Jones, will finish up in the role on 28 February.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy-Director General Dr Andrew Old, who heads the Public Health Agency, said Jones started a two-year secondment in August 2022, moving from his substantial role as Clinical Director and Medical Officer of Health for Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>He agreed to stay another six months in August 2024, and will return to his job in Hawke's Bay at the end of his secondment.</p>
        
            <p>"I personally want to acknowledge his achievement while with the Agency and thank him for supporting our ongoing work to help New Zealanders live longer lives in good health," Old said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now actively recruiting for his replacement."</p>
        
            <p>The Director of Public Health is a statutory role providing public health leadership across the Public Health Agency, within the Ministry of Health, and the National Public Health Service within Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Sweeping cuts to the National Public Health Service were announced in November, with about 60 jobs set to go on top of 300 vacant roles disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>The resignation comes days after Health NZ chief Margie Apa resigned before the end of her contract.</p>
