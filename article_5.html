            <p>Pharmac's board has started advertising for a new chief executive following the resignation of Sarah Fitt, declaring it wants to become a more empathetic organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Fitt in February announced she was resigning from the role she had held for eight years and would leave the drug-buying agency at end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>Brendon Boyle was appointed Pharmac's acting chief executive while the board searched for a new CEO in New Zealand and overseas.</p>
        
            <p>He had previously been the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development, Department of Internal Affairs and Land Information New Zealand, in addition to health sector roles including a Capital & Coast District Health Board member.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac board chair Paula Bennett said it was looking for a leader to help the agency become a more "outward-focused, empathetic organisation".</p>
        
            <p>"Pharmac has a big work programme ahead and Brendan's wealth of experience delivering what New Zealanders need will lay the foundations of the reset for when the permanent chief executive is appointed."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister David Seymour welcomed Boyle's appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"In a trying fiscal environment, we need to prioritise funding and resources and ensure Pharmac remains focused on the basic function of procuring medicine for people who need it, to the best of its abilities.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year in my letter of expectations I made it clear that I want Pharmac to work in partnership with consumers, clinicians, suppliers and the health sector to improve health outcomes for New Zealanders underpinned by robust data and evidence."</p>
        
            <p>Fitt had faced repeated calls to step down from patients and medical experts, particularly after emails released under the Official Information Act in 2023 that revealed what critics called a "sneering and contemptuous" tone among some Pharmac staff.</p>
        
            <p>Last year a submission calling for Fitt to be sacked was presented to Parliament's health select committee, building off a 100,000-signature petition demanding an overhaul of Pharmac.</p>
