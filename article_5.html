            <p>A South Wairarapa councillor is pushing for her council to stop using Facebook and Instagram, citing a poor ethical track record from parent company Meta.</p>
        
            <p>As a member of the LGBTQ community, councillor Rebecca Gray said the threat of harm for specific communities was increasing on Meta platforms.</p>
        
            <p>She was also concerned by "a change in policies within the social media businesses regarding tolerance of hate speech and disinformation".</p>

            <p>"My concern is by using platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, that if we are using that company, are we saying we are supportive of the harm that company is doing in different communities?" she asked elected members at a recent meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to have the ability to make a conscious decision about what we want to support as a council and what we don't want to support."</p>
        
            <p>Gray's report to the council's Strategy Working Committee made suggestions that the council develop, with urgency, a Digital Communications and Data Integrity policy.</p>
        
            <p>She also suggested the council should immediately withdraw from using social media as a communication tool "until such time as we can be assured of the safety of our whole community and the integrity of democracy on these platforms".</p>
        
            <p>Her report also highlighted concerns with the council's use of artificial intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Alistair Plimmer said the council's use of Facebook was important because it allowed them to put out information reasonably quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"When we are providing emergency information - and to me that's really the only reason we need to be on Facebook - we need to be on systems people are using."</p>
        
            <p>He said he agreed with Gray's concerns and was "not on Facebook because a lot of that crap".</p>
        
            <p>"But i think it's really important that we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater."</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Martin Connelly said the issue was about "what we stand for as a council".</p>
        
            <p>"If you go back 80 years and it turned out a really good way to communicate with people was through a fascist mailout, no matter how good it was, how efficient it was, how cheap it was, we would not want to be associated with it.</p>
        
            <p>"The issues councillor Gray has raised are all about the ethics of us appearing to use a company which stigmatises a group of people in our community."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Kaye McAulay said although she agreed with Gray's concerns, the council needed to communicate with the platforms ratepayers were using which was largely Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's certainly good to look at alternatives, but we have to use the communication channels our ratepayers are using. we can't just go cold turkey."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Pip Maynard said she supported a closer look at social media policy but couldn't see the council withdrawing from social media immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Facebook has 7000 followers and to try to do that right now in the middle of two consultations is a bit of an ask," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A council staff member said work was currently underway on a policy.</p>
        
            <p>Greytown-based digital communications specialist Seamus Boyer said many councils were grappling with navigating the harm social media could cause.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's important to remember the positives that often get overlooked," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Social media can amplify minority voices, help people find their communities online, and create opportunities for those who struggle with social interactions.</p>
        
            <p>"Walking away from Meta wouldn't stop hate and disinformation. What it would do is reduce the council's ability to positively influence existing conversations. And doing this just before an election? That would feel disingenuous."</p>
        
            <p>He said pulling out of Meta would be a massive decision to make with big consequences for community connection.</p>
        
            <p>"Facebook is, by far, the council's largest platform. Many South Wairarapa residents rely on it as their primary way of accessing council news. If the council left, people wouldn't stop talking about local issues - they'd just get their information from potentially less reliable sources."</p>
        
            <p>From a cost perspective, social media remained one of the cheapest communication tools available, Boyer said.</p>
        
            <p>"While it's harder than ever to cut through the noise, it still delivers strong value for small councils working within tight budgets."</p>
