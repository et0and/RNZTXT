        <h2>Quick fix for 98% of potholes on state highways exceeds govt target</h2>
        <p>
Last year the government established a $3.9 billion pothole prevention fund so the NZTA could sort out problems within 24 hours.

            <p>Ninety-eight percent of potholes on state highways have been repaired within 24 hours, according to figures released by the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>The figures exceed targets set by the government, which ordered NZTA to fix 95 percent of potholes within 24 hours in July.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Chris Bishop said it showed the government's pothole prevention plan was getting strong results.</p>
        
            <p>"Since our targets were introduced, NZTA has delivered every month with greater use of new innovations to ensure that temporary pothole repairs last longer before a permanent reseal can take place, instead of simply placing cold mix in potholes," he said.</p>

            <p>Last year the government established a three-year ringfenced $3.9 billion pothole prevention fund for resealing, rehabilitation, and drainage maintenance works on state highways and local roads.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the rehabilitation work would prevent potholes from being formed in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"Increasing productivity to help rebuild our economy is a key priority for our government, and boosting pothole repairs and prevention will deliver a safe and efficient state highway network that will support this growth," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A dedicated tipline was also set up, so members of the public could report potholes to NZTA.</p>
        
            <p>The summer maintenance programme started in October, and will run until March.</p>
