            <p>Cycling advocates say the government is pumping an eye watering amount of money into a roading project in south Auckland that was put on ice three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Transport Minister Simeon Brown unveiled the government's draft statement on land transport, which includes plans to revive the Mill Road corridor project and the East West Link.</p>
        
            <p>The two roading projects come with big price tags.</p>
        
            <p>The first stage of Mill Road was set to cost $1.3 billion, and the East West Link is set to cost $1.9b.</p>
        
            <p>Communities in South Auckland are celebrating the return of the projects but it was not without its critics.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Hormann, chairperson of cycling advocacy group Bike Auckland, said the cost for the projects were staggering.</p>
        
            <p>"These are eye wateringly expensive, big, projects, at a time where a lot of things are being cut," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The projects needed to work for everyone, Hormann said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have all the details, but, the way the funding has been proposed in the [Government Policy Statement], it's likely that they will be just carbon trucks that are being accommodated," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're spending a lot of money and we're not actually providing infrastructure for everybody."</p>
        
            <p>She was worried big roading projects would create accessibility issues for residents.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got Onehunga, which is quite a big residential area, families and kids, and instead you're going to bring in more cars and more trucks," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what happens when you build roads, it just brings more vehicles, so that makes the whole area less appealing, less safe, and less accessible."</p>
        
            <p>The draft policy statement featured a proposed fuel tax increase of 12 cents to hit all at once in 2027, and a plan to hike vehicle registration fees by a total of $50.</p>
        
            <p>Manurewa-Papakura ward councillor Daniel Newman said the Mill Road project was essential to keep up with the area's growth.</p>
        
            <p>"The growth is real, it is there, and we're already years late to provide an alternate transport corridor, so that's why Mill Road has to be delivered," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted Auckland Council to support the draft policy statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Mill Road needs to happen," Newman said.</p>
        
            <p>"It needed to start a long time ago, and I think that the draft [Government Policy Statement] which includes Mill Road is a big step forward."</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson of the Papakura Local Board, Brent Catchpole, described the Mill Road project as overdue.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an obvious choice for when the main motorway, State Highway One, clogs up," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will take a lot of traffic and heavy trucks away from there as well, so this is absolutely gold for Papakura and the people in the south."</p>
        
            <p>The draft policy statement is out for consultation and closes on 2 April.</p>
