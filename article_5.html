            <p>There are calls for an independent review to be conducted into New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) housing and accommodation, as part of a new advocacy campaign launched on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Mission Homefront has been developed to raise awareness about the challenges experienced by service people and their whānau.</p>
        
            <p>The campaign is spearheaded by military spouse Erin Speedy, who wrote an open letter to the government detailing the problems being faced.</p>
        
            <p>Speedy said they included personnel living in damp, cold and mouldy homes, substandard house maintenance, and some families struggling financially.</p>
        
            <p>"Some instances being described include a family who had no toilet for two months and were forced to use the neighbouring house's toilet," Speedy said.</p>
        
            <p>She said another family was left without heating for three months, while others have reported living in homes in negative temperatures with poor insulation and drafts.</p>
        
            <p>"Personnel and civilians are submitting stories of living in damp, cold and mouldy homes, children and adults suffering constant and recurring illnesses including mould toxicity, respiratory infections and asthma problems that are leaving some hospitalised," Speedy said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way uniformed members across our armed forces are being treated is heartbreaking and negligent, leading to all kinds of negative outcomes for individuals, whānau and tamariki."</p>
        
            <p>Speedy said it was an extremely hard lifestyle to live, particularly when posted to remote and isolated communities with no civilian opportunities, support and lack of facilities such as childcare and medical centres.</p>
        
            <p>"One spouse told how they were left with PTSD due to the lack of support available when their partner was overseas for a long period of time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Personnel are also detailing how high attrition rates have left them stressed and burnt out, sometimes forced to do the jobs of up to five people in their units."</p>
        
            <p>There needs to be an independent review into NZDF housing and accommodation, Speed said, as well as cross party political support to ensure Defence and its people were funded and remunerated appropriately.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is, Defence spending isn't about arms and heavy weapons, it's about investing in people and capabilities to have the ability to respond to events in our own backyard, the Pacific and globally.</p>
        
            <p>"The welfare and serving conditions of our Defence Force personnel and their whānau needs to be a top priority, and they need to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve."</p>
        
            <p>NZDF has been approached for comment.</p>
