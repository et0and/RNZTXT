        <h2>Howzat? NZ-India trade negotiators given shot of urgency</h2>
        <p>
It came after both Luxon and Trade Minister Piyush Goyal upped the ante at a business event in Delhi, joking about getting a deal done in 60 days.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has had to dial back expectations over the timeline for a free trade agreement with India after a burst of enthusiasm overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It came after both Luxon and India's Trade Minister, Piyush Goyal, upped the ante at a business event in Delhi, joking about getting a deal done in a breakneck 60 days.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon later told media not to take that deadline literally, but he stressed both sides wanted talks to move with pace.</p>
        
            <p>He said discussions had been brought forward from next month to next week, following his meeting with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's four-day trip to India began with an announcement that trade talks between the two countries would restart, a decade after the first effort collapsed.</p>

            <p>Enthusiasm over the prospect was brimming at a NZ-India Business and Economic Forum hosted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce late Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Addressing the audience, federation chair Anish Shah said the two trade ministers had told him they were aiming for the "fastest trade negotiation that they have ever done".</p>
        
            <p>In a later speech, NZ business delegation co-chair Dame Therese Walsh noted that a closed CEO roundtable meeting had discussed the possibility of settling a deal within 90 days.</p>
        
            <p>"If 90 days was achieved, I promise to come back here in 90 days. And in fact, we all do."</p>
        
            <p>Goyal then ramped up the stakes: "What if we were to complete it in 60 days?"</p>
        
            <p>In response, Luxon quipped that that speed would see both countries' trade ministers lose all their hair.</p>
        
            <p>He concluded his speech thusly: "I look forward to, with Prime Minister Modi, signing that deal in 60 days' time."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters several hours later, Luxon sought to temper expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't take the 60-to-90 days literally," he said. "It'll take as long as it takes. It's important we negotiate as hard as we can."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the comments from both sides should be seen as a deliberate message to their teams "very strongly" that they expect them to move quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"There is real intention and real juice and energy...this thing doesn't need to get bogged down."</p>
        
            <p>Trade Minister Todd McClay told reporters both ministers had directed negotiators to go "as quickly as they can", not to get the quickest-ever deal.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said his commitment remained to get the deal done within his first term, despite telling NewstalkZB on Tuesday that his private expectation was to get it done by the end of this year.</p>

            <p>The PM bristled when asked about the changeable timeline by reporters in India, saying that focus on timing was "fascinating" given earlier scepticism.</p>
        
            <p>"I told you that we will deliver a free trade agreement in the first term. You were very sceptical about that as a media."</p>
        
            <p>He went on: "I get underestimated and doubted all the time. We just chunk on through...don't worry, we're focused on outcomes and results."</p>

            <p>Luxon spent his last full day in Delhi with a colourful programme, including a spot of street cricket with underprivileged Indian children.</p>
        
            <p>The game was a light moment organised by the charity STAIRS which saw the prime minister face off with children, using a stack of bricks as stumps.</p>
        
            <p>Also taking part was former Indian great Kapil Dev, as well as Kiwi cricketers Ross Taylor and Ajaz Patel, who are part of the NZ delegation.</p>

            <p>Earlier in the day, Luxon visited Swaminarayan Akshardham, the largest Hindu temple in India.</p>
        
            <p>The temple usually hosts up to 7000 visitors every day, but the site and surrounding roads were closed in preparation for the prime minister's visit.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was met by head priest Swami Ji, who placed a garland around Luxon's neck and tied a bracelet around his wrist before guiding him around the grounds.</p>
