        <h2>Opposition told to regroup, fight the coalition</h2>
        <p>
The opposition has been told not to lick its wounds for too long, so it can join the fight against the new government's policies affecting Māori.

            <p>The Labour Party and the Green Party were welcomed onto Te Whare Rūnanga on the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāpuhi rangatira Hone Sadler told the politicians Māori were sick of fighting but could not stop, as the price to pay was their children and grandchildren's futures.</p>
        
            <p>He asked them not to lick their post-election wounds for too long so they could regroup and come up with a strategic plan to oppose the coalition's policies.</p>
        
            <p>The new government has committed to supporting legislation to redefine the principles of the Treaty up to the Select Committee stage, on top of repealing Te Aka Whai Ora (The Māori Health Authority) and Oranga Tamariki law allowing iwi and hapū involvement in the uplift of children.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has repeatedly stated National has no intentions of supporting the Treaty Principles Bill beyond first reading but stopped short of categorically ruling it out.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on the marae, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said it was disingenuous for Luxon to distance himself from the legislation when it would be introduced in the name of his government.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand will not move forward and achieve all our potential as a country if we have political leaders that seek to drive a wedge between us. I think we are a better country than that."</p>

            <p>Hipkins said many non-Māori New Zealanders rejected the coalition's policies affecting Māori and wanted to see the work governments -led by both Labour and National - had started.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of non-Māori New Zealanders that totally reject the kaupapa of this government; that want to see the work we started continue; but not just the work that we have started; the work that has continued through successive governments, be they Labour or National.</p>
        
            <p>"This government shouldn't turn their back on their own track record, because progress has been made under them in the past as well. We have to continue to move forward as a country and that means fronting up; being here at Waitangi for more than just the pōwhiri."</p>

            <p>Speaking to reporters afterwards, Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said it was Luxon's responsibility as prime minster to enhance the articles of Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>"That bill (Treaty Principles Bill) doesn't need to go into the house. The discussion that is going to incite fear of Māori governance, fear of Te Tiriti should not go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, he should be a leader of Aotearoa New Zealand that highlights the benefits, positives and aspirations that people on the ground already know."</p>

            <p>Outgoing Labour MP Kelvin Davis gave his final speech as a politician at Te Whare Rūnanga today; telling the crowd the lion's den of government representatives was about to arrive, and not to speak to decision makers like lambs.</p>
        
            <p>The former Māori-Crown Relations Minister said if the coalition heard the anger of Māori, they may not follow through with some of its policies.</p>
        
            <p>He also expressed his disappointment Te Paati Māori did not walk onto the marae with the other opposition parties, Labour and the Greens.</p>
        
            <p>Te Paati Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer has confirmed her party will be walking onto the marae with the Kīngitanga tomorrow.</p>
