            <p>The government has released the list of organisations it provided information to on how to apply for fast-track consents - just hours before public submissions on the bill close.</p>
        
            <p>The list contains the identities of the stakeholders, and includes district councils, iwi, mining companies, housing developers, power companies, and fisheries.</p>
        
            <p>However, it contains no details on potential projects.</p>
        
            <p>The Fast-track Approvals Bill aims to speed up approvals for infrastructure and development projects of regional or national significance, and reduce consenting costs.</p>
        
            <p>An advisory panel has been set up to recommend projects for fast-tracking.</p>
        
            <p>However, cabinet ministers Chris Bishop, Shane Jones, and Simeon Brown have the final sign-off over which projects are included in the legislation.</p>
        
            <p>The application process closes on 3 May.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop's office had already released the letter he sent to the companies.</p>
        
            <p>Although the letter indicates the companies were invited to apply, or had a high level of interest in applying, Bishop said it should not be assumed a stakeholder on the list will submit a project.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a courtesy form letter which simply directed potential applicants to the Ministry for the Environment's online application form," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having been sent this letter in no way guarantees that an applicant will choose to submit a project into the new process. If they did choose to submit a project, having received the form letter from me does not mean they would receive any preferential treatment."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said ministers and agencies had received a series of Official Information Act requests for the list, so he was releasing it "in the interests of transparency".</p>
        
            <p>However, Forest & Bird has disputed this. Its conservation and advocacy group manager Richard Capie said the only reason the list was released was because Forest & Bird had complained to the ombudsman.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed it had received a complaint.</p>
        
            <p>"We can confirm the chief ombudsman received a complaint from Forest and Bird as described by the minister's office and commenced an investigation under urgency given the timeframes involved. The chief ombudsman conveyed a provisional opinion on Wednesday this week to the minister, however the matter was resolved by the minister's decision to release the fast track stakeholder list today."</p>
        
            <p>Forest & Bird is one of the groups that sent OIA requests, and has frequently criticised a lack of transparency behind the bill, and the power it gives the three ministers.</p>
        
            <p>"That the government didn't want to release this information and that it's now only coming out the day that submissions close shows just how anti-democratic this whole thing is," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Bishop said the claim the ombudsman had forced the release was false, and that Forest & Bird had actually asked the ombudsman to order the release of a list of possible projects ministers may wish to consider for inclusion in the bill.</p>
        
            <p>"This list was never substantively considered by ministers as it was around that time that Cabinet agreed an Expert Advisory Group should be stood up to undertake a more thorough and independent analysis of projects that could be included in the bill. I explained to the ombudsman that to release that list of projects would be confusing and misleading, given it had been set aside in favour of the Expert Advisory Group process," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"The ombudsman did not order the release of that long-since discarded projects list, but as a sign of good faith I proactively offered to release this list of stakeholders. This was agreed to this morning, and I have released the list of stakeholders on the same day."</p>
        
            <p>Public submissions on the bill close at 11:59pm on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Forest & Bird said it was "deeply cynical" that the list was released just hours before the deadline. It said the submission process should be extended, now that the identities of who received the letter had been made public.</p>
        
            <p>"How much longer will New Zealanders be kept waiting to find out which of these organisations will have their projects included in the first 100 projects destined to be fast-tracked?" Capie said.</p>
        
            <p>"In light of this just-released information, at the very least, the select committee needs to extend the submission process so that people have time to see what kind of environmental destruction is being proposed in their communities."</p>
