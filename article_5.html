        <h2>Listen: Luxon says 'no need to meet' with hīkoi at Parliament</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister says organisers were "closely aligned" with Te Pāti Māori, but acknowledged it was "a significant day". Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is standing by his decision not to front the hīkoi outside Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He said the organisers were "closely aligned" with Te Pāti Māori, but acknowledged it was "a significant day".</p>
        
            <p>While te Hīkoi mō te tiriti is over for now, the Treaty Principles Bill isn't - yet.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour insists hīkoi supporters don't represent all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>But hīkoi supporters were proud of taking a stand.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report there were "strong passions" on both sides of the debate, but he believed National's position was the right one - "we think we've got a better approach, issue by issue".</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori was not bothered by criticisms that the hīkoi was simply a campaign event for the party.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said there were people from all races and age groups taking part who came together to defend Māori rights.</p>
        
            <p>She said the Government was attacking tangata whenua, indigenous rights, and te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said there was no sign the Government would do anything to stop work on the Treaty Principles Bill following Tuesday's historic protest against it.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report the government has not listened.</p>
        
            <p>"We're at a tipping point in Aotearoa."</p>
        
            <p>There was "one opposition, collective opposition", to the treatment of the Treaty, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"A heavy Māori kaupapa agenda" at the beginning of 2025 would be the scene of "a lot of debate".</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Luxon dismissing the hīkoi as a protest solely by Te Pāti Māori was "pathetic".</p>
        
            <p>"It shows he's either arrogant or out of touch or potentially both," Hipkins told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>He said he stood and listened to the hīkoi event for about three hours. The strong message was of unity, Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>He didn't speak because it was clear they didn't want the event to be overtaken by politicians, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"David Seymour doesn't understand this, a conversation involves listening as well as talking, he seems to think he can have a conversation in which he's the only one that talks."</p>
        
            <p>Peeni Henare spoke on behalf of Labour, Hipkins said. "Yesterday was not about me."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier Reuben Taipari told First Up the hīkoi was lead by a new young movement.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very much into the popular unification, bringing everybody together, from all cones and all races and all denominations and that's wonderful."</p>
        
            <p>But the government "need to be careful", he told First Up. The "old school" were still there, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we get mad enough, if we get angry at this government who aren't listening to the voice of the people, yeah we'll come back and we'll be doing it our way and that's the old hardcore way of doing things, that's protesting, it's making massive confrontations against the government for them to listen."</p>
