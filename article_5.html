            <p>Three suspected scammers who posed as spiritual practitioners have been arrested after allegedly defrauding victims of thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>The Chinese nationals - a 50-year-old man, and two women aged 59 and 53 - were arrested at Auckland International Airport on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said the trio arrived in New Zealand in October last year and began operating a scam where they deceived people into believing that they or their loved ones were cursed, and would offer spiritual healing in exchange for money or valuable items.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Craig Bolton said the trio were facing joint charges in relation to two victims - one who lost $14,500 worth of jewellery, and another who lost $15,000.</p>
        
            <p>He said the accused targeted immigrant or elderly communities.</p>
        
            <p>Bolton said while two victims had been identified so far, he believed there could be more victims in the Chinese community.</p>
        
            <p>He said victims were pressured to hand over cash or jewellery, and given packages in exchange.</p>

            <p>They would be instructed not to open the packages, only to later discover the contents were worthless.</p>
        
            <p>"In New Zealand, blessing scams have predominantly targeted Chinese communities, exploiting cultural beliefs in spiritual healing and curses," Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>"This type of fraud has been active in New Zealand for more than 15 years, with a notable rise in cases in Auckland in recent years."</p>
        
            <p>He was urging anyone who may have fallen victim to the scam to contact police, and for members of the Chinese community to raise awareness with their elderly relatives.</p>
