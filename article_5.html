            <p>Applications for money from the government's new mental health fund will open this month, the Mental Health Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>Matt Doocey and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon are visiting Middlemore Hospital in Auckland for the announcement which also covered a set of five targets to be met in the sector.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwis were facing major challenges trying to access mental health services, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Progress had been made in the past 20 years, but challenges included people waiting weeks or sometimes months to see a counsellor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Supporting New Zealanders with their mental health is a priority for this government."</p>
        
            <p>That was why the government had set up the $10m fund for mental healthcare innovation.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said the target was 80 percent of people seen within three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Another one was a shorter stay in EDs for those with mental health issues. The aim was people to be admitted, discharged or transferred within six hours.</p>
        
            <p>The training of mental health and addiction staff each year would be increased to 500 instead of the current 480.</p>
        
            <p>"These targets will help lift the focus on mental health."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said if the targets and the fund worked as hoped it would be "powered up".</p>
        
            <p>"Let's give it a go because we've got to do something different from what we've been doing."</p>
        
            <p>The Mental Health and Addiction Community Sector Innovation Fund was among new health spending announced in Budget 24.</p>
        
            <p>"The fund will support new and innovative initiatives that are focused on increasing access to better mental health support, a top priority for me as New Zealand's first Mental Health Minister," Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>The government did not have all the answers, however, schemes to help were available in the community and just needed some backing, Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>The government would need to see certain priorities be addressed for those seeking funding including:</p>
        
            <p>The fund will be open to all NGOs (non-government organisations) and community mental health and addiction providers, including iwi-based and other Kaupapa Māori providers.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey expected the first contracts to be in place before the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The government has already announced $24 million over four years for Gumboot Friday to provide free mental health counselling services to young people aged between five and 25.</p>
        
            <p>Today's announcement comes soon after a report that there has been a dramatic dropoff in New Zealanders able to access specialist mental health and addiction services over the past five years, has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>The Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission's Kua Tīmata Te Haerenga five-year monitoring report released last month showed thousands fewer people were able to access specialist help.</p>
