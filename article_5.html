        <h2>NZ and Philippines pledge defence cooperation amid rising tensions</h2>
        <p>
The commitment came after a sit-down meeting between Christopher Luxon and President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Romualdez Marcos Jr overnight.

            <p>New Zealand and the Philippines have pledged to bolster defence ties - making it easier for their armed forces to work together - as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>The commitment came after a sit-down meeting between Christopher Luxon and President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Romualdez Marcos Jr overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It was the final stop on the prime minister's South East Asia tour - with Luxon due to return to New Zealand early Sunday, and he clearly hit it off with his counterpart during their first proper meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand delegation received a grand and lavish reception - a state banquet at the Presidential Palace preceded by a full military welcome complete with cannon; a performance of 'P≈çkarekare Ana' accompanied by a spectacular fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>On his way there, Luxon first stopped at a popular chicken joint, with Marcos saying it "immediately qualifies you as a honourary Filipino".</p>
        
            <p>Not such a laughing matter is the game of chicken playing out right now in the surrounding seas. The prime minister is in town at a pivotal time for regional security - with the Philippines and China clashing over the disputed territory in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>Marcos highlighted the South China Sea in their joint media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"The Philippines welcomes New Zealand's continued commitment to advocate for the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, including through the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon in turn acknowledged "President Marcos' leadership on the international stage with both of us focused on building international partnerships".</p>
        
            <p>Just this week, the Philippines and the US announced plans for an expansive military drill starting Monday - a warfare simulation in nearby waters.</p>
        
            <p>Beijing is not happy about it, issuing a strong rebuke: stop making trouble - stop the provocation. Analysts say tensions in the region are the highest they've been in years.</p>
        
            <p>That is worrying news for New Zealand - dependent on China for trade - but tending towards the US for security.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, New Zealand agreed to work more closely with the Philippines on matters of security - to enhance interoperability allowing both countries' armed forces to conduct more complex engagements.</p>

            <p>Australia sealed a similar pact with the Philippines three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon earlier told RNZ he was open to the possibility of troops joining more maritime exercises in the South China Sea.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will take part in next week's military exercise - but only watching on. The question is: for how long can New Zealand stay just an observer?</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Marcos Jr agreed to elevate the relationship between the two countries to a Comprehensive Partnership by 2026, marking the 60th anniversary of bilateral relations and aiming to increase two-way trade by 50 percent by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is expected to visit the country to further discuss the partnership later in the year.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said defence cooperation was a "key focus of the meeting", including establishing the legal architecture to allow our defence forces to do more together by the end of this year. They agreed to sign a Mutual Logistics Supporting Arrangement by the end of 2024, and to conclude a Status of Visiting Forces Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The statement noted New Zealand was providing $19.4m in climate finance to the Philippines through the Asian Development Bank's s Energy Transition Mechanism.</p>
        
            <p>As with the previous joint statements with the prime ministers of Singapore and Thailand, this one included mention of various global developments, highlighting the South China Sea, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the situation in Gaza - including the Filipino migrant workers who died in the 7 October attacks in Israel - Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and the military coup in Myanmar.</p>
