            <p>A Green Party spokesperson has confirmed the party is aware police are investigating a third allegation of shoplifting against its MP Golriz Ghahraman.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a matter for police to investigate," the party has said.</p>
        
            <p>The police confirmed today they received a report of shoplifting at Cre8iveworx on Cuba Street in Wellington, which allegedly occurred on 26 October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Cre8iveworx has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman has returned to New Zealand, she was away on a personal trip that had been planned months ago when allegations surfaced last week that she had shoplifted from Auckland clothing retailer Scotties Boutique before Christmas.</p>

            <p>Green Party co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw earlier said they would address the matter with Ghahraman when she returned to New Zealand, which a party spokesperson confirmed on Monday she had done.</p>
        
            <p>The party confirmed last week she had stood down from all of her portfolio responsibilities until the matter had been resolved. She remains an MP.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw and Davidson on Friday said the party had been aware of the accusation relating to Scotties since 27 December, but they had not made a statement at the time because the store did not want the matter made public and were happy to wait for Ghahraman to return.</p>
        
            <p>They also confirmed they had been informed, on 5 January, of a second allegation of shoplifting at Scotties Boutique.</p>
        
            <p>Scotties Boutique has continually refused to comment on the matter when approached by RNZ, although a worker confirmed they had been spoken to by police.</p>
