            <p>The Foreign Affairs Minister says a social media account posing as an 'MFAT insider' is likely a disgruntled former employee.</p>
        
            <p>The X account claims to provide "views from inside the 195", the Ministry of Foreign Affairs home base in Wellington's CBD.</p>
        
            <p>It regularly attacks political and public service leaders and has been very critical of New Zealand's response to the war in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Winston Peters confirmed he had been briefed about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes I have and let me say that of all the departments in this country the most professional is Foreign Affairs and we don't comment on things like that. We don't encourage those sort of people."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was likely a former employee, adding the information they were sharing on social media wasn't correct.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not paying it no attention. It's probably a disgruntled former person, we think.</p>
        
            <p>"The information is not correct that's why we know the person doesn't know what they're doing."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the agency didn't share information about its internal processes for investigating potential information leaks.</p>
