            <p>The new government has confirmed its plan for its first 100 days, with 49 items Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says are "ambitious for New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>The new Cabinet met today for the second time to discuss the plan, which combines the 100-day plan National campaigned on with the priorities of its two partner parties ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Announcing it at his first post-Cabinet briefing on Wednesday, Luxon said New Zealanders voted for a change of government, a change of policies and a change of approach.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government is starting the way we mean to go on - ambitious for New Zealand. With 49 actions to deliver in the next 100 days, this plan is hugely ambitious but we will be working as hard as we can," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop said the new Parliament would get started from next week with the usual ceremonial matters.</p>
        
            <p>This starts with the election of a Speaker on Tuesday, and the official opening on Wednesday with the Governor-General delivering the Speech from the Throne - laying out the government's agenda.</p>
        
            <p>This would be debated by party leaders, with a few first speeches from new MPs rounding out the week. The following week would then include further debate and maiden speeches, while the government would also move into urgency to pass and repeal a series of laws.</p>
        
            <p>They were aiming to pass four pieces of legislation repealing laws Labour brought in, as well as progressing 90-day trials to select committee, by Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"The first bill that we will introduce and move through all stages will be a bill to return the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to a single mandate, a single focus on fighting inflation," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"We intend to move a bill to repeal the Labour government's Fair Pay - or so-called Fair Pay - legislation to repeal that through all stages. We will remove and repeal the Natural and Built Environment Act, and the Spatial Planning Act - Labour's RMA 2.0 Acts - through all stages.</p>
        
            <p>"We will repeal the ute tax - the Clean Car Discount - through all stages, and we will introduce and refer to select committee a bill to extend 90-day trial periods for all businesses."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon again said the plan was ambitious.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're going to do more in 100 days than the (last) government did in the last six years".</p>
        
            <p>The plan revolves around three focus areas: The economy, law and order, and public services.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about his confidence in getting through all the items on the 100-day plan, Luxon said the way they went through negotiations was working through the policy programmes from all three parties.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there's a lot in it, we know we've got a massive amount of ambition, we know we're biting off a lot in order to get it done, but we're determined to do so. So frankly, hitting the country with a lot more intensity than we've observed in the last six years, to say 'we are going to get things done'."</p>
