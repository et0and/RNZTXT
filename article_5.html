            <p>The country's newly minted health minister is expected to make an announcement about the future of the new Dunedin Hospital on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister re-allocated the portfolio to Simeon Brown earlier this month, saying his government would have a "ruthless focus" on health this year.</p>
        
            <p>Brown will be in Dunedin later on Friday, where it is expected he will share details with the public about the coalition's plan for the new hospital build.</p>
        
            <p>The rebuild has dogged the coalition since September, when it announced a budget blowout and asked Health New Zealand for urgent advice to find ways to keep costs in line.</p>
        
            <p>A government-commissioned report had found plans for the hospital could not be delivered within the $1.88 billion budget set in 2017.</p>

            <p>The report projected costs could balloon to $3 billion, a figure the coalition described as unaffordable.</p>
        
            <p>It prompted about 35,000 people to march through the city streets to voice passionate opposition to any cuts to the new hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Cuts, delays, shelving spaces or developing the old hospital site had been put back on the table as ways of reducing costs.</p>
        
            <p>Friday's announcement is expected late morning.</p>
