            <p>The government has unveiled its Defence Force leadership with new chiefs for the navy and army.</p>
        
            <p>Brigadier Rose King will be promoted to Major General - the first woman appointed in that role - and Commodore Garin Golding will become Rear Admiral.</p>
        
            <p>Air Vice-Marshal Darryn 'Digby' Webb had been air force chief since last year and would continue in the role - with all three being appointing for three years from 27 August.</p>
        
            <p>They report to Defence Force Chief Air Marshal Tony Davies.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Defence Minister Judith Collins said she looked forward to working closely with all three.</p>
        
            <p>"These accomplished leaders are the New Zealand Defence Force's most senior officers in their service, bringing a wealth of experience and strategic insight and being dedicated to serving our country," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Commodore Golding had been NZDF maritime component commander since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Brigadier King has been acting chief of army since June. From 2022 to 2024 she was the deputy chief of army.</p>
        
            <p>Webb had been chief of air force since 2023. From 2021 to 2023 he was assistant chief of defence - strategic commitments and engagements.</p>
        
            <p>He was perhaps most well known to New Zealanders for his role during the Covid-19 pandemic overseeing the quarantine facilities.</p>
