            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has flown to Melbourne commercially because of a fault with the Defence Force plane.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon headed across the Tasman to meet leaders of Southeast Asian nations, on the sidelines of a special Australia-ASEAN summit.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to fly out on a Defence Force Boeing 757 aircraft about 6am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>After several delays, media were told the Defence Force had identified a "maintenance fault" with the plane and advised the Prime Minister to fly on a commercial service.</p>

            <p>Luxon is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with Southeast Asian nation leaders including the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, and the prime ministers of Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
        
            <p>The late arrival could disrupt his schedule with two of the meetings due to take place before he lands in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"Southeast Asia is incredibly important for New Zealand. The ASEAN bloc is our third largest goods export market. Stepping up our focus on the region reflects the impact it has on New Zealand's strategic and economic interests," Luxon said in a statement before leaving.</p>
        
            <p>While in Melbourne he will also meet trans-Tasman business leaders, and returns on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Last year a back-up Boeing 757 was sent to Asia in case of a break down in the Defence Force plane carrying Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and his delegation to China. The move attracted international attention and criticism from National and ACT who described it as a source of national embarrassment.</p>
        
            <p>At the time Luxon said the would not commit to replacing the plane earlier than the planned 2028-2030 timeframe.</p>
