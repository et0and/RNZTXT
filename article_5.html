            <p>An appeal by former Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman to have her shoplifting convictions wiped, has been dismissed by the Auckland High Court.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Ghahraman was convicted on four counts of shoplifting, and fined $1600 and an additional $260 in court costs.</p>
        
            <p>Her request to be discharged without conviction was at the time dismissed by Judge June Jelas.</p>
        
            <p>Her further appeal has now been dismissed.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
        
            <p>Concerns had been raised about a conviction making it difficult to revive her legal career.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Venning said there was no evidence to show that the Law Society wouldn't approve her application for a practising certificate based on her conviction.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was also no evidence to show whether her conviction would affect her application for jobs at the International Criminal Court.</p>
