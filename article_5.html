        <h2>Watch: Govt marks its own work, PM speaks at postcab briefing</h2>
        <p>
The PM is unveiling the government's plan for the next three months - and it has scored itself highly for recent efforts.
</p>
        
            <p>The government has unveiled its action plan for the next three months, giving itself a mark of 35 out of 36 for its April through June efforts.</p>
        
            <p>The second-quarter plan followed the government's initial 100-day agenda, which Prime Minister Christopher Luxon boasted about having completed - but RNZ's closer analysis revealed the completion of 15 of the 49 actions was up for debate.</p>
        
            <p>The second plan's 36-point list covered the three months of April, May and June - with a concrete deadline of Sunday the 30th June.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon, speaking to media after this week's Cabinet meeting, said the second quarter plan had been completed successfully, with 35 out of 36 actions completed and "the remaining target well on the way to delivery".</p>
        
            <p>The incomplete item was to "take decisions to disestablish Te PÅ«kenga and consult on a proposed replacement model", with a note explaining that decisions had been taken and consultation was due to begin "shortly".</p>
        
            <p>The government marked three items as complete, but with the details "yet to be announced". These included:</p>
        
            <p>"We ticked off 49 actions in our 100-Day Plan and we have continued to build on that momentum. I want Kiwis to know that we have no plans to slow down," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He also announced the plan for the next three months, again saying it "will have a strong focus on making Kiwis safer and restoring law and order".</p>
        
            <p>"This includes passing four laws that will crack down on criminal activity and support offenders to turn their lives around," he said, highlighting laws the government was aiming to pass.</p>
        
            <p>These included banning gang patches in public, restricting gang members from associating with each other, bolstering firearm seizure powers, increasing rehab access for remand prisoners, and "improve efficiency in the courts and increase access to justice".</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has become a country in which it's too hard to get things done, so it is vital that we take steps to make it easier to deliver long term projects."</p>
        
            <p>He also specifically highlighted the introduction of its military-style academies for young offenders, and the introduction of a Young Serious Offender category.</p>
        
            <p>However, the government is facing criticism over that approach after official information revealed the volunteer-based course that served as its blueprint had led Defence Force staff to suffer serious mental illness including several cases of suicidal ideation.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force had also warned the government to stop comparing the two programmes, saying they were "not comparable" due to several major differences and continuing to do so could lead to public misunderstanding about the Defence Force's involvement in the new scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell has since said this did not mean the LSV programme was not successful, and brushed off suggestions the boot camps would be even harder on NZDF personnel considering participants would be there by order of the court.</p>
        
            <p>Rebuild the economy and ease the cost of living</p>
        
            <p>Restore law and order</p>
        
            <p>Deliver better public services</p>
