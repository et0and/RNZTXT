            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has thanked US President Joe Biden for hosting him and other NATO allies and partners at the White House.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a wonderful night at the White House, and I want to thank President Biden and the First Lady for hosting NATO allies and partner countries for a very enjoyable evening," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had the pleasure of talking with the President who expressed his love for New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>It had previously been uncertain whether Luxon would be able to secure any one-on-one time with Biden, with no specific meeting set.</p>

            <p>Luxon had said his team was not focused on securing such a meeting with the incumbent President, who as well as hosting the NATO summit has been facing criticism for a poor debate performance against Republican contender Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister has however been meeting with other global leaders on the sides of the summit, and meeting with other US politicians.</p>
        
            <p>"It was also good to chat with Sir Keir Starmer and congratulate him on his election victory, and to reconnect with Prime Minister Kishida who I had visited in Tokyo a few weeks ago," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I also spoke to President [of Ukraine, Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and talked all things Hobbit with the delightful Prime Minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni."</p>
