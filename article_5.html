            <p>It is not clear whether allowing patched gang members to attend a local council meeting broke the law, the council's chair says.</p>
        
            <p>During the Hawke's Bay Regional Council meeting on Wednesday, the members voted unanimously to keep Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>Photographs have since emerged showing patched Mongrel Mob members in council chambers performing a haka, celebrating the decision.</p>
        
            <p>A law banning gang patches in public is on its way, but is not yet in force.</p>
        
            <p>But another law has banned gang insignia in government premises - which includes local government - since 2013. Local Government Minister Simeon Brown has told media he expected that to be enforced.</p>
        
            <p>The law - called the Prohibition of Gang Insignia in Government Premises Act 2013 - states "government premises" means "the whole or part of any structure (including any associated grounds) that is owned by, or is under the control of, (i) the Crown, acting through a department, the Police, or a Crown entity; or (ii) a local authority".</p>
        
            <p>The regional council's chair Hinewai Ormsby said she did not know whether the law applied to the Hawke's Bay Regional Council building.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no policy on that matter," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Amongst city and district councils, their public facilities definitely cover no gang insignia, so I can understand it applying there.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of regional council buildings, which are regional council assets, we have no policy for that."</p>
        
            <p>But the council would consider creating one, as well as investigate whether or not the law applied to the regional council's offices, Ormsby said.</p>
        
            <p>It would also kōrero with local gang leaders to discuss leaving their patches "in the car", she said.</p>
        
            <p>There were no problems with the gang members' behaviour, and they enjoyed engaging with local government, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were there to support the matter of the day, it was a well-run meeting, a good result, and there were no issues, in the end it was  celebration for everyone that was there."</p>
