        <h2>Luxon on Treaty bill haka: MPs must uphold Parliament's standards</h2>
        <p>
Treaty issues are "emotional and difficult", but New Zealanders expect a certain level of behaviour in Parliament, the PM says.
</p>
        
            <p>No one at the APEC meeting in Peru has mentioned the haka performed in Parliament this week to protest the Treaty Principles Bill, the prime minister says</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke was suspended for 24 hours and "named" for leading the haka during the first reading of the bill.</p>
        
            <p>Speaker Gerry Brownlee said her conduct was appallingly disrespectful and grossly disorderly. Video of the incident has gone viral around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media in Peru on Saturday (NZ time), Christopher Luxon said the incident had not been raised with him at all.</p>
        
            <p>He was not concerned that discord over the bill would affect New Zealand's international reputation.</p>
        
            <p>The haka in Parliament has gotten global attention by media outlets such as the BBC and CNN.</p>
        
            <p>There were "high tensions on all sides" of the Treaty debate and the issues surrounding it were "complex", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been built up over 184 years through good debate and discussion. We go forwards, we go backwards, we don't always agree, but actually it's made us a much better country.</p>
        
            <p>"It's too simplistic with a stroke of a pen to say 'we're going to resolve 184 years of debate'."</p>
        
            <p>National had made a coalition agreement with ACT to vote for the bill at its first reading, but "we do not support the bill", Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said New Zealanders expected certain standards from MPs in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally, irrespective of how emotional and difficult a topic may be to discuss in Parliament, all parties need to adhere to the standards of Parliament, otherwise it doesn't kind of work."</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, deciding whether an MP's conduct breached those standards was a call for the Speaker, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Māori Development spokesperson Willie Jackson was also ejected from the House on Thursday after he called ACT leader David Seymour a "liar" during the bill's first reading - breaking Parliament's rules.</p>
