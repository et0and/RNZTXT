        <h2>Dunedin hospital: Warning given just before cutbacks</h2>
        <p>
Doctors warned that scaling down plans for the new hospital risked leaving it in a "clinically precarious state" - just two days before the government announced its cutbacks.

            <p>Doctors warned officials that scaling down plans for the new Dunedin hospital at an advanced stage of the design risked leaving it in a "clinically precarious state" - just two days before the government announced its cutbacks to the project.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released under the Official Information Act and seen by RNZ show the group leading the design sent a strongly worded memo which argued that cutting costs at this point was unlikely to save a meaningful amount, yet it would compromise clinical services.</p>
        
            <p>The memo, written by clinical transformational group executive chair Dr Sheila Barnett and its deputy chair Professor Patrick Manning, stated the existing New Dunedin Hospital (NDH) design followed "a seven-year process of continued refinement, peer review and clinical scrutiny".</p>
        
            <p>The result, it argued, was "a robustly interrogated design of high clinical and operational functionality" and any proposed changes - such as retro-fitting existing, older buildings, staged delivery or moving inpatient services to a separate site - "would compromise this".</p>
        
            <p>The advisory group also denied the hospital was too big or complex, arguing its size and services reflected the needs of both the district and the region.</p>
        
            <p>"The NDH's size and complexity are appropriate for the tertiary services it provides to the whole of urban and rural Southland, Otago and, increasingly, South Canterbury; the ageing population; its geographical isolation from other tertiary centres; and the expected 50-year-plus life of the building."</p>
        
            <p>The group also warned that making changes at the latter stage of the project was unlikely to save much money, and more likely to add cost.</p>
        
            <p>"The project is now midway through detailed design and piling is almost complete. This would suggest that the cost of change will be high (eg relifting a building, programme delay and redesign costs) and the potential savings low."</p>
        
            <p>Barnett and Manning sent their memo to officials, including ministerial advisers, on 24 September.</p>

            <p>On 26 September the government announced the project needed to be reduced or done in stages.</p>
        
            <p>Two days later, Health Minister Shane Reti and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop announced the government would either scale back the project at the former Cadbury's site or retro-fit the existing hospital at a budget of $1.88 billion.</p>
        
            <p>If this was not done, they warned, the cost could hit $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ head of infrastructure delivery Blake Lepper said the health agency recognised the challenges that came with a reduced budget but needed to "work within our means to deliver this project".</p>
        
            <p>It was still working with the clinician team, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Throughout this process we have, and continue to, engage closely with the Clinical Transformation Group to ensure that we can provide high-quality hospital facilities that are fit-for-purpose for the community."</p>
