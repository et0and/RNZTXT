            <p>The government has announced a $5.7 million boost to emergency department (ED) security, aiming to employ an extra 200 people in the short term.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the roles would be part time, amounting to 93 full-time equivalent positions.</p>
        
            <p>They will only be funded to the end of February at the latest, but the government says is also investigating a longer-term solution.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti announced the move on Friday afternoon, saying the government had listened to ED staff about the frequency of violent incidents at hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said 1179 assaults were reported by Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand in 2021, rising to 2459 in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Another 1267 were reported in just the first three months of 2023, he said, and would top 5000 if that trend continued.</p>
        
            <p>"That's totally unacceptable,"</p>
        
            <p>The funding would go towards five extra staff for each of eight higher-risk EDs employed until the end of February, and between two and five additional security staff in a further 24 EDs through to mid-January or late February depending on local needs.</p>
        
            <p>The higher-risk EDs include the four Auckland hospitals, Waikato, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The other "hotspots" include: Bay of Islands, Dargaville, Kaitaia, Whangārei, Tauranga, Whakatāne, Rotorua, Taupō, Taranaki Base, Te Kuiti, Thames, Tokoroa, Taumarunui, Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa, Hutt Valley, Nelson, Wairau, Ashburton, Buller, Te Nikau Greymouth, Timaru, Lakes District, and Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of the health workforce and patients has to be a priority. These staff will be ready to provide round-the-clock cover and the first people are on the ground already," Dr Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>"This initiative addresses an immediate need. I'm also committed to working urgently on a longer-term plan to improve security across our hospitals."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was an example of the government moving increased support out of the back office and into the front line of health.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no place for people being abusive or aggressive towards staff, who are doing their absolute best for their fellow New Zealanders in often stressful situations."</p>
