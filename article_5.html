            <p>The government has named new leadership for the human rights commission.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith announced Friday that Dr Stephen Rainbow would be appointed as the new Chief Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Gail Pacheco the Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner, and Dr Melissa Derby the Human Rights Commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said Rainbow's "career has encompassed a range of roles including managing government relations for the largest infrastructure project in New Zealand, lecturing at Victoria University, as Director of Urban Strategy at Wellington City Council, and National Manager of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust".</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow was also a Wellington City Councillor from 1989 to 1998, and has been active in promoting LBGTQ rights.</p>
        
            <p>Pacheco is a professor of economics and director of the NZ Policy Research Institute at Auckland University of Technology.</p>
        
            <p>"She has extensive experience leading large-scale, multi-institutional funded projects, including work for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Ministry for Women, Ministry of Education and the Human Rights Commission," Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>New Human Rights Commissioner Derby is a senior lecturer at Waikato University, teaching early literacy and human development.</p>
        
            <p>Her primary area of research is early literacy, and in particular, exploring the role of whƒÅnau in fostering foundational preliteracy skills.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith had earlier expressed desire to make changes in the commission, which the ACT Party campaigned to abolish before the last election.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith thanked Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Dr Saunoamaali'i Karanina Sumeo, who has taken on the roles of acting chief commissioner and acting race relations commissioner over much of the past year.</p>
