            <p>Government spending on primary healthcare has not increased in its share of the total health budget, and barely in real terms, since 2009, according to new research.</p>
        
            <p>The study - published in the journal of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners on Thursday - is the first analysis of primary healthcare as a share of health funding.</p>
        
            <p>Researchers from Victoria University's Health Services Research Centre found, on average, New Zealand allocated 5.4 percent of its health budget to primary care between 2009 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Funding for primary care "in nominal terms" nearly doubled in that time from $667 million to $1277m, which equalled a 30 percent increase in real terms.</p>
        
            <p>"Taking into account population growth, PHC [primary healthcare] funding per capita in real terms remained fairly stable, showing a 7 percent growth over the period."</p>
        
            <p>This raised concerns about whether PHC was "truly being prioritised", the researchers said.</p>
        
            <p>Patients missing out on primary care were putting more pressure on hospitals, which meant acute services took a larger share of the funding, perpetuating the cycle.</p>
        
            <p>"When patients face long waits, have to pay for visits, or are not happy with the care received, they turn to using 24-hr hospital services (free in NZ) for their basic needs. This leads to more funding going to specialised care as it becomes more overwhelmed with demand, which further erodes PHC resources."</p>
        
            <p>The research called for stronger financial prioritisation of primary care, routine monitoring and minimum funding benchmarks "to ensure resilience and equity of the health system".</p>
