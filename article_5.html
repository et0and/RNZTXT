            <p>New police commissioner Richard Chambers wants to reduce the size of the police executive - proposing to cut 17 roles in total.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said he "clearly signalled" his intent in November - when he was appointed - to restructure the "highest-ranking levels of our organisation".</p>
        
            <p>A consultation document includes disestablishing 37 executive and support service positions, as well as creating 20 new positions - a net reduction of 17 roles.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said he wanted to ensure the executive was "fit-for-purpose, provides strong, clear leadership to the frontline, and delivers on the priorities I have set".</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ it was focused on organising the senior leadership levels in a way that would deliver on the priorities across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe that the proposal rationalises a number of positions that it ultimately is the structure that I believe will deliver the strategy that we need for our country."</p>
        
            <p>The new roles would be essentially combining some of the previous roles into one. He said he was looking for opportunities to reinvest in the frontline.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been very clear from the outset of my tenure as Commissioner that the frontline is an absolute priority for me and I'm looking for opportunities to support them further, to develop their capability, to ensure that we're providing a safe environment for them as best we can."</p>
        
            <p>He reiterated his commitment to boosting the frontline, and said redundancy was "not available to constabulary employees."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers sent the proposal to affected staff on Tuesday, and feedback is open until 10 February.</p>
        
            <p>"All feedback will be reviewed and carefully considered before final decisions are made in late February," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a lot of very positive feedback. Of course there is always going to be a mix of feedback and we invite some other suggestions before some final decisions are made but overall the vast majority of the feedback that I've had ... at a lot of different levels has been very positive."</p>
