            <p>A group of youth offenders will today begin the government's new boot camp pilot in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>The Oranga Tamariki-run programme involves ten boys aged between 15 and 18, and will be run out of the existing Te Au rere a te Tonga Youth Justice Residence.</p>
        
            <p>All were from the North Island [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/522657/children-s-minister-unveils-pilot-boot-camp-in-palmerston-north</p>
        
            <p>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/522756/oranga-tamariki-acknowledges-it-should-have-engaged-with-mana-whenua-on-youth-boot-camps-earlier and nine were Māori.]</p>
        
            <p>Each of the teenagers had committed at least two crimes with a court sentence of at least ten years, Children's Minister Karen Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>The minister would be present at the opening pōwhiri Monday morning and said she wished the participants all the best.</p>
        
            <p>While each teen's programme would be different to cater to their needs, the base of the pilot was the same, Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is around structure, wake up times, lights out times, daily exercise. It's about keeping their rooms tidy, all that structure and routine the young people need," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A typical day would begin with a 6.30am wake up, include physical drills, education or employment pathway training, mentoring, whakapapa and cultural connection before lights out at 9.30pm</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force (NZDF) maintained an oversight role in the pilot, Chhour confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>About 30 Oranga Tamariki staff had been trained by NZDF to run the pilot and modifications had been made to one of the residence's sleeping quarters, she said.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the boot camp's location in Palmerston North was "close to the Defence assets that are there that can be used, as I understand, from time to time".</p>
        
            <p>But Chhour said that was not the case.</p>
        
            <p>"We're unable to use the Defence facilities, so we can only use the Youth Justice facilities under the current law.</p>
        
            <p>"NZDF will have a little bit of involvement going forward, but probably not as much as when we change the law at the end of the year," she said.</p>
        
            <p>An outdoor gym and assault course had also been built on the field of the residence for the programme.</p>
        
            <p>Both would be able to be used by other rangatahi in the facility when those in the pilot were not using it, Chhour said.</p>
