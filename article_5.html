        <h2>Critics question legality, enforceability of banning gang patches</h2>
        <p>
Labour says asking the police to enforce a ban on gang patches may increase the rate of assaults on officers.

            <p>Critics are questioning the legality and enforceability of the government's ban on gang patches.</p>
        
            <p>The government expects to have banned gang patches in all public places by the end of this year.</p>
        
            <p>The policy, expected to be introduced in parliament this week, expands on existing restrictions in schools, hospitals and courthouses.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said people didn't feel safe in their homes, communities and public places.</p>
        
            <p>"For too long gangs have been allowed to behave as if they are above the law.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no tolerance for this behaviour and these new laws will support police to take action against it."</p>
        
            <p>Gang patch bans have been tried before - through a bylaw in Whanganui in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>The Hells Angels later asked the High Court to review the law and it ruled the ban was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, specifically the right to freedom of expression.</p>
        
            <p>The government said its ban was based on "legislation that's worked" in Australia, but Australia doesn't have a Bill of Rights.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association president Chris Cahill said he anticipated gangs would fight the changes in court.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly going to be controversial and there will be challenges throughout the courts I'm sure, probably all the way to the Supreme Court around the Bill of Rights.</p>
        
            <p>"But when you've had gang members double in a very short period of time I think you've got to try and do something."</p>
        
            <p>Cahill said his organisation was broadly in favour of the coalition's policies - though the police wouldn't be able to enforce them everywhere, all the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Gang members aren't just going to hand over their patches. So the ability to police it in some communities will be much more difficult than others.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you might have lone police officers, or one or two, dealing with large numbers of gang members, whereas in other parts of New Zealand you'll have large numbers of officers and they'll be able to deal with it."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's police spokesperson Ginny Andersen said focusing on gang wardrobes wasn't good policy; arguing seizing weapons and shutting down illegal businesses was a better use of resources.</p>
        
            <p>She also raised concerns the ban on gang patches would put police officers at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm concerned about the impact on increased assaults to the frontline. It's really hard for police to consistently enforce this law right across New Zealand. That will be a challenge."</p>
        
            <p>The Police Minister Mark Mitchell said the police were capable of enforcing the new laws and he was confident they would do so.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation will be accompanied by a report from the Attorney-General, outlining the human rights implications, when it's introduced to Parliament this week.</p>
        
            <p>It will go through the full Select Committee process, meaning anyone can have their say on the new laws later this year.</p>
