        <h2>Hymns on Sunday, 18 August 2024</h2>
        <p>
Church musician William Shrubsole is best known for the hymn tune ‘Miles Lane’. He was a “one tune man”, wrote composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, but what a “superb” tune it was. You can hear it set to Edward Perronet’s hymn All hail the power of Jesu’s name this week in Hymns on Sunday. Audio

            <p>Come, let us to the Lord our God
With contrite hearts return;
Our God is gracious, nor will leave
The desolate to mourn.

His voice commands the tempest forth
And stills the stormy wave;
And though His arm be strong to smite,
’Tis also strong to save.

As dew upon the tender herb,
diffusing fragrance round;
As show’rs that usher in the spring,
and cheer the thirsty ground:

So shall His presence bless our souls,
And shed a joyful light;
That hallowed morn shall chase away
The sorrows of the night.</p>

            <p>Titiro mai, e te Atua,
    Ki tenei whakaminenga,
    Kia whakarongo iho koe
    Ki tenei rangi whakapai.

    Hei konei ra koe noho ai,
    Hei waengai a matou nei:
    Manaakitia mai ra e koe
    Te kahui o tou atawhai:

    Kia tika ai te waiata
    Kia pono ai te karakia;
    He mea kia riroiho ai
    Te taro o te oranga.

    Kia tau te oro whakapai
    I roto i te whare nei;
    Hei konei oho ake ai
    Nga Areruia hari nui.

            <p>God, look
    At this gathering
    So that you may hear
    This song of praise.

    Let you be one with us
    In our midst
    May you bless
    The gathering which you care for.

    So that we may sing righteously
    And pray faithfully
    So that we may receive
    The bread of life.

    Let the songs of praise be beautiful
    In this house;
    It is here this present moment
    To sing with Hallelujahs of great happiness.
    Amen</p>

            <p>Holy Spirit, ever living
As the Church's very life;
Holy Spirit, ever striving
Through us in a ceaseless strife;
Holy Spirit, ever forming
In the Church the mind of Christ;
Thee we praise with endless worship
For thy fruits and gifts unpriced.

Holy Spirit, ever working
Through the Church's ministry;
Quick'ning, strength'ning, and absolving,
Setting captive sinners free;
Holy Spirit, ever binding
Age to age and soul to soul
In communion never ending,
Thee we worship and extol.</p>

            <p>For the healing of the nations,
Lord, we pray with one accord;
for a just and equal sharing
of the things that earth affords;
To a life of love in action
help us rise and pledge our word.

All that kills abundant living,
let it from the earth be banned;
pride of status, race, or schooling,
dogmas that obscure your plan.
In our common quest for justice
may we hallow life's brief span.

You, Creator God, have written
your great name on humankind;
for our growing in your likeness
bring the life of Christ to mind,
that by our response and service
earth its destiny may find.</p>

            <p>King of glory, King of peace,
I will love thee;
and that love may never cease,
I will move thee.
Thou hast granted my request,
thou hast heard me;
thou didst note my working breast,
thou hast spared me.

Wherefore with my utmost art
I will sing thee,
and the cream of all my heart
I will bring thee.
Though my sins against me cried,
thou didst clear me;
and alone, when they replied,
thou didst hear me.

Seven whole days, not one in seven,
I will praise thee;
in my heart, though not in heaven,
I can raise thee.
Small it is, in this poor sort
to enroll thee;
e'en eternity's too short
to extol thee.</p>

            <p>Where can I turn for peace?
Where is my solace
When other sources cease to make me whole?
When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,
I draw myself apart,
Searching my soul?

Where, when my aching grows,
Where, when I languish,
Where, in my need to know, where can I run?
Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?
Who, who can understand?
He, only One.

He answers privately,
Reaches my reaching
In my Gethsemane, Saviour and Friend.
Gentle the peace he finds for my beseeching.
Constant he is and kind,
Love without end.</p>

            <p>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
in a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
and drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
and calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
and to the weary, rest.

Dear name, the rock on which I build,
my shield and hiding place,
my never failing treasury, filled
with boundless stores of grace!

Jesus! my shepherd, brother, friend,
my prophet, priest and king,
my Lord, my life, my way, my end,
accept the praise I bring.

Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see thee as thou art,
I’ll praise thee as I ought.

Till then I would thy love proclaim
with every fleeting breath,
and may the music of thy name
refresh my soul in death!</p>

            <p>O My Soul, arise and bless your maker,
For He is your Master and your Friend.
Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy;
Worship the Saviour, Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>King of grace, His love is overwhelming;
Bread of Life, He’s all I’ll ever need,
For His blood has purchased me forever:
Bought at the cross of Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>And I will sing for all my days
Of heaven’s love come down.
Each breath I take will speak His praise
Until He calls me home.</p>
        
            <p>When I wake, I know that He is with me;
When I’m weak, I know that He is strong.
Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on:
Safe on the Rock of Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Stir in me the songs that You are singing;
Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen.
Give me faith to move in works of power,
Making me more like Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Then one day I’ll see Him as He sees me,
Face to face, the Lover and the loved;
No more words, the longing will be over:
There with my precious Jesus.</p>

Recording: Abbey PRCD 706</p>
        
            <p>All hail the pow'r of Jesu's name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem
to crown him, crown him, crown him
crown him Lord of all.

Crown him, ye morning stars of light,
who fixed this floating ball;
now hail the strength of Israel’s might,
and crown him, crown him, crown him
crown him Lord of all.

Crown him, ye martyrs of your God,
who from his altar call;
praise him whose way of pain ye trod,
and crown him, crown him, crown him
crown him Lord of all.

Let ev'ry tribe and every tongue
to him their hearts enthrall,
lift high the universal song,
and crown him, crown him, crown him
crown him Lord of all.</p>
