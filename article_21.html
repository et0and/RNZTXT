            <p>In the mid-1960s, Sandy Edmonds was one of the biggest names in New Zealand music with hits like 'Daylight Saving Time'. </p>
        
            <p>But after a meteoric rise, she gave it all up, trading the celebrity life for one of marriage, travel and a retail career in Australia. </p>
        
            <p>Rock'n'roll reporter John Baker reflects on the British-born pop singer's short but memorable music career and sudden disappearance from the scene.</p>

            <p>Sandy Edmonds - born Rosalie Edmondson - grew up in Liverpool and moved to Auckland with her family at 15.</p>
        
            <p>After attending Takapuna Grammar for six months and a stint as a dental assistant, Edmonds was discovered singing at an Auckland cafe.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, music manager and "canny operator" Phil Warren saw her potential and "took over the managerial reins", Baker says, shortening her name to 'Sandy Edmonds'.</p>
        
            <p>Although Edmonds didn't have an exceptional singing voice, her appearance and charisma made an impact on Warren.</p>
        
            <p>"A teenage mod face in 1965, great looks. She can sing okay, she can hold a tune. And then he worked it from there."</p>
        
            <p>Warren, who was "no slouch when it came to getting publicity", got his new client a range of interesting promotional gigs.</p>
        
            <p>She became the mascot for a New Zealand Navy ship, the face of Napro hairspray, an Air New Zealand poster girl and a regular on the cover of New Zealand Women's Weekly.</p>
        
            <p>Edmonds' cover of The Pretty Things' hit 'Come See Me' was the first song Baker heard of hers - at a friend's flat in Parnell in 1986.</p>
        
            <p>"Sandy was a huge Pretty Things fan. She liked her rock and roll wild and you couldn't get much wilder than The Pretty Things back then.</p>
        
            <p>"She did this stonking version, recorded at Saratoga Avenue up in Herne Bay ... and she's backed by The Aussie Pleasers.</p>
        
            <p>"She put her vocals over this and she nails it. It's just a wonderful production. Yeah, there's a lot of beautiful '60s distortion on this."</p>
        
            <p>Edmonds released two albums - Sandy and The Sound of Sandy - before leaving New Zealand in the late '60s, Baker says.</p>
        
            <p>She travelled extensively in Asia, had children and eventually settled in Melbourne where she went by her birth name, Rosalie Edmundson. </p>

            <p>Baker tracked her down there back in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>"We found out where Sandy was and we got to meet her at her little fashion store. She was lovely. I was starstruck, I didn't know what to say, but she was so gracious and warm with us. So it only took me 24 years to find her."</p>
        
            <p>Although Edmonds, who died in 2022, didn't match the success of other NZ pop singers like Dinah Lee, Baker says that for him she was "right up there".</p>
        
            <p>"She had the look and the style and that kind of zing that I can't quite put my finger on. And then when I finally got to meet her, I was like, 'gosh, she's still got the zing'."</p>
