            <p>There are eight Anglican cathedrals, each with choirs, around Aotearoa: Auckland, Hamilton, Napier, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>But this Labour Weekend, they'll all be singing under the one spire in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Cathedral of St Paul is this year's host of the festival of the nation's Anglican Cathedral Choirs, with more than 150 singers gathering for a concert on Saturday evening and two services on Sunday.</p>

Not a bad place for a sing.

            <p>RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump spoke with Andrew Williams, who sings with the Wellington Cathedral Choir but has also begun writing music for it, thanks to a long layoff from work due to a sports injury.</p>
        
            <p>The Welsh-born tenor was playing a game of social touch rugby when he found himself gaining on an opposition player faster than he expected.</p>
        
            <p>Surgery after the resulting collision left him with a bit of metal in his leg and time on his hands.</p>
        
            <p>Inspired by the improvisations of then Cathedral organist Richard Apperley, Williams began writing his own mass.</p>
        
            <p>His Missa Brevis went down so well with the choir, the organisers of the 2024 Anglican Cathedral Choirs Festival put it into the programme.</p>
        
            <p>When not singing in the cathedral choir, Williams works at Wellington Hospital as a medical physicist.</p>
        
            <p>He enjoys the choir partly because he grew up singing in church choirs in Wales, but also because of the variety of music - something new for every service.</p>
