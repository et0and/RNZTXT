            <p>John Drummond became an addict at high school - addicted to a drug called opera.</p>
        
            <p>That's when his music teacher, Percy Lovell, got his students to put on Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro". Drummond loved the experience so much he wrote his own opera, based on a story from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.</p>
        
            <p>His high school teacher got the students to put on that opera too.</p>

            <p>Now Drummond (retired music professor at Otago University, and former RNZ Concert programme maker) has written a book about his ongoing addiction.</p>
        
            <p>"Habitation of Dreams: A life in Opera" tells Drummond's story right from those high school beginnings in England, through to his decision to migrate as a single man to Dunedin in the 1970s, and on to his thoughts about the future of music drama.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Drummond says opera is as relevant as ever, but wonders if New Zealand's only full-time professional opera company, NZ Opera, is trying too hard to put on large scale lavish productions, beyond this country's means to support.</p>
        
            <p>The big romantic operas of the 19th and early 20th centuries have a place, but countries need either to have governments, or patrons, that are wealthy enough to fund them, Drummond says.</p>
        
            <p>There are plenty of wonderful operas that still work with a smaller cast and lower budget, he says.</p>
        
            <p>Drummond also wonders if the music world needs to break down the barrier between "musicals" and "opera" - it's all musical theatre in his book.</p>
