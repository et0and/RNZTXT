            <p>This special NZ Music Month Mixtape celebrates the hero guitars played by some of our most legendary musicians.  </p>
        
            <p>Country singer/songwriter Glen Moffatt wrote a definitive list of the ten hero guitars of NZ music on Audioculture.</p>
        
            <p>Of course once that list was published there was an outcry about which guitars had been left off the list…..so he’s just published another one. 

Born in Napier, Glen became a well known performer in the clubs, town halls, theatres, and festivals of New Zealand before moving to Brisbane. He’s now a music historian at Audioculture, sharing his knowledge and appreciation for Kiwi music.</p>
