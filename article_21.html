            <p>It might seem like a simple assignment, writing for children, but one composer who has says it's anything but.</p>
        
            <p>SOUNZ, the Centre for New Zealand Music, and Orchestra Wellington are once again asking composers to submit a proposal for a work the Orchestra will play with the youth ensemble Arohanui Strings later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Based in the Wellington region, the ensemble is part of the global Sistema movement which aims to bring classical music making to more young people by giving children access to that most expensive of things - a musical instrument.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump spoke with last year's recipient of the SOUNZ Commission for Orchestra and Sistema Youth Orchestra, South African-born composer Keith Moss.</p>
        
            <p>Moss told Crump about the South African inspiration behind his short piece, "A Kalahari Eclogue", and the challenges of writing for a children's group of mixed ability together with symphony orchestra.</p>

            <p>His advice to aspiring composers: make sure to stretch the young players musically and think about making use of the unique timbre a children's orchestra has.</p>
        
            <p>The deadline for submissions is 5pm on Monday February 3rd. Composers don't have to submit a completed work, just a sketch as to how their piece will work out.</p>
        
            <p>More information is available on the SOUNZ website.</p>
