            <p>The Pacific Signature Choir will again take the stage alongside the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to showcase the rich melodies of traditional songs from across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>The Mana Moana project, a fusion of symphony and songs of the Pacific performance that was hugely successful in Wellington, will appear in Auckland on 24 November.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland performance will include 13 Pacific songs, and the 50 members of Signature Choir will be joined by another 30 local singers.</p>
        
            <p>Signature Choir is led by Music Director, Helen Tupai. Co-director of the Signature Choir, Jadrah Tupai, says:</p>
        
            <p>"The song(s) had to be significant to the culture that we were representing,"</p>
        
            <p>"When we were tasked with doing these arrangements, both Helen and I had the task of kind finding the songs, and the main criteria was that the song had to be significant to the culture that we were representing."</p>
        
            <p>"We had to make sure that we stay true to the essence of the original song and its original message,".</p>
        
            <p>Jadrah Tupai says that everyone is pouring their hearts and souls into the performance to put on the best show they can.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that when you come along and you hear your songs, hear your stories, being told in a familiar but refreshing light you are going to be inspired."</p>

            <p>Choir member Nathan Lopa, said as a Tokelauan, he's proud to know that Tokelau songs will be sung at the Mana Moana performance.</p>
        
            <p>"The pride that I have when I hear Gagana o Tokelau being sung by this talented group of people. I hope, just as it has to me, empowers our Tokelauan youth, please make the most and nurture our language."</p>
        
            <p>He said in Pacific culture, songs are more than just a tune that we hum.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a way that we document history, and it's a way that we pass down stories through generations, so to be able to have this opportunity with Signature Choir and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, singing these songs at this level, in front of a jammed packed crowd, hopefully in Auckland, and paying homage to those who have gone before us, as well as introducing these songs to a newer generation."</p>
        
            <p>For Saimoni Daugunu, being part of the choir has helped him reconnect with his Fijian heritage.</p>
        
            <p>"Just having this opportunity to be part of this group has pushed me to go away and find my identity and reconnect with my culture so I'm finding personally it's helping me reconnect with my Fijian culture."</p>

            <p>Tempora Samia said despite the challenges of Covid-19 last year, they have all persevered. All the time spent overcoming setbacks was worthwhile, once they finally took to the stage.</p>
        
            <p>"And I guess that really represents our Pacific people too, you know the journey that we go through, even though it's a bit of a struggle sometimes, we just preserve and we just get on with it and that's reflected in the whole journey of last year."</p>
        
            <p>The choir members, whose cultures span the Pacific Region, unite to share the hymns and the songs from their homelands.</p>
        
            <p>Henrietta Hunkin-Tagaloa said music is a universal language.</p>
        
            <p>"We all come together to sing with each other, with each other using our Pacific languages and languages of our ancestors, it's just a special thing to be a part of but also the music that's gone behind it, all the creative works and time that's gone into it, it's a huge tribute to the people who have gone before us."</p>
        
            <p>She said they are excited to showcase the past 12 months of hard work. Pacific music enjoys strong support in Auckland, and tickets are expected to sell out for the Auckland show.</p>
