            <p>In 1988 New Zealand was riding the wave of 80s pop culture, and at the forefront was Rikki Morris. His hit ‘Nobody Else’, produced by his late brother Ian Morris, topped the charts here.

Rikki has won a ‘Tuis’ award, the prestigious APRA Silver Scroll, and he’s played in legendary bands Th’ Dudes and The Crocodiles, but yet he’s spent the greater part of his music career discovering new bands as a studio engineer. </p>
        
            <p>It’s been decades since Rikki Morris has given us new music, so it was exciting to hear he has released an album, aptly titled About Time. </p>
