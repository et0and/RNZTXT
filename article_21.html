            <p>Not every musician owns a DC3 aircraft, but if you do, you might as well make the most of it.</p>
        
            <p>Viola player, business man and plane enthusiast Mark Oremland is taking seven Parisian classical musicians on a tour of Aotearoa, travelling in his own Douglas DC3.</p>
        
            <p>It's the fulfillment of a long-held dream of Oremland, who bought the DC3 in England twenty years ago, to mix classic flying with classical music.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Oremland says getting the plane to New Zealand a few years back almost ruined him financially, but he was determined to hold onto the aircraft and keep it in running order.</p>
        
            <p>Built in the 1930s and 40s by the Douglas Aircraft Company, the DC3 played a crucial role in carrying freight during the Second World War.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, it was used in domestic passenger service in the 1950s and 60s, and later as a top dressing aircraft spreading fertiliser across hill country farms.</p>
        
            <p>Oremland, who works in the tourist industry, divides his time between France and a lodge he owns in Te Anau.</p>
        
            <p>Did he fly the plane and his musicians out from France? Crump asks.</p>
        
            <p>No, the plane is usually based in Wanaka, which is just as well, because flying it from Europe would have taken the best part of two weeks and Oremland is not a pilot: he's hired a couple of professionals to fly it around the country.</p>
        
            <p>However, because it's relatively slow, and has a maximum altitude of about four thousand metres, the DC3 is perfect for scenic flights.</p>
        
            <p>Violinist Cyril Garac, one of the French musicians touring with Oremland, says the chance to see New Zealand up close from the air, as well as perform, was something he couldn't turn down.</p>
        
            <p>The eight musicians, including Oremland, began their 14-venue tour of New Zealand in Auckland this week, with the final gig in Queenstown 18 days later, playing music by Beethoven (his Septet) and Schubert (his Octet).</p>
        
            <p>Crump asks if Oremland is worried if the tour will break even: wouldn't it have been quite a bit cheaper just to take a mini-van?</p>
        
            <p>Oremland doesn't care. Getting his dream tour off the ground is all that matters.</p>
