            <p>Singakademie Graz, one of over two hundred choirs in Auckland for the World Choir Games, came in to the RNZ studio to perform live on RNZ Concert’s Three to Seven show.</p>
        
            <p>Bryan Crump spoke with conductor and founder, Maria Fürntratt, and asked her why she started the choir back in 1995 and why she continues to lead it nearly 30 years on.</p>
        
            <p>“I love singing,” says Maria, "and singing is my life.</p>
        
            <p>“My slogan is ‘Singing is an adventure’, and it keeps me young! It was always my life, and ... with singing you can get friends from all over the world. That’s the best hobby for me.”</p>
