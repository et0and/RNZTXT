            <p>This weekend marks 60 years since The Rolling Stones toured New Zealand. It was the band's first visit to NZ and Australia and at time the longest travel they had undertaken in their career.</p>
        
            <p>The tour included stops in Auckland, Wellington, Dunedin, Christchurch and Invercargill. </p>
        
            <p>Dave Hogan was there to meet The Rolling Stones at Invercargill airport in 1965 - wearing his school uniform - and later bumped into the band at a local tearoom. </p>
        
            <p>Dave joins Music 101 to share his memories of their legendary performance at the town's Civic Theatre. </p>
