            <p>First Reading: Acts 10:34-43 read by Gavin Knight, Dean’s Warden</p>
        
            <p>Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p>
        
            <p>Hear what the Spirit is saying to the Church.
Thanks be to God.</p>

            <p>Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!
our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!
who did once upon the cross, Alleluia!
suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia!

Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia!
unto Christ, our heavenly king, Alleluia!
who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia
sinners to redeem and save. Alleluia!

But the pains that he endured, Alleluia!
our salvation have procured; Alleluia!
now above the sky he’s king, Alleluia!
where the angels ever sing. Alleluia! Amen.</p>

            <p>The Reverend Chris Frazer:
Hear the holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to John.
Praise and glory to God, Alleluia. </p>
        
            <p>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.

But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>
        
            <p>This is the Gospel of Christ.
Praise to Christ, the Word, Alleluia.</p>

            <p>The Reverend Digby Wilkinson gives the Easter Day sermon</p>
        
            <p>The Very Reverend Canon Katie Lawrence:
We affirm our faith together in the words of the Nicene Creed.

We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty,
maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,
eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven,
was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
he suffered death and was buried.
On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures;
he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
and his kingdom will have no end.

We believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
We look for the resurrection of the dead,
and the life of the world to come.
Amen.</p>

The risen Christ came and stood among his disciples and said,
‘Peace be with you.’ Then were they glad when they saw the Lord.
Alleluia!
(cf John 20: 19, 20)</p>
        
            <p>The peace of the risen Christ be always with you.
And also with you. Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>

            <p>Christ, you came to greet them
on that Easter day.
Your disciples searching
where your body lay
found the dark tomb empty,
grave clothes lying there;
they, uncomprehending,
fled in dark despair.

Anxious, lost, bewildered,
numb with grief and care,
Jesus' friends were gathered –
then their Lord was there,
silent as the sunrise
after darkest night;
though they did not know him,
doubts were put to flight.

Christ, you come to meet us
on this Easter day.
Joyfully we greet you,
doubts are rolled away.
May we know and love you,
look to you as Lord,
gather others to you,
faith and hope restored.</p>

            <p>The Very Reverend Canon Katie Lawrence and The Reverend Tim Handley continue:
It is right indeed, it is our joy and our salvation, holy Lord,
almighty Father, everlasting God, at all times and in all places
to give you thanks and praise through Christ your only Son.

You are the source of all life and goodness;
through your eternal Word you have created all things from the beginning and formed us in your own image;
male and female you created us.

When we sinned and turned away you called us back to yourself
and gave your Son to share our human nature.

You raised him to life triumphant over death;
you exalted him in glory. By his victory over death, the reign of sin is ended,
a new age has dawned,
a broken world is restored and we are made whole once more.

In him you have made us a holy people
by sending upon us your holy and life-giving Spirit.

Therefore with the faithful who rest in him,
with angels and archangels and all the company of heaven,
we proclaim your great and glorious name,
for ever praising you and singing:</p>
        
            <p>The Choir sings:</p>
        
            <p>Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus,
    Dominus Deus Sabaoth.
    Pleni sunt coeli et terra Gloria
    Hosanna in excelsis.</p>
        
            <p>Holy, holy, holy Lord,
    God of power and might,
    heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Hosanna in the highest.</p>

            <p>The Very Reverend Canon Katie Lawrence and The Reverend Tim Handley continue:</p>
        
            <p>All glory and thanksgiving to you, holy Father;
on the night before he died your Son, Jesus Christ, took bread;
when he had given you thanks, he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said:
Take, eat, this is my body which is given for you;
do this to remember me.</p>
        
            <p>After supper he took the cup; when he had given you thanks,
he gave it to them and said:
Drink this, all of you, for this is my blood of the new covenant which is shed for you
and for many for the forgiveness of sins;
do this as often as you drink it, to remember me.</p>
        
            <p>Glory to you Lord Christ;
your death we show forth;
your resurrection we proclaim,
your coming we await;
Amen! Come Lord Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Therefore loving God,
recalling your great goodness to us in Christ,
his suffering and death, his resurrection and ascension,
and looking for his coming in glory,
we celebrate our redemption with this bread of life
and this cup of salvation.
Accept our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,
which we offer through Christ our great high priest.</p>
        
            <p>Send your Holy Spirit
that these gifts of bread and wine which we receive
may be to us the body and blood of Christ,
and that we, filled with the Spirit’s grace and power,
may be renewed for the service of your kingdom

United in Christ with all who stand before you in earth and heaven,
we worship you, O God, in songs of everlasting praise.</p>
        
            <p>Blessing, honour and glory be yours,
here and ev’rywhere,
now and forever.
Amen.</p>

            <p>Ye choirs of new Jerusalem,
Your sweetest notes employ,
The Pascal victory to hymn
In strains of holy joy.

For Judah's Lion burst his chains,
Crushing the serpent's head;
And cries aloud through death's domains
To wake the imprisoned dead.

Devouring depths of hell their prey
At his command restore;
His ransomed hosts pursue their way
Where Jesus goes before.

Triumphant in his glory now
To him all power is given;
To him in one communion bow
All saints in earth and heaven.

While we his soldiers praise our King,
His mercy we implore,
Within his palace bright to bring
And keep us evermore.

All glory to the Father be,
All glory to the Son,
All glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,
While endless ages run.
Alleluia, Amen.</p>

            <p>Sing, choirs of heaven! Let saints and angels sing!
Around God's throne exult in harmony!
Now Jesus Christ is risen from the grave!
Salute your King in glorious symphony!

Sing, choirs of earth! Behold, your light has come!
The glory of the Lord shines radiantly!
Lift up your hearts, for Christ has conquered death!
The night is past; the day of life is here!

Sing, Church of God! Exult with joy outpoured!
The gospel trumpets tell of victory won!
Your Saviour lives: he's with you evermore!
Let all God's people shout the long Amen!</p>
