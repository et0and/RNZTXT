            <p>The 2024 National String & National Piano Competitions – presented by the Hill Family Foundation for Arts and Music and the Chiron Lewis Eady Foundation respectively, take place in Auckland from 13–16 December.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's Andrew Clark talked with one of the contestants, violinist Sarah Lee, and Anne Rodda (Executive Director, Michael Hill International Violin Competition).</p>
        
            <p>There are two benefits of competitions, Rodda says. First, there's identifying the winners and those with real aptitude, and giving them a platform where they can get some recognition.</p>
        
            <p>But perhaps even more important is the benefit that comes from the preparation required for competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"There's not many opportunities [where] young artists... have to have (in Sarah's case) an hour's plus worth of music... under her fingers and ready to go at any time. And for the pianists, it's an hour-and-a-half they have to have ready to go."</p>
        
            <p>"So it's that kind of intensity in preparation, and getting it to not just performance level but competition level where the real benefit of competition comes in."</p>
