            <p>Haynes is currently doing a PhD at Victoria University on the history of translation of song and literature into te reo Māori. And in September, he's off to the Royal College of Music in London to begin a Masters in Voice.</p>
        
            <p>Is he hoping to keep both areas of study going? </p>
        
            <p>"I think so. I mean, I'm asked... quite often to explain how they fit together."</p>
        
            <p>"For me... I feel like I'm running a united project that's about how words, and voices, and music and song explain what it is to be human, and how we can understand each other, and how we can connect through these things."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to keep doing all these things until I'm forced to stop!"</p>
