            <p>Of all the masterworks, all the millions of notes, it's the Appassionata Sonata Paavali Jumppanen loves best.</p>
        
            <p>The Finnish pianist will perform Beethoven's masterpiece at the Martinborough Festival at the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from his second home in Melbourne (he and his family switch between Australia and Finland), Jumppanen told Bryan Crump why Beethoven's Sonata No 23 in F Minor is his favourite.</p>

            <p>Beethoven wrote it between 1804 and 1805 as he came to terms with his hearing loss, and while the French dictator Napoleon was creating mayhem across Europe.</p>

Napoleon didn't make Beethoven's hearing loss any easier.

            <p>Earlier in his life, Napoleon had been a hero to Beethoven. But by the time of the Appassionata, the self-proclaimed Emperor of France had become a big fat zero to the German composer.</p>
        
            <p>Jumppanen told Crump the collapse of Beethoven's inner and outer worlds found their full expression in the work, and it's that dramatic intensity which makes the Appassionata so difficult - but rewarding - to play.</p>
