Words/Music: Psalm 23 (Rous)/james Bain arr Jacob

            <p>The Lord's my Shepherd; I'll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of blessedness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I pass through shadowed vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head with oil Thou dost anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my days
Will surely follow me;
And in my heart forevermore
Thy dwelling place shall be.</p>

            <p>Make me a channel of your peace
Where there is hatred let me bring your love
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord
And where there is doubt true faith in you.

Refrain:
Oh, master grant that I may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul.

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there is despair in life let me bring hope
Where there is darkness only light
And where there's sadness ever joy
Refrain:

Make me a channel of your peace
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
In giving to all man that we receive
In dying that we are born to eternal life.
Refrain: 

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there is hatred let me bring your love
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord
And where there is doubt true faith in you.</p>

            <p>Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
and publish abroad his wonderful name;
the name all-victorious of Jesus extol;
his kingdom is glorious and rules over all.

God ruleth on high, almighty to save;
though hid from our sight, his presence we have;
the great congregation his triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.

"Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!"
let all cry aloud, and honour the Son;
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.

Then let us adore and give him his right:
all glory and power, all wisdom and might,
all honour and blessing with angels above
and thanks never ceasing for infinite love.
Amen.</p>

Recording: Abbey 282830</p>
        
            <p>O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
and all that in me is
Be stirred up his holy name
to magnify and bless.

Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
and not forgetful be
Of all his gracious benefits
he hath bestow’d on thee.

All thine iniquities who doth
most graciously forgive:
Who thy diseases all and pains
doth heal, and thee relieve.

Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
to death may’st not go down;
Who thee with loving-kindness doth
and tender mercies crown:

Who with abundance of good things
doth satisfy thy mouth;
So that, ev’n as the eagle’s age,
renewed is thy youth.</p>

He gives light to all his creation.
In the Lord is my joy and salvation,
He gives peace and true consolation.</p>

            <p>Bread of the world in mercy broken,
wine of the soul in mercy shed,

By whom the words of life were spoken,
and in whose death our sins are dead:

Look on the heart by sorrow broken;
look on the tears by sinners shed;

And be your feast become the token
that by your grace our souls are fed.</p>

            <p>Companions let us pray together,
in this place affirm our faith.
God who made us is here among us;
we stand together in God’s grace.

Refrain:
We are whanau, we are one,
brothers, sisters of the Son.
We are reaching for our freedom,
the prize that Christ has won.

The broken Christ stands here among us,
shares our suffering and our pain;
in breaking bread we find empowerment
to live in aroha again.
Refrain:

The risen Christ brings light and laughter,
celebrates the life we share;
the poured out wine of Christ’s self-giving
inspires us to reach out and care.
Refrain:

Now let us sing to God who loves us
and accepts us as we are;
Go out from here and live that message,
proclaim our oneness near and far.
Refrain:</p>

            <p>The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,
keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God,
and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord:
and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
be amongst you and remain with you always.
Amen.</p>
