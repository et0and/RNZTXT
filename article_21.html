            <p>I'm gonna sing when the Spirit says sing,
I'm gonna sing when the Spirit says sing,
I'm gonna sing when the Spirit says sing,
and obey the Spirit of the Lord.

I'm gonna pray when the Spirit says pray,
I'm gonna pray when the Spirit says pray,
I'm gonna pray when the Spirit says pray,
and obey the Spirit of the Lord.

I'm gonna shout when the Spirit says shout,
I'm gonna shout when the Spirit says shout,
I'm gonna shout when the Spirit says shout,
and obey the Spirit of the Lord.</p>

            <p>Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire
and lighten with celestial fire;
thou the anointing Spirit art,
who dost thy seven-fold gifts impart.

Thy blessed unction from above
is comfort, life, and fire of love;
enable with perpetual light
the dullness of our mortal sight.

Teach us to know the Father, Son,
and thee, of both, to be but one,
that through the ages all along
this may be our endless song:

Praise to thine eternal merit,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
Amen.</p>

            <p>Sing to him in whom creation
found its shape and origin;
Spirit, moving on the waters,
troubled by the God within;
source of breath to all things breathing,
life in whom all lives begin.

Sing to God, the close companion
of our inmost thoughts and way;
who, in showing us his wonders,
is himself the power to gaze;
and his will, to those who listen,
by a still small voice conveys.

Holy men, both priest and prophet,
caught his accents spoke his word;
his the truth behind the wisdoms
which as yet know not our Lord;
he the love of God eternal,
which in Christ was seen and heard.

Tell of how the ascended Jesus
armed a people for his own;
how a hundred men and women
turned the known world upside down.
to its dark and furthest corners
by the Wind of Whitsun blown.

Pray we then, O Lord the Spirit,
on our lives descend in might;
let thy flame break out within us,
fire our hearts and clear our sight,
till, white-hot in thy possession,
we, too, set the world alight.

Praise, O praise the Holy Spirit,
praise the father, praise the Word,
source, and truth, and inspiration,
trinity in deep accord:
through thy voice which speaks within us
we thy creatures own thee Lord.</p>

            <p>Breathe on me, Breath of God,
fill me with life anew,
that I may love the way you love,
and do what you would do.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
until my heart is pure,
until my will is one with yours,
to do and to endure.

Breathe on me, Breath of God,
so shall I never die,
but live with you the perfect life
for all eternity.</p>

            <p>Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
the holy one, is here;
Come bow before him now
with reverence and fear:
In him no sin is found
we stand on holy ground.
Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
the holy one, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around;
He burns with holy fire,
with splendour he is crowned:
How awesome is the sight
our radiant king of light!
Be still, for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place;
He comes to cleanse and heal,
to minister his grace
No work too hard for him
In faith receive from him
Be still, for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place.</p>

            <p>Refrain:
Spirit of God, rest on your people
waken your song deep in our hearts

Spirit of the quiet earth,
Spirit breathing hope to birth,
sustaining us, the fire of your love.
Refrain 

Spirit blowing through creation
love that cannot be contained
bring forth for us the wonders you proclaim.
Refrain 

Song that echoes through our story
music of our restless souls
resound with joy in those who call your name.
Refrain 

Spirit moving through our lives,
work in our memories.
healing and restoring, teaching and revealing,
strengthening and bringing to life.
Refrain

Spirit breaking through our cellphone,
Spirit tearing down our walls,
challenge and discern us, in a voice that questions and calls.

            <p>Come down, O love divine,
seek thou this soul of mine,
And visit it with thine
own ardour glowing.
O comforter, draw near,
within my heart appear,
And kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.

O let it freely burn,
til earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes
in its heat consuming;
And let thy glorious light
shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

Let holy charity
mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness
become mine inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart,
which takes the humbler part,
And o’er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

And so the yearning strong,
with which the soul will long,
Shall far outpass the power
of human telling;
For none can guess its grace,
till he become the place
Wherein the Holy Spirit makes his dwelling.</p>

            <p>O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace! [last line x 4]

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro' all the earth abroad
the honours of thy name. [last line x 4]

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease,
that bids our sorrows cease,
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life and health and peace. [last line x 4]

In Christ, your head, you then shall know,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
Anticipate your heaven below
And own that love is heaven. [last line x 4]</p>
