            <p>It was Covid that brought Carleen Ebbs home.</p>
        
            <p>London had been a base for the Motueka-raised soprano for 15 years. First she completed her singing training there, then she worked as a freelance soprano - until the pandemic struck.</p>
        
            <p>As work dried up, she decided to return to Aotearoa where she landed a job with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra as its Development Manager.</p>
        
            <p>But Ebbs hasn't given up on singing, and this month she's embarking on a short tour of the South Island that includes gigs in Takaka and in her old home town.</p>
        
            <p>Touring with pianist Gabriela Glapska, Ebbs describes the concerts as a "musical hug of adored art songs".</p>

            <p>Ebbs says while she enjoyed many musical highs working in London, the city can sometimes be a tough place to live in.</p>
        
            <p>She's enjoying the musical freedom she's found back in New Zealand, and so far has had plenty of opportunities to make music, when not working with the NZSO.</p>
        
            <p>And while her parents no longer live in Motueka, Ebbs says plenty of her old friends are coming along to this evening's concert in the town's Chanel Arts Centre.</p>
