            <p>Just over a year after her triumph in the 2023 Michael Hill International Violin Competition, South Korean Yeyeong (Jenny) Jin is back touring the country, and she's brought another Korean champion with her.</p>
        
            <p>Joining her for a tour of New Zealand and Australia for Chamber Music New Zealand is Jeonghwan Kim, winner of last year's Sydney International Piano Competition.</p>
        
            <p>Jin and Kim's joint tour will take them to eleven venues across Aotearoa, before heading to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>And ahead of that, violinist Jin, who now lives in the USA, will play Mozart's 3rd violin concerto with the Auckland Philharmonia.</p>
        
            <p>Jin joined RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump to talk about life after winning the Michael Hill competition, why so many Koreans excel playing western classical music (the conductor for the Mozart concerto is another South Korean Shiyeon Sung), and how the great American violinist Itzhak Perlman taught her the gift of kindness.</p>
