            <p>In collaboration with SPCA, RNZ Concert is offering a radio show of music chosen to be gentle for pets during fireworks. </p>
        
            <p>Both organisations are keen to help improve the wellbeing of their communities. We know music is a positive part of many people’s lives, and we know many RNZ Concert listeners have beloved pets. Now we’re completing that circle with the SPCA’s expertise to provide an enjoyable listening experience for people and their furry friends on a night we know can be challenging for both.</p>

"My mum and dad and human sister Nina think the concert for animals is the best thing since sliced turkey. Even Nana Lola is going to be listening as the fireworks make us all anxious. Thanks very much for the lovely music - Pixie xx"
