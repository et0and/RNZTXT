            <p>In a 2021 conversation, New Zealand poet Sam Hunt spoke to Trevor Reekie about music, mortality and creativity while sharing some of his favourite songs.</p>

            <p>After a 52-year run on stages, Sam Hunt doesn't "go on the road" anymore.</p>
        
            <p>These days, his charismatic readings are performed mostly to the animals who share his Kāpiti Coast property.</p>
        
            <p>"I go downstairs.... and my only audience are the cattle and the birds, the pūkekos. They seem to be quite used to it. There's a sheep that I'm sure knows all my poems."</p>
        
            <p>Apart from being "very fond of a few old mates", Hunt says he can't actually stand poetry or poets much.</p>
        
            <p>Although he's been penning poetry since the age of seven, he says the phrase 'writing a poem' doesn't describe his creative process.</p>
        
            <p>"I hear a poem and so I won't forget it I scribble it down … It's very like recalling a dream - it's from some part of the brain that's pretty connected, I think."</p>
        
            <p>As a young man, Hunt toured as a performing poet for five years and then gave up "the road" indefinitely after his first child Tom was born.</p>
        
            <p>"I worked in the sawmill ... took about two years off. I wasn't sure whether I was going to go back on the road. I wasn't worried about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Then my old friend Gary McCormick came along, I've got Gary to thank, and it was time to get out of the slippers and get my boots on."</p>
        
            <p>Now, several years into retirement, Hunt is not in the best health.</p>
        
            <p>He says death - the subject of the recent poem 'This Way', which he reads in this interview - is something he's curious about and even looks forward to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one thing that everyone's going to do … As David Kilgour said to me 'Look, nothing wrong with being dead. A lot of people I admire most are dead'."</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, though, Hunt says he still loves being alive and is very happy spending time at his home in Pukerua Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"At times things fall apart. But so far ... they sort of come right, too.</p>
        
            <p>"I have times, like most people have, when you're not so happy, But when I wake up, if I don't have too big of a hangover or something, I'm ready to go for the day... I don't go far."</p>
