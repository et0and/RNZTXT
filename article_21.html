            <p>New Zealand composers have been creating music for locally-made movies since the 1930s, and one of the first composers to really put their mark on a string of hit films with his original music was John Charles.</p>
        
            <p>A true Renaissance man, John cut his teeth playing piano in jazz bands like the Acme Sausage Company, was an integral part of musical collective BLERTA, and - along with childhood friend Geoff Murphy - made the transition to film.</p>
