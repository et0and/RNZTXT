            <p>Influenced by astrology and theosophy, Gustav Holst's pieces describe the moods or personalities of seven of the sun's planets. The pieces are not ordered by their planet's distance from the Sun, rather some commentators have seen the work as a progression through life, from tumultuous beginnings to serene old age.</p>
        
            <p>These Orchestra Wellington performances are accompanied by images from NASA and ESA missions, compiled by Dr Claire Bretherton, Curator – Science, Space Place at Carter Observatory.</p>
