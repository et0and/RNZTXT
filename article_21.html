            <p>Robbie Ellis moved to Chicago on a whim.</p>
        
            <p>The former RNZ Concert host was in his late 20s and in the mood for an OE. He didn't want to go to Europe, so he threw his virtual hat into the US Green Card lottery and won.</p>
        
            <p>Ellis was tossing up between New York and Chicago, but went for the latter because of the greater opportunities in the niche field he loves so much - classical music comedy.</p>

            <p>These days, when he's not hosting on the classical music radio station WFMT, Ellis is busy creating his own classical music send ups, or directing the music at various comedy clubs around the city.</p>
        
            <p>Ellis is back in New Zealand to show off his 14-month-old baby, as well as present an evening of (mostly) music comedy in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Ellis spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump ahead of his Auckland gig.</p>
        
            <p>One of the first things Crump notes is Ellis still has a Kiwi accent despite living in Chicago for the best part of a decade.</p>
        
            <p>"Do you keep it when you're on air?" Crump asks.</p>
        
            <p>Ellis says Americans can't seem to get enough of his New Zealand vowels, which is one of the reasons he's done so well in the States.</p>
        
            <p>It also helps that Ellis is supremely talented, quick on the keyboard, and possesses boundless energy.</p>
        
            <p>There's more than a hint of the great Tom Lehrer in Ellis keyboard antics, remarks Crump.</p>
        
            <p>Turns out one of Ellis' projects is to orchestrate and perform some of Lehrer's songs in time for his 100th birthday in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>We hope Lehrer lasts that long, because if anyone can score this for the Chicago Symphony, Ellis can.</p>
