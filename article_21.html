            <p>Emily Beynon has come halfway around the globe for the world premiere of the latest flute concerto written for her.</p>
        
            <p>The Welsh-born, Amsterdam-based flute player is here to play Guillaume Connesson's new work, "Danses Concertantes" in two concerts with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ, Beynon says the new work is full of joy, but also dramatic mood swings.</p>
        
            <p>There's a sultry tango, and at one point the music gets so violent it might be a pas de deux for zombies.</p>
        
            <p>Beynon, who when not playing solo is principal flute with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in the Netherlands, is also giving masterclasses during her stay in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>She tells RNZ Concert's Bryan Crump she loves the flexible approach of the New Zealand students and their willingness to try something different.</p>
        
            <p>"I think music happens when you take a risk. It's got to smell at least a little bit dangerous... I think really, that sense of danger is what brings music to life."</p>
