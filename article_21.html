Three to Seven host Bryan Crump invited RNZ Concert listeners to send in a photo of where they are listening, and a music request. Before long we had messages from all over New Zealand, and as far away as Australia and California. Audio

            <p>Three to Seven invited you to send in photos of your RNZ Concert listening posts this week, and we've been delighted with the response.</p>
        
            <p>"Send in a photo with a music request", suggested host Bryan Crump. "And we'll see what we can squeeze in between 3 and 4 on a Friday" </p>
        
            <p>Before long Crump had messages from as far away as Australia and even California, where Tim Morrison listens online, because while there are some good classical music stations in his home patch (San Francisco's Bay Area) only RNZ Concert offers classical music with a Kiwi accent.</p>
        
            <p>Morrison fell in love with New Zealand when he worked in Wellington for a few months.</p>

Chris was working from home in Melbourne when he answered the call. We think the arrows are either pointing to his office, or his hedge.
