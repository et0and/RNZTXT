            <p>One musical anniversary that’s definitely worth celebrating this year is violinist Andrew Beer’s decade as Concertmaster of the Auckland Philharmonia.</p>
        
            <p>But in the orchestra's concert on Thursday 28 November, he'll be leaving the first desk of the violins to take centre stage as soloist for the Violin Concerto by star jazz and classical trumpeter, Wynton Marsalis. The work is in four movements (Rhapsody, Rondo Burlesque, Blues and Hootenanny) and was commissioned by violinist Nicola Benedetti, who premiered the concerto in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's David Morriss caught up with Andrew Beer to talk about how he approaches the concerto, ahead of its New Zealand premiere.</p>
