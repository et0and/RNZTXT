            <p>Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee;
holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee,
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
who wert and art and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,
though the eye made blind by sin thy glory may not see,
only thou art holy; there is none beside thee,
perfect in power, in love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise thy name, in earth and sky and sea;
holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!</p>

            <p>He aroha nou e Ihu
    Tenei ra i kitea ai
    Tiakina hoki matou
    I te roa o tenei po.
    Atawhaitia mai e koe
    Mau ano ka ora ai.

    Tenei matou he manene
    Noho waenga i te he,
    Nei ra tiakina iho,
    I o matou hoa whawhai
    Tino awhitia e koe,
    Ki ou ringa atawhai

    Ka pahure enei wahi
    Me nga ra e ora ai
    A ka tata ki te mate
    Whakakahangia e koe
    Tangohia ki te rangi
    Okioki  atu ai.
    Amine.</p>
        
            <p>It is your love Lord Jesus!
    that we witness as you,
    watch over us,
    through this long night.
    Take care of us, for
    you are our Saviour.

    We are mere pilgrims
    who live in the midst of sin.
    Watch over us,
    from our enemies.
    Embrace us fully
    In your loving arms

    When time has passed
    And the days numbered,
    Nearing the time of death,
    Grant us strength,
    To be taken to heaven,
    For a complete rest.
    Amen.</p>

            <p>Dear Lord and father of mankind,
Forgive our foolish ways;
Reclothe us in our rightful mind,
In purer lives thy service find,
In deeper reverence, praise,
In deeper reverence, praise.

In simple trust like theirs who heard,
Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word,
Rise up and follow thee,
Rise up and follow thee.

Drop thy still dews of quietness,
Till all our strivings cease;
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of thy peace,
The beauty of thy peace.

Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and thy balm,
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire,
O still small voice of calm,
O still small voice of calm!</p>

Words/Music: Psalm 23/Dorothy Buchanan
Recording: KSP 93001</p>
        
            <p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me down to lie in pastures green: he leadeth me, the quiet waters by.
My soul He doth restore again, and me to walk doth make within the paths of righteousness e’en for His own name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale, yet will I fear no ill: for thou art with me and thy rod and staff me comfort still.
Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me: and in God’s house for evermore my dwelling place shall be.</p>

            <p>One bread, one body, one Lord of all,
one cup of blessing which we bless.
And we, though many, throughout the earth,
we are one body in this one Lord.

Gentile or Jew, servant or free, woman or man no more.

One bread, one body, one Lord of all,
one cup of blessing which we bless.
And we, though many, throughout the earth,
 we are one body in this one Lord.

Many the gifts, many the works, one in the Lord of all.

One bread, one body, one Lord of all,
one cup of blessing which we bless.
And we, though many, throughout the earth,
we are one body in this one Lord.</p>

            <p>An upper room did our Lord prepare
for those he loved until the end:
and his disciples still gather there
to celebrate their risen friend.

A lasting gift Jesus gave his own:
to share his bread, his loving cup.
Whatever burdens may bow us down,
he by his cross shall lift us up.

And after supper he washed their feet,
for service, too, is sacrament.
In Christ our joy shall be made complete:
sent out to serve, as he was sent.

No end there is! We depart in peace.
He loves beyond our uttermost:
in every room in our Father's house
Christ will be there, as Lord and Host.</p>

            <p>King of glory, King of peace,
I will love thee;
and that love may never cease,
I will move thee.
Thou hast granted my request,
thou hast heard me;
thou didst note my working breast,
thou hast spared me.

Wherefore with my utmost art
I will sing thee,
and the cream of all my heart
I will bring thee.
Though my sins against me cried,
thou didst clear me;
and alone, when they replied,
thou didst hear me.

Seven whole days, not one in seven,
I will praise thee;
in my heart, though not in heaven,
I can raise thee.
Small it is, in this poor sort
to enroll thee;
e'en eternity's too short
to extol thee.</p>

            <p>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation:
All ye who hear,
brothers and sisters draw near,
praise him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth
shelters thee under his wings, yea, so gently sustaineth:
hast thou not seen
all that his people have been
granted in what he ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
surely his goodness and mercy here daily attend thee:
ponder anew
what the Almighty can do,
if with his love he befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before him!
Let the Amen
sound from his people again:
gladly for aye we adore him.</p>
