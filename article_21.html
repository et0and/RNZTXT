            <p>The final album by Dunedin band The Chills Spring Board: The Early Unrecorded Songs was released yesterday, a passion project led by the band's late frontman, Martin Phillipps, to re-record early, unreleased tracks from his youth. </p>
        
            <p>Before his passing in July 2024 at age 61, Phillipps collaborated with his bandmates Oli Wilson, Erica Scally, Callum Hampton, and Todd Knudson to bring these early compositions to life. The album also features contributions from notable New Zealand artists, including Neil Finn of Crowded House, Julia Deans of Fur Patrol, Hollie Fullbrook of Tiny Ruins, and others.</p>
        
            <p>This album stands as a poignant conclusion to The Chills legacy, offering fans a final glimpse into Phillipps's creative world and the band's enduring impact on the music scene.</p>
        
            <p>Longtime band manager Scott Muir talks to Music 101.</p>
