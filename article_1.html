            <p>In his final speech to Parliament, outgoing MP Grant Robertson has told the House the tax system must be reformed.</p>
        
            <p>He also issued a veiled warning to the new government not to drastically cut spending.</p>
        
            <p>The former finance minister has delivered his valedictory speech, calling time on his 15 years as an MP.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would not be a surprise to MPs that one thing he wanted to do but did not was reform the tax system.</p>
        
            <p>Not properly taxing assets and wealth was entrenching inequality, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on his time as finance minister, Robertson said it was vital that governments were careful with the money they spend on behalf of the public, but that the public services they need would not be provided without sufficient investment.</p>

            <p>In a sit-down interview with RNZ, Robertson recalled some of the impossible decisions he had to make, the intensity of threats against him personally and the Parliament protest that has continued to have an impact.</p>
        
            <p>He leaves to become vice chancellor of the University of Otago.</p>
