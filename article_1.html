            <p>Initial progress results for the Tauranga City Council election show that Mahé Drysdale is likely to be the city's new mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Former Olympic rowing champion Drysdale has nearly 5000 more votes than former mayor Greg Brownless who is in second place, followed by former deputy-mayor Tina Salisbury, with singer-songwriter Ria Hall in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale does not currently live in Tauranga city but had said that if elected mayor he planned to move to Tauranga with his young family once the current school year was over.</p>
        
            <p>Voter turnout was the lowest it has been in over a decade with only 31.09 percent, or 33,998 of Tauranga residents, taking their opportunity to vote.</p>
        
            <p>Voter turnout had been going up in the city before 2020, with 40.28 percent voting in 2019, 38.07 percent in 2016, and 37.78 percent in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday's election was the first since the last council was sacked by the government in February 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Since that time the city has been run by government appointed commissioners, chaired by former National MP Anne Tolley and Tauranga locals were not able to participate in the last nationwide local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>The final election result will be declared next week once last minute and special votes have been counted.</p>
        
            <p>The new council will be sworn-in on 2 August.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come ...</p>
