            <p>A researcher described as a pioneering force for women's health in Aotearoa has been named Kiwibank New Zealander of the Year 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Bev Lawton, of Wellington, received the honour at an awards event in Auckland on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>It is just one of Lawton's many accolades to date, including being made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2005 for services to women's health.</p>
        
            <p>The former GP's achievements include establishing Te Tātai Hauora o Hine (The National Centre for Women's Health Research Aotearoa) and driving major advances in cervical cancer screening, maternal health, and indigenous health equity.</p>
        
            <p>Just last year she led a historic shift to HPV self-testing as the main method for cervical screening, making New Zealand the first high-income country to do so.</p>
        
            <p>That was expected to significantly increase cervical screening uptake for wāhine Māori, and ultimately save lives, especially in rural communities.</p>
        
            <p>The judging panel said Lawton, of Ngāti Porou descent, was "a true champion" who built strong relationships, ensured her research was relevant and innovative, and grounded all her work in community engagement.</p>
        
            <p>"Her ability to disseminate important information about women's health more broadly ensures the profile of women's health in Aotearoa is elevated, and she regularly contributes expert commentary to media, providing evidence, ideas, and opportunities for system transformation," the judges said.</p>
        
            <p>"Her research-informed policies and alliances continue to shape healthcare systems, tackle inequities and reduce preventable harm for wāhine Māori and all women across the motu."</p>
        
            <p>Seven other awards were presented during Thursday night's gala dinner for individuals and groups making New Zealand a better place.</p>
        
            <p>They were:</p>
        
            <p>The judging panel said Auckland's Namulau'ulu Nu'uali'i Eteroa Lafaele (Fogapoa, Leulumoega Tuai, Lefaga) was a globally recognised Samoan leader and software engineer from Porirua, forging new pathways to bridge the digital divide for Pacific communities in Aotearoa.</p>
