            <p>The housing market recovery is spreading, with nearly 60 percent of suburbs seeing some improvement this year.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic's interactive mapping tool indicates 549 of the 935 suburbs (58.9 percent) it tracks saw an uptick in median estimated property values in the three months to March.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 386 suburbs in decline, only 152 have seen falls of 1 percent or more since December.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic NZ chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said 103 suburbs saw value gains of at least 2 percent, with seven up by 5 percent or more.</p>
        
            <p>"Queenstown continues to demonstrate market resilience, with growth in Sunshine Bay (10.6 percent) a standout example," he said.</p>
        
            <p>While price recovery was spreading to more parts of the country, Davidson said the trend was not yet nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>"The market's recovery is unlikely to be a straight line from month to month, or region to region. With mortgage rates still high and affordability stretched in many areas, an underwhelming upturn remains on the cards for 2024."</p>
        
            <p>Just over half (52 percent) of Auckland suburbs saw values rise, and 10 of those have seen increases of at least 5 percent - including Fairview Heights, Somerville, Northpark, Pinehill, and East Tamaki.</p>
        
            <p>There was a rebound in Hamilton, with 13 suburbs up since December. Tauranga saw price recovery in 14 suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington saw some recovery with values down in 16 suburbs, while 11 saw gains of at least 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Just seven of Christchurch's 82 suburbs saw gains, while Dunedin's 39 suburbs saw some gains.</p>
