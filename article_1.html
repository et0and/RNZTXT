            <p>Police investigating the death of a Dargaville woman on a west coast beach last month are hoping new CCTV images will provide a breakthrough in finding her killer.</p>
        
            <p>The body of Joanna Mai Sione-Lauaki was found on Ripiro Beach, between Omamari and Aranga, on 2 August, a day after she failed to return home.</p>
        
            <p>The 38-year-old's death was initially regarded as unexplained but since last Friday police have been treating it as a homicide.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Al Symonds, of Northland CIB, said police were appealing to the public for sightings of the man captured in the CCTV images.</p>
        
            <p>The man was about 189cm tall, in his late 30s, with Caucasian complexion, green eyes, a beard and sandy coloured hair.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing a blue sweater with white pants, dark boots and a hat, and had two white pig hunting dogs.</p>

            <p>Symonds said police believed he was the last person to see Sione-Lauaki alive.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking anyone who may have seen this man in the Baylys or Omamari beach areas, and as far north as The Bluff, on 1 or 2 August to please come forward."</p>
        
            <p>Symonds also repeated his appeal for information about a white 2012 Toyota Hilux flat deck ute, with no registration plates, an orange hazard light on the roof, and aluminium dog cages on the back.</p>
        
            <p>He believed the vehicle was in the area where Sione-Lauaki's body was found.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to hear about any sightings of the ute until about 10 August.</p>

            <p>"Our teams are working hard to piece together the events leading up to Jo's death and any information, no matter how small, could assist in getting closure for her whƒÅnau," Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>Several items of clothing were still missing, and police wanted the public's help to locate a white Nike T-shirt with a red tick, black or dark grey tracksuit pants and red Adidas scuffs.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who could help should call 105 quoting file number 240803/9062.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who wanted to talk to a member of the investigation team in person could go to Dargaville Police Station, and those who wanted to pass on information anonymously could do so via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
