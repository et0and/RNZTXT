            <p>A picture perfect right cross has seen the downfall of Israel Adesanya continue.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi mixed martial artist was finished in emphatic fashion at the hands of Nassourdine Imavov in the main event of UFC Fight Night in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Just thirty seconds into the second round, Imavov cracked Adesanya on the chin, and then followed up with a clean left uppercut and a barrage on the ground to decisively finish the former champion.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya appeared to have taken a glancing blow to the groin and temporarily paused, before waving off the referee.</p>
        
            <p>Immediately after the resumption, 'the Sniper' fired his shot and in an instant, one of the greatest UFC careers may well be over.</p>
        
            <p>It was a closely fought first round, as the two traded low kicks to start things off before Imavov shot for a takedown which was expertly stuffed by Adesanya.</p>
        
            <p>The former middleweight king, fighting in his first non-title bout in six years, found some success from the outside, using his significant reach advantage to land some crisp jabs.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of nice knees in the clinch and 'The Last Stylebender' may have done enough to earn the first five minutes on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was academic after the Russian-born Frenchman bided his time, and found the opening to send Adesanya crashing to the canvas.</p>
        
            <p>Imavov said in his post-fight interview that he is now deserving of a title shot having dispatched the New Zealand legend.</p>
        
            <p>He will now await the result of the middleweight championship fight between champion Dricus du Plessis and Sean Strickland in Sydney at UFC 312 next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>For Adesanya, this likely spells the end of any hope of another run at the gold, and may see the future Hall fo Famer hang up his gloves and leave a legacy which few will come close to replicating.</p>
