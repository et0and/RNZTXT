            <p>More than 1000 people have turned out at Petone Beach, north of Wellington, to protest plans to demolish the community's historic timber wharf.</p>
        
            <p>As part of its draft Long Term Plan, Hutt City Council is proposing to demolish Petone Wharf, after it was damaged in a series of earthquakes and closed for urgent repairs in 2021.</p>

            <p>The Save Petone Wharf group organised a community walk from Petone Settlers Museum to the beach, to encourage the public to make submissions on the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Save Petone Wharf spokesperson John Roper said its demolition would be heartbreaking.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the second-longest timber wharf in New Zealand. It was built in 1890 and it was rebuilt in 1906, and has been the focal point of the community since then," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has got an amazing history, and it was interesting today talking and walking down at the beach with people - everybody had a story about the wharf."</p>

            <p>There were people who had memories of their children jumping off the wharf, of catching fish off it, and even someone who had been married on the wharf, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the community were baffled by the proposal to tear the wharf down, Roper said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the Long Term Plan, there are two options to do with the wharf: the first option is to pull the wharf down and spend the capital cost of $6 million. The second one is to pull the wharf down for $6 million and then spend an extra $4 million for a memorial and a viewing platform.</p>
        
            <p>"We have got a costing from an international repair company for $6 million to repair the wharf, to get it back to the state that it can be opened and reused again.</p>
        
            <p>"So our logic, and what a lot of people are saying, is why would you spend that amount of money to pull it down, when you can spend the same amount of money and save it?"</p>
        
            <p>Submissions on the Hutt City Council draft Long Term Plan close on 3 May.</p>
