        <h2>Thousands protest Fast-track Approvals Bill in central Auckland</h2>
        <p>
Rallies have been held around the country to oppose the bill, which gives three ministers the final say over major infrastructure and development projects.
</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of people gathered in central Auckland have been told that they must say no to the Fast-track Approvals Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The protesters - including former Green Party co-leader Russel Norman, Forest & Bird's Nicola Toki and actress Robyn Malcolm - made their way down Queen Street as part of the March for Nature.</p>

            <p>The bill will see three ministers in charge of deciding on whether major infrastructure or development projects should go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The former Green Party co-leader and Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman believes the bill will be bad for the environment.</p>

            <p>"We must stop those who would destroy nature for profit.</p>
        
            <p>"The vast majority of New Zealanders - nine out of 10 people, when you survey them - say they do not want development that causes more destruction of nature."</p>
        
            <p>Norman told the crowd gathered at Aotea Square in Auckland that the bill was worth fighting against.</p>

            <p>"Expect resistance from the people of Aotearoa. There will be no seabed mining off the coast of Taranaki. There will be no new coal mines in pristine native forest.</p>
        
            <p>"We will stop them - just like we stopped the oil exploration companies. We disrupted them until they gave up."</p>
        
            <p>The government would be on the wrong side of history if it ignored protesters, Norman said.</p>

            <p>Pro-Palestinian protesters are also at the rally, with banners accusing the government of being complicit in genocide.</p>
        
            <p>A march against the axing of thousands of state sector jobs is also being held in Wellington.</p>
