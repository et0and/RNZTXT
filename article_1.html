            <p>The last few residents have reportedly been evacuated from Waipoua Settlement in Northland as the remote, forested area is threatened by a massive fire on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers of the Te Kopuru Fire Brigade reportedly brought the last two residents out of the settlement to the safety of the Waipoua River mouth on the west coast.</p>
        
            <p>Access to the Waipoua Settlement is not possible from State Highway 12 due to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed some firefighters are also unable to get out by road and will have to evacuate via the beach.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is close to the former Waipoua Forest headquarters and about 6 kilometres from the kauri tree Tane Mahuta.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, four helicopters and multiple fire crews made their way to the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>It is roughly 6km south of Tāne Mahuta, the world's largest surviving kauri tree</p>
