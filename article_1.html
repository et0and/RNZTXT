            <p>A Dutch architect is harnessing the rising seas as the basis for an architectural revolution: Floating cities.</p>
        
            <p>Homes are built on concrete foundations that are anchored to the seabed. They rise and fall with the tide, offering a safer future as the climate changes.</p>
        
            <p>Waterstudio.NL, an architecture firm based in the Netherlands, has built the first houses in a floating city in the Maldives, and development of another floating city off the South Korean coast will begin later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Waterstudio.NL architect Koen Olthuis told Sunday Morning the houses in the Maldives had the "same look and feel and stability and cost" as normal houses - but instead of cars or bikes, people used private boats or water taxis to move around their neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>They had been designed to withstand natural disasters by looking at the effects on the Maldives of the 2004 tsunami, he said.</p>
        
            <p>During that tsunami, the waves stayed "quite small" but moved "very very fast across the water", Olthuis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have now designed for the worst scenario - that means there will be a little bit of water damage, but never any personal damages."</p>

            <p>Depending on the deepness of the ocean or river, it was often safer and better for the environment to build on water than on reclaimed land, Olthuis said.</p>
        
            <p>The architecture firm had built floating villas on canals in Amsterdam, but floating cities could eventually grow much taller.</p>
        
            <p>"On the water, it doesn't matter if you have one storey or three storeys or six storeys. It's just about the foundation - as long as the floating foundation is large enough and stable enough, you can build small towers on the water. That's the trend we are now moving towards."</p>
        
            <p>Floating cities were dynamic and elements could be moved around to suit the needs of the inhabitants.</p>
        
            <p>Houses could be moved closer together during winter, or redirected towards the sun, while floating parks could be move to better serve different neighbourhoods.</p>
        
            <p>"That means in the summer the city can look completely different than in the wintertime."</p>
        
            <p>Building on water could also be cheaper than building on land, as buying land in the city could be very expensive, Olthuis said.</p>
