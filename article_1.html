            <p>Questions are being raised about whether New Zealand might also be caught up in cyber campaigns that have prompted the US and UK to introduce new sanctions against China.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021 New Zealand revealed it had been victim to 'malicious cyber activity' undertaken by the Chinese Ministry of State Security.</p>
        
            <p>The US Justice Department and FBI say millions of Americans' online accounts have been caught up in a Chinese hacking plot that targeted US officials.</p>
        
            <p>And in the UK, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden accused China of being responsible for targeting the Electoral Commission and MPs.</p>
        
            <p>MPs on New Zealand's Security and Intelligence committee are meeting on Tuesday and are expected to be briefed by the heads of the SIS and GCSB.</p>
