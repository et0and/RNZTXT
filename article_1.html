            <p>A rain band moving across the upper North Island continues to bring heavy rain and thunderstorms throughout the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Rain has put a damper on many sporting and outdoor events around the country, including one music festival.</p>
        
            <p>The Love Your Ways Music Festival in Auckland featuring Basement Jaxx and others was cancelled, with organisers saying they were "devastated" on social media, but "the event has been deemed unsafe to proceed."</p>
        
            <p>The second T20 cricket international between New Zealand and Pakistan in Mount Maunganui has also been abandoned due to the weather.</p>
        
            <p>Only 11 overs of play was possible with New Zealand reaching 72 for two before the rain forced the players from the field and they never returned.</p>
        
            <p>Bangladesh led the three match series one nil, which means the Black Caps must win game three in Mount Maunganui on Sunday, to level the series.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said further heavy rain can be expected in Auckland, Northland, Taranaki, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It said an estimated 15 to 25mm of rain will fall in some of those areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there could be localised surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, parts of the South Island are also under heavy rain warnings and watches, including Nelson, Buller, Richmond and Bryant ranges and the ranges of Westland.</p>
        
            <p>It is wet weather for many parts of the country tonight, but those heading out to New Year's festivals can look forward to a sunnier weekend.</p>
        
            <p>MetService Meteorologist John Law said that for those at festivals on the East Coast, Saturday looks to be the best day in the lead up to the new year.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the more notable thing for that eastern coast will be some exceptionally high temperatures on Saturday, but also some really warm, muggy nights coming through so well worth airing in that tent as you go through the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Law said that another band of rain will move across the country on Sunday, potentially bringing showers for Auckland and Northern areas just as the calendar turns into 2024.</p>
