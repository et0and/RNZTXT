            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII will be laid to rest on Thursday, alongside his tupuna at the top of his ancestral Maunga Taupiri.</p>
        
            <p>Tainui iwi, who are the kaitiaki of the Kiingitanga movement, have released the official proceedings for Te Whakawahinga (raising up) ceremony, for the successor, and for the funeral service.</p>
        
            <p>The formal ceremony to announce the successor will start at 10am when the Tekau-maa-rua (the Kiingitanga advisory council) will usher the new M훮ori monarch to the throne.</p>
        
            <p>Once the new monarch sits on the throne there will be Karakia Whakawahinga.</p>
        
            <p>Tumuaki Hone Taamihana will then place a bible on the head of the monarch, using the same bible that Tumuaki Wiremu Taamihana used to raise up the first M훮ori Kiingi, Pootatau Te Wherowhero, in 1858.</p>
        
            <p>Archbishop Don Tamihere will say a karakia to bless the new monarch with sacred oils.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whakawahinga ceremony will be followed by the funeral service for Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>

            <p>Following the internment, the funeral procession will return to Tuurangawaewae Marae, where Tekau-maa-rua will lead whare ariki (members of the royal house) onto the marae, followed by a haakari (feast) to conclude the tangihanga.</p>

            <p>NZTA said heavy congestion is expected on State Highway 1, between Ngaaruawaahia and Huntly. They have published information about road closures and detours on their website.</p>
        
            <p>Police will have a noticeable presence on the roads, and have urged all drivers to pay close attention to what is in front of them, given the influx of people arriving into the district. Motorists should drive safely and make allowances for those from outside the district who may be unfamiliar with local roads, they said.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a train for people to take to Taupiri mountain from Ngaaruawaahia.</p>
