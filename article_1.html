            <p>Microsoft says it estimates that 8.5 million computers around the world were disabled by the global IT outage.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time that a number has been put on the incident, which is still causing problems around the world.</p>
        
            <p>The glitch came from a cyber security company called CrowdStrike, which sent out a corrupted software update to its huge number of customers.</p>
        
            <p>Microsoft, which is helping customers recover, said in a blog post: "We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices."</p>
        
            <p>The post by David Weston, vice-president, enterprise and OS at the firm, says this number is less than 1 percent of all Windows machines worldwide, but that "the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services".</p>
        
            <p>The company can be very accurate on how many devices were disabled by the outage as it has performance telemetry to many by their internet connections.</p>
        
            <p>The tech giant - which was keen to point out that this was not an issue with its software - says the incident highlights how important it is for companies such as CrowdStrike to use quality control checks on updates before sending them out.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also a reminder of how important it is for all of us across the tech ecosystem to prioritise operating with safe deployment and disaster recovery using the mechanisms that exist," Weston said.</p>
        
            <p>The fall-out from the IT glitch has been enormous and was already one of the worst cyber-incidents in history.</p>
        
            <p>The number given by Microsoft means it is probably the largest ever cyber-event, eclipsing all previous hacks and outages.</p>
        
            <p>The closest to this is the WannaCry cyber-attack in 2017, which is estimated to have impacted around 300,000 computers in 150 countries. There was a similar costly and disruptive attack called NotPetya a month later.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a major six-hour outage in 2021 at Meta, which runs Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. But that was largely contained to the social media giant and some linked partners.</p>
        
            <p>The massive outage has also prompted warnings by cyber-security experts and agencies around the world about a wave of opportunistic hacking attempts linked to the IT outage.</p>
        
            <p>Cyber agencies in the UK and Australia are warning people to be vigilant to fake emails, calls and websites that pretend to be official.</p>
        
            <p>And CrowdStrike head George Kurtz encouraged users to make sure they were speaking to official representatives from the company before downloading fixes.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this," he said in a blog post.</p>
        
            <p>Whenever there is a major news event, especially one linked to technology, hackers respond by tweaking their existing methods to take into account the fear and uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>According to researchers at Secureworks, there has already been a sharp rise in CrowdStrike-themed domain registrations - hackers registering new websites made to look official and potentially trick IT managers or members of the public into downloading malicious software or handing over private details.</p>
        
            <p>Cyber security agencies around the world have urged IT responders to only use CrowdStrike's website to source information and help.</p>
        
            <p>The advice is mainly for IT managers who are the ones being affected by this as they try to get their organisations back online.</p>
        
            <p>But individuals too might be targeted, so experts are warning to be to be hyper vigilant and only act on information from the official CrowdStrike channels.</p>
