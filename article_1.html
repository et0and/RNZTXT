        <p>
Philip Polkinghorne's wife was referred to a crisis team by her GP in 2019 after saying she had "suicidal thoughts".

            <p>Content warning: This story deals with mentions of suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The long-time family doctor of an Auckland woman allegedly killed by her eye-surgeon doctor has told the court about her patient calling her about suicidal thoughts in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne is on trial accused of murdering Pauline Hanna in their Remuera home in 2021, then staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The general practitioner, whose name has been suppressed by Justice Lang, took the witness stand on Thursday afternoon and revealed more details about Hanna's medical history.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock about when there was a time Hanna wanted to talk to the doctor about being unwell, the witness recalled receiving a call from Hanna days before Christmas in 2019 where she said her mother is in hospital, her husband had left her and she had "suicidal thoughts".</p>
        
            <p>"I asked do you have plans, she said 'no, I just don't feel right'," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said Hanna was referred to the crisis team, and when they spoke to her the next day, Hanna said she was feeling "much better" and had spoken to her psychologist.</p>

            <p>The incident was also mentioned by the defence last week.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) since 2001, and had also started weight loss medication from 2004, the court heard.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said Hanna was taking "quite a bit of alcohol" - one bottle per night - at one point, and had frequent blackouts, not being able to remember the end of the evening.</p>
        
            <p>They said Hanna was prescribed Naltrexone to help with reducing her alcohol intake.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said Hanna was drinking about two glasses per night by 2019, and had been seeing a psychiatrist and specialists to address the issue.</p>
        
            <p>When later cross-examined by defence lawyer Hannah Stuart whether it was fair to say Hanna was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, the witness said "most likely".</p>
        
            <p>Stuart undertook an exhaustive cross-examination which combed through Hanna's history of medication prescriptions since the early 2000s.</p>
        
            <p>Stuart questioned why Hannah was prescribed weight loss medication Reductile when she was not in fact overweight, and also asked whether the doctor agreed the drug could magnify depressive thoughts, to which the witness said "No".</p>
        
            <p>The witness said many patients having weight loss medication are much happier and more energetic.</p>
        
            <p>A conversation Hanna had with close friends more than a year before her death went under thorough cross-examination in court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>John Riordan and his wife Pheasant Riordan earlier told the court that Hanna told them during a dinner with them in North Havelock, that Polkinghorne had attempted to strangle her.</p>
        
            <p>When questioned by defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC on Thursday, Riordan conceded that he could not recall exactly what led up to that disclosure.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as she came up with 'he tried to strangle me' it's like everything else went out the door, because all I'm focused on is if this is the case, we need to get Pauline to safety," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So if I'm a little hazy about what might have been said as the preamble, I can't do anything about that.</p>
        
            <p>"You didn't sound very hazy yesterday sir, you sounded very clear about what you wanted to impress upon the jury," said Mansfield, referring to Riordan's evidence given on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield also took aim at the fact that Riordan cannot provide further evidence of any conversations with Hanna about his concerns for her wellbeing after she told them about Polkinghorne's attempt to strangle her.</p>
        
            <p>"I would not be surprised if we did have one (conversation)," Riordan said, but admitted that he did not have evidence.</p>
