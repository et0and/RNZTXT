            <p>ACT leader David Seymour says progress has been made on tax, and the parties are looking at ministerial positions as well as policies now.</p>
        
            <p>He spoke to media after a day of meetings negotiating the formation of the government with National and New Zealand First that included the first face-to-face with all three party leaders at a hotel in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>National subsequently met with both parties separately.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour explained a cut on his face was from the razor that morning. Much like his shave, the parties were getting "closer by the day" to reaching agreement.</p>
        
            <p>He said ministerial positions as well as policies were now being explored in the talks.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say we're talking about both at this point," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said progress was being made on tax, which emerged in recent reporting as a likely sticking point in the negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"We've made some progress on tax, I think us and New Zealand First probably have different tax issues and we'll keep working on those," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's mathematical but I think where there is agreement, everyone wants to end government waste and have the average person paying less tax, it's just a question of what the structure of that is."</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty of Waitangi and its principles is another topic of controversy where the different parties have their own stances. ACT campaigned for a referendum on it.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour on Wednesday said they were getting close to reaching agreement on the matter with the other parties, but were not there yet - and did not give away the details of what such an agreement might look like.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously an area that we believe is important for the future of New Zealand, we've made a lot of progress there and I think we're pretty close."</p>
        
            <p>The trio were meeting in Auckland after both Seymour and Luxon travelled to Wellington, with expectations of putting together a three-way meeting - but in the end Peters did not travel to the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said Auckland was the home city for all three leaders - as well as his deputy Brooke van Velden, but whether a final agreement would be reached in the city of sails was "well above my pay grade".</p>
        
            <p>He denied any kind of relationship problems between the three.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't believe that there is a relationship issue on my behalf. I don't hold any grudges or feel that anyone's acted improperly there, obviously I can't speak for the other two but as far as I'm aware they don't have any relational issues because of that as well."</p>
