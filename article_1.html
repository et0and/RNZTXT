            <p>Kamala Harris has questioned Donald Trump's mental state after the 78-year-old Republican's latest televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session.</p>
        
            <p>"Hope he's okay," the Democratic candidate posted on X.</p>
        
            <p>Harris' campaign, which has begun to aggressively challenge Trump on his health and mental stability, said that during the late Monday event he appeared "lost, confused, and frozen on stage".</p>
        
            <p>Former president Trump defended the event in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, saying it was "so different".</p>
        
            <p>"It was amazing! The Q and A was almost finished when people began fainting from the excitement and heat," Trump posted on his Truth Social network.</p>
        
            <p>"We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going. So different, but it ended up being a GREAT EVENING!"</p>
        
            <p>He then hit out at vice president Harris, who released a White House medical report at the weekend that said she was fit for the highest office and challenged Trump to do the same.</p>
        
            <p>"With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for President! MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!"</p>
        
            <p>Trump's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung declared that "something very special" had taken place between the billionaire and the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>For about half an hour, the event in Oaks near Philadelphia was standard fare ahead of the 5 November election: Trump took friendly questions from supporters on the economy and cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>With the session moderated by a loyal right-wing ally, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Trump was on cruise control - although he got the election date wrong by two months, urging supporters to vote "on January 5".</p>
        
            <p>After the town hall paused for two audience members who required medical attention, Trump then switched focus.</p>
        
            <p>Jokingly asking whether "anybody else would like to faint," Trump declared: "Let's not do any more questions."</p>
        
            <p>"Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?" Trump said.</p>
        
            <p>And so they did: for more than half an hour, the Trump playlist blasted while the candidate mostly stood on stage listening and slowly dancing.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has made a brief, jerky dance his signature at the end of rallies for years, nearly always to his exit song - the Village People's 1978 disco anthem 'YMCA'.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, however, he stayed on stage for nine songs, ranging from opera to a series of Trump favourites, including Guns N' Roses' 'November Rain', Rufus Wainwright's rendition of 'Hallelujah', Elvis and of course 'YMCA'.</p>
        
            <p>And his dance routine expanded from the familiar jerky motion to a slow swaying. Often, however, he did not dance but stood in place and stared out into the crowd and sometimes pointed at people.</p>
        
            <p>Harris and Trump are locked in a dead heat, according to polls, and the election is set to be decided by seven swing states where the margins could come down to barely 10,000 votes each.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Trump was set to discuss the economy in Chicago and hold a rally in Georgia, a swing state. Harris was giving an interview to popular radio host Charlamagne tha God in an effort to boost her messaging to Black male voters - a part of the electorate where Trump has made gains.</p>
        
            <p>With only three weeks to go, Harris has begun to home in on Trump's health and age. She turns 60 this Sunday and last weekend released a medical report in which the White House doctor declared her "in excellent health", with the "physical and mental resiliency" to serve as president.</p>
        
            <p>Trump is now the oldest person ever to be nominated for a presidential bid, after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate that sparked fears about his own age.</p>
        
            <p>Trump, who has been the target of two assassination attempts during the campaign, has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health, prompting fierce criticism from Harris.</p>
