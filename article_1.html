            <p>Corrections staff were allegedly bribed with sex and money to take contraband into Rimutaka Prison.</p>
        
            <p>Six people have been charged with corruption and bribery after a three-year investigation by police into the Upper Hutt jail.</p>
        
            <p>The National Organised Crime Group has led the investigation named Operation Portia since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Of the six defendants - a prisoner, a current prison employee, a member of the public and three former employees - five appeared in Hutt Valley District Court on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Corrections said the current employee has been suspended.</p>
        
            <p>A 50-year-old man, who cannot be named, appeared in Hutt Valley District Court on Tuesday for allegedly accepting sex twice from a woman named Jacinta Cherry, 37, as a bribe to smuggle contraband into the prison.</p>
        
            <p>Cherry has been charged with corruptly bribing the man with sex and failed to appear in court.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Tim Black issued a warrant for her arrest and refused her lawyer's request for name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>A current Rimutaka inmate is allegedly party to offering that bribe.</p>
        
            <p>Three men have been charged with accepting multiple monetary bribes between $65 and $1300 to bring contraband into the prison.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Portia followed another investigation named Operation Dory which was a drug-related investigation at Rimutaka Prison.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Portia involved interviewing almost 200 people, including Corrections staff and prisoners, as well as reviewing phones, bank data and CCTV footage.</p>
        
            <p>The corruption and bribery charges required Attorney General consent to prosecute according to police.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they have worked collaboratively with the Department of Corrections to prevent corruption and strengthen prison systems.</p>
