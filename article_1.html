            <p>After an unlikely win in the opener, the Black Caps are out to clinch the series with a game to spare at Mt Maunganui's Bay Oval.</p>
        
            <p>The new-look New Zealand team beat Sri Lanka by eight runs on Saturday, after it had looked as if the visitors were cruising in their chase.</p>
        
            <p>Sri Lanka were 121 for no loss in their pursuit of 173 runs, but a Jacob Duffy triple-strike turned the tide of the contest.</p>
        
            <p>The second game begins at 7.15pm today, with the final game at Saxton Oval in Nelson scheduled for 1.15pm on Thursday.</p>
