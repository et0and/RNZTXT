        <h2>Building reforms will deliver 'more homes, more quickly' - Property Council</h2>
        <p>
The government is looking at changes to the building consent system - including who is liable when properties are defective.

            <p>Reform of the building consent regime will mark the beginning of a "new era for the construction industry", a developers' lobby group says.</p>
        
            <p>The government announced on Sunday it would be reforming the building consent system - including reducing the number of consenting authorities.</p>
        
            <p>It was also looking at changing who was legally responsible for payouts over defective buildings.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement followed proposed 'granny flat' law changes that would remove the new for consents home homes under 60sqm.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Building and Construction Chris Penk said the "cumbersome" consenting system meant New Zealand had some of the "least affordable housing in the world".</p>
        
            <p>The system was intended to protect homeowners from defective building work, by requiring it to be inspected and consented by a Building Consent Authority (BCA).</p>
        
            <p>A lack of consistency in how the 67 BCAs were interpreting the building code was leading to costs and delays for builders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Among the new options being considered to replace the current BCA system were:</p>
        
            <p>The government was also looking at changing who was legally responsible for payouts over defective buildings.</p>
        
            <p>"Under the current settings, councils and their ratepayers are liable for defective work," Penk said.</p>
        
            <p>"Joint and several liability means councils can be 'the last person standing' available to foot the bill when things go wrong. This creates a highly conservative and risk-averse approach, which contributes cost and draws out deadlines."</p>

            <p>Property Council chief executive Leonie Freeman welcomed the changes as a "bold move", saying they would cut through red tape and deliver faster, more efficient developments.</p>
        
            <p>"Our members, including the country's leading property developers, investors, managers and property experts, have been clear: the current consenting system is plagued by delays and inconsistencies across regions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hindering progress and escalating costs for projects that are crucial to meeting New Zealand's housing needs."</p>
        
            <p>Developers had reported wait times over two months for building consents, and up to 18 months for resource consents, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This creates a level of uncertainty that drives up costs, slows progress and ultimately puts home affordability further out of reach."</p>

            <p>The announcement marked "the beginning of a new era for the construction industry", and the group had been "actively engaging" with the government on the issue all year, she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are fully supportive of the options presented today. Faster, streamlined consents mean faster, more affordable housing, which benefits everyone," Freeman said.</p>
        
            <p>An advocate for owners of leaky homes said the government needs to be cautious around any re-introduction of private building consent providers.</p>
        
            <p>The president of home owners and buyers association, John Gray, said this was practiced in the 1990s and owners had suffered from the providers' lack of competency.</p>
        
            <p>"It did not work then and it will not work now, unless they get competent people.</p>
        
            <p>"And most importantly, that those private certifiers have mandatory insurance to back them for their failures."</p>
        
            <p>Gray said many private certifying companies went bust in the '90s because no insurers were prepared to take the risk of insuring them.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the ACT party urged the government to "go harder" on its reforms.</p>
        
            <p>ACT housing, building, and construction spokesman Cameron Luxton said the government should also look at letting home builders opt out of building consents, provided they had long-term insurance for the work.</p>
        
            <p>"That would get councils out of the way completely, for faster, more innovative, and ultimately more reliable building consents."</p>
