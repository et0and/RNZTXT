            <p>Officers have closed off sections of Hobson and Union streets and have since gone into the Goodview Apartment Hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the scene about 8am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told RNZ he saw two people arguing on the street. Soon after one of the men "got up, put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a gun and loaded it and pointed it at him and said he's going to shoot him".</p>
