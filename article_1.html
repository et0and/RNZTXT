            <p>The Silver Ferns have been dealt a blow heading into the Taini Jamison netball series against England, with defender Phoenix Karaka ruled out due to illness.</p>
        
            <p>Erena Mikaere, who last played for the Silver Ferns five years ago has been called into the squad ahead of Sunday's first test in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Dame Noeline Taurua said Karaka had been sick leading into their recent camp in Napier and had not recovered in time to be considered for any of the three tests.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really disappointing for Phoenix, but she was unable to meet the return to play protocols and the best option was to give her time to fully recover for the remainder of the Silver Ferns season," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Erena has been working with the Silver Ferns in camp so we feel it should be a seamless switch and I know she's going to relish the opportunity to get back out in the international arena."</p>
        
            <p>Karaka is expected to be available for the Constellation Cup against the Australian Diamonds, starting in Wellington on 20 October.</p>
