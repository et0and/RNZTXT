        <h2>Anger over treatment of Fijian Drua in NZ visit</h2>
        <p>
The team had to jump into the back of a truck to get a ride, and then were denied a late hotel checkout before their clash with the Hurricanes.

            <p>A former Fiji international has voiced his concern about the travel issues Fijian Drua endured when they were in New Zealand two weeks ago for their Super Rugby Pacific game against the Hurricanes.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes pipped Fijian Drua 38-34 at Napier's McLean Park in round two of the competition. The Drua team lost it in the last five minutes, having taken the lead just minutes before through a try.</p>
        
            <p>The Sydney Morning Herald reported Fijian Drua management wrote to the Super Rugby chief executive about the disruptions they encountered, which included the team having to pile into the back of a luggage truck to get to their hotel on arrival in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>After landing in Auckland close to midnight, the bus booked by Super Rugby organisers to take them to a nearby hotel did not arrive so they had to get a lift in the back of a truck.</p>
        
            <p>Drua then shared the same hotel in Napier as the Hurricanes but were told they could not get a late check-out ahead of the 4pm game, because the city was also hosting a major triathlon festival that weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Drua later learned the Hurricanes were able to stay at the hotel until just before the kick-off.</p>
        
            <p>Following a review, Super Rugby Pacific found several breakdowns in communication created challenges for the Drua but said those issues had been addressed with the clubs and an external transport provider.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Facebook, former Flying Fijian and Waratahs winger Nemani Nadolo questioned how it could even happen.</p>
        
            <p>"What frustrates me the most is that after a long flight, the team arrives at the airport only to find that their bus is nowhere to be seen. Instead of waiting another three hours for it to arrive, the boys jump in the back of a truck to get to the hotel," Nodolo said.</p>
        
            <p>"To make matters worse, they're denied a late checkout, leaving them to either wander around or sleep in the lobby for hours-while the Hurricanes squad gets to rest comfortably in their rooms right up until game time.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and a lot of others said they lost that game in the last 10 minutes. But after hearing what happened, I think they actually lost the game the minute they landed in Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Nadolo said when Super Rugby franchises visit Fiji, they were treated like royalty, with police escorts and top-tier hospitality. "Can you imagine an Australian or New Zealand team ever being put through something like this?" he asked.</p>
        
            <p>The Fijian Drua host the Chiefs in Lautoka on Saturday.</p>
