            <p>A family is shocked after their 83-year-old father was "dumped" by a Intercity bus driver half way through the journey.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Gardiner was travelling from Christchurch to Nelson when the bus stopped for a break in Kaikōura.</p>
        
            <p>Gardiner got off the bus to get a snack, and hurrying to get back on, he fell.</p>
        
            <p>His daughter-in-law, Bex Gardiner, said agitated with how long he was taking to get on the bus, the bus driver dumped his luggage and left him there.</p>
        
            <p>Bex Gardiner told Checkpoint people on the bus had reached out to her and described the "terrible treatment" her father-in-law received, and told her passengers had tried to get the driver to stop when he drove off.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily, employees at the local souvenir shop came to Barry Gardiner's aid and one drove him to her house.</p>
        
            <p>"He's 83-years-old and what if his phone wasn't charged? There's no way he knows our numbers off by heart. So many things run through my mind, just makes me angry...</p>
        
            <p>"He could've gone into shock and died from this, you just don't know."</p>
        
            <p>Bex Gardiner said what had happened to her father-in-law was "absolutely shocking".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't wish it upon anyone."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was still to hear back from an email she had sent to Intercity about the situation, although they had responded to a Facebook post and called her father-in-law.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was "better than nothing" but she wanted them to employ people with "a bit of respect" and who are kind.</p>
        
            <p>She did not want the bus driver to lose their job over the situation, but "you don't do that to people".</p>
        
            <p>Apart from being embarrassed and having a sore knee from his fall, her father-in-law was doing okay, Bex Gardiner said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to Checkpoint, Intercity said the situation was "deeply concerning".</p>
        
            <p>"We apologise unreservedly to Mr Gardiner for the experience he has had on our service which is unacceptable. We have spoken with the passenger to check on his welfare and to offer a full refund.</p>
        
            <p>"Intercity is engaging with its teams to provide further support and ensure its standards are upheld in the future."</p>
