            <p>All Blacks winger Caleb Clarke has admitted to driving dangerously and says he is "extremely apologetic and embarrassed".</p>
        
            <p>He said he made an error of judgement while riding his motorbike in Auckland in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year, I made an error of judgement while riding my motorbike in Auckland. I've taken full responsibility for my actions and have entered a guilty plea today. I'm extremely apologetic and embarrassed. The court and employment processes are ongoing and I am now going to focus fully on my rugby," Clarke said.</p>
        
            <p>Through his lawyer Rowan Butler, Clarke pleaded guilty to failling to stop and driving in a dangerous manner, in the Auckland District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Butler has requested a discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke, 25, is a winger for the Blues and the All Blacks. He is the son of former All Blacks midfielder Eroni Clarke.</p>
        
            <p>He has played 28 tests for New Zealand since making his debut in 2020 and was part of the 2023 World Cup squad.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues said they are aware of a driving incident last year involving Clarke.</p>
        
            <p>"Caleb has taken full responsibility for his actions and the matter is now subject to an employment process."</p>
