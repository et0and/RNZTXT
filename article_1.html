            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau and a group of councillors are calling for the resignation of Wellington Water's board chairperson and another board member.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday Nick Leggett said he was "taking soundings" on whether he should resign after a scathing report revealed possible theft and problems at his organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"I could be the sacrificial lamb," he told Morning Report on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He could also help with the fix, he told the programme.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
