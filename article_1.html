            <p>Heavy snowfall in parts of the South Island has left thousands without power and some schools and roads closed.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury high country and inland Otago are bracing for heavy snowfall with orange warnings in place.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said up to 25 centimetres of snow is forecast to settle above 600 metres in Otago, and up to 20cm in Canterbury, south of the Rakaia river.</p>
