            <p>Provincial Unions have rejected New Zealand Rugby's proposed governance reforms.</p>
        
            <p>Proposal one, which was backed by the NZR board and essentially adopted all the recommendations from last year's independent governance review, failed to get the two thirds majority required, with a vote of 31 for and 59 against.</p>
        
            <p>The voting members will now vote on proposal two, put forward by a group of provincial unions including Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>That proposal would keep some form of provincial representation, with three of the nine directors having to have served provincial boards in the past.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's independent review recommended that all nine members of the NZ Rugby board be independently appointed.</p>
        
            <p>Currently the 26 provincial unions and the Maori Rugby Board nominate three of the board members.</p>
        
            <p>The Players Association, representing the country's professional players, had threatened to walk away from the game if last year's Pilkington review recommendations weren't fully implemented.</p>
        
            <p>More to come..</p>
