        <h2>Big tour buses banned from 'most stunning' views of Aotearoa</h2>
        <p>
Tour bus access to one of the best views in New Zealand is being restricted due to safety concerns.

It is a view tour operators say is worth a detour, but the Lake Clearwater Hutholders Association do not want big buses rolling through the village.

            <p>Tour bus access to one of the best views in New Zealand is being restricted due to safety concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Signs stating "no coaches" were placed in the Lake Clearwater hut settlement by the Ashburton District Council in June.</p>
        
            <p>It came after hut holders became fed up with the impacts of the large tour buses driving through the area.</p>
        
            <p>Hassle Free Tours owner Mark Gilbert has been taking visitors to destinations like Erewhon Station and the Lord of the Rings location at Mt Sunday for two decades.</p>
        
            <p>The council held a hearing on the issue after Gilbert requested a review into the restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>A decision was made to retain the signs, but with an amendment stating no large coaches (over 20 seats) and to form a working group to discuss alternative options. The decision would be reviewed in 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>Gilbert and other tour companies stop at the edge of Lake Clearwater for a photo opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"This vantage point offers our guests a breathtaking view down Lake Clearwater, which I personally consider one of the most stunning spots in all of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is another way we could get to that viewpoint we would drive it tomorrow," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Buses must drive through the lake settlement to get to the view.</p>
        
            <p>The Lake Clearwater Hutholders Association contacted the council in February airing its concerns, seeking a restriction of "heavy vehicles using these roads".</p>
        
            <p>Association committee member Colin Pearson said the buses create dust, noise, safety issues, and road damage.</p>
        
            <p>He said the association does not want to cut all access, but they do not want big buses driving through the settlement.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the request, the council installed "no tour coaches" signs on 27 June on Mount D'Archiac Drive, Mount Possession Street, and Mount Jollie Street.</p>
        
            <p>It means the tour coaches are required to park at the Lake Camp car park and walk around 300 metres through the settlement to the lakeside viewpoint.</p>
        
            <p>Council owns the land occupied by the 180 baches in the settlement.</p>
        
            <p>Mount Possession Street is a legal road while the signs located at Mount D'Archiac Drive and Mount Jollie Street are on private council freehold land.</p>
        
            <p>As the landowner, the council has the discretion to impose any restrictions on the use of that land.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to retain the restriction of large buses but to allow the smaller buses was seen as a compromise.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Russell Ellis warned it may be a compromise that does not suit either party.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty-seat buses sounds a good idea but if you end up three times as many of them, how does the dust problem go away?"</p>
        
            <p>The majority of councillors were in favour of the adjusted restrictions but wanted to see the association and the tour providers work together on solutions.</p>
