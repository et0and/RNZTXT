            <p>Day one of competition at Te Matatini is well underway with performances from 14 groups in the first pool of the preliminary performances.</p>
        
            <p>The excitement was evident, with morning traffic jams caused by hundreds of spectators arriving early, some lining up two hours before the gates opened for the "Olympics of Kapa Haka" at Pukekura/ Bowl of Brooklands.</p>
        
            <p>Always a hard spot to be in, the first group opening the festival were Auckland stalwarts Te Rōpū Manutaki.</p>
