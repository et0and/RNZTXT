        <h2>'Sorry, it's quite a big one': Aftershock strikes mid-interview</h2>
        <p>
Vanuatu Business Resilience Council chair Glen Craig was talking to Morning Report when a 6.1 aftershock struck.

            <p>Aftershocks have continued to hit Vanuatu after a large 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck just off the coast of capital Port Vila on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu Business Resilience Council chair Glen Craig was talking to Morning Report when a 6.1 aftershock struck.</p>
        
            <p>Craig was discussing the need to do checks on key infrastructure to assess the damage after the initial earthquake, and was reiterating the need for help from Australia and New Zealand to check on some key buildings when the aftershock hit.</p>
        
            <p>"We have put in some requests to Australia, and I know the same requests have gone to New Zealand. So the requests have been for engineers so that they can do checks on the structural integrity of critical infrastructure like some of the key buildings, like hospitals, Prime Ministers Office, and some of the bridges.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that some bridges are out in some of the settlements. So we need to have those assessed to see how bad it is. We've requested search and rescue personnel."</p>

            <p>Craig was then interrupted by shaking.</p>
        
            <p>"There's another, quite a significant earthquake happening as we speak.</p>
        
            <p>"Sorry, it is quite a big one actually."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the interview Craig said that residents had been told to expect aftershocks, but was hopeful the worst of the earthquakes was behind them.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were 18 aftershocks overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"After what we've been through, they're scary... you think is this another big one happening.</p>
        
            <p>"We think that the worst of it is behind us, but we are expecting a few more in the day as well. This is what the scientists are telling us."</p>
        
            <p>After the shaking stopped, Craig called for more medical assistance for the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We need medical personnel to help us respond to the people that are injured."</p>
        
            <p>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson has told RNZ there are 58 New Zealanders registered as being in Vanuatu, though they expect there will be more who are not registered. At this stage they are not aware of New Zealanders killed or injured.</p>
