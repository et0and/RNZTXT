            <p>Three schools in Gisborne are in lockdown because of a threat, and cordons are in place.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said "a school" has gone into what they are calling a "self imposed lockdown" because of a threat.</p>
        
            <p>They said the public will see lots of officers in the Riverdale area, but they are there as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>There are cordons in the area near Nelson Road to redirect traffic.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook Riverdale Primary, Lytton High School, and Campion College all said they were in lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Lytton High School said police are on site.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, the school said it had entered an "unexpected lockdown".</p>
        
            <p>"Please do not come to school. We hope to have it resolved quickly and will contact you with more information as soon as possible. All children are safe in their classrooms."</p>
        
            <p>In an update, the school said students are secure.</p>
        
            <p>Kay Maaka at Riverdale School says they were told just before school pick-up time, and some students had gone home, but those still at the school were safe and well.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, Riverdale School said the incident was at Lytton High School.</p>
        
            <p>"The police have asked us to keep our students and staff in their classrooms until further notice. We are all safe. We ask that you do not come and pick up your children at this stage. We will keep you updated as soon as we know anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Kay Maaka says parents should stay away from the school while it follows emergency procedures.</p>
        
            <p>At 3.30pm, Campion College said its students had been released.</p>
        
            <p>It follows an earlier incident in Taup≈ç which saw a school go into lockdown on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>And on Tuesday, a school in Addington, Christchurch went into lockdown while police hunted for a man involved in a firearms incident.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
