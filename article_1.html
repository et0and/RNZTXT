        <h2>Labour says govt's five major health targets 'empty goals', lack deadlines</h2>
        <p>
Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall is responding to the government's announcement of "five major health targets" earlier today.
</p>
        
            <p>Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall says the government's "five major health targets" announced earlier today are an afterthought, with no deadlines as to when they will be met.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Health Minister Shane Reti spoke at WhangƒÅrei Hospital after a visit to the radiation oncology facility there.</p>
        
            <p>The targets are:</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said they ignored general practice and primary care, which was the part of the health system New Zealanders used most.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was concerned that the targets could be "gamed".</p>
        
            <p>"[During] the last National government we saw people taken off waiting lists to make those lists appear shorter and patients can be moved into virtual wards to make their time in the emergency department appear shorter than it really is."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said it was essential to have a goal of a high immunisation rate for children, but Health Minister Shane Reti needed to say when that would be achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was minister my expectation was that they had to get there within two financial years."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said the targets were "empty goals".</p>
        
            <p>"Dr Reti promised ambition but essentially ... without a deadline how's he going to mobilise the system to get there."</p>
        
            <p>There were multiple problems with the targets, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the targets do not have a deadline and therefore they do not function, they also do no focus on the parts of the health system we need them to focus on."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall also criticised the government's cancer treatment target which aimed to have 90 percent of patients to receive cancer management within 31 days of the decision to treat.</p>
        
            <p>In terms of cancer treatment it was essential to get people diagnosed quickly, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The most important time for people waiting for cancer treatment is the time from when you're suspected of having cancer to get all your investigations done - biopsies and scans.</p>
        
            <p>"They've [the government] chosen the period after that once it's completed through to when you get your treatment."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said it was pointless to wait four months to have the initial tests done and then to quickly go to treatment and Reti needed to focus on the earlier part of the process for that cancer target.</p>
        
            <p>It was easier to get a patient into cancer treatment once they had had all their tests done because there was no bottleneck there, Verrall said.</p>
        
            <p>The bottleneck in the system occurred at the point where the patient had scans and biopsies so the decision to treat could be made, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I suspect there's been a prioritisation over the things that are easy over the things that matter."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall pointed to an article in the New Zealand Medical Journal which she said stated cancer survival rates would not improve until there was a focus on early diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, Verrall said she did not believe the targets would deliver "meaningful health outcomes for New Zealanders" because they focused on the parts of the health system that were "easy to measure and easy to deliver on".</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said there needed to be changes to the general practice funding system but the government's challenge was to do that in the context of tax cuts.</p>
