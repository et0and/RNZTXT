        <h2>Winning seventh Olympic gold 'surreal', Dame Lisa Carrington says</h2>
        <p>
The women's K2 duo were so focussed on their own race, they didn't realise they were a full boat length ahead of their closest competitors.

            <p>The GOAT has bagged another gold.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington has added an eighth medal to her extensive collection of Olympic bling after cruising to victory in the women's K2 500m with Alicia Hoskin.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi crew romped home in one minute and 37 seconds, well ahead of the pack to defend their title from Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>The red-hot favourites for the final rocketed out to first and held it comfortably over Germany in second.</p>
        
            <p>No other crew could touch the kayak queen, and she and Hoskin hit another gear after the midway mark to obliterate the field by a boat length.</p>
        
            <p>In a fierce fight for second, Hungary won silver with Germany taking bronze.</p>
        
            <p>It marks Dame Lisa's seventh Olympic gold medal, and eighth overall.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was "really surreal" to bag her seventh gold.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] will probably take a little bit to sink in, but it's the paddling I love and I love this team. Nothing could ever beat that feeling."</p>
        
            <p>
The women crossed the finish line well ahead of the competition.

            <p>She said it was amazing paddling with Hoskin.</p>
        
            <p>"She is an incredible teammate, supporter, friend, all of the above. It's amazing to be able to do it out there with her.</p>
        
            <p>"She's got such a great attitude and helps me zone in on enjoying the paddling."</p>
        
            <p>Hoskin said she was so focussed on paddling, she did not realise where the other boats were, or how close the fight was for second.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't really know what was going on back there. I was locked in on Lisa and just trying to trust our strategy and our race and have a really good paddle.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't really realise how close it was, but I'm not surprised. These girls are amazing and prepared extremely hard as well."</p>
