        <h2>Watch live: Luxon and Albanese hold joint conference in Canberra</h2>
        <p>
The two prime ministers are facing questions after a meeting covering security, defence and trade.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese are facing questions after a meeting in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is in Australia, with security and defence front and centre, amid concerns over any potential New Zealand involvement in the AUKUS alliance.</p>
        
            <p>In a foreign policy speech in Sydney on Thursday, Luxon said New Zealand "must be a participant and a contributor - not an interested bystander" in international affairs.</p>
        
            <p>He has been in Canberra on Friday, for a meeting with Albanese. They will address the media together at 12.55pm (NZ time) before Luxon takes questions from the press.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, New Zealand and Australia celebrated 40 years of the Closer Economic Relations trade agreement, that allows people to live, work, trade and businesses to grow and invest more easily between the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>Australia is one of New Zealand's biggest trading partners, with two-way trade worth more than $31 billion last year.</p>
        
            <p>The trade and economic relationship is important as New Zealand navigates its independent foreign policy, balancing ties with China as it flirts with the possibility of joining AUKUS Pillar Two.</p>
