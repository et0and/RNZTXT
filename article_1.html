            <p>One person has died after being trapped inside a car for several hours when it crashed into a New Plymouth home.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they received a report of a vehicle colliding with a house on Riverside Drive in Merrilands about 9.15am.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency had earlier said the single occupant of the car had been rescued and no one else was injured. However, someone inside the house was taken to Taranaki Base Hospital with moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The driver, who had been trapped underneath the house on Riverside Drive in Merrilands, died.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency say it took several hours to pull the car out with a fire truck due to the position of the car.</p>
        
            <p>It confirmed power lines were knocked down during the crash and power was off in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the fallen lines also made it difficult for them to get to the driver.</p>
        
            <p>St John said it sent three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, and an operations manager to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the road has been closed while emergency services respond.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are to avoid the area if possible and expect delays."</p>
