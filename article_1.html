            <p>Former Prime Minister Dame Jacinda Ardern has written her first children's book, titled 'Mum's Busy Work'.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Jacinda said the book is a celebration of the relationship between working mothers and their children, based on real conversations she had with her daughter, Neve, when she was prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Ardern was elected prime minister in 2017 and, in 2018, gave birth to her daughter. She was the first leader of a country in 30 years to give birth while in office and the second only in global history.</p>
        
            <p>"Mum's Busy Work is based on the words and lessons taught to me by my daughter while I was prime minister of New Zealand. My hope is that every child knows that no matter what, they are our life's greatest work," Ardern said.</p>

            <p>Ruby Jones, the book's illustrator from Christchurch, said she had always wanted to work on book for children.</p>
        
            <p>"However, illustrating one for Jacinda - a woman I have admired for years - was well beyond anything I could have ever dreamt of. I think Mum's Busy Work perfectly captures the little family moments that feed our hearts during our busy lives, and I hope it brings joy to parents and children everywhere," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>The book will be released in New Zealand, Australia, US and UK on 30 September.</p>
        
            <p>Ardern currently lives with her husband and daughter in Boston in the US where she is a university lecturer and public speaker.</p>
