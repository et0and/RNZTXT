            <p>A warning has already been issued for Hawke's Bay, meaning streams and rivers could rise, with the possibility of slips and surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>From midday Monday, there is also a heavy rain watch for Northland.</p>

            <p>From Tuesday morning there are heavy rain watches for Gisborne, Wairarapa and Tararua.</p>
        
            <p>The watches could be upgraded to warnings, MetService said, and more areas could be affected.</p>

            <p>Gisborne and Hawke's Bay's heavy rain watch lasts until 6pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The government is changing rules to make it easier for lines companies to remove trees near powerlines, to prevent outages during high winds and storms.</p>
        
            <p>The move would ensure the power stayed on, particularly during severe weather events, Energy Minister Simeon Brown said. The changes will come into effect in September.</p>
