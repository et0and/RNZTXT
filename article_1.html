        <h2>Tree felling on hold over concerns about kiwi</h2>
        <p>
RNZ understands the developer has received a formal letter requesting a sweep of the property with a kiwi-detecting dog.

            <p>The felling of a large stand of mature gum trees next to Kerikeri's town centre appears to be on hold after concerns were raised that kiwi could be living in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Work had been due to start in mid-October to cut down a roughly 24-hectare block of trees known as the Bing Property, bordered by the town centre, Kerikeri River and the Heritage Bypass.</p>
        
            <p>The trees are mostly 90-year-old eucalypts and redwoods, forming the town's distinctive skyline, with some natives in the understorey.</p>
        
            <p>The land is zoned residential and no permission is required to fell the trees.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation has confirmed, however, it has asked the developer to check the property for kiwi before felling starts.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Islands operations manager Bronwyn Bauer-Hunt said DOC had contacted the planners with a suggestion they put a kiwi-detecting dog through the property.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had reports of kiwi being heard in that area. Our concern is if they are going to check in case there are taonga species in there."</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said it was standard procedure for forestry companies to check an area for kiwi before felling.</p>
        
            <p>"And we believe that is their responsibility," she said.</p>
        
            <p>DOC had no comment on the development itself. The department's concern was about the species that could be living in the area, she said.</p>
        
            <p>If kiwi were found, DOC would support the developers with translocating the birds to a safe location.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands a formal letter was sent to the developer, Turnstone, on Wednesday requesting a sweep of the area with a kiwi dog.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Turnstone, via its planner, for comment.</p>

            <p>The wider Kerikeri area is a stronghold for New Zealand's feathered national icon.</p>
        
            <p>Purerua Peninsula, in the northern Bay of Islands, holds the record for New Zealand's highest kiwi call count, thanks to years of intensive pest control.</p>
        
            <p>The Kerikeri suburbs of Rangitane and Opito Bay are known for some of the highest kiwi densities of any residential area in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Sightings in the town centre are rare, though in 2010 a kiwi was spotted running around in the Mill Lane industrial area.</p>
        
            <p>There were reportedly still a few in the Bing Property in 2008 when the Heritage Bypass was built.</p>
        
            <p>There have also been anecdotal reports of a solitary kiwi in the DOC reserve on the other side of Kerikeri River.</p>
        
            <p>Felling of the trees is a permitted activity so does not require council consent.</p>
        
            <p>A law change in 2012 removed all blanket protection of trees in urban New Zealand, except in areas subject to conservation plans.</p>
        
            <p>Individual trees can still be protected by being listed on the notable trees register.</p>
        
            <p>It is not known if the Bing Property is home to other endangered species such as native bats.</p>

The so-called Bing property, currently covered in 90-year-old gum trees, is the last significant chunk of undeveloped, residential-zoned land in central Kerikeri.

            <p>Meanwhile, work is continuing to plan the housing developments that could replace the gum trees.</p>
        
            <p>A concept plan prepared last year by the Planning Collective shows a new road through the property, running parallel to Kerikeri Road and linking Homestead Road with the Heritage Bypass.</p>
        
            <p>If built, that would create the town centre bypass long called for by councillors and local planning advocates.</p>
        
            <p>The plan splits the Bing Property in two, with six "super lots" at the northern end, closest to the Heritage Bypass, and a "lifestyle village" at the southern end adjoining the town centre, with a reception building and a café overlooking Kerikeri River.</p>
        
            <p>A "green link" would connect the new bypass road to the river.</p>
        
            <p>The idea is to create a mixed-use precinct connecting the town centre with the river, with a variety of retail and commercial premises, apartments, town houses, terraced houses, and standalone dwellings.</p>
        
            <p>The plan, however, only shows broad concepts and may have been superseded.</p>
        
            <p>The entire property is currently zoned residential. The planners have applied to the council for an extension to the town centre in the District Plan.</p>
