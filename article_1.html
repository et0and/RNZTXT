        <p>
Companies who between them control around $6 trillion worth of funds have made their way to Auckland for the summit.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is about to speak at the close of the two-day Infrastructure Investment Summit.</p>
        
            <p>Companies who between them control around $6 trillion worth of funds have made their way to Auckland for the government's much-heralded summit.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 organisations from 14 international countries heard from government ministers, who showcased areas in their portfolios where there are investment opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is flying to India Saturday for a four-day visit to Delhi and Mumbai. He is under pressure to make progress towards a free trade deal given his election pledge to strike an agreement.</p>
