            <p>Police say there is no active water search for a man who is believed to have gone overboard on a Wellington Harbour ferry on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Instead they say they are searching the shoreline.</p>
        
            <p>A water search will recommence if further information comes to light, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The East By West ferry was travelling towards Days Bay, Eastbourne from Queens Wharf and left just after 6am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The man was the only passenger onboard, and was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Coastguard and other vessels searched the harbour all day on Friday, but police temporarily suspended the search in the evening, pending a review.</p>
        
            <p>They still have not identified the man, and are calling on the public for information.</p>
        
            <p>He is described as in his 40's, fair skinned, around 180cm tall with darker hair.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing a dark jacket with a zip and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>Police want to hear from anyone who knows someone matching this description who hasn't returned home as expected.</p>
