            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has won the British Open at St Andrews.</p>
        
            <p>It is her third major title.</p>
        
            <p>Ko went into the final round tied for fourth, three shots from the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic champion fired a three under par 69 which got her into a share of the lead late in her round and a birdie on the 18th gave her a one-shot lead.</p>
        
            <p>Ko then had to wait for her rivals to finish their rounds.</p>
        
            <p>In the end the 27-year-old finished two shots ahead of Lilia Vu and Nelly Korda of the United States, Jiyai Shin of South Korea and Ruoning Yin of China.</p>
        
            <p>The win is worth US$1,425,000 (NZ$2.28 million) for Ko.</p>
        
            <p>Ko's previous best result at the British Open was a tie for third in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"Winning the gold medal in Paris was almost too good to be true and heading into the weekend I thought how is it possible for me to be in contention for the British Open," Ko told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had the most Cinderella-type story the last few weeks and this is almost too good to be true.</p>
        
            <p>"Of all the major championships, this one I had the least amount of confidence just because I haven't had as much experience playing on links (courses).</p>
        
            <p>"So to be holding this trophy, I can't believe it."</p>
        
            <p>Her win at the Paris Olympics has qualified her for World Golf's Hall of Fame.</p>
