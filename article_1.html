        <h2>Whanganui council-iwi agreement: How will this work?</h2>
        <p>
An iwi partnership is being considered by Whanganui District Council, which could encompass management of reserves, and a trust to foster social well-being - and could be legally binding.

            <p>Embedding a council partnership with Māori into New Zealand law will support a "positive and necessary" shift, Whanganui residents have been told.</p>
        
            <p>Whanganui District Council will next month decide on proposals put forward for the Treaty of Waitangi settlement being negotiated by Whanganui iwi and hapū.</p>
        
            <p>The proposals would embed into Treaty settlement legislation how the council partners with Takapau Whariki, the proposed post-settlement governance entity (PSGE) for Whanganui Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Around 350 people attended two information sessions co-hosted by the Whanganui Land Settlement Negotiation Trust (WLSNT) and the council in December about proposals that would legislate the council's post-Treaty settlement relationship with hapū and iwi.</p>
        
            <p>As part of redress for breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Whanganui Māori are proposing a platform for joint initiatives.</p>
        
            <p>The three elements of the platform are to:</p>
        
            <p>At its meeting on 13 February, the council is to consider signing up to the binding partnership - described in December by mayor Andrew Tripe as an unprecedented opportunity and "a world-first indigenous-council partnership".</p>
        
            <p>Negotiations between WLSNT and the Crown are expected to be finalised early this year.</p>
        
            <p>The council must make decisions on the proposals ahead of this.</p>
        
            <p>Answering questions put by the community, the council said on its website that partnership opportunities integrated into the settlement would bring benefits to the entire community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach from central government is not working.</p>
        
            <p>"By partnering with Whanganui Land Settlement, we are leading a shift towards local solutions for local issues, which is a positive and necessary step.</p>
        
            <p>"As community leaders, we have a deeper understanding of our people's needs, challenges and strengths, enabling us to create tailored, effective solutions that central government cannot.</p>
        
            <p>"Together, we can develop approaches that truly reflect the unique needs of our community."</p>

            <p>Asked about the cost of the initiatives and who would pay, the council said there were no additional costs to the council at this stage for the three initiatives.</p>
        
            <p>"The relationship agreement focuses on working together in a values-based way to benefit the Whanganui community, emphasising open communication and transparency," the council said.</p>
        
            <p>"The direct costs to ratepayers are expected to be very small."</p>
        
            <p>To set up a Statutory Reserves Board, WLSNT would provide a $500,000 fund.</p>
        
            <p>There would be no changes in the immediate term to council costs for reserve management.</p>
        
            <p>"The council will continue to maintain the reserves as it does now, ensuring the cost to ratepayers remains minimal.</p>
        
            <p>"Reserve management planning will flow into long term and annual budgeting processes, as it currently does."</p>
        
            <p>Board fees for appointees would not be significant.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the cost of maintaining reserves as shared public spaces would continue to be funded through rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving the administrator status from the council to a joint Statutory Board will not result in any change or additional impact on ratepayers for reserve management."</p>
        
            <p>Ownership of reserves would remain with the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>"The only change being proposed is that the administration of these specific reserves under the Reserves Act will shift from the council to a joint statutory board."</p>
        
            <p>That decision had been made through the Treaty settlement process by the Crown, not the council.</p>
        
            <p>The Pākaitore Moutoa Gardens Historic Reserve would be transferred from Crown ownership to the PSGE and administered by the joint board.</p>
        
            <p>The council (and/or community groups) would continue to own and maintain the buildings at Pukenamu Queen's Park and at the Gonville/ Tawhero Domain.</p>
        
            <p>Costs for the social well-being entity Toitū te Whānau were still being determined.</p>
        
            <p>"WLSNT are still in the early stages of developing and shaping this concept in partnership with Crown agencies," the council said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the immediate term the Crown agencies who will work with this initiative will bring their own resourcing and cover their own costs."</p>
        
            <p>WLSNT would also contribute to establishment costs, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked why the proposed relationship agreement had not been made available to the public, the council said the agreement was designed "to foster collaboration, not control".</p>
        
            <p>"It's about building a strong, cooperative partnership to address issues and opportunities effectively."</p>
        
            <p>The concept of the relationship agreement had been in the public arena since negotiations began and was outlined in the WLSNT Agreement in Principle, signed on 30 August 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The council could not share the draft agreement because negotiations were still underway.</p>
        
            <p>"Any early release would cause prejudice to the goodwill of the parties and the collaboration described above. It could also affect the progress of the negotiations."</p>
        
            <p>The council expects the relationship agreement will be released to the public in the meeting agenda for 13 February.</p>
