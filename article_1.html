            <p>One of Dunedin's most iconic dairies in the heart of the city is on the market.</p>
        
            <p>The Rob Roy dairy - famous for its enormous ice creams - sits on the corner of the city's main street George Street, and the University precinct.</p>
        
            <p>Liz Watson has run the shop for 16 years, but is selling up and looking for a new owner to keep the beloved dairy in tip top condition.</p>
        
            <p>Watson told RNZ Nights the giant ice creams were already a tradition when she took over the store.</p>
        
            <p>"So I decided I had to keep that going, because it keeps the people coming in."</p>

            <p>She said the dairy's main clients were the city's students, with many of them also working there during its 7am to 10pm opening hours.</p>
        
            <p>But Watson said after years of those long hours it was "time to give someone else a go".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a place for it in Dunedin, people recognise it. It's just an ideal time for someone to come in with a bit more energy, maybe.Â </p>
        
            <p>"And there are things they can do to enhance it and put their own stamp on it, but the basic idea works, and it's successful, so don't change it."</p>
