            <p>A judicial review has found demolition of a network of huts in Te Urewera was unlawful.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-nine huts were burned down in 2022 at the direction of T큰hoe's post settlement entity Te Uru Taumatua following a decision by Te Urewera Board to decommission Department of Conservation (DOC) infrastructure within Te Urewera.</p>
        
            <p>The move was supported by the director-general of DOC.</p>
        
            <p>Wharenui Tuna of T큰hoe (Te Whakatane hap큰) obtained an interim injunction to prevent the destruction of further huts in November 2022.</p>
        
            <p>A further 10 huts were burned down following the interim injunction. Te Uru Taumatua denied responsibility and police were investigating.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the High Court has found the DOC director-general, Te Uru Taumatua and Te Urewera Board acted contrary to Te Urewera Act in allowing the huts to be demolished.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, Te Uru Taumatua and the board acted failed to act so that:</p>
        
            <p>The court also found Te Uru Taumatua acted unlawfully by demolishing the huts without having in place an annual operational plan, and that Te Uru Taumatua and the director-general acted unlawfully by failing to prepare an annual operational plan for the past two years, as required by law.</p>
        
            <p>The decision also said the board and DOC acted unlawfully "by purporting to adopt a retrospective annual operational plan authorising the huts' demolition".</p>
        
            <p>The court described this as "a striking example of reviewable error" on behalf of the director-general.</p>
