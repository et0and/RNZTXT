            <p>A third arrest has been made in the homicide investigation into the disappearance of Jayden Mamfredos-Nair.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Callum McNeill, of Waitematā CIB, said today police arrested a 20-year-old man on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also charged this man with Jayden's murder," he said.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday police announced a body had been found at a Dairy Flat property after a search began on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"While we still have to carry out formal identification procedures, from all of our inquiries to date we believe this is Jayden," McNeill said.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, both aged 26, had been charged with the murder of Mamfredos-Nair.</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man is due to appear in the North Shore District Court on Monday at the same time as the two men arrested earlier on Saturday, McNeill said.</p>
        
            <p>He added police were not ruling out further arrests as part of the homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Mamfredos-Nair, then 19, was reported missing in April 2023. He was last seen on Birdwood Road in West Auckland's Rānui, the same month.</p>
        
            <p>McNeill called the recovery of the body "a devastating ordeal for Jayden's whānau, who are still coming to terms with the loss they have suffered".</p>
        
            <p>"We hope that this brings them some closure, in knowing that their boy can now be returned to them so he can be laid to rest."</p>
