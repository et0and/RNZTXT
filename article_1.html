            <p>Auckland bottle shops are concerned they could go out of business if forced to close their doors at 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>The council has proposed stricter alcohol sale times for supermarkets and liquor stores across the region.</p>
        
            <p>It would also implement a freeze on new liquor stores in the central city and 23 other "priority areas" mostly in south and west Auckland for the next two years.</p>
        
            <p>The changes are part of a new Local Alcohol Policy for the city.</p>
        
            <p>The policy has been in the works since 2008 after South Auckland liquor store owner, Navtej Singh, was shot while working, dying in hospital the next day.</p>
        
            <p>A Karangahape Road business owner strongly opposed to the rule change said: "I don't think it's a good idea. Many customers want a drink on the weekend. If we close early it's going to be so hard for us".</p>
        
            <p>They said construction workers and truck drivers who worked until late liked to buy a drink after work.</p>
        
            <p>Another liquor store owner in the central city said earlier closing times would put the future of the business at risk. They would lose around $4000 - $5000 per week in sales and their staff would leave, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bad decision. It's hard for a small business owner. We have to pay rent and pay our staff."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Councillor Josephine Bartley said the policy took important steps towards reducing alcohol harm. It was not about banning alcohol but creating a thriving community.</p>
        
            <p>Many Auckland residents supported restricting late-night alcohol sales if it made the community safer. One said they saw a lot of violence working on Karangahape Road and wished they did not.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only two hours less than what it is now. It shouldn't bother people too much to get their drinks a couple of hours earlier."</p>
        
            <p>A West Auckland resident said reduced liquor store hours in their community had made a difference. "I think it's a good thing. It's sometimes annoying if I can't get a bottle of wine until the next day, but it's a good sacrifice to keep the community safe."</p>
        
            <p>Founder of youth organisation Kick Back Make Change, Aaron Hendry, hoped the policy would reduce alcohol related harm.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm all for it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is the longer those bottle stores are open the more harm there is for our community. Restricting it should keep our communities safer."</p>
        
            <p>But not everyone was pleased.</p>
        
            <p>One Aucklander said he wanted to be able to buy a bottle of wine and a few beers after dinner. "That's so out of touch. I can't believe that's happening."</p>
        
            <p>Another person said it was an infringement of their rights. An Aucklander who worked in alcohol sales said she could both sides of the debate.</p>
        
            <p>Bartley said the council will decide when to enforce the new rules on August 29. They could try to relitigate the policy but she expected it to be straightforward.</p>
