            <p>A man has been arrested following a police stand-off in the Auckland suburb of Waterview on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man arrived at a house on Tutuki Street where someone he knew lived, and began making "concerning comments".</p>
        
            <p>The person who lived in the house managed get out, a police spokesperson said, and armed police cordoned off the street while they tried to talk to the man.</p>
        
            <p>Two loud bangs were heard coming from the property, at about 4:40pm, a person at the scene said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers using a loudspeaker could be heard saying: "Come out now and show us your hands", while the Armed Offenders Squad are approaching the property behind shields from the street</p>
        
            <p>Police cordons were set up at the incident and included Hadfield Street and Fir Street from Great North Road, while the police Eagle Helicopter hovered above, and three ambulances were also at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>At 5.15pm, armed officers at the scene asked for residents who were standing on their driveways watching, to go back into their homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Police had information the man was potentially in possession of a firearm and as such the Armed Offenders Squad was deployed to the area," the police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after 5pm, police managed to enter the house and arrested a 43-year-old man.</p>

            <p>Charges against the man would be decided upon later, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the public's cooperation while this matter was resolved this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson asked members of the public to stay clear of the cordons. A small group of people unable to get home have gathered at the Fir Street cordon.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby Great North Road remained open for traffic.</p>
