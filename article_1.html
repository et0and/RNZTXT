            <p>Fiji police have seized over three tonnes of methamphetamine, with the country's acting top cop confirming it is "one of the biggest seizures ever" in the country.</p>
        
            <p>The drugs was stored in 797 medium-sized containers wrapped in brown tapes that were seized from a vacant house currently under construction in Namaka in Nadi, police said via a statement on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Local police have not put a street value on the haul but, based on the NZ drug trend survey, it could be priced in the hundreds of millions of dollars if it landed here.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the drugs seized are in police custody and investigation into the matter continues.</p>
        
            <p>No further details on the people involved have been released.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific has contacted the Fiji police for more information.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Police Commisioner Juki Fong Chew said via the press statement their "fight against drugs" continues in the form of "consistent raids" with "more drugs being seized".</p>
        
            <p>"This is one of the biggest seizures ever and this shows that we are on top of things," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The white powder seized was over three tonnes and it was stored in 797 medium size containers.</p>
        
            <p>"Our fight against drugs continue and we are out there trying to make our country free from drugs."</p>
        
            <p>He said engagements with the organisation's external partners continues as part of its fight against illicit drugs.</p>

            <p>Last year, the Fijian government made the admission it was losing the fight against the sale and consumption of illegal drugs in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Attorney-General Siromi Turaga was pleading with traditional leaders to work with police to address the drug problem, local media had reported.</p>
        
            <p>Turaga said the use of methamphetamine, which is known by the street name "ice", had become widespread and affecting people's lives.</p>
        
            <p>He warned the illegal substance has flooded the community "and even schoolchildren are selling" it.</p>
        
            <p>He said children needed to be protected, as concerns were being raised about children being used to peddle and distribute drugs.</p>
        
            <p>According to Drug Free World Fiji founder Kalesi Volatabu, one in three children on the streets were "highly likely" users of meth and other hard drugs.</p>
