        <h2>The $84k bike rack used an average of 3 times a week</h2>
        <p>
A survey shows only 2.7 bikes on average are secured to the rack but it's still "a no-brainer" asset for Wellington Audio

            <p>Wellington City Council has spent $84,000 on a bike rack that a survey shows is used by only 2.7 bikes a week on average.</p>
        
            <p>The two tiered covered rack is on Oriental Parade and has space for 24 bikes to park up but critics say it has barely been used.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Tim Brown, who is chairperson of the Environmental and Infrastructure committee, said the installation and cost were worth it.</p>
        
            <p>It was a very solid piece of equipment and there were similar ones dotted around the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Brown attributed its current low use to not many people taking their bikes down to the beach in the middle of winter.</p>
        
            <p>He said in another part of the central city he had walked past a similar bike park recently and it was "absolutely chocka".</p>
        
            <p>He also compared the cost of a bike park ($3500) to a car park which cost $130,000 in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an absolute no-brainer."</p>
        
            <p>As well, pedestrian safety was a priority. He stressed the importance of having bikes secured in a purpose-built durable structure so that pedestrians did not trip over them.</p>
        
            <p>During the summer the area around Oriental Parade was popular and residents would complain to the council if they had to negotiate their way around bikes lying on the footpaths or tied to fences or trees.</p>
        
            <p>"We want pedestrians to have unfettered use of the footpath."</p>
        
            <p>He added: "This is a logical thing for the council to have done... It's a very solid piece of equipment because it needs to be because it's going to be used by a lot of people over many years and it's in a spot right by the marine environment. It needs to be a good piece of gear".</p>
        
            <p>Cycling was becoming more popular in Wellington and the council was doing its part by providing bike racks.</p>
        
            <p>While some people might not be impressed with their low use at certain times of the year, Brown cited the spending of $100,000 for a pedestrian crossing for a primary school.</p>
        
            <p>That would probably be used by the children for only five hours a week but noone would begrudge the council spending the funds, Brown said.</p>
