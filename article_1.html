            <p>Rain is on the way for much of Aotearoa on Friday, with thunderstorms and hail possible in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the culprit was a low pressure system moving eastwards onto New Zealand during the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Cooling temperatures in the upper atmosphere would bring unsettled weather to central and northern parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>There was a moderate risk of thunderstorms for Waitomo, Taranaki, Horowhenua, Kāpiti Coast, western Tasman and Buller, with 10-15mm of rain per hour expected.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, another low pressure system is forecast to spread across Aotearoa New Zealand during Friday, bringing rain or showers to many areas.Thunderstorms with hail are possible over many central and northern parts of the country during Friday.Tolaga Bay, Tairāwhiti… pic.twitter.com/q0Re6SalKF</p>
        
            <p>MetService said in a tweet that it was possible those thunderstorms would bring hail.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the rest of the North Island had a low risk of thunderstorms on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Tolaga Bay in Tairāwhiti would see the best weather.</p>
        
            <p>Sunshine, northwest breezes and a high of 26C were expected there, MetService said.</p>
