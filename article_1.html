            <p>Maketū Pies has gone into voluntary liquidation after five years of losses.</p>
        
            <p>Its owner, Te Arawa Management Ltd, bought the national pie supplier in 2019 during a receivership process but says it has operated at a loss since.</p>
        
            <p>It was, at the time, the town's largest employer and had operated for about 40 years. It had about 40 staff, mostly locals.</p>
        
            <p>Interim chief executive Tina Kilmister-Blue said the "difficult decision" was made after a "great deal of discussion and deliberation".</p>
        
            <p>Maketū Foods Ltd, trading as Maketū Pies, went into a solvent liquidation process on Thursday, which meant it would remain operating for now.</p>
        
            <p>Kilmister-Blue said that in a challenging and competitive fast-moving consumer goods sector, the business had operated with losses since it bought it in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"[Te Arawa Management Ltd] has continued to support the business over the past five years, but can no longer continue to contribute further investment to keep operating.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision has not been made lightly, and a number of alternative operating options have been explored, however, these are not viable."</p>
        
            <p>Community leaders were told of the liquidation on Thursday in a letter from Kilmister-Blue which was provided to Local Democracy Reporting.</p>
        
            <p>It outlined the sector challenges which included increasing costs and smaller margins and how it could "no longer continue to contribute further investment to keep operating".</p>
        
            <p>Some "serious" options were investigated but none were viable as they required significant investment.</p>
        
            <p>A solvent liquidation process would "ensure all creditors and our people are paid".</p>
        
            <p>While the business winds down, BDO liquidators will manage the process.</p>
        
            <p>She ended the letter with: "We appreciate all our people over the lifetime of Maketū Pies have contributed towards a Kiwi icon that will be remembered for years to come".</p>
        
            <p>Te Arawa Management Ltd is a subsidiary of Te Arawa Lakes Trust.</p>
        
            <p>A notice in the Bay of Plenty Times of the liquidators' appointment noted January 13 as the last date for creditors to make claims and establish any priority.</p>
        
            <p>Local man Shane Beech, known to some as the Mayor of Maketū, told Local Democracy Reporting the brand was iconic.</p>
        
            <p>Closure and job losses would impact the small town. He did not know how many people worked there but understood it was still Maketū's largest employer.</p>
        
            <p>"Not good times."</p>
        
            <p>Western Bay of Plenty Maketū-Te Puke ward councillor Grant Dally said a closure would be "quite devastating".</p>
        
            <p>"It's an integral part of the community."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped, however, that another business would see potential in how the building "in the heart of Maketū" offered a good facility for food processing or something else.</p>
        
            <p>Western Bay of Plenty mayor James Denyer said his thoughts were with the workers and their families.</p>
