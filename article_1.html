            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has warned of the possibility fires raging towards Gallipoli may reach the graves of Australian soldiers at Anzac Cove.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts today are also with our friends in Türkiye. We understand there are efforts underway to control fires that are burning on the Gallipoli Peninsula," Albanese said in a press conference on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Gallipoli is, of course, sacred ground to both of our countries.</p>
        
            <p>"Some 60,000 Australians served at Gallipoli during the eight-month campaign, and 8700 Australians lost their lives," he said, referring to the Gallipoli campaign of World War I.</p>
        
            <p>"Eighteen thousand were wounded during the campaign. And there were more than 7200 Australians buried in cemeteries or listed as missing there.</p>
        
            <p>"So our thoughts today are with those who continue to care for those cemeteries, and welcome thousands of Australians who visit ANZAC headstones each year, as they endure these difficult times."</p>
        
            <p>About one in six New Zealanders who landed on the peninsula - 2779 people - also died.</p>
        
            <p>Albanese's statement comes after an update from the general manager for Türkiye's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Bekir Karacabey, who said firefighters were managing the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"We are intervening non-stop from land and air with the guardians of #GreenHomeland to bring the forest fire in Eceabat, Çanakkale under control," Karacabey wrote in a Facebook post, referencing the area where Anzac Cove is located.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's be careful to prevent other fires in these days when the risk of fire increases due to extraordinary weather conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Fires have also sparked in other regions of Türkiye, with Karacabey reporting a "superhuman effort" to bring a blaze in Göynük - over 400 kilometres from Gallipoli - under control.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry İbrahim Yumaklı said 1,413 firefighters - supported by 14 planes, 31 helicopters and 265 land vehicles - had been dispatched to control another fire in Manisa, 300 kilometres from the Gallipoli site.</p>
