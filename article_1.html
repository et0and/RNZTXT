            <p>Green Party Candidate Geordie Rogers has won Wellington's by-election for the Pukehīnau / Lambton General Ward.</p>
        
            <p>The seat was vacated at the Wellington City Council table by Tamatha Paul after she won the Wellington Central seat in the general election last year.</p>
        
            <p>He beat independent candidate Karl Tiefenbacher, a local businessman who founded popular ice cream brand Kaffee Eis.</p>
        
            <p>The initial progress result of the election, issued on Saturday afternoon, showed Tiefenbacher ahead of Rogers by 621 votes.</p>
        
            <p>However, a count of final-day votes on Saturday evening reduced his winning margin to 164 with special votes still to be validated and counted.</p>
        
            <p>With all votes now counted, Rogers is declared the winner.</p>
