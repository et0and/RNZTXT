            <p>The warm weather is set to continue for much of the country this weekend, and a heat alert has been issued to warn Aucklanders to take measures to cool down in extreme summer temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>MetService issued a heat alert on Friday for Auckland, warning people to take measures to protect their health in hot temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>The national forecaster is running a trial of heat alerts this summer. Heat alerts are generated when an area becomes much hotter than is usual for that area.</p>
        
            <p>As well as being draining for every day life, it said extreme summer heat could cause illness or even be fatal.</p>
        
            <p>"But effective planning and actions can readily reduce its effects on health."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was expected to be uncomfortably hot and muggy on Friday, with an expected high of 27 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said people should keep hydrated, seek shade, and check in with vulnerable people, pets, and livestock.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is vulnerable to extreme heat. However, babies and infants, older people, those with pre-existing medical conditions or on certain medications are more at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the country will continue to get great beach weather through the weekend, though grey skies will close in from the south into Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is forecasting a warm and cloudy weekend for most areas, after a scorcher on Thursday, with temperatures reaching into the low 30 degrees Celsius range for some, including Hastings, which models show could reach 33 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>Warm air hangs around☕ Muggy for the North Island☀ Lots of intense sunshine - make sure to stay sun smart! Wānaka and Twizel are looking to crack 30°C. Coastal Canterbury and Otago reached the 30s yesterday, but easterlies will make for a warm day instead of a hot one pic.twitter.com/nyZ9HrrfEr</p>
        
            <p>By Sunday, rain clouds are expected to head up from the south, with heavy downpours expected for Otago, Southland, and inland Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>And "fresh southwesterly change" could come early on Monday, significantly reducing temperatures for many places.</p>
        
            <p>The rain would be relief for firefighters, with warm weather having dried out vegetation and prompted a number of fire bans and restrictions nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Total fire bans are in place for parts of Northland, Hauraki, Wairarapa, Marlborough, inland Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Fire restrictions are in place for Wellington, Coromandel Peninsula and much of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Open windows in the evening and overnight, once temperatures have cooled</p>
        
            <p>Turn off non-essential lights and electrical equipment - they generate heat.</p>
        
            <p>Home insulation will help keep your home cooler in summer</p>
        
            <p>Move into a cooler room if possible, especially for sleeping</p>
        
            <p>Keep light-coloured curtains or blinds closed on windows facing the sun during the day.</p>
        
            <p>Dark coloured curtains or blinds are best left open as they absorb the heat</p>
        
            <p>Use electric fans to keep cool</p>
        
            <p>Use the cool cycle on a heat pump. Clean heat pumps - vacuum the filters regularly.</p>
