            <p>A cruise ship which ran aground on rocks in Fiordland's Doubtful Sound last week will restart trips on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The RealNZ-operated Fiordland Navigator ran aground near Crooked Arm in Doubtful Sound last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>All 67 passengers and crew on board were evacuated, with one person sustaining minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The boat's hull was breached and it took on water, but it was refloated later that night and returned to its berth at Deep Cove.</p>
        
            <p>Real NZ chief conservation officer Paul Norris said final repairs had been made to the vessel, and it was cleared to return to service on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"All regulatory authorities have been supportive of our approach to bring the Navigator back to service and kept up-to-date with progress. We are excited to welcome back our first guests on the Fiordland Navigator's overnight experience in Doubtful Sound this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>Norris said there were external and internal investigations underway into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Accident Investigation Commission said it was investigating, talking to witnesses and collecting evidence from the site.</p>

            <p>Chief investigator Naveen Kozhuppakalam said the ship was also investigated back in 2006. However, he said it was too early to draw any possible links to the latest incident.</p>
        
            <p>Kozhuppakalam said groundings were considered serious because they could damage the hull and create a loss of structural integrity, which could potentially result in the vessel sinking or capsizing.</p>
        
            <p>"The commission's investigation should draw into any particular lines of inquiry that [the grounding] has been a systemic issue that we might identify, but at this stage it's too early to comment on any of that.</p>
        
            <p>"What we do know though is that the evacuation was quite successful. Once the vessel grounded, the crew responded well and the passengers were safely evacuated, so there was a good outcome."</p>
        
            <p>It could be up to two years before the marine safety inquiry was completed.</p>
