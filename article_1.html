            <p>Commuters heading from Auckland to Northland via State Highway One are in for a slow drive.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic was heavy before and through Warkworth, then again from Wayby through Wellsford up to Te Hana.</p>
        
            <p>For holidaymakers going south, Auckland's Southern Motorway southbound was heavy from Manukau to Drury.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, there have been multiple crashes throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>Remutaka Hill has reopened in both directions after a three-vehicle crash that left one car on fire. Three people received minor to moderate injuries.</p>

            <p>A crash on Haywards Hill Road in Wellington has also closed the road to eastbound traffic.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency said the crash was after the intersection with Mt Cecil Rd.</p>
        
            <p>The northbound lane of SH1 south of Sanson was closed after a campervan crashed near Rongotea just after midday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said no one has been injured.</p>
        
            <p>SH1 near Rowe Road was closed to northbound traffic and while southbound lanes remain open, the Transport Agency said drivers should expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>There were also reports on social media that traffic was crawling northbound between ÅŒtaki and Levin.</p>
