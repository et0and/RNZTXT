        <h2>Luxon says 'simplistic' Treaty Principles Bill 'not helping'</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister has given a scathing appraisal of the bill on the day of its first reading.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has given a scathing appraisal of the Treaty Principles Bill on the day of its first reading, saying the legislation has been unhelpful to his mission of getting the country back on track.</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, he said the National caucus would support the bill - championed by ACT's David Seymour - on Thursday afternoon, but no further, fulfilling National's coalition agreement with ACT.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will miss the parliamentary debate - enroute to Peru for the APEC summit instead - but he called a morning media conference where he criticised the legislation in perhaps his strongest words yet.</p>
        
            <p>"You do not go negate, with a single stroke of a pen, 184 years of debate and discussion, with a bill that I think is very simplistic."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has previously criticised National's position, accusing its coalition partner of being afraid to engage with difficult issues.</p>
        
            <p>But Luxon bit back, saying the Treaty Principles Bill was not helping the government's focus on the real "hard stuff" like the cost-of-living and rising crime.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not helping us get New Zealand back on track," Luxon said.</p>

            <p>"Go out here and talk to New Zealanders getting through a week. It's a tough time. It's getting better. Our plan is starting to work, but that's the hard work that the National Party is engaged on."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said National's long-held position was that it was more sensible to grapple with difficult issues on a "case by case" basis: "We can have a conversation respectfully without actually having to go into demonising each other."</p>
        
            <p>He said the compromise position - where National supported the bill to select committee but no further - was a pragmatic approach given New Zealand's political system.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't get what I wanted, I've been very upfront about that. David Seymour and ACT didn't get what they wanted, which was a full national referendum."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, the Green Party requested the legislation be treated as a conscience issue, allowing individual MPs to vote as they please.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said that had not been a topic of discussion within National's caucus, but regardless, he would not have entertained the idea.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Midday Report, Seymour disagreed with Luxon's assessment that the bill was unhelpful to the government.</p>
        
            <p>"There wouldn't be a government without a coalition agreement to do this," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the record showed the bill had not stopped the government from cutting waste and regulation, as well as improving health and education.</p>
        
            <p>"It very clearly is not distracting the government from doing those things because we're doing it."</p>
        
            <p>Furthermore, the interpretation of Treaty principles were essential to how the government tackled many of the problems facing New Zealand, Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"The task is all the harder when you have an assumption that people have a different role in society based on ancestry."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he was feeling "fantastic" ahead of the first reading: "It's finally arrived that New Zealanders will have a proper discussion about what our founding document means."</p>
