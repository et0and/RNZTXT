            <p>A group of young people have sent a list of demands to Minister of Climate Change Simon Watts ahead of the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The Youth Climate Statement, created at New Zealand's first COP Simulation event on 28 September, was sent to Watts and the New Zealand delegation heading to Azerbaijan for COP29, which runs from 11 to 22 November.</p>
        
            <p>Delara, 16, said rangatahi were disproportionately impacted by climate change, yet their voices were among the most overlooked. Climate change not only destroyed things, but also erased identity and culture, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we're talking about climate change, it's very important of course to talk about how people's lives are being impacted in terms of property, but it's so important to talk about culture as well."</p>
        
            <p>Sylvie, also 16, said there was a strong focus on ensuring people were at the heart of the discussion at the COP Simulation in September.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that it's really important for Aotearoa to make sure that, as an island nation, we are always finding ways to improve our responses in mitigating and adapting to climate change to help our future generation."</p>

            <p>Save the Children New Zealand advocacy, strategy and research director Jacqui Southey said children and young people were demanding a safer, healthier and more sustainable world, and the opportunity to be included in climate protection and decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>"Children and youth bring personal experiences, new ideas and deep commitment to improve our world. It is well past time they were accorded the opportunity to do so," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Youth Climate Statement would form part of the global statement for Save the Children to be presented at COP29.</p>
        
            <p>"Children's experiences, insights and advice matter and we need to ensure a focus on children's rights in climate negotiations, policies and financing at all levels.</p>
        
            <p>"It was children who pushed the climate emergency up the political agenda and, as adults, we must step up and support children to implement their ideas for a better future."</p>

            <p>The Youth Climate Statement focused on three key areas: water, sanitation and hygiene; loss and damage; and sustainable food systems.</p>
        
            <p>The first demand was for a holistic approach that integrated global cooperation, sustainable funding mechanisms, indigenous knowledge, and local capacity building.</p>
        
            <p>"By addressing the challenges in water, sanitation, and hygiene through equitable solutions and focusing on resilience, these recommendations contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals and fostering healthier, more sustainable communities worldwide."</p>
        
            <p>The second was to build resilience and address loss and damage, particularly for Global South nations.</p>
        
            <p>"By establishing financial mechanisms, integrating Indigenous knowledge, and investing in renewable energy, these recommendations provide a pathway towards equitable recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"Global cooperation, education, and support will ensure that communities can adapt to the ongoing and future impacts of climate change, contributing to the achievement of the sustainable development goals."</p>
        
            <p>And the third was to build sustainable, equitable food systems that integrated indigenous knowledge, promoted food security and reduced environmental impact.</p>
        
            <p>"By focusing on land regeneration, incentivising sustainable agriculture, and ensuring access to nutritious food, these recommendations aim to create resilient communities that can adapt to the ongoing challenges posed by climate change."</p>

            <p>The Youth Climate Statement was also sent to the Ministry for the Environment, Labour climate change spokesperson Megan Woods, ACT climate change spokesperson Simon Court, Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March and Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke.</p>
        
            <p>Menéndez March said it served as "a reminder that everything is connected and that it will take all of us and taking a system lens approach to addressing the climate crisis".</p>
        
            <p>"It just reminds me of the importance of fighting to honour our Tiriti, and that none of the stuff outlined will be able to be done if our foundational document isn't actually respected," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just so important to put all these knowledges into a domestic context and recognise that we've got a fight ahead - not just globally, but here in Aotearoa too."</p>

            <p>Watts told RNZ younger generations would be among those most affected by climate change, and it was important for the government to hear their "vital perspectives".</p>
        
            <p>"The Aotearoa Youth Statement raises important climate change issues particularly around the need for cooperation, disaster response, education and global equity."</p>
        
            <p>While Watts did not mention COP29, he said the government was committed to its climate obligations and understood the importance of New Zealand playing its part to reduce emissions and keep temperature rise in check.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government's climate strategy, released in July, focused on making sure:</p>
        
            <p>The final emissions reduction plan was under active consideration, and decisions would be made by the end of the year, Watts said.</p>
