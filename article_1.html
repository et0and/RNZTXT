            <p>Veteran New Zealand photographer Peter Bush has died at the age of 93.</p>
        
            <p>On an Instagram page, his family shared he had died on Saturday morning in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"My father was a powerful life force. A man teeming with energy, adventure and laughter.</p>
        
            <p>"A self-made professional with a relentless passion for capturing the perfect moment.</p>
        
            <p>"A lover of the outdoors, a hater of bureaucracy, an epic storyteller and a friend and mentor to so many. Kua haere ia t≈çna moenga roa. (He has gone to his eternal rest)."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's best-known sports photographer, he accompanied many All Black teams on overseas tours, and his photographs formed a history of the game in his time.</p>
        
            <p>Known affectionately as Bushy, he was also respected for his coverage of royal tours and the 1968 Wahine ferry disaster.</p>
        
            <p>In 2000, the New Zealand Rugby Union acknowledged his contribution to the game by presenting him with a special award that guaranteed him access to the sidelines of any test match in the country.</p>
