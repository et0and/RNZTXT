            <p>Fire and Emergency says it could not raise an ambulance directly on the morning of a fatal house fire in Auckland because its communication system was down.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwa Ropitini-Fairburn and Tony Marsters, both aged in their mid 20s, died in the blaze, while a third man was seriously injured, on Freshney Place in Hillpark, shortly before 7am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters arrived at the two-storey home within minutes, but could not get in touch with ambulance staff through their usual InterCAD system.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands this meant firefighters were unable to advise ambulance staff of any injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said the outage meant a phone call had to be made to ambulance operations instead.</p>
        
            <p>"While ambulance staff were on their way to the incident, firefighters were able to rescue two people from the house and administer CPR."</p>

            <p>An ambulance and rapid response vehicle arrived shortly after, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesperson declined to comment and said queries were best to be directed to Fire and Emergency.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of Monday's fire is still under investigation by police and fire investigators.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said an examination of the house was still underway on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The man who was injured remains in a serious condition at Middlemore Hospital, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The InterCAD system is used as a way for emergency services, including ambulance, police and the fire service to communicate.</p>
        
            <p>It allows information given by 111 callers to be shared immediately between the three services.</p>
        
            <p>An event is created by the service who were called and dispatch information is sent to all three services at the same time.</p>
