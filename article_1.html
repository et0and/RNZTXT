            <p>Hundreds of gang members who were in Foxton today for a funeral are now leaving to head home.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 was briefly blocked during the tangi for Head Hunters gang leader William "Bird" Hines which began at 11am this morning.</p>
        
            <p>But police said there had been no significant issues reported during the large gathering of mourners at Motuiti Marae today.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Assistant Commissioner Mike Johnson said police continued to monitor the gang members' movements through the North Island roading network as they left Foxton.</p>
        
            <p>"We are co-ordinating the road policing operation across multiple police districts to ensure safe behaviour and, when and where necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked the public for their patience while traffic management measures were in place, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said one person was arrested for a driving-related matter immediately after the tangi.</p>
        
            <p>Horowhenua mayor Bernie Wanden said the funeral was one of the biggest the small town had seen.</p>
        
            <p>"The challenge was more around getting them in and out of the marae onto State Highway 1 this afternoon, but everything seems to have gone relatively smoothly and without too much incident, and those people are now returning to their homes," Wanden said.</p>
        
            <p>While there had been some minor traffic issues, there had been no major problems, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure the work that police have done in being proactive has helped, but also the way that the community have reacted obviously well too, they've gone about their business in a normal manner, but also the way the tangi itself has gone fairly smoothly and without incident."</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management near the Motuiti Marae on State Highway 1 was now being lifted, but police would remain in the area for the next day or so, he said.</p>

            <p>Earlier, police kept the crowd contained. Both patched gang members and members of the public were evident at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter in Foxton said the main highway was briefly blocked as Hines' coffin was transported along the road.</p>
        
            <p>He described the procession as orderly, but significant in size.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, smoke from a bike burnout could be seen billowing through the crowds and many appeared to be filming the procession as it went past.</p>
