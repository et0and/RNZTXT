            <p>The mayor of Invercargill is describing a code of conduct investigation he is facing as a "distraction he doesn't need".</p>
        
            <p>Nobby Clark has come under fire following an interview he gave comedian Guy Williams on the satirical news show New Zealand Today last month.</p>
        
            <p>During the interview - described as "a train wreck" by one of his elected members - Clark defended previous instances where he has used the n-word, again repeating the slur.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill city councillor Ria Bond confirmed she was one of two representatives who had laid a complaint against the mayor in relation to the interview.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would not be commenting further as she did not want to muddy the process moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>Clark also confirmed two of his councillors had laid a complaint and that an independent agency from Dunedin would be investigating.</p>
        
            <p>He would not be drawn on whether he felt he had the support of his council.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just part of democracy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're doing some good things in our community but this is a distraction I don't need."</p>
        
            <p>Clark first caused controversy last year when he used the word at an Art Foundation event, supposedly to make a point around "tolerance" and "freedom of expression" within the art world.</p>
        
            <p>He doubled-down on the matter during his appearance on the 21 March episode of New Zealand Today, much to the ire of Williams.</p>
        
            <p>"If you had some rap music that come in, where every second word was n***, would that be okay? Certainly not to me," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"Would you allow me to stop that."</p>
        
            <p>Clark claimed to hate the term but again used the slur when citing the name of an Invercargill street gang.</p>
        
            <p>"It's offensive to people."</p>
        
            <p>He also asked Williams if he was homosexual.</p>
        
            <p>"You (Williams) tend to be leaning towards minority groups," Clark proposed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not leaning towards," Williams replied.</p>
        
            <p>"Well all right bent over towards them," Clark quipped.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has requested a copy of the Code of Conduct complaint from the Invercargill City Council.</p>
