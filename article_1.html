        <h2>One hundred tourist sites closed this summer due to Cyclone Gabrielle damage</h2>
        <p>
DOC staff are still cleaning up after more than 550 sites across the North Island were damaged in February, with spots like Cathedral Cove remaining shut over summer.

            <p>The Department of Conservation says about 100 tourist sites are still closed due to damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle, but this just presents an opportunity for people to explore less popular areas.</p>
        
            <p>Director of Heritage and Visitors, Catherine Wilson, said staff are still cleaning up after more than 550 sites across the North Island were damaged in February.</p>
        
            <p>"The cyclone had a really big impact on our infrastructure across the North Island."</p>
        
            <p>Popular spots including Coromandel's Cathedral Cove and the Te Henga Walkway outside Auckland, will remain shut over summer.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said it is an opportunity for Kiwis to visit places they have never been to before, or see old favourites from a new perspective, such as viewing Coromandel's Cathedral Cove from a boat tour.</p>
        
            <p>"With a bit of creativity, they can enjoy plenty of other areas in new and different ways, and still have a really amazing Kiwi holiday experience,"</p>
        
            <p>"We're really lucky in New Zealand to have so much nature to explore so there are plenty of options out there."</p>
