            <p>Tauranga's first Māori ward councillor Mikaere Sydney is resigning after never being able to take up the job because of illness.</p>
        
            <p>A by-election will now be held to fill the vacant seat.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney developed a rare form of encephalitis after contracting a virus in July 2024. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain.</p>
        
            <p>He was elected to Tauranga City Council on July 20 but was unable to take up his position and was approved for unpaid medical leave until December 31.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney's resignation was announced by his uncle Hemi Rolleston on Facebook on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the considered opinion of Mikaere and his whānau that we withdraw his name from the Te Awanui Māori Ward seat currently.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority as whānau has and always will be Mikaere's health, his future recovery and prospects.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be time for Mikaere, he is young and strong. Just not this time."</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council confirmed it received Sydney's resignation with immediate effect.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Mahé Drysdale said he was saddened to learn Sydney would not be joining the governance team.</p>
        
            <p>"My fellow councillors and I were very much looking forward to working with Mikaere when he was well enough but completely appreciate and respect the decision that he and his whānau have made at this time," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Mikaere is young and talented and has a bright future ahead of him. I'm confident that we will see him play an important role in the Tauranga community in years to come, but for now, his health remains the priority and we offer best wishes for a fast and full recovery."</p>

            <p>Tauranga electoral officer Warwick Lampp said Sydney's resignation triggered a by-election in the Te Awanui Ward.</p>
        
            <p>That process would take three to four months and would cost around $55,000, Lampp said.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said: "We want to see the Te Awanui Ward represented as soon as possible and the council will act quickly, within the statutory timeframes, to have arrangements for the by-election put in place."</p>
        
            <p>He expected a new Māori ward councillor would be sworn into the role by early May.</p>
        
            <p>Rolleston said the family remained "forever grateful" to everyone who had supported Sydney and his whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"We have spoken with representatives of the many communities who supported Mikaere in his bid for the Te Awanui Māori Ward along with iwi, hapū, marae and our wider whānau to clarify the situation going forward for Mikaere.</p>
        
            <p>"Advice was also sought from Mikaere's doctors as to his future health diagnoses, which we are pleased to report are positive and ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that over time Mikaere will come back healthier, stronger and more determined."</p>
        
            <p>The community rallied around Syndey during his illness and raised $39,000 by scaling Mauao in a "Mauaoathon" held in December.</p>
        
            <p>The fundraiser was organised by Rolleston who said he wanted to support his nephew while he was unable to earn an income.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney grew up on Rangiwaea Island, an island at the eastern end of Matakana Island in Tauranga Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>He said in his election profile he was an active member of the community, including as a netball coach, Tauranga Netball director, kapa haka judge and "young leader in our moana".</p>
        
            <p>Sydney was the clear winner in the Te Awanui ward with 1515 votes, double runner-up Suaree Borell's 754 votes.</p>
        
            <p>This could be the city's only electoral term with a Māori ward, which will remain in place until the 2028 elections.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga's July 2024 election to replace the government-appointed commission was out of sync with the rest of New Zealand's councils, which will go to the polls in October.</p>
        
            <p>After a change in Government policy, Tauranga City Council will need to decide on the future of the Māori ward by November 30, 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Other councils have been required to do this before the October elections.</p>
        
            <p>If Tauranga City Council voted to keep the Māori ward, a referendum on the matter must take place by March 28, 2027.</p>
        
            <p>If a decision was made to disestablish the ward a referendum will not be held.</p>
        
            <p>Results of any referendum would inform the council's representation review in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>The review looks at the structure of wards and number of councillors to best represent the community.</p>
        
            <p>Councils must conduct a representation review every six years.</p>
