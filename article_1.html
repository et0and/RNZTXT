            <p>A powerful Israeli airstrike has targeted central Beirut, security sources say, shaking the Lebanese capital as Israel pressed its offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.</p>
        
            <p>At least four people were killed and 23 wounded in the attack on Saturday in Beirut's Basta neighbourhood, Hezbollah's al-Manar broadcaster reported, citing the health ministry.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's National News Agency said the attack resulted in a large number of fatalities and injuries and destroyed an eight-storey building. Footage broadcast by Lebanon's Al Jadeed station showed at least one destroyed building and several others badly damaged around it.</p>
        
            <p>The blasts shook the capital around 5am (4pm NZ time), Reuters witnesses said. Security sources said at least four bombs were dropped in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>It marked the fourth Israeli airstrike this week targeting a central area of Beirut, where the bulk of Israel's attacks have targeted the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. On Sunday an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah media official in the Ras al-Nabaa district of central Beirut.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has killed several leaders of its long-time foe Hezbollah in air strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>Israel launched a major offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon in September, following nearly a year of cross-border hostilities ignited by the Gaza war, pounding wide areas of Lebanon with airstrikes and sending troops into the south.</p>
        
            <p>The conflict began when Hezbollah opened fire in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas after it launched the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.</p>
        
            <p>A US mediator travelled to Lebanon and Israel this week in an effort to secure a ceasefire. The envoy, Amos Hochstein, indicated progress had been made after meetings in Beirut on Tuesday and Wednesday, before going to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz.</p>
