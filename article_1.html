            <p>A customer who tried to stop an attempted robbery at an Auckland bar on Saturday night is thought to be among those injured in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were hurt, one critically, when two men entered the Mt Albert Sports Bar on New North Road at 10.10pm and tried to rob it.</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Chris Allan said there was an altercaton, which resulted in the injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were taken to Auckland City Hospital, one in a critical condition and one in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>The manager of a nearby restaurant, Min Ji, said one of the staff members from the sports bar came into the restaurant with an injury to his neck.</p>
        
            <p>"He came into our store and said someone had come in to try to take their money," Ji said.</p>
        
            <p>"He said one customer had tried to stop (them), but he was hurt by the thief."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland police were still looking for the two offenders on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Ji said it was not the first time shops in the area had been targeted.</p>
        
            <p>"Our glass has been broken once and next door (was also) broken into. Last time they stole some money but this time they've hurt people, so I don't think it's safe."</p>
        
            <p>Police carried out a scene examination at the Mt Albert Sports Bar on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Allan said anyone with information who had not yet spoken to police should get in touch by calling 105 and quoting file number 240623/8649.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be shared anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
