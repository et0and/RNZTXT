            <p>French executives will be flying to New Zealand to discuss the timing and budget of the City Rail project after concerns from officials about its deadline.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald has reported documents from the Auckland Council Audit and Risk Committee report show a 50 percent chance the project will meet its November 2025 deadline.</p>
        
            <p>Originally the City Rail Link (CRL) was expected to cost $2-3 billion, but had since ballooned to $5.5b.</p>
        
            <p>The link was due to open in 2026, but earlier this week Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown said he had lost confidence it would be finished on time.</p>
        
            <p>He shared his concerns with Transport Minister Simeon Brown in a joint statement about the implementation of the project.</p>

            <p>"We know how important the CRL project will be for Aucklanders to get to where they want to go quickly and safely. We share the concerns raised about the delivery of this project and we have been clear in our expectations about the need to hold the Alliance to account for delivery.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain committed to holding all parties accountable for delivery of this important project and ensuring it is delivered on budget and on time," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their worries, CRL had advised the pair it remained confident it could deliver the project within the funding available and on time in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, CRL chief executive Patrick Brockie said risks such as the ones highlighted in the documents were common on construction contracts.</p>
        
            <p>"As Aucklanders can see with the stations coming to life in front of them. We continue to work with Link Alliance and other contractors to deliver the project within the approved funding envelope and look forward to first passengers riding on the train in 2026," Brockie said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council Infrastructure and Resilience Director, Barry Potter said there had been no suggestion that the project and overall timeframe had been jeopardised.</p>
        
            <p>"It is also important to note that discussing risks in detail is normal for large complex projects, this is both anticipated and planned for. It is also essential when you are spending public money and delivering large-scale infrastructure for Aucklanders to benefit from for generations to come," Potter said.</p>
