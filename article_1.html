        <h2>Kiwi Ukrainian watches Trump, Zelensky shouting match in horror</h2>
        <p>
Olga Dubnytska believes the US President and Vice-President took advantage of the language barrier by "rudely interrupting" and "humiliating" Ukraine's President.

            <p>A Ukrainian living in New Zealand was shocked as she watched the disastrous Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky unfold.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting, which took place at the White House on Saturday, quickly became fractious as the US President and Vice-President JD Vance berated Ukraine's President for his lack of deference.</p>
        
            <p>Following the heated discussion in front of the world's media, Zelenksy cut short his visit, leaving ahead of a scheduled joint press conference and without signing a minerals agreement with the US.</p>
        
            <p>Olga Dubnytska was born in Ukraine and now works as a Palmerston North GP.</p>
        
            <p>She said she "felt for" Zelensky during the fraught meeting, especially as he was working in his second language.</p>
        
            <p>She thought Trump and Vance had "taken advantage" of the language barrier by "rudely interrupting" and "humiliating" Zelensky.</p>
        
            <p>Dubnytska was also frustrated at some of the figures Trump used when discussing US support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"He either exaggerated or just made it up - that's just how Trump goes... just because he's the president."</p>
        
            <p>Dubnytska was pleased to see the many statements from global leaders supporting Zelensky in the aftermath of the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Ending the war would benefit the world, not just the Ukraine, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Putin's not going to stop just invading Ukraine and taking over, destroying everything in his way. It will never stop with one border once he has occupied any Ukrainian land - he will move further into Europe."</p>
        
            <p>She had yet to hear what her family back in Ukraine thought of the Oval Office exchange.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure they're all devastated, but they're all supporting our president. He's one of us ... and he's doing his best."</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian community here continued to pray for peace, and provide financial and emotional support for their families back home in whatever ways they could, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Being far away in New Zealand we're just observers, trying to do as much as we can."</p>
        
            <p>While she tried to remain positive, she felt like she was losing hope as the US aligned itself with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>Ukraine was a small country facing off against two of the world's most powerful countries, she said, it felt as if it was "set up for failure in advance."</p>
        
            <p>But she said Ukrainians would "die before they capitulate," despite the terrible toll the war was taking.</p>

            <p>An entire generation was being wiped out, leaving only older people and little children, Dubnytska said.</p>
        
            <p>Many of those dying on the front lines "are kids - they're 17, 18, 19 years old".</p>
        
            <p>"What are people dying for? Because somebody like Trump and Putin decided to prove they are powerful people?</p>
        
            <p>"Not even thinking about how many people are dying from the Ukrainian and Russian sides. It just doesn't make any sense."</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon reiterated New Zealand's support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was aware of the "robust exchange", but New Zealand "remained steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself in a war that Russia started".</p>
        
            <p>"[The Ukraine is] mounting the defence of a proud, democratic, sovereign nation, but also the defence of international law," the prime minister said.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition leader Chris Hipkins said the meeting showed how volatile global politics were at present, and he felt for Zelensky.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's actually a very patient man, he's a very resolved man, and I have huge sympathy for the situation that he finds himself in.</p>
        
            <p>"I think he's led Ukraine with exceptional leadership over the last couple of years and I think the world community should continue to support Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said he didn't believe Zelensky was being disrespectful.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand should remain committed to an international system of rules and Russia's invasion violated those rules, Hipkins told reporters at Te Matatini.</p>
