            <p>An Air New Zealand flight has landed safely at Sydney Airport following reports of a bomb threat on board.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were not permitted to disembark the plane for at least a hour and a half, but have now been released.</p>
        
            <p>9 News said flight NZ247 arrived from Wellington about 5.40pm local time (7.40pm NZT), with a tactical operations unit, paramedics and firefighters all called to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The plane had 154 staff and passengers on board, the channel reported.</p>

            <p>A passenger on board the plane told RNZ they were "stuck" on the tarmac for an hour and a half.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] have been told there was a bomb scare. [They're] not letting us disembark just yet," she said about 9pm NZT.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of police and emergency vehicles on standby."</p>
        
            <p>Journalist Brian Wilson said the plane stopped on a utility taxiway, away from the airport terminals, and remained there for more than an hour.</p>
        
            <p>It then taxied to the international terminal, where it was met by Federal Police.</p>

            <p>Passengers were allowed to disembark by 10pm and emergency services were being stood down.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand was aware of "a security incident" on board the flight, the airline's chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Standard security protocols were followed. Emergency services assessed the aircraft after it landed and passengers were able to disembark.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to this incident NZ248, the return flight to Wellington was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>"Air New Zealand apologises for the inconvenience caused to customers on both services. The safety and security of all passengers and our crew is our utmost priority."</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 emergency services vehicles were at the scene when the plane landed, including bomb squad cars and armed police, 7News said.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared planes at the airport briefly entered a holding pattern while the aircraft landed, the outlet said.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes just one day after King Charles III and Queen Camilla touched down at Sydney Airport for a tour of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>An Australian Federal Police spokesperson said the force had "responded to an incident on board an aircraft that was en route to the airport".</p>
        
            <p>Investigations were ongoing, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no threat to the community."</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Police said the federal police was the lead agency for the incident, but "considerable NSW Police resources" responded to the airport.</p>
        
            <p>"Most have now been stood down," a spokesperson said about 10pm NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney Airport has been contacted for comment.</p>
