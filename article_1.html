            <p>New Zealanders are feeling worse about their quality of life, according to a new survey.</p>
        
            <p>New survey data released by the Quality of Life Project found 77 percent of people felt positively about their quality of life, down from 83 percent in 2022 and 87 percent in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The survey is a collaboration between the Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hutt City, Porirua, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin city councils, as well as the Waikato Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>Though fewer people were happy about their quality of life overall, more felt like it had improved compared to previous years. Of the respondents, 25 percent felt like their quality of life had improved in the previous 12 months, compared to just 18 percent in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The most popular reasons for this included health and financial well-being.</p>
        
            <p>"I have savings, a partner, less debt and feeling a lot better mentally," one respondent had written.</p>
        
            <p>"I have gained financial independence & security by purchasing a house and getting a new job with better pay," wrote another.</p>
        
            <p>Respondents were also less concerned about climate change than in previous years, 32 percent in 2024 compared to 42 percent in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Those worries were replaced with cost of living and housing concerns, with just 32 percent feeling their housing costs were affordable and 35 percent feeling they had enough money to cover their everyday needs.</p>
        
            <p>"Transport costs have increased, food prices have increased faster than my pay rate, government is doing everything it can to help the rich at the expense of the poor," one respondent wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and Porirua reported the lowest satisfaction throughout the eight regions covered in the survey, with only 75 percent of respondents feeling positively about their quality of life.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedinites were most satisfied at 83 percent positive, two points higher than their closest competitor Wellington at 81 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The survey takes place every two years, with the next set to take place in 2026.</p>
