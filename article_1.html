            <p>The Jehovah's Witness Church is challenging a decision to extend the scope of the Abuse in Care inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is taking place in the Court of Appeal in Wellington on Thursday in front of a packed public gallery that includes abuse survivors and current members of the church.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the High Court decision in October to dismiss the Jehovah's Witnesses legal bid to get out of being included in the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The church maintains it should be exempt because it did not run institutions that cared for children or vulnerable people.</p>
        
            <p>In her judgment at the time Justice Ellis argued the church could not avoid scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>The Jehovah's Witnesses has appealed that decision saying it contained errors of law that needed to be challenged.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, a lawyer for the church, Sarah Jerebine said the faith was not avoiding being investigated.</p>
        
            <p>She said instead it was challenging the Royal Commission's decision to extend the scope of the inquiry beyond institutional care to a review of "trust-based relationships" between authority figures and children.</p>
        
            <p>Jerebine argued the extension was unlawful because it went beyond the original purpose of the inquiry and wanted the court to publicly declare so.</p>
        
            <p>The legal team representing the Royal Commission and the government have started their submissions saying it was not unusual for the scope of an inquiry to evolve over time to reflect public interest.</p>
