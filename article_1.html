            <p>The quadbike crash that left four hospitalised and two missing is "really tragic", the Far North Mayor says.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Peria, east of Kaitāia, just after 5pm yesterday when the bike crashed into a swimming hole in the swollen Waikāinga Stream.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were able to make it out of the water and were taken to hospital with minor to moderate injuries, but two others were not found.</p>
        
            <p>Police were searching for the pair today. The Dive Squad have been requested to help out with the search in the stream.</p>
        
            <p>Far North Mayor Moko Tepania said it was terrible to learn of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"Any loss of life, or any accidents, or anyone going missing in any community in Aotearoa is obviously going to be terrible so just really hoping that our search and rescue can find our missing whānau members."</p>
        
            <p>"Just really tragic to hear of this ... up here in the Far North over the summer season."</p>
        
            <p>While he had not had any calls with any residents in Peria yet, Tepania said he knew that the community there would be "devastated".</p>
        
            <p>"This area is really quite remote and really tight-knit as well so I know they will be incredibly anxious at this time."</p>
        
            <p>He said the district council would offer any support they could to affected communities.</p>
        
            <p>Tepania said it was a timely reminder for people to take extra care over the summer period.</p>
        
            <p>Police said support is being offered to those involved.</p>
