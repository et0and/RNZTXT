            <p>Dairy cooperative Fonterra is looking to sell all or part of its global consumer business as it shifts its focus to becoming a global business-to-business provider of dairy nutrition products.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra's consumer business brands included Anchor, Mainland, Kāpiti, Anlene, Anmum, Fernleaf, Western Star, Perfect Italiano and others.</p>
        
            <p>Those brands used about 15 percent of the co-op's total milk solids and represented about 19 percent of its underlying profit in the first half of this financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra chief executive Miles Hurrell said the co-op could increase its value to farmers as a business-to-business dairy nutrition provider.</p>
        
            <p>The company expected to continue supplying milk to the consumer brands through its ingredients business.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe we can grow further value for the Co-op by focusing on being a B2B dairy nutrition provider, working closely with customers through our high-performing ingredients and foodservice channels," Hurrell said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be enabled by strong relationships with farmers, a flexible manufacturing and supply chain footprint, deeper partnerships with strategic ingredients customers, further investment in our Foodservice channel, continued delivery on our sustainability commitments and investment in innovation."</p>
        
            <p>The divestment of its consumer businesses could also include integrated businesses, including Fonterra Oceania and Fonterra Sri Lanka.</p>

            <p>The sale could include 17 co-op-owned manufacturing sites around the world, including three in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The sale of its business units was expected to take at least 12 to 18 months and would require shareholder support.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra said it had already received unsolicited interest in the consumer parts of the business.</p>
        
            <p>Global markets chief executive Judith Swales was leaving the co-op, as the company changes strategic direction.</p>
