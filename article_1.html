            <p>The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre received a distress call at 3.30am on Saturday morning from a boat near the Hen and Chicken Islands that was taking on water.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after, the skipper announced that all three onboard were abandoning the vessel.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Whangārei volunteers launched their rescue vessel Circa Rescue and the police eagle helicopter was deployed.</p>
        
            <p>The helicopter spotted the boat and the three men in the water just after 4.30am and directed the Circa Rescue to the location.</p>
        
            <p>The men wen were transported to shore at Mangawhai Heads and then two of them were flown to Whangārei Hospital by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>The third was taken to the hospital by road.</p>
        
            <p>"We're immensely relieved and grateful that the men were wearing lifejackets, which ensured they gave themselves the best chance of survival in the dark of night and cold water," Coastguard Whangārei said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to thank the volunteers who didn't hesitate to leave the comfort of their homes to help these three men return to their loved ones."</p>
