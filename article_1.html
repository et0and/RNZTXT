        <h2>All Blacks edge England at Eden Park</h2>
        <p>
The All Blacks have held off a spirited English side to secure a hard-fought win and keep their 30-year Eden Park winning streak alive.

            <p>The fortress remains intact.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks' 30-year unbeaten streak at Eden Park is still alive after edging a brave English side 24-17.</p>
        
            <p>Some late drama almost saw the visitors steal a draw at the death, a seemingly eternal number of replays eventually giving the All Blacks an unbelievably relieving penalty.</p>
        
            <p>Down by one at halftime, a brilliant cameo off the bench by Beauden Barrett and the boot of Damian McKenzie ensured the 30-year record remained.</p>
        
            <p>The win also seried the series 2-0 for the All Blacks, kicking off Scott Robertson's reign in winning style.</p>
        
            <p>A sellout crowd packed the stands in Auckland. The hosts looked sharp early on, a couple of electric runs from Sevu Reece sending Codie Taylor away with the line open, but the hooker didn't quite have the gas to beat the cover.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks turned their dominance into points at the 10-minute mark on the back of a strong run from Savea. Mark Telea sniped from the base to a wide open blindside.</p>
        
            <p>However, England struck back immediately, Marcus Smith sending a picture-perfect cross for Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, who still had to evade the final two defenders which he did to square the ledger.</p>
        
            <p>One went begging for the All Blacks shortly after as McKenzie broke free down the left flank and linked with Telea.</p>
        
            <p>An interplay between Telea and Stephen Perofeta had a second looking assured, only for Smith to intercept the final pass and the All Blacks to butcher a certain try.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie tried to replicate his opposite and send a cross for Reece as had worked so well in the first test, but his radar was slightly off and it beat the winger into touch.</p>
        
            <p>Under advantage, McKenzie duly converted the penalty to put his side back in front.</p>

            <p>England enjoyed an extended stint in possession but mistakes were costing them, their frustrations boiling over into a push and shove on the New Zealand 22.</p>
        
            <p>With halftime looming and awarded a kickable penalty, Mckenzie slotted it through the sticks to extend the lead to six.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis were unable to control the restart however, giving England a shot to steal the lead heading to the sheds.</p>
        
            <p>Courtesy of another perfectly executed cross from Smith, they did just that as Tommy Freeman soared above Telea to snatch it out of the air.</p>
        
            <p>Smith added the extras as England went into the break ahead 14-13.</p>
        
            <p>A reversed penalty gave England first shot at points in the second, Smith pushing the lead to four.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Theo Dan hit the deck after copping a knee to the head, while the All Blacks brought Barrett on at the back for Perofeta and Samipeni Finau made way for Luke Jacobson.</p>
        
            <p>Cortez Ratima entered the arena to become the first new All Black under Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were struggling to get out of their own half as England had them camped at one end before an Ardie Savea lineout steal finally had the All Blacks back upfield.</p>

            <p>Anton-Lienert Brown replaced Ioane at centre in the last of the backline substitutions, and he latched onto a McKenzie cross to put his team on the front foot.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett then soared through a gaping hole and linked with Telea on his left to regain the lead for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Barrett was on fire at fullback, making several surging runs to rattle the English.</p>
        
            <p>A penalty right in front extended the advantage to four with 12 minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>With the clock tricking down, the All Blacks won a crucial scrum penally on halfway and plugged the England corner.</p>
        
            <p>England infringed again, and McKenzie went in off the uprights with his fourth penalty to stretch it to seven.</p>
        
            <p>England refused to lie down though, and hammered away for a late equaliser.</p>
        
            <p>They very nearly got it too, Nic Berry going upstairs after a lineout maul collapsed over the chalk.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd collectively held its breath as the TMO scoured the replays, finally awarding a penalty to the All Blacks and another famous win at their hallowed ground.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 24 (Telea 2, tries, McKenzie 1 cons, 4 pens)</p>
        
            <p>England 17 (Feyi-Waboso, Freeman. tries, Smith 2 cons, 1 pens)</p>
