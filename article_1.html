            <p>A woman in her 20s who suffered a skin reaction from her epilepsy medication nearly died after waiting weeks to see a dermatologist in the public system.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Hyun Kyoung Lee - who analysed the case for The New Zealand Medical Journal - said it was believed to be the first documented case in the world of Lamotrigine-induced generalised pustular psoriasis.</p>
        
            <p>Lamotrigine is prescribed for a range of conditions, including epilepsy and mood disorders.</p>
        
            <p>In this case, the patient noticed a rash on her feet within a week of starting on the medication.</p>
        
            <p>Her GP prescribed antibiotics, steroids, antifungals and antihistamines - but the vivid red rash kept spreading until it covered half her body and the skin started peeling away.</p>
        
            <p>It took six weeks to diagnose.</p>
        
            <p>"During those six weeks, the GP tried to refer her to the public dermatology service, but there's only one public dermatologist working in Palmerston North Hospital and I think she only works two half-days a week, so the waiting list is quite long," Dr Lee said.</p>
        
            <p>"The patient was waiting for the public dermatologist for several weeks without any luck."</p>

            <p>New Zealand has fewer than 80 dermatologists of whom the equivalent of just 22 work full-time in the public system. Some regions have none.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora MidCentral said the current wait time to see its dermatologist was 94 days - but urgent cases would be seen outside regular hours.</p>
        
            <p>In this case, the worried GP referred the patient to a private dermatologist Louise Reiche, who immediately had her admitted to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reiche, who is also co-president of the Dermatological Society, said the case required coordination with other specialists, including neurologists.</p>
        
            <p>"That's because epilepsy treatments can't be stopped precipitously without a risk of causing quite dangerous, prolonged epilepsy flares."</p>
        
            <p>She described it as "a tightrope situation".</p>

            <p>"Had there been a further delay of a couple of days or even a day, that patient would have been a mortality statistic."</p>
        
            <p>The report found the delay in getting a specialist appointment put the woman's life at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"This patient had not been able to seek timely public hospital dermatology clinic review, due to New Zealand health service pressures, resulting in disease progression and subsequent need for admission."</p>
        
            <p>In the five years to the end of December, Medsafe recorded 710 adverse reactions from lamotrigine, including six deaths.</p>
        
            <p>A second young woman taking Lamotrigine spent a month in Palmerston North Hospital late last year after she developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a life-threatening skin condition affecting one or two in a million people each year.</p>
        
            <p>The drug safety agency said the level was in line with international reporting, with more than 17,000 New Zealanders prescribed the drug last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, doctors warned other patients were at risk from complications because of long waits to see specialists.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland dermatologist Paul Jarrett said too many patients ended up in hospital because they did not get earlier treatment for their skin conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there are interventions that can help, we just need the workforce to be able to provide it and the funding to provide it as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't sit easily on any doctor's shoulders not to provide the best care available. It's deeply uncomfortable."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Jarrett, who is the Dermatological Society's spokesperson on public provision, said this country only had one dermatologist for every 250,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>The ideal ratio was one dermatologist per 80,000.</p>
        
            <p>"The private as well as the public, all of us are running like hamsters on the wheel."</p>
