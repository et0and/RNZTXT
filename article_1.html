            <p>Reaction to the attempt on Donald Trump's life shows how "deeply polarised" the US nation is, a New Zealand based US academic says.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland University senior lecturer in history in the Faculty of Arts Dr Paul Taillon says he felt a sense of "dread" when he first heard of it</p>
        
            <p>He referred to previous assassinations or attempted killings of presidents Ronald Reagan and John F Kennedy and others.</p>
        
            <p>In all those incidents the US people broadly rallied around the wounded or slain leaders and the two main parties, Republicans and Democrats, also responded in a similar fashion.</p>
        
            <p>"The current event if anything more deeply polarises an already very polarised nation."</p>
        
            <p>Trump had just begun a campaign speech in Butler, Pennsylvania on Sunday (NZT) when shots rang out, hitting the former president's right ear and streaking his face with blood.</p>
        
            <p>Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who they say fired from the roof of a building 140m from the stage where Trump was speaking.</p>
