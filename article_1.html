            <p>The financial situation of Health New Zealand is the government's responsibility, Labour says.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government announced Monday it would be replacing the board of Health New Zealand with a commissioner, who will be tasked with finding savings and strengthening the agency's governance.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said without urgent action, Health New Zealand would run an estimated deficit of $1.4 billion by the end of 2024-25.</p>
