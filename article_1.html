            <p>A police raid at a property in an affluent Wellington suburb has come as a surprise to residents who witnessed it.</p>
        
            <p>Two men were arrested on Thursday after a series of police searches in the suburbs of Khandallah and Hataitai that saw cash, cocaine, and cars seized.</p>
        
            <p>Police have claimed the men were selling a significant amount of cocaine via social media and encrypted applications.</p>
        
            <p>Khandallah residents reported seeing a flurry of police activity for several hours on Lucknow Terrace, with plain clothed officers ferrying brown paper bags into unmarked cars.</p>
        
            <p>Residents said the targeted house was known for its "expensive-looking, big cars" - reportedly a mustang, a ute, and a BMW.</p>
        
            <p>One witness said they did not hear anything out of the ordinary, "but when we saw the cars being towed, we realised something was off".</p>
        
            <p>Residents spoken to by RNZ said the street was a quiet one, with only the occasional disruption from people gathering at the nearby Nairnville Park.</p>
        
            <p>They said the majority of houses were owner-occupied, though believed the one raided by police had been recently rented out.</p>
        
            <p>One resident, who RNZ agreed not to name, said the street was usually pretty quiet, so it was a surprise to see half a dozen cops "piling brown paper bags" out of the house.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like, what the hell is going on?</p>
        
            <p>"There were between four and six officers, they had two unmarked cars, and they were in plain clothes with the full police vest.</p>
        
            <p>"They were just diving in and out of the house, looking very serious and bringing out armfuls of stuff. I noticed the two cars were gone."</p>
        
            <p>The resident said the cars stood out on the street, describing one as an "American muscle car - black with a green racing stripe" - and the other as a "big white ute".</p>
        
            <p>"Expensive-looking cars, big cars."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement yesterday, police confirmed two men had been arrested following a series of warrants executed in Khandallah and Hataitai.</p>
        
            <p>Close to $50,000 in cash, three vehicles, and 9 kilograms of cannabis with a street value of more than $75,000 was also seized in the searches.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the searches came after a two-month investigation into the supply of drugs in Wellington, with police alleging the men were selling cocaine via social media - reaching an "audience of up to 500 people".</p>
        
            <p>The arrested men, aged 29 and 31, face charges related to the supply of cocaine, ketamine, MDMA and cannabis. One of the men also faces a money laundering charge.</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old man appeared in Wellington District Court on Friday and was remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>A 31-year-old man is due to appear on Monday.</p>
