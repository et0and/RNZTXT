            <p>The 15-year-old who was struck multiple times by a car in Waikato will have long-term disabilities - if he survives, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The boy was walking on Old Taupiri Road near Ngāruawāhia about 5pm on Wednesday when he was struck by a car and run over more than once, Detective Inspector Darrell Harpur said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a particularly nasty targeted serious assault," Harpur told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"The young man, 15 years old, is going to have long-term disabilities from this incident. He's currently in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>"Multiple fractures and breaks, internal injuries, surgeries... he's going to be in there for months.</p>
        
            <p>"We have spoken to a witness who was there at the time and witnessed the events unfold."</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the driver ran over the boy multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a nasty, particularly nasty incident," Harpur said.</p>
        
            <p>"It still could well be a homicide. Injuries like this, there's always a potential the victim could pass away. He's currently fighting for his life in intensive care."</p>
        
            <p>The car, a black Toyota Auris with registration number NBE817, was found abandoned at Pukemokemoke Bush Reserve near Tauhei.</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said police wanted to hear from anyone who saw the car between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Wednesday between Huntly and Taupiri.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this car - a black Toyota Auris with the registration number NBE817 - left the Huntly township at approximately 4.40pm on Wednesday 10 April and travelled to the Hopuhopu area."</p>
        
            <p>Police believe this was a targeted attack, and the driver of the car purposely struck the victim before then driving the car over him more than once, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said police were "keeping an open mind" about a motive but he did not believe there was any gang involvement.</p>
        
            <p>"We're making good process. I'm confident we'll be able to achieve a good result soon."</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said he could not comment as to whether the victim may have known his assailant or assailants.</p>
        
            <p>"We are appealing to the community to come forward," particularly if they have any footage.</p>
        
            <p>Police have set up a portal for images and short recordings to be uploaded into.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or larger quantities of footage can contact police on 105 quoting file number: 240410/3018.</p>
