            <p>Armed police have closed a street on Auckland's North Shore as they respond to an emergency incident where a woman has been injured.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Herald understands police earlier responded to a reported kidnapping in Beach Haven and that the two incidents are linked.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Kerry Watson said police received calls shortly after 7pm of an incident in Beach Haven.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a serious incident there, a number of police units went to the address.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of what we discovered at that address, shortly afterwards having received information we went to Greenhithe."</p>
        
            <p>Watson said police had located an injured female who was believed to be related to the incident in Beach Haven.</p>
        
            <p>"All I can say in regards to the Beach Haven incident is we'd been given some information there... it was quite a serious incident that occurred there and we were worried about the safety of one person.</p>
        
            <p>"We've now located that person and she is receiving medical attention."</p>
        
            <p>Watson said police were "pretty satisfied" that both the Beach Haven and Greenhithe areas are now safe.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't taken anyone into custody, we're making inquiries at this stage. There's still a lot of inquiry work that needs to take place in order to locate people that we need to speak to."</p>
        
            <p>Three different locations had been cordoned off by police, one in Beach Haven and two in Greenhithe.</p>
        
            <p>"The residents of Greenhithe may see an increased police attendance and also in Beach Haven in the morning until these scenes have been dealt with," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>A Hato Hone St John spokesperson said they were attending an incident on Mackay Dr in Greenhithe. They were assessing one patient and being assisted by police.</p>
        
            <p>The patient was being transporting in a moderate condition to North Shore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A photographer at the scene said armed police had blocked Mackay Dr at the intersection of Greenhithe Rd.</p>
        
            <p>The police Eagle helicopter is also understood to be hovering above Greenhithe.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, police responded to reports of "loud bangs" at a residential address on Sunnyhaven Ave in Beach Haven about 7.35pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are in the area working to determine what has occurred," a spokesperson earlier said.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald understands the two incidents are related.</p>
