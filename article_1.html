            <p>Emergency officials have been making preparations for a deluge predicted over a large stretch of the coast over the next two days.</p>
        
            <p>In Franz Josef, close to 300mm of rain had fallen since yesterday, West Coast Emergency Management group controller Te Aroha Cook said. The Franz Josef community had been proactive in shifting stock and people in low-lying areas had prepared to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>SH6 from Franz Josef to Haast is closed due to multiple slips and people south of Hannahs Clearing, near Haast, could be without power for several days.</p>
