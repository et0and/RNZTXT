            <p>Three people are dead and two other seriously injured after a crash in South Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>The serious crash involving two vehicles on State Highway 79 was reported about 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicles - a four-wheel drive and a people-mover - were travelling in opposite directions when the crash occurred, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Three of the dead were in the people-mover, while another person was critically injured. The driver of the four-wheel-drive, who was travelling alone, was seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Losing so many lives at once is shocking and our hearts go out to those involved," Aoraki Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The deceased were part of a group visiting the district, and members of that group were following behind the vehicle at the time of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"We're wrapping support around them and will be speaking with them to help establish what occurred," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Incidents like this are hard on everyone involved, and our communities too."</p>
