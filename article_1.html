            <p>All Blacks v Wallabies</p>
        
            <p>Kick-off: 7:05pm Saturday 28 September</p>
        
            <p>Sky Stadium, Wellington</p>
        
            <p>Live updates on RNZ Sport</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie has either paid the price for an error-ridden performance in Bledisloe I or taking an admittedly well-earned rest. All Black coach Scott Robertson has replaced him at first five with Beauden Barrett, one of several changes to the starting side to face the Wallabies at Sky Stadium on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>The other changes to the backline see the injury-enforced change at second-five, with Jordie Barrett's knee injury seeing him replaced by Anton Lienert-Brown. Will Jordan remains at fullback, where he started on Saturday after Beauden Barrett's late withdrawal due to illness.</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara comes back in at halfback for Cortez Ratima, while Sevu Reece stays on the right wing and David Havili comes back into the 23.</p>
        
            <p>The reasons for McKenzie's benching will presumably be confirmed by Robertson when he fronts media this afternoon, but it should be taken into account that he is one of only two players to have started every test this year. He's also only been subbed once, so with the Bledisloe Cup now safely stored away for another year, this test was always likely to be one where he was given the night off. Harry Plummer has dropped out of the squad after only playing three minutes last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>However, it doesn't mask the fact that McKenzie's performance in the 31-28 win over the Wallabies in Sydney came under heavy scrutiny, so for him to be left out the week after can be seen as a consequence of that.</p>

            <p>Lienert-Brown's inclusion is predictable given his consistent form, but all eyes will be on Barrett. He last started at first five two years ago, against Scotland at Murrayfield. It was one of five starts in the 10 jersey, three of which were losses.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sam Cane gets a start in his 100th test match in an unchanged forward pack from last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks are looking to snap a shocking record at Sky Stadium, a venue they have not won a test match at since 2018.</p>
