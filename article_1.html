            <p>There's been a strong show of support for the South island hīkoi as it leaves Kaikōura for Picton, with participants due to unite with those already preparing to march on Parliament tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Scores of people lined the entrance to the town, some with tino Rangatira flags and making clear their opposition to the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Māori Queen, Nga wai hono i te po, will join the national hīkoi to Parliament on Tuesday, saying she will not accept a process which undermines Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of supporters of the hīkoi are having a rest day on Monday before heading to Wellington and Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
