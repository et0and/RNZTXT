            <p>Gisborne police have impounded a car, after its driver did a burnout on the city's rainbow crossing.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time this week that the crossing on the main street has been targeted.</p>
        
            <p>Three people face vandalism charges after a layer of white paint was spread over the crossing on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The police were treating it as a hate crime.</p>
        
            <p>This was followed by a heated demonstration involving Destiny Church members and counter-protesters on Tuesday, which was outside a children's storytelling event read by a drag queen at the city's public library.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, the rainbow crossing on Karangahape Road in the city was also painted over in white on Thursday, but rain washed a lot of it off.</p>
        
            <p>Last night about 8:30pm, skid marks were made on the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>The police said the car involved was located six hours later and has been impounded.</p>
        
            <p>It was not yet known whether anyone faced charges.</p>
