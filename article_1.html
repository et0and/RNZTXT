People leave shops with looted goods amid a state of unrest in Port Moresby on 10 January 2024. A festering pay dispute involving PNG's security forces sparked angry protests in the capital, where a crowd torched a police car outside the prime minister's office. By Wednesday afternoon pockets of unrest had spread through Port Moresby.

            <p>Papua New Guinea's Commissioner of Police David Manning has reiterated his call to all people in Port Moresby that now is the time to clear the streets and go home.</p>
        
            <p>Civil unrest, sporadic looting, and arson broke out in the capital on Wednesday, local time, after police and the military went on strike over a pay deduction between US$26 and US$80 from their wages.</p>
        
            <p>Buildings and shops were torched, and PNG's fire chief officer Bill Roo said firefighters were outnumbered when trying to attend to fires, and some firefighters were also threatened by looters.</p>
        
            <p>One hospital was forced to evacuate its patients as fire from nearby shops spread.</p>

            <p>There were also reports that the airport was closed with all international flights cancelled until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>National newspaper Post-Courier has called it the "Darkest day in our city" in its frontpage on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It said the security personnel - military and police - were on the streets after the "unprecedented looting and rampage by hooligans and opportunists".</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner David Manning said security forces will not tolerate troublemakers, and where innocent members of the public are threatened, live rounds may be used in accordance with standing orders.</p>
        
            <p>Police reinforcements were sent from outside of the capital last night to maintain order.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 Papua New Guinea police and military personnel abandoned work on Wednesay to protest.</p>
        
            <p>At 10am (local time), police and military personnel gathered at Port Moresby's Unagi oval in protest over what they say are hefty "tax" deductions in the most recent pay period.</p>
        
            <p>The police union demanded answers from the government at the gathering and by 11am, a large group proceeded to parliament where they demanded answers from the prime minister and members of the cabinet.</p>

            <p>Law enforcement with PNG Defence Force soldiers stormed the nation's parliament building where they have been addressed by officials over the dispute.</p>
        
            <p>There are reports that security guards stood aside as police and military entered Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The deductions come as Papua New Guineans experienced a noticeable rise in the cost of goods and services in the last three months.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific correspondent in PNG Scott Waide said the Internal Revenue Commissioner has released a statement, saying that the government was working as quickly as possible to resolve the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister James Marape later released a statement calling for calm while stating that the deductions were caused by a glitch in the government payroll system.</p>
