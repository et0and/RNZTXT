            <p>Kiwi golfer Steven Alker has had a $2.1 million payday on the seniors Champions Tour in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
        
            <p>Alker claimed the $1.7m prize for finishing top of the tour's points list for the second year running, but he missed replicating his win last year in the final tournament - Charles Schwab Cup Championship - falling just short on a dramatic final hole, leaving 67-year-old German Bernhard Langer as the tournament winner.</p>
        
            <p>Alker earned $460,000 for finishing tied for second with Australian Richard Green, at 17-under, one shot behind Langer.</p>
        
            <p>Alker, Langer and Green were level at 17-under when Alker and Langer teed off at the 18th hole, with Green in the clubhouse after his round.</p>
        
            <p>Both had untidy approach shots, but Langer nailed a 30-foot (9.1m) putt and Alker came just a few inches short with his putt that would have sent them to a playoff.</p>
        
            <p>It was Langer's 47th victory in 18 years on the Champions Tour.</p>
        
            <p>He had a one-stroke lead over Alker heading into the final round, after shooting his age with a four-under 67 in the third round.</p>
        
            <p>He led until bogeying the 17th hole, and while his shot-making on the final hole was patchy, he scrambled well enough before sinking a brilliant clincher.</p>
        
            <p>"It still has to sink in," Langer told Sky Sport.</p>
