            <p>There are just two days of campaigning left before polls close in a historically close United States presidential election.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has been at a Donald Trump rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, as he focuses on the critical state.</p>
        
            <p>Democrat Kamala Harris campaigns in Michigan on Monday (NZ time) while Trump will go on to hit two more eastern battleground states North Carolina and Georgia.</p>
        
            <p>A poll has shown Harris leading in Iowa, a state that Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020, raising the possibility of an upset there.</p>
