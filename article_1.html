            <p>When it comes to growing flowers, timing is everything.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne flower grower Kate Briant has traded one career focused on perishable products in the horticulture sector, for an even more time-sensitive product.</p>
        
            <p>"Once a flower is ready, it's ready," she told Country Life. "It's not like a mandarin, or an apple or a kiwifruit that can sit there for another week or two. When that flower is ready, if you don't pick it within 48 hours it goes to waste."</p>
        
            <p>Kate made the move to flower farming, and running her own floristry business The Rural Florist, not long after the birth of her now four-year-old son George.</p>
        
            <p>Having studied commerce and agriculture with a minor in plant and soil science at Lincoln University before going to work in the horticulture sector, Kate realised she wanted a more flexible role when young George came along.</p>
        
            <p>Kate already enjoyed making bouquets for friends and family before realising she could make a business out of it.</p>
        
            <p>A family with green thumbs - her mother-in-law is a florist and Kate describes her mother and grandma as "great gardeners" - she set about developing a garden from scratch.</p>
        
            <p>"I just thought I'd give it a go and best-case scenario it works, and worst-case scenario I've got lots of flowers to give to people."</p>
        
            <p>
The makeup of the bouquets is influenced by what Kate can grow during the different seasons, the longevity of the blooms and colour palettes that appeal.

            <p>She began by supplying bouquets to the local grocer at Makaraka Veges, after she realised there wasn't a flower shop on this side of Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>The business got bigger, including events and a summer flower-subscription service.</p>
        
            <p>George eventually ended up in daycare, though two-year-old sister Emily is still with Kate fulltime making it a bit of a juggle.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of my joy is that I can do this with them in garden. We just have so much fun."</p>
        
            <p>When juggling becomes a bit much, she focuses her efforts on the Makaraka retail stand and shuts the website down temporarily.</p>
        
            <p>Floristry and flower growing require different skills compared to her horticulture job, which involved a lot of paperwork and travelling between orchards.</p>
        
            <p>"I just wanted to get my hands dirty again."</p>
        
            <p>As with any business that relies on ever-changing weather conditions, running the flower farm certainly has its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"So with flower growing it's not this glamorous thing. I don't portray it so much but a lot of the flower grower influencers do, especially overseas. They're prancing through fields with their beautiful curled hair and their floaty dresses.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is not that. We are farming. The playing with flowers, AKA making the bouquets, is only about 10 percent of the actual work."</p>

Proteas are one of Kate's favourite flowers to work with.

            <p>When Country Life visited back in late July, the anemones and tulips were just starting to bloom.</p>
        
            <p>Her dining room table was awash with vibrant pinks and lush greens, buckets filled with proteas and lots of foliage.</p>
        
            <p>Although she grows foliage all year long, there is a three-month gap between winter and spring where she has to buy in some of the flowers.</p>
        
            <p>"In the winter, my bouquet-making skill is different to the summer," Kate explained.</p>
        
            <p>"In the summer, it's all flowers, it's an abundance - how many flowers can I pack into a bouquet? In the winter, it's a lot more strategic, you know these flowers have cost me to buy in so I can measure how much does this bouquet cost me to put together? What do I need to price it at to make it worth my while? And bulking it out with greenery."</p>
        
            <p>Summer is all about dahlia and zinnia flowers, and pinky-pastel or bright orange colour palettes.</p>
        
            <p>Kate also grows and dries flowers, so as not to worry about perishability and waste.</p>
        
            <p>When designing a bouquet, she considers elements such as the colour palette as well as long-lasting blooms that offer customers value for money.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's about] trying to strike a balance between what's pretty and what lasts."</p>
