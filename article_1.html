        <h2>Diabetes register to improve access to care - expert</h2>
        <p>
A new national diabetes register will show for the first time how many people are living with each type of diabetes in Aotearoa.
</p>
        
            <p>
Health NZ says the real-time register is yet to be developed, but it will be an early priority for its new Diabetes National Clinical Network, Mahitahi Matehuka, which it established earlier this year.

            <p>A new national diabetes register will show for the first time how many people are living with each type of diabetes in Aotearoa, which is crucial for diagnosis and treatment, a diabetes specialist says.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ says the real-time register is yet to be developed, but it will be an early priority for its new Diabetes National Clinical Network, Mahitahi Matehuka, which it established earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>A new global study published this week reported more than 800 million adults have diabetes worldwide - almost twice as many as previous estimates have suggested - while this country's Virtual Diabetes Register shows 324,000 cases.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Ryan Paul, co-chair the Diabetes National Clinical Network, said the current Virtual Diabetes Register did not differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2, despite them needing very different treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The new real-time register would distinguish between them, as well as the lesser-known forms of the disease, such as monogenic diabetes (when genetic variants cause diabetes) and pancreatogenic diabetes (which can occur when the pancreas is not working).</p>
        
            <p>This would lead to improved access to care, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"The management of diabetes varies… by the type of diabetes, so we want to know the right type of diabetes to provide the best management for that person.</p>
        
            <p>"Type 1 diabetes, they definitely need insulin, and we're very thankful that continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery, which is the gold standard treatment for Type 1 diabetes, became funded in Aotearoa from October 1.</p>
        
            <p>"Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable, but we need to remember that both Type 2 diabetes and obesity have a very strong genetic component. At least 40 to 70 percent is genetic, so we need to start looking at it not just as a purely lifestyle disease but the other factors that go into that as well."</p>
        
            <p>"But, just as importantly, if we do get the right diagnosis, of the right type of diabetes, that gives the best management, and it also governs access to care.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people with Type 1 diabetes will be seen by specialist diabetes services in their region, whereas those with Type 2 diabetes, it may only be those with complications that get access to specialist care."</p>
        
            <p>Paul said at present, best estimates based on Waikato data were that there are approximately 17,000 to 22,000 New Zealanders with type 1 diabetes, with well over half having started funded continuous glucose monitoring.</p>
        
            <p>Diabetes was a leading cause of death and health loss in Aotearoa New Zealand and globally, but the disease was "not sexy" in the eyes of drug funding agencies, Paul said.</p>
        
            <p>People with all forms of diabetes were routinely reproached by others, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a massive stigma... you mention diabetes and it doesn't matter what type you have, you're automatically blamed for having it. Even Type 1 diabetes, which is completely unpreventable."</p>
