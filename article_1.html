            <p>A Southland woman is overjoyed after a four-year search for her missing cat ended with a trademark high-five from the paw of her "best friend".</p>
        
            <p>Winton woman Torria Cummings said she never gave up hope of finding Ceasar after he went missing when she moved to a new house.</p>
        
            <p>Now after years of searching, tears and false alarms, the pair have been reunited.</p>
        
            <p>''I still can't believe he is here - it sounds so cliche, but I just had this feeling he was still alive.''</p>
        
            <p>It was a social media post from Farming Mums NZ and Furever Homes that led to the reunion.</p>
        
            <p>The post was from a woman asking for help to check the sex of a ''stray cat'', which she had rescued from another family.</p>
        
            <p>''I messaged her and said that my cat was missing - it was a long shot as it was so long ago.</p>
        
            <p>''I sent some photos of Ceaser and then she asked me if there was anything you can distinguish that it's him - I told him he could high-five.''</p>
        
            <p>She told the woman if she clicked her fingers, he would jump up and high-five and she replied saying it looked like him.</p>

            <p>Cummings said she could not believe it.</p>
        
            <p>''I went there, I was trying to keep my expectations down because I've gone to so many places to see if it was him - and it wasn't.</p>
        
            <p>''As soon as I went down there and he high-fived me - She was just like 'Oh my God, it's not normal for a cat to high-five. This is your boy'.''</p>
        
            <p>Cummings was happy to have Ceaser back and said he was already fitting in with her children.</p>
        
            <p>''They get jealous sometimes because I just cuddle him all the time, but he's just a part of the family again.''</p>
        
            <p>Cummings adopted Ceaser when she was about 19.</p>
        
            <p>While her family had many cats before, she had just moved into a new flat with her partner and thought it would be a milestone to have their first pet.</p>
        
            <p>''I'm a cat person. Not like heaps of cats, one is enough kind of girl, but Ceaser was my first cat.</p>
        
            <p>''He became my best friend and he still is, now that he's back.''</p>
        
            <p>Years later, Cummings, who is a farm manager, moved to Wreys Bush.</p>
        
            <p>In the same week, when she returned home for lunch, she could not find Ceaser.</p>
        
            <p>''He was gone. So my husband and I went searching for him. We called out his name, went to the neighbours' properties, put posts on social media . . . But we had no luck.</p>
        
            <p>''We repeated that so many times - we went looking for him for months, if not years, because I still had hope.''</p>
        
            <p>Not long after, Cummings moved to another farm - but she never stopped searching for Ceaser.</p>
        
            <p>During those years, there were a lot of false alarms, and whenever she was around Wreys Bush she called Ceaser's name, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Cummings and her husband have had two cats and two children since then, but she always had ''her best friend'' on her mind.</p>
        
            <p>''I kept seeing posts and being like, 'it could be him. I'll just go out and check him out'.''</p>
        
            <p>Furever Homes volunteer Loanna Messman said the story of Ceaser and Cummings was a great example of owners who never gave up.</p>
        
            <p>''To everyone with a missing pet, don't give up hope. Cats are incredibly resilient.</p>
        
            <p>''We're overjoyed for them.''</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the Otago Daily Times.</p>
