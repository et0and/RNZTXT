            <p>The Green Party co-leaders are set to respond to the findings of the independent investigation into MP Darleen Tana this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Tana has been suspended since 14 March, following allegations of migrant exploitation made against her husband, and about her possible involvement.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation by independent investigator and barrister Rachel Burt has now wrapped up.</p>
        
            <p>By May, the probe had cost $43,000, from the the Green Party leaders' office budget.</p>
        
            <p>She was also referred to the police by the Electoral Commission last month, over accusations she failed to provide a promoter statement in a Verve Magazine election ad.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday marked 115 days since Tana was suspended from the caucus, meaning she has spent more than half of her Parliamentary career suspended with pay.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will be livestreaming the media conference at 1pm.</p>
