            <p>About 40 pilot whales are stranded at a beach near Māhia on the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A video has been posted on a Facebook community page of the whales struggling in the shallows of a rocky beach.</p>
        
            <p>Whale conservation group Project Jonah and the Department of Conservation are mobilising a team to attempt to save the animals.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah manager Daren Grover said the team planned to assess the scene and triage the whales based on which were in most urgent need of care.</p>
        
            <p>He said the beach was isolated and this was a major stranding for an area where there were not many people nearby to help.</p>
        
            <p>But Grover said any locals wanting to help should not get in the water with the stranded whale because it could be unpredictable and dangerous.</p>
