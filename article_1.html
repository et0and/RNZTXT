            <p>Police said cordons remained in place on Seddon Street and residents could expect to see a police presence in the area this evening.</p>

            <p>A resident, who RNZ has agreed not to name, earlier said it was sad to hear someone had died, but they were not worried for their safety.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident told RNZ a sheet had been lain over something in the middle of the road.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services are asking Seddon St residents to follow the directions of officers at the cordons.</p>
        
            <p>Three police cars and armed officers have blocked Seddon St at the corner of Wheatley Street.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are out on the street talking amongst each other and looking on down the road, but the scene cannot be viewed from the cordons.</p>
