            <p>Donations to the US Democratic Party's election campaign have surged on the back of the news President Biden will step aside and support his VP Kamala Harris to run for president.</p>
        
            <p>Harris was endorsed by Biden as he announced his withdrawal from the 2024 election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, Biden said he would remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025. He had faced vocal opposition from within his party, particularly after his performance in the first official debate against his Republican opponent Donald Trump, and has not been seen in public since testing positive for Covid-19 last week.</p>
        
            <p>Following Biden's statement, senior Democratic Party representatives issued their own statement backing Harris, saying she has a track record of winning tough elections and is a proven leader.</p>
        
            <p>The move seems to have sent ripples out, mobilising Democratic supporters. Website ActBlue, which collects campaign donations for the Democratic Party, has reported a $US27.5m surge in donations in the five hours following Biden's announcement.</p>
        
            <p>The funds were from small-dollar donations, ActBlue said in a social media post, and indicated: "Grassroots supporters are energized and excited to support [Harris] as the Democratic nominee."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a string of world leaders have paid tribute to Biden, including New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who said Biden "has dedicated his life to public service, and that is something that deserves much respect".</p>
