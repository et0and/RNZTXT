            <p>In a Facebook post on Saturday night, Johnston's mother Amy Walsh said she left her house in Akron Grove while intoxicated.</p>
        
            <p>We have been searching for her since 9pm. She has no phone, no wallet, nothing. Just the black jeans shorts, green shoestring singlet and a black tshirt she was carrying. Wearing converse shoes."</p>
