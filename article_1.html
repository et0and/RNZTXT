            <p>The start of July brings a raft of changes that will affect households across the country.</p>
        
            <p>From prescription changes to mortgage tweaks, the rules, fees and taxes will affect the way that many people spend and borrow money.</p>
        
            <p>Here are a few of them.</p>
        
            <p>New debt-to-income rules will limit how much banks can lend to borrowers, compared to their household income.</p>
        
            <p>Only 20 percent of lending can go to owner-occupier buyers with a debt-to-income ratio of six, and only 20 percent of investors loans will be able to be at a debt-to-income ratio of more than seven.</p>
        
            <p>The debt-to-income calculation takes into account other debt, such as student loans.</p>
        
            <p>These rules are not expected to make a big difference initially, because not much lending is currently being done above those levels. However, they are likely to limit the extent of future house price growth.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, loan-to-value rules will be eased slightly to allow banks to give 20 percent of lending to owner-occupier borrowers with a deposit or equity of less than 20 percent, and 5 percent of lending to investors with a deposit or equity of less than 30 per cent.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, they could only lend 15 percent to owner-occupiers with less than 20 percent deposit and 5 percent of lending to investors with less than 35 percent.</p>
        
            <p>A $5 charge is coming back on for prescriptions.</p>
        
            <p>This does not apply to people who are over 65, Community Services Card holders, people who are under 14 or people ages 14 to 17 who are dependent on a Community Services Cardholder.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Regional Fuel Tax scheme ended on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>This is worth 11.5c per litre on petrol, diesel and their biovariants.</p>

Families are now able to claim childcare subsidies of up to $75 a week.

            <p>The FamilyBoost policy takes effect from 1 July, offering a payment of 25 percent of early childhood education fees for households up to $75 a week.</p>
        
            <p>This is available in full to households earning up to $140,000 and reduces for those earning up to $170,000.</p>
        
            <p>Households should start saving their invoices from 1 July as either PDF or JPG files, Inland Revenue says.</p>
        
            <p>Payments will be made in three-monthly blocks, starting in October.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 July, the bright-line test will reduce to two years, from the current 10 years, or five for new builds.</p>
        
            <p>The bright-line test sets a limit on how long properties, apart from someone's main home, have to be held to avoid tax on capital gains when they are sold.</p>
        
            <p>That means that properties sold on or after Monday now need to have been held for at least two years to avoid the automatic tax.</p>
        
            <p>Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand is warning there could be some confusion, though, because the new rules focus on the "disposal" date of a property rather than the acquisition date.</p>
        
            <p>"Care needs to be taken as the dates are determined differently. The bright-line end date is determined by when the seller first enters a contract for sale, whereas the start, or acquisition date is typically determined when title transfers."</p>
        
            <p>He said that could mean that anyone who had entered negotiations before 1 July could still be captured under the old rule.</p>
        
            <p>Each year, the maximum amount of paid parental leave available increases.</p>
        
            <p>How much you get is determined by how much you were earning before you went on leave.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 July, the maximum is $754.87 a week before tax, compared to $712.17 previously.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 July, a 12 percent offshore gambling duty applies operators who are taking bets from New Zealand residents.</p>
        
            <p>Offshore gambling operators have to register for GST if they make more than $60,000 in a 120-month period. Those that are registered for GST must also now register for the duty.</p>
        
            <p>The annual adjustment of excise tax on alcohol takes place on 1 July. This is based on movements in the consumer price index in the year to March.</p>
