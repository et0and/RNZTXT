            <p>The incoming prime minister's office is one of a number of Auckland buildings vandalised by a pro-Palestine group in a call for politicians to support a ceasefire of the conflict in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>TƒÅmaki for Palestine splashed red paint on the buildings of six National MPs and ACT leader David Seymour's office overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It is calling the incoming government a "coalition of complicity" for failing to call for a ceasefire or condemn Israel's actions.</p>
        
            <p>It said the red paint represents the blood on their hands for the deaths of thousands in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Among the National Party offices vandalised were Christopher Luxon's, Judith Collins', and Paul Goldsmith's.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the group did a similar act, vandalising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the US Consulate offices.</p>
        
            <p>One person was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
