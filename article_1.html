            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council has issued thousands of dollars worth of fines over illegal odours coming from a Lower Hutt wastewater treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>Between 31 October and 12 December 111 complaints were made regarding a smell described as "sickening" by some residents.</p>
        
            <p>The issue triggered Greater Wellington Regional Council to investigate the issue in November.</p>
        
            <p>The probe found there were 13 incidents of offensive and objectionable odour beyond the boundary of the property resulting in infringement notices.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water and service provider Veolia were charged $22,750 each for 26 instances of non-compliance.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt City Council and Upper Hutt City Council have also been issued infringement notices for breaches of abatement notices - with a cost per council of $9750.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council environment group manager Lian Butcher said the council did not take this step lightly.</p>
        
            <p>"Issuing fines is an enforcement approach that takes a lot of consideration.</p>
        
            <p>"But following non-compliance with the consent conditions and subsequent abatement notices, and given the severity of the odour, there were very few options left available to us other than issuing these infringements."</p>
        
            <p>Butcher hoped replacing the plant's biofilter media to mitigate odour would put an end to the discomfort felt in neighbourhoods adjacent to the treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>The replacement is due to be completed in mid-February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington would continue to monitor odours for compliance with all relevant consents, Butcher said.</p>
