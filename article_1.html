            <p>Search and rescue are looking for a young person who has been swept down a river in Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 11.40am after being alerted to an individual being swept down the Hollyford River, near Lower Hollyford Road.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said officers and Search and Rescue teams were in pursuit and that a helicopter had been deployed.</p>
        
            <p>Hollyford River is described by NZ Fishing as being "off the beaten track". The terrain is rugged and remote.</p>
        
            <p>The group described the upper reaches of the river as rough.</p>
        
            <p>The "very very cold" water can appear shallow and sedate below Hidden Falls, but is often much deeper and more powerful than it seems, NZ Fishing said.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
