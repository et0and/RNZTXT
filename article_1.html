            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is adamant Cabinet ministers are following their own conflict of interest processes as a minister complains about health officials undermining the government's smoking reforms.</p>
        
            <p>According to 1News Associate Health Minister Casey Costello has accused health officials of undermining the government's smoking reforms by questioning advice she used to justify a tax cut on heated tobacco products.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report the important thing was Costello's focus on bringing down daily smoking rates.</p>
        
            <p>The failure of officials to declare a conflict of interest was "unacceptable" and "frustrating".</p>
        
            <p>He declined to elaborate on whether Shane Jones and Winston Peters had declared conflicts of interest regarding tobacco policy decisions made by Cabinet.</p>
