        <h2>Live: Thousands join hīkoi as it heads to Bastion Point and Ihumātao</h2>
        <p>
Crowds are swelling in Ōkahu Bay and Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) and also in Christchurch for the South Island hīkoi.
</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of supporters of the hīkoi mō te Tiriti - a march traversing the length of Aotearoa in protest against the Treaty Principles Bill and government policies impacting Māori - have crossed the Auckland Harbour Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reporters with the march said it was swaying and rocking as the protesters descended on the Westhaven side of the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, crowds are swelling in Ōkahu Bay and Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) in inner-east Auckland, ahead of the arrival of the hīkoi mō te Takutai Moana convoy.</p>
        
            <p>And in the South Island, more than 1000 people have met under the Bridge of Remembrance in Christchurch, with more people filing in from all directions ahead of the hīkoi event there.</p>
