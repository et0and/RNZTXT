            <p>National's deputy leader says the party is working hard to reach not just a deal - but a lasting agreement with ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to First Up, Nicola Willis said National had reached policy agreements with both parties in its talks to form a coalition government but there was still work to do in getting a final deal.</p>
        
            <p>ACT and New Zealand First still needed to reach policy agreements with each other, for example.</p>
        
            <p>Other work to be done included cross-checking agreements, a discussion on ministerial roles and finalisation of documents.</p>
        
            <p>"So there's still work to do to finalise a deal but we did reach an important milestone."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said she was joined by the majority of New Zealanders in the "wish" that the deal would be done sooner rather than later.</p>
        
            <p>Willis rejected the idea that leader Christopher Luxon was inexperienced in such political discussions.</p>
        
            <p>"I think, in fact, what we have had is three men with different experiences, different viewpoints with different party interests to represent.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've had across many of those meetings are deeper understanding of each other, each other's policies, of motivations to make sure we can reach not just an agreement, but a lasting agreement that will provide a foundation for good government."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said there had been "getting to know each other exercises" as well as learning how to iron out any issues and get things done quickly for the country.</p>

            <p>"It's been a very positive process."</p>
        
            <p>She said she did not believe Kiwis were going to judge the party based on its negotiations - but by its results.</p>
        
            <p>"They want a stronger economy, they want us to be addressing the cost of living, to be dealing with crime, to be delivering better public services."</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the cost of travel and room hire associated with the negotiations, Willis said it was normal for members of Parliament to travel as part of their job.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "practical decision" to host talks in Auckland where possible given all three leaders of the parties live there.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been attempts made to ensure the costs are represented value for money for the taxpayer."</p>
        
            <p>Despite how long the negotiation has taken, Willis said the party would be working right up until Christmas given the amount of work to do.</p>

            <p>Political commentator Bryce Edwards said it was clear from negotiation leaks that New Zealand First leader Winston Peters wanted to be appointed attorney-general.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards told Morning Report it would be a "big headache" for National and "constitutionally difficult" for it to give him the role.</p>
        
            <p>"It means that Peters would have a lot of control over judicial appointments and the understanding is that Peters wants that influence.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially in terms of treaty issues, in terms of the court's role in interpreting the principles of the treaty, but also because attorney-general essentially has control over the Serious Fraud Office and of course, Winston Peters has a long running beef with the Serious Fraud Office due to, I guess, cases they've taken against New Zealand First."</p>
        
            <p>Another big appointment would be deciding who gets the role of deputy prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards said there were three likely options.</p>
        
            <p>They included giving National's Nicola Willis the role and giving other ministerial porfolios to New Zealand First and ACT to make up for it.</p>
        
            <p>Other options were splitting the role between Peters and ACT's David Seymour - or giving the role to one of them for half the time and the role to the other for the remaining time.</p>
        
            <p>As a whole, the liklihood of all three parties going into Cabinet together was a "new innovation" and "quite a significant change for MMP", Edwards said.</p>
