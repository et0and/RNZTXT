            <p>Police say they will crack down on spectators as well as dangerous drivers, ahead of an expected event on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Ashley Gurney said police believed an event planned for the Manawatū area this weekend would be a "gathering of antisocial vehicle users", and police were collecting information about it and boosting the numbers of officers on duty.</p>
        
            <p>"Disruption on the roads would not be tolerated," Gurney said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said some drivers taking part in illegal car meets went through a large number of tyres, which were often bought used.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask people or organisations to come forward and report suspicious purchases or requests," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the community is fed up with this behaviour. We want to reassure you; your concerns are heard, we will be present, and we will take enforcement action in the form of seizing vehicles, issuing infringements, charging drivers, and/or ordering vehicles off the road where offending is identified.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have a message for the people that come to watch these events - we will be firm in enforcement action against spectators and others who enable the driving behaviour seen at these events."</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend, officers went to Feilding, Palmerston North and Sanson "where a large number of antisocial road users had gathered", and police issued four infringements for speeding, one for drunk driving and one for a broken headlight.</p>
        
            <p>Gurney said in cases where action could not be taken by police on the night, officers would note down information and follow it up later. This week that led to the seizure of a car they believed belonged to "a suspected lead driver" of the gathering last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>They asked anyone who sees illegal activities to call 111 if it is happening at the time. Or if the report is being made after the event, to contact police by calling 105 - "with as much information as possible, including photos and video if it is safe to do so from your vehicle".</p>
