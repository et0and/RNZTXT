            <p>Day two of the Paris Olympics is chocka with strong New Zealand contenders in swimming, rugby sevens and sailing.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will be bringing you live coverage throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington swimmer Lewis Clareburt came sixth-equal in the heats for the 400m individual medley at 9.15pm, putting him into the final which is at 6.30am Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather took second place at this year's swimming world championships in Doha in the 200m freestyle, so she is a strong competitor for the heats for the same event on Sunday night (and hopefully the semifinal at 8am Monday).</p>
