            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is speaking to the New Zealand China Council in Auckland .</p>
        
            <p>It comes after lawyers for former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr wrote to Peters informing him they intend to launch legal action against him.</p>
        
            <p>It also follows another speech earlier this week, where Peters said New Zealand was a long way from deciding on whether to join the AUKUS security alliance after criticism from the opposition.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' speech this morning covered New Zealand's relationship with China. He also took questions from media following the speech, including on the legal drama.</p>
