            <p>At a rally in the grounds of Parliament, Bishop Brian Tamaki said "we have to stand on the right side of history and standing with Israel is right".</p>
        
            <p>Bishop Tamaki and members of Destiny Church have organised the rally as an expression of support for Israel.</p>
        
            <p>During the rally Tamaki will present his petition to Members of Parliament that calls for the Hamas and Hezbollah organisations to be declared as terrorist organisations and for any MPs who support them to be expelled from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released beforehand, Tamaki said there was no place in New Zealand for "Palestine/ Hamas sympathisers" or for anti-Semitic behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "shameful" to see Green MPs wearing keffiyeh (scarves) in Parliament on Tuesday and "embarrassing" Te Pāti/ Māori wanted the Israeli ambassador to New Zealand expelled from the country.</p>
        
            <p>He also accused Prime Minister Christopher Luxon of being weak by calling for a ceasefire in the Israel/ Hamas conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki will also lead a prayer for peace in the Middle East and unity across the country as the new government takes office.</p>
        
            <p>Police said officers would be present at the protest to keep the peace and ensure people's safety.</p>
        
            <p>About 250 people arrived early for the rally.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, several hundred Palestinian supporters gathered on the corner of Lambton Quay and Whitmore Street, holding Palestinian flags and chanting.</p>
        
            <p>The group are holding Palestinian flags and signs - some of which say 'Aroha not hōhā, ceasefire now and toot for Gaza'.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there were no road closures or cordons planned, but they would be monitoring the event as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>They said they had advised organisers on how to protest safely and legally.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said the counter-protest had been peaceful although a couple of people going past with Israel flags were met with a rousing chant to free Palestine, while vehicles going past have been tooted their support.</p>
        
            <p>The counter-protest ended with a karakia and organisers urged everyone to leave in groups for safety.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, RNZ reported Foreign Minister Winston Peters is expected, later today, to call on all parties involved in the Gaza conflict to "take urgent steps towards establishing a ceasefire".</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's agenda for this afternoon states that Peters will ask Parliament to express grave concern at the ongoing violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
        
            <p>He will also "unequivocally condemn" the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October and call for the release of all hostages.</p>
        
            <p>Peters will also move that Parliament recognises Israel's right to defend itself acting in accordance with international law and that all civilians be protected from armed conflict.</p>
        
            <p>He had released a statement last Friday saying New Zealand was calling for all countries with influence in the region to work urgently towards a long-term ceasefire, but today's move will set that down on the Parliamentary record and allow the political parties to debate it.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
