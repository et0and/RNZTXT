            <p>A decision on if seven emergency housing motels will operate in Rotorua past December is weeks away.</p>
        
            <p>Independent commissioner David Hill spent the last three days in Rotorua hearing whether the government should be able to extend emergency housing motel consents by a year.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development applied in June to extend seven consents, and the commissioner expected the hearing to be closed by 25 November, once he received all updated information.</p>
        
            <p>He aimed to have a decision before the current consents expired on 15 December.</p>
        
            <p>The original consents were granted in 2022, for 13 motels.</p>
        
            <p>Hill heard over the three days how the ministry believed the consents should be granted, how Rotorua Lakes Council agreed with strict conditions, and most submitters wanted either all, or specific consents, to be denied.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to how motel residents were impacting neighbouring residents, iwi and businesses - key themes of the hearing revolved around how the ministry planned to exit the motels.</p>
        
            <p>While the ministry had confidence in its ability to close the motels by the end of next year, in part aided by the pipeline of Kāinga Ora housing, others were less confident, and there was a desire for specific timelines and closures - something the ministry opposed.</p>
        
            <p>In the council's right of reply, consultant planner Craig Batchelar said it still believed there was a need for contracted emergency housing for another year, with no suitable alternatives readily available now.</p>
        
            <p>Its opinion had not changed, overall.</p>
        
            <p>Batchelar noted the different views.</p>
        
            <p>"The degree of concern expressed by submitters opposing the applications is acknowledged, against a backdrop of poorly executed delivery of emergency housing policy for Rotorua motels, and consequences that have followed for many in the community over a number of years and transitioning out."</p>
        
            <p>He said the RMA was an inefficient framework for addressing complex social issues.</p>
        
            <p>Given the evidence from those in the Whakarewarewa area and the three motels close to each other impacting on the small community there, those motels should be prioritised to close first.</p>
        
            <p>While potential impacts were recognised in 2022, they were meant to be mitigated through motel conditions. Batchelar said these were not as effective as expected.</p>
        
            <p>These three motels were not taking new residents and would potentially close mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>The council's preference was for the Apollo Hotel consent not be approved.</p>

            <p>Reverting to non-consented motels used by residents with special needs grants would not be permitted under the district plan. There are currently two such motels.</p>
        
            <p>"I've confirmed with [the] council that a hard line has been drawn on this and that all hotel operators are on notice that regulatory requirements under the RMA and the Building Act must be admitted in all cases into the future."</p>
        
            <p>The council would provide specific recommendations for conditions, including site-specific.</p>
        
            <p>A condition that surrounding residents be able to meet in-person with emergency housing motel providers to discuss the level of engagement they were wanting was suggested.</p>
        
            <p>Another possible condition the applicant put forward was that it provide a quarterly report on its consents and exit strategy, to the community liaison group.</p>

            <p>The ministry's legal counsel Nick Whittington said the ministry was "well-aware" of the effects on the community and did not disregard them, but acknowledged the stress that came with process participation.</p>
        
            <p>He opposed the view that lobby group Restore Rotorua's legal counsel Mai Chen expressed, that the ministry approach was to shame members of the public against the consents.</p>
        
            <p>"That is absolutely not the case."</p>
        
            <p>Whittington said the commissioner was given different information and perspectives, and the ministry did not believe experts were the only voices or views worth listening to.</p>
        
            <p>He said it still believed flexibility was needed on its exit strategy, and did not support hard deadlines, given unknown factors that could influence housing need.</p>
        
            <p>Certain conditions suggested, such as age-appropriate placement in motels, could result in placement difficulties as it exited other motels.</p>
        
            <p>On submitters' evidence of seeing rough sleepers, he said this was evidence of unmet housing demand.</p>
        
            <p>All but one of the 37 submitters oppose the applications.</p>
        
            <p>Contracted emergency housing prioritises families/whānau with children, young people, and people with disabilities. It also can include kuia, kaumātua, and elderly individuals. It includes wrap-around support.</p>
