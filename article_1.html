            <p>Hundreds of people, including about 140 children, turned out for the blessing of the Featherston playground which now bears author Joy Cowley's name.</p>
        
            <p>The blessing on Friday morning included emotional speeches from Cowley and the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>It was also something of a farewell for the celebrated children's author, who will soon leave the town she has called home for the past 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"My heart is full. I don't have words big enough to tell you how I feel," Cowley told the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"I am so grateful to Matua Wiremu for the beautiful blessing that wraps us in a cloak of feeling. It was beautiful."</p>
        
            <p>Cowley said she will leave a part of herself in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"Within me there has always been a child, and that child has never aged. And I believe now that child is in this playground. And what a good place for a child to be.</p>
        
            <p>"So, when the old woman has gone, the child will remain here in Featherston children's playground."</p>
        
            <p>She said the feet of the children of tangata whenua from generations past would have blessed the land the playground is now on.</p>
        
            <p>"There is something very profound about that. Something that moves the heart, because we've got the past, the present and the future all together," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very special."</p>
        
            <p>The Featherston Community Board recommended the local playground be named after Cowley to acknowledge her substantial contribution to literature, especially children's literature, in the town and across the region.</p>
        
            <p>South Wairarapa District Council accepted the recommendation at a meeting in September.</p>
        
            <p>Cowley is also the patron of Featherston Booktown, an annual festival of arts and letters in the town attended by thousands.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Biggs, the chairperson of the organisation's Board of Trustees, spoke at the gathering. He shared several stories about Cowley.</p>
        
            <p>"Not just the person called Joy, but the feeling of joy. Because Joy is a name, it's a noun and it's an emotion," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All of these are contained in this wonderful person - Joy Cowley."</p>
        
            <p>He described and honoured Cowley's contribution to readers.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you, Joy, over your lifetime of writing and also - while you are living in this community - for giving us the gift of numerous lives. Joy has given this to children and adults of all ages through her many books.</p>
        
            <p>"And thank you Joy, for being an indefatigable champion of books, reading, writing, story making, and storytelling."</p>
        
            <p>He described Cowley as unpretentious and unassuming despite her many accomplishments.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for totally being just who you are. A wonderful host, a wonderful cook, happy to drink a glass or two or more of wine and have a long chat.</p>

            <p>The crowd of more than 220 included children from South Featherston, Featherston, and St Theresa's schools. The blessing was conducted by Matua Wiremu Dawson.</p>
        
            <p>School children sang waiata at the start of the ceremony, and ended the ceremony with a haka.</p>
        
            <p>South Wairarapa mayor Martin Connelly, Wairarapa MP Mike Butterick, and Wairarapa-based MP Kieran McAnulty also attended.</p>
        
            <p>Cowley's awards include the New Zealand Commemoration Medal, an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Massey University, and she is a three-time winner of overall book of the year at the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, she was made a member of the Order of New Zealand and in 2020, she received an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Award, limited to 20 living people.</p>
        
            <p>The author expects to leave Featherston for Dunedin later this month.</p>
