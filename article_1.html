            <p>Billed as Dame Lisa's toughest competition, fellow New Zealander Aimee FIsher finished in fourth in 1:49.91.</p>
        
            <p>Both Kiwis cruised through their semis, Fisher finishing in first in a time of 1:49:54, while Dame Lisa also comfortably won hers, one second faster than Fisher.</p>
        
            <p>The win takes the New Zealand medal tally to 16.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Sky Sport, Dame Lisa said she simply turned up, hoping to do her best.</p>
        
            <p>"I just turn up to do my best. I love the paddling, I love the journey, and I'm incredibly privileged," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Striving for excellence has given me a lot of growth over the last 12 years."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had been keeping an eye on Fisher, who had been paddling "incredibly well".</p>
        
            <p>"I always knew she was going to be a massive competitor, I just had to stick to my own game plan and trust my fitness and that's what I did."</p>
        
            <p>She said no matter the medal count, she was just happy to be at the Olympics with her team.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you put goals out there to try and win. It's more than the medals for us - to have my team here, no matter the result, we as a team have done amazing things together.</p>
        
            <p>"Thanks for the support at home, the pressure, the expectation, but to remember why I paddle is because I love it, so that's all I was trying to do today."</p>
        
            <p>Fisher told Sky Sport she was "so happy" for Dame Lisa.</p>
        
            <p>"She raced beautifully, and was magnificent out there."</p>
        
            <p>She said that she came into the race wanting to be unafraid.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of fear this morning first thing, a lot of emotions that came out, the pressure and the tension. But when I lined up, I wasn't afraid, I didn't panic.</p>
        
            <p>"I just tried to stick to my game plan one stroke at a time and it just wasn't enough today.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been through hell and back and I'm still standing, and I'm so sorry I couldn't get it done."</p>
