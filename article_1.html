            <p>Provisional figures show a significant reduction in the number of drownings last year.</p>
        
            <p>Water Safety New Zealand said there were 71 preventable drownings, down from 90 the year before and well below the 10-year average of 83.</p>
        
            <p>It said last year's total was the lowest since 2018 and the third lowest in nearly two decades.</p>
        
            <p>The holiday period just ended saw three drownings, down from an average of 10.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Daniel Gerrard said focusing on water survival skills for young people seems to be paying off.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been over a decade now that there's been a focus on basic aquatic skills, that ability to float.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just seeing the drowning rate drop in the school age children, but also now a lagging drop in those 15- to 24-year-olds, so really positive in that regard."</p>
        
            <p>Gerrard said rivers and beaches are the most hazardous environments.</p>
        
            <p>Gerrard said 83 percent of those who drowned in 2023 were men, and the figure shows little sign of improving.</p>
        
            <p>"The over-55 male is the highest water user, those that are out there in the environment the most, so they're putting themselves at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"These older guys just need to stop and have a little bit more of a think and a bit more planning, and in particular wearing lifejackets."</p>
        
            <p>Gerrard said teaching basic skills such as floating is one way of preventing drowning.</p>
        
            <p>Activities such as kai gathering, "taking a dip" or swimming, and slips and falls are still over-represented in the statistics, and Māori and Pasifika communities face persistent vulnerabilities, the report says.</p>
        
            <p>The report shows:</p>
