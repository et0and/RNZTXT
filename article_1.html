            <p>Police say they are responding to an incident in the Lower Hutt suburb of Taitā and say schools in the area have been locked down as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are in place on High Street and residents in the area have been asked to stay inside or avoid the area until the situation has been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>The Armed Offenders Squad is heading there, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A resident says the police told them a person had a weapon, according to RNZ's reporter at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter could be heard flying overhead in Avalon.</p>
        
            <p>A police traffic cordon was in place on High Street where the road intersects with Te Ara O Motutawa road.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses near the cordon said police had not explained what was happening but officers were on the road holding guns.</p>
        
            <p>One shop worker said traffic was being turned around and rerouted to avoid the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the situation was currently controlled and there was no threat to Naenae College which has gone into lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Schools which have confirmed they are in lockdown are Avalon Intermediate School, Naenae College and Naenae Intermediate.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kura o Kimi Ora is also in lockdown and has contacted parents to let them know not to collect their children.</p>
