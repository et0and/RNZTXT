        <h2>Luxon, Peters and Seymour to finally meet - at least, that's the plan</h2>
        <p>
It was a "risky business" to assume where Peters was "these days", said the ACT leader ahead of the three leaders' first meeting together Wednesday.

            <p>The leaders of National and ACT are on their way home to Auckland, where they will meet with New Zealand First leader Winston Peters on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The first meeting between all three is a significant step forward in their ongoing efforts to form the next government.</p>
        
            <p>National leader and incoming Prime Minister Chris Luxon and ACT leader David Seymour were in the capital on Tuesday, while Peters remained in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at Wellington Airport, Luxon told RNZ it had been a "good" day with "productive conversations".</p>
        
            <p>"We're making progress but there's more to do."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he had expected Peters to be in Wellington as well on Tuesday, Luxon said: "There were good, productive meetings at all levels and good intensive conversations - it's been great."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour was on the same flight out of Wellington, and told RNZ they had had "a couple of meetings with our colleagues in the Nats [National Party]" in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, we'd hope to meet with our colleagues in New Zealand First but they were in a different city, nonetheless, here we are."</p>
        
            <p>It was a "risky business" to assume where Peters was "these days", said Seymour, but he confirmed ACT would meet "with the Nats more tomorrow in Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>He was reluctant to go into any details about whether the meeting would include New Zealand First: "We'll have a meeting, and the location… we'll see."</p>
        
            <p>There were "a series of further meetings booked to, again, just keep sharpening those pencils, improving that agreement so we get the best agreement and the fastest agreement possible".</p>
        
            <p>"Let me just say it's in a secure but undisclosed location, and that's not trying to be tricky - it's just that we really do want to get this done as quickly as possible."</p>

            <p>Peters had "not given a reason" for not coming to Wellington on Tuesday, "but there could be many reasons that I think we should leave to him", he said.</p>
        
            <p>In Peters' absence, Seymour said there had been "a lot of good work".</p>
        
            <p>"We've continued to work through with National on areas of agreement and disagreement. We want a solid, public policy-heavy agreement because the challenges New Zealand is facing are large.</p>
        
            <p>"And the government's response is going to have to be nimble, detailed and decisive, and that's what we're working towards."</p>
        
            <p>Today marked a month from the general election, and Seymour acknowledged "everyone, everywhere wants everything all the time to be better and faster, there's no question about that".</p>
        
            <p>"All I can say is I think ACT has been first up and ready to deal with whomever; we've reached out first and we've been engaging first in order to get to the result that we want and I think we've played a good role in it so far."</p>
        
            <p>Asked how far negotiations had progressed, Seymour said "there are areas where we're certainly, I guess you could say, dotting the i's, there's areas… of substance that we still have to work out".</p>
        
            <p>"But what's important is that we are not going to get the fastest agreement, but we're going to get the best agreement - and I think that's an important distinction."</p>
        
            <p>All of his dealings with Peters had "actually been very professional", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's all I can say. Obviously it's helpful to be in the same city but there's clearly been some miscommunication there and I'll leave it to him to explain his location."</p>

            <p>Seymour said he'd been in Wellington "primarily" to meet with National and "thought [Peters] would be here too".</p>
        
            <p>A potential threesome in the capital had turned into a twosome today, but Seymour joked it "could be worse - we could be in a foursome, but at least that'd be good for playing golf".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands Peters was presented with a proposal by National at the end of last week, but found it unacceptable - so meetings and calls with both of the other leaders continued over the weekend and throughout Tuesday.</p>
