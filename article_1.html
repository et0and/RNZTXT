            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Health Minister Shane Reti are answering questions from reporters ahead of getting their annual flu vaccinations.</p>
        
            <p>With the pair in Auckland, the usual Cabinet meeting for the week was held online this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is expected to speak from about 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the release of the coalition's 36-point action plan for its second quarter, due for completion by 30 June, which includes a mix of concrete tasks and more ambiguous easily achieved objectives.</p>
        
            <p>While 100-day plans have been utilised by numerous former governments, the notion of an ongoing public quarterly programme is much less common but in keeping with Luxon's self-professed CEO-style.</p>
