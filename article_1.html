            <p>One of Donald Trump's lawyers has told the BBC "nothing will change" his fight for the White House - despite being convicted following an historic trial in New York.</p>
        
            <p>Jurors found Trump guilty on Thursday of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Trump became the first US president to be convicted of a crime, but he has said the trial was rigged and the prosecution was politically orchestrated.</p>
        
            <p>Alina Habba has told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the former president is a "victim of political, selective prosecution".</p>
        
            <p>Following the seven-week trial at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>
        
            <p>Trump will be sentenced on 11 July. However, he confirmed he will be appealing against his criminal convictions.</p>
        
            <p>Habba, 40, sat alongside Trump during the trial and said even if jailed, Trump will still stand in the US presidential election in November.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen some corruption in this country that frankly has never seen before in our judicial system," Habba told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very real, it is not posturing by any means, it is 100 percent problem that this country is going to have to handle and get a grapple on in November.</p>
        
            <p>"He is running for president, nothing will change there.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that need him in this countryâ€¦ that's more important than anything anybody else thinks.</p>
        
            <p>"Our people are speaking loudly, donating, they are small donors, and they are standing up, because they are afraid, because we cannot have this happen to us."</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Donald Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to payments made to Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign</p>
        
            <p>In remarks at Trump Tower in New York on Friday, Trump spoke for more than 30 minutes and angrily attacked his political opponents, the jury and the judge in his case.</p>

            <p>He called Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over his trial, a "tyrant" and claimed that he "literally crucified" witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>In response, President Joe Biden's campaign described Trump as unhinged and thirsting for revenge.</p>
        
            <p>"That's how the American system of justice works," Biden said, adding it was "reckless" and "irresponsible" for anyone to the trial was rigged.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's unprecedented conviction has entrenched bitter divisions in the US, in the run-up to November's vote.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors successfully laid out a case Trump was afraid Daniels would fatally harm his 2016 presidential campaign by going public with an alleged sexual encounter, prompting him to pay her - then illegally hide the transaction.</p>
        
            <p>Trump denied these allegations.</p>
        
            <p>Daniels herself gave evidence. In another development since the convictions, her lawyer told ABC News Daniels wore a bulletproof vest when she went to the New York courthouse.</p>
        
            <p>Clark Brewster said: "It's so vicious and threatening and so I think from the standpoint of just the fear of what somebody might do," he said of the atmosphere for Daniels.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really fear."</p>
        
            <p>Previously, Daniels's husband, Barrett Blade, told CNN she felt "a little vindicated".</p>
        
            <p>Blade added that despite the trial ending and bringing some relief, the stress was far from over.</p>
        
            <p>"It brings another weight upon her shoulders of what happens next," Blade said.</p>
        
            <p>"We take it day by day."</p>
