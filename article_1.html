            <p>A South Auckland business will pay a multimillion-dollar settlement for a workplace death in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Jamey Bowring, 24, was killed when a tank exploded at a hazardous substance company in Wiri.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court in Auckland on Monday ordered Salters Cartage Limited and its owner, Ronald Salter, to forfeit $4 million.</p>
        
            <p>The decision came after the commissioner of police made an application for civil forfeiture under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act (CPRA).</p>
        
            <p>A seven-week trial was set to begin last week, however parties involved instead entered into settlement discussions.</p>
        
            <p>The court agreed with police that Salter and his business financially benefited from failing to comply with requirements for handling dangerous substances and ensuring workers' safety.</p>
        
            <p>Bowring's mother Sarah Ferguson said Salter minimised his role in the events that led to her son's death.</p>
        
            <p>"This case was so much more than someone getting some paperwork wrong. His behaviour leading up to and since that day has been beyond unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"Greed cannot come before safety."</p>

            <p>Police Detective Inspector Lloyd Schmid said he was aware of businesses' concerns about the application of civil forfeiture for workplace health and safety offences.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have no intent to use the CRPA routinely for offences against the Health and Safety at Work Act.</p>
        
            <p>"This case, largely brought on the basis of breaches of regulations relating to hazardous substances, had some unique features and aggravating circumstances, including the tragic death of a young man.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will however consider any future cases on a case-by-case basis."</p>
