        <h2>David Nyika ready for world title fight against Jai Opetaia</h2>
        <p>
The two familiar foes will go head-to-head in a salivating trans-Tasman title fight.

            <p>Everything was in order ahead of David Nyika's Friday night sell-out at the Gatton Shire Hall, until Noel Thornberry called the caterer.</p>
        
            <p>Alarm bells rang when there was an awkward silence at the other end of the line.</p>
        
            <p>The chef eventually admitted to Nyika's trainer, manager and promoter that he thought the fight was on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Thornberry has seen it all in a lifetime around boxing, so there was no panic.</p>
        
            <p>Hours later, the beef cheeks were served tender, like Waikato Falefehi's ribs after Nyika had finished him inside two rounds to move to 7-0.</p>
        
            <p>If all goes to plan for Nyika on Wednesday, the 600 who had gathered in Gatton last July will be able to say they were there that night watching a future world champion.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old, now 10-0, will fight IBF and The Ring cruiserweight strap holder Jai Opetaia (26-0) on the Gold Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Injury to mandatory challenger Huseyin Cinkara opened the door for Nyika to take the fight on three weeks' notice and bring to life a salivating trans-Tasman title fight between two familiar foes.</p>
        
            <p>But Thornberry has been anticipating the moment ever since he took charge of the Tokyo Games bronze medallist, two-time Commonwealth Games champion and New Zealand's Olympic flag-bearer three years ago.</p>

            <p>"Here we were struggling to get an opponent to fight on the card at all, now we are in the main event in the other corner," Thornberry said.</p>
        
            <p>"Opportunity sometimes doesn't knock twice, but somebody like David will always create opportunities and he seizes on them.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the years, we've missed a lot of opportunities with guys not keeping themselves in the shape they should be.</p>
        
            <p>"Dave's not that guy. He's always ready to go and is the most professional athlete I've had anything to do with."</p>
        
            <p>Nyika chose to move to Gatton to train with Thornberry.</p>
        
            <p>He will now be the fourth boxer out of Thornberry's humble backyard boxing gym to fight for a world title - heavyweight Alex Leapai's clash with Wladimir Klitschko 11 years ago, the most notable.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, Thornberry has got creative to keep Nyika active, his Gatton headliner and all of its moving parts just another night at the office.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm used to being in a state of chaos, doing everything," he laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was younger I trained, managed and promoted myself.</p>
        
            <p>"I was the promoter on the night, plus fighting the main event, so this is a cakewalk for me."</p>

            <p>Nyika has embraced his quiet Gatton existence, mowing lawns and building chicken coops in his backyard.</p>
        
            <p>Locals are now familiar with the chiselled torso regularly spotted pounding the pavement of the regional Queensland town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really lucky we found each other: he's never really had anybody that just focused on him, as good as he was," Thornberry said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very bright, has opinions and I always listen. If he was a prima donna, I wouldn't be interested."</p>
        
            <p>They would have liked at least eight weeks to prepare for the man regarded as the best cruiserweight since Oleksandr Usyk, but Thornberry is still quietly confident.</p>
        
            <p>"I rang Dave at 8.30 on the Saturday morning and told him we'd been offered the fight," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He said to me, 'Noel, I'm hot right now, let's take it'.</p>
        
            <p>"Just one sentence, not an ounce of hesitation in his voice. He's been on the world stage since he was 18 (winning Commonwealth gold). He fought on the first Usyk-Fury undercard. That's why I don't think that this is as daunting a proposition as some may think.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been on the big stage and he's revelled in it."</p>
