            <p>A student who used a pair of scissors to assault two teachers at a Christchurch school on Wednesday has been suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating the attack after they were called to Haeata Community Campus in the suburb of Aranui just before 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>The assault happened in the primary section of the school, and involved a student under the age of 16, and was witnessed by a number of staff and students.</p>
        
            <p>One teacher was cut on the palm of their hand and another received head injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The teachers were treated for their injuries and were on leave for at least the rest of the week.</p>
        
            <p>They did not require hospitalisation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Thursday, principal Dr Peggy Burrows said a full investigation was under way with a report expected to be presented to the school board early next week.</p>
        
            <p>"The incident has triggered the suspension of the student involved," Dr Burrows said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Burrows said she was satisfied the student's behaviour met the threshold of "gross misconduct that is a harmful or dangerous example to other students at Haeata Community Campus".</p>
        
            <p>"The ākonga/student involved is now required to attend a Board suspension meeting next week.</p>
        
            <p>"The ākonga/student will not be permitted to attend school until the Board has met to discuss their suspension."</p>
        
            <p>The board would then consider its options, including lifting the suspension, extending the suspension with conditions, or excluding the student.</p>
        
            <p>"The members of staff affected by this assault received medical attention and remain at home on Board funded paid leave until they feel able to return.</p>
        
            <p>"The ākonga/student involved and their whānau are being supported by the kura/school and whānau as is required under the kura's Health, Safety, and Welfare Policy."</p>
