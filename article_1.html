Possums "crave" the "delicious, high-calorie" bait.

            <p>A possum control project in Taranaki is using "delicious, high-calorie" mayo to lure possums to a photo opportunity, so the pest's movements can be monitored.</p>
        
            <p>Towards Predator-Free Taranaki has eradicated 3500 possums between the Timaru Stream and the Hangatāhua (Stony) River since 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Regional council programme lead Nick Heslop said the original farmland area between the Timaru and Oākura River had no resident possum population for more than three years.</p>
        
            <p>"We are down to chasing individual possums now. There are so few it's at the point we are starting to name them."</p>
        
            <p>Heslop said eradication work continued with the aid of cameras, scat detection dogs and targeted trapping, but attention had now turned to the design and creation of a 3km barrier stretching across private farmland southeast of the Kaitake Range.</p>
        
            <p>As part of that, self-reporting cameras were being installed on trees, which point at an automatic lure dispenser that squirts a small amount of mayonnaise each evening.</p>

            <p>"Mayonnaise is delicious and high in calories, which possums crave in winter. Trials show it's a highly effective lure."</p>
        
            <p>When movement was detected, the cameras took a photo which was reviewed remotely.</p>
        
            <p>Heslop said the initial goal was to determine how many cameras were needed to detect and then remove possums trying to re-enter the cleared area. The lessons learnt would inform future operations both in Taranaki and around the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to understand the density and movement of possums and get a clear picture of what is happening at that edge of the zone. We know how to remove those possums and will do it eventually, but for now gaining knowledge on how to keep them out is just as important.</p>
        
            <p>"We were the first in New Zealand to attempt possum elimination on farmland at such a large scale (the total area is 9500ha), so sharing what we are learning is important and one of the reasons we receive funding from Predator Free 2050."</p>
        
            <p>Self-setting traps were also being strategically deployed along the barrier.</p>
        
            <p>"The new barrier will in time become our main incursion response tool, with intruder possums tracked and removed, as we are currently doing in the main zero possum area."</p>
        
            <p>Heslop said landowners had been supportive, allowing the team to set up cameras and return to track down possums or maintain equipment, although work had slowed recently as farmers focused on calving.</p>
        
            <p>The barrier should be complete by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>Zero Possum project lead Cody Luckin, who grew up near Ōkato and still lived within the Zero Possum zone, said the project was special for him.</p>
        
            <p>"I applied for this job because I am from here, I went to school here, my family farms here and I am really passionate about this area. I want to see my home possum-free so to be part of what is happening here is really rewarding."</p>
        
            <p>He said the project's success so far showed what was possible.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe one day we could do the whole Taranaki ring plain - from river to river. How cool would that be?"</p>
        
            <p>A Towards Predator-Free Taranaki Zero Possum opening evening will be held at Butlers Reef, Oākura on Thursday 5 September between 5.30pm and 7.30pm. It will include a possum dog demonstration, possum and rural mustelid project updates, spot prizes and more.</p>
