            <p>A body has been found after a boat capsized on the Riverton bar on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police Southland area commander Inspector Mike Bowman said they located the person in the water on Saturday night during a final rescue helicopter sweep of the area.</p>
        
            <p>Two people out of five who were on the boat were recovered alive. One is in Southland Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a heart-wrenching incident, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the whƒÅnau of those involved, who are being supported," Bowman said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to commend all staff involved in this incident, they responded swiftly and brought all five people home.</p>
        
            <p>"While this was not the result we were hoping for, we are pleased to have been able to recover two of the occupants alive and be able to play our part in returning the deceased to their loved ones."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to police, Coastguard staff from Riverton and Bluff, Hato Hone St John, Fire and Emergency New Zealand and Search and Rescue volunteers were involved in the search.</p>
