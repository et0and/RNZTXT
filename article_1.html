            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia's youngest child and only daughter has been announced as the new monarch of the Kiingitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Kuini Nga wai hono i te po is the eighth Māori monarch and the second woman. The first woman to hold the position was Kiingi Tuheitia's mother, Te Atairangikaahu, who died in 2006. And at 27, Kuini Nga wai hono i te po is also the second-youngest Māori monarch to be appointed.</p>
        
            <p>Kuini Nga wai hono i te po had been favored to ascend the throne, although the selection was not a foregone conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>The late King also has two sons - Te Ariki Tamaaroa Whatumoana Paki and Te Ariki Turuki Korotangi Paki.</p>
        
            <p>Whatumoana Paki, the eldest son, served by his father's side early on, but daughter Ngawai Hono i Te Po has become more well-known in recent years accompanying the king on official engagements.</p>

            <p>His youngest son, Korotangi, runs a successful Tā Moko business, named Korotangi Art. In 2016, Korotangi donated his kidney to his father, Kiingi Tuheitia for a kidney transplant.</p>
        
            <p>Tekau maa-rua - the 12 - is the Kiingitanga council made up of 12 representatives from iwi across the motu. The have played a key role in deciding the new monarch, alongside other rangatira, leaders, from around the country. The council has been in wānanga over the last few days coming to this final decision.</p>
        
            <p>It is not known whether the King indicated a preference before he died as to who he wished to take his place.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, Kuini Nga wai hono i te po was appointed to the Waitangi National Trust, to represent Māori living in the North Island south of Tāmaki Makaurau. That seat has been previously held by King Koroki, Sir Hepi te Heuheu, her grandmother Dame Te Atairangikaahu the last Māori queen, and most recently by Sir Tumu te Heuheu.</p>
        
            <p>Kuini Nga wai hono i te po studied a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Waikato, followed by a Masters Degree in Tikanga Māori. During university she taught Kapa Haka.</p>
        
            <p>She was part of kapa haka rōpū Ngaa Pou o Taniwharau, which both of her parents also performed with. Her first taste on the stage at Te Matatini was in 2013 when she was invited to join her tutors on stage in the senior competition.</p>
        
            <p>She was named by her grandmother, the late Te Atairangikaahu, who was told of the birth when she was at a meeting at night near Parikino.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, to celebrate Kiingi Tuheitia's 10th year leading the Kiingitanga movement, Kuini Nga wai hono i te po received her moko kauae alongside her mother, Atawhai and former Labour MP and cousin Nanaia Mahuta.</p>

            <p>Although the role of Māori monarch is not automatically inherited or hereditary, all of the current kings and queens, starting with Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, the first monarch, and ending with Tuheitia, are direct descendants of their predecessors. It was possible that the role could have been handed to someone from another whānau, or even iwi.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia's two sons have also had important roles and have previously been considered possible successors.</p>
        
            <p>For much of 2013, Kiingi Tuheitia was unwell with diabetes and cancer. In 2014, he suffered a heart attack, and spent time in Waikato Hospital. During his period of illness, his eldest son Te Ariki Tamaaroa Whatumoana assumed the role of Te Whirinaki a te Kiingi, to speak on his behalf.</p>
        
            <p>A King's Council, Te Kaunihera a Te Kiingi was created to help guide Whatumoana Paki, who was just 22 at the time, while he acted for his father and took over his duties. Whatumoana Paki was a close confidant of his grandmother, even learning of his father's succession before he did.</p>
        
            <p>Whatumoana has long been prepared to succeed his father but ultimately Kuini Nga wai hono i te po was chosen.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia himself did not expect to be the next King.</p>
