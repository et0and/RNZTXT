            <p>The All Blacks have stuck with the tried and tested for Saturday's clash with England at Eden Park. Scott Robertson has only made one change to his team that won 16-15 in the first test in Dunedin, replacing injured halfback TJ Perenara with Finlay Christie.</p>
        
            <p>That also means Cortez Ratima comes onto the bench for a possible test debut.</p>
        
            <p>It will Christie's third start in a 22-test career, with the last time being a 50-minute stint in last year's 23-20 Bledisloe Cup win over the Wallabies in Dunedin. Christie played the entire second half in last weekend's tense first test, after Perenara suffered a knee injury.</p>

            <p>Despite some chatter about Beauden Barrett coming into the starting line-up, Robertson has stuck with Stephen Perofeta after his assured performance at fullback.</p>
        
            <p>Jordie Barrett and Rieko Ioane will be looking for a bit more room in the midfield after being smothered by the English defence, however the appointment of the more familiar Australian Nik Berry may see a tighter application of the offside law.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie will clearly be mindful of how long he's taking to shoot at goal but is probably more interested in how much space he can get as well, while in front of him the pack predictably stays the same.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Borthwick names his England side later this afternoon. The English have not won at Eden Park for 51 years, the All Blacks have not lost there for 30.</p>
