            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Health Minister Shane Reti are announcing "five major health targets" to cap off the government's100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are speaking at WhangƒÅrei Hospital after a visit to the radiation oncology facility there.</p>
        
            <p>The 100-day plan , unveiled in November, broadly specified two of the targets would include "wait times", and "cancer treatment", but Friday's announcement should outline the other three - and detail what specifically is being aimed for.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon confirmed months ago the deadline for the plan was to be 8 March, and has been confident the government had achieved all 49 actions - though questions could be raised about some of these.</p>
        
            <p>"We told you what we're gonna do, we've done it, and now we're telling you what we've done," Luxon said of the plan on Thursday, as he unveiled the government's fast-track legislation alongside three other ministers.</p>
