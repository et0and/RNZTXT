            <p>A spelling mistake at a West Auckland bus stop has been driving locals round the bend.</p>
        
            <p>The bright yellow letters painted on Te Atatū Road spelled "bus sotp."</p>
        
            <p>Pedestrians stopped for pictures with the suburb's latest tourist attraction, and resident Shane Callahan reckoned the letters had a deeper meaning.</p>
        
            <p>"You know what I think that stands for? 'Stops on Te Atatū Peninsula'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Callahan had seen pictures on the local Facebook group and had journeyed to see it in person.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought 'oh, someone's done a Photoshop, nobody could be that dumb,' but it's there," he said. "I've seen it myself."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Auckland Transport said it was made aware of the mistake on Tuesday and would have the bus stop re-painted at the contractor's expense with no cost to AT or ratepayers. It has since been fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Business owner Gloria Halloran said it was an embarrassment.</p>
        
            <p>"We all went out and had a look, and sure enough it's spelled S-O-T-P," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We think it's an absolute joke. With the amount of money they spend you'd think they would have a stencil that says 'stop'."</p>
        
            <p>Other residents weren't sure whether to laugh or cry.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think they need to be a bit more onto it, especially here... 'sotp'," one mother said.</p>
        
            <p>"After all the work they've done it's a shame, but it's a bit of fun while it lasts," said a shopper.</p>
        
            <p>"They had to mark out the O and the T and the P... I don't know how this happened," another said.</p>

            <p>A local teacher said it was a learning opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hilarious, they should have gone to school and stayed there," she laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"Make sure you sit your spelling tests at school, don't skip them, and make sure you practice every night... signed every school teacher."</p>
        
            <p>said the mistake needed to be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they should change it because it'll make them look like idiots," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To actually spell it wrong like they did... it's so funny. Everyone around here is having a good laugh."</p>
        
            <p>Waitākere Ward Councillor Shane Henderson said as funny as it was, the sign needed to be re-painted to keep the road safe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got to be very clear what it is. It's really outside of the standards of a modern city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no idea how they made that mistake in the first place, it's a really weird one."</p>
