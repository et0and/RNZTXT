            <p>Politicians have spoken at Tuurangawaewae Marae as they pay their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of mourners have been gathering to pay their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII this week, with the people of Tainui epitomising the Māori value of Manaakitanga - or hospitality - during the tangihanga.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on behalf of the coalition government, NZ First's Shane Jones said Kiingi Tuheitia devoted his life to making sure te ao Māori was heard and valued and if anyone was able to unite a country divided, he was the one that had the ability to do so.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said they came today to share in the pain and love of Kiingi Tuheitia's grieving family.</p>
        
            <p>"We look at the people from all over the world who have come to show love and respect and come to share memories for the King Tuheitia Pootatau te Wherowhero te tu e Whitu. Go into the long sleep of death and sleep in the comforting arms of your ancestors, your land and your king."</p>
        
            <p>Speaker of the House Gerry Brownlee said Kiingi Tuheitia had been in the thoughts and prayers of those in Parliament since they heard of his passing, and "I can't fully express my own sadness at hearing that".</p>
        
            <p>Brownlee said he was struck by the words there is enough room in the waka for all, and he hopes that from the mighty tōtara that had fallen, "with a place for all of us".</p>
        
            <p>"And that we might remember with that simple analogy that he put to us that no waka moves forward without all the paddles going in the same direction."</p>
