            <p>Chaos has hit tonight's Taylor Swift concert at Sydney's Olympic Park with thousands of fans being evacuated after lightning strikes near the venue.</p>
        
            <p>Fans have also been notified that the start time for Taylor's Swift's first of four sold-out shows in the Harbour City has been delayed.</p>
        
            <p>"The floor and lower bowl are currently being evacuated due to lightning strikes nearby the stadium," organisers posted on The Eras Tour page on X, formerly Twitter.</p>
        
            <p>"Please stay safe, sheltered and follow venue screens until further notice."</p>
        
            <p>Fans inside the venue have told the ABC that no one was being allowed to enter rows one to 20.</p>
        
            <p>Numerous bands of storms were visible on radar sweeping across Sydney early in the evening, and further storms are predicted later tonight.</p>
        
            <p>A force of sequins as far as the eye could see is still swarming its way to the stadium from the nearby train station, car parks and drop-off points.</p>
        
            <p>Some thanked the bemused bus drivers who got them there by gifting them a bracelet, which are beaded with lyrics from Taylor Swift songs, or in-jokes between fans.</p>
        
            <p>The NSW Police are also getting in on the act, trading bracelets with fans and complimenting them on their outfits.</p>
        
            <p>The number 13, Swift's favourite, adorns the hands of many of her fans along with colourful friendship bracelets up to their elbows.</p>
        
            <p>Swift's songs are known for creating girlhood amongst adolescent fans, but people of all ages have turned out to see their idol.</p>
        
            <p>Workers on the streets surrounding the precinct, blasted the multi-Grammy award winner's hits, as did a live acoustic band.</p>
        
            <p>Top on her fans' minds is tonight's set list - what will be her opening numbers? And more importantly, what will be her surprise songs?</p>
        
            <p>Brisbane Swiftie, Sam L'Lachi was lucky enough to see the Melbourne show, but said he could not wait for tonight.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very excited, I haven't seen her before The Eras Tour, I'm definitely excited to see her," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely looking forward to the secret songs, I don't know what they'll be but I'm grateful for whatever I get."</p>
        
            <p>Another fan in a Reputation outfit has seen Swift six times before, but said this was a massive moment for her.</p>
        
            <p>"She means everything to me ... I've grown up with her," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My whole life happened at the same time as hers."</p>
