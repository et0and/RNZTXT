            <p>Westland's mayor Helen Lash says the region has fared exceptionally well overnight and avoided the worst of the deluge.</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency has been lifted and a red heavy rain warning has expired.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very very fortunate because if we'd had the intensities for the length of time it was forecasted, we would be having a totally different conversation right now," Lash said.</p>
        
            <p>The original forecast was for some areas to receive up to 49 millimetres an hour overnight and while the rain fell, it was spread over a longer period, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, rivers were beginning to fall and Lash said the slips that had been found were minor and were being cleaned up.</p>
        
            <p>Nobody was evacuated overnight despite communities opening their halls ready to welcome anybody in need, Lash said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything worked like a well-oiled machine, I couldn't be more pleased with how everything worked."</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 6 between Haast and Hokitika has now reopened following the two-day deluge.</p>
        
            <p>Read how the situation unfolded this morning:</p>
