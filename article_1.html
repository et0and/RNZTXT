            <p>A man who died of a gunshot wound on the Coromandel Peninsula on Friday has been described as a "loveable ratbag" and father of five boys.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Mark Mabbott died about 2pm at Waiau on The 309 Road, and another man was airlifted to Auckland City Hospital with a gunshot wound. Police said the latter remained in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>A third man was taken into custody later that afternoon, and on Saturday the 77-year-old was charged with murder and attempted murder.</p>
        
            <p>Mabbott's mother Jane Mabbott posted on Facebook on Sunday announcing the 41-year-old's funeral details, which were to include a private cremation on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"With a heavy heart we announce the passing of our beloved Kevin Mabbott. He will be arriving home on Monday morning, we are keeping this day and Tuesday for family only."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, she wrote: "Rest in peace and love our son. We are all broken. Your two sisters, numerous cousins, aunties, uncles, friends and five sons.</p>
        
            <p>"A needless end to your vibrant lovable crazy ratbag free-spirited self."</p>
        
            <p>She invited anyone who wanted to pay their respects to Mabbott to do so on Wednesday from 9am to 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be an informal gathering to share and celebrate his life. He will be taken for a private cremation afterwards. Everyone is welcome to stay for a kai, coffee or beer."</p>

            <p>A man who rushed to Mabbott's aid and performed CPR said he had been at work serving children ice cream on The 309 Road - southeast of Coromandel town - when someone ran in and reported hearing gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>The former army medic, who did not want to be named, grabbed his first aid kit and went to Mabbott. He said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>
        
            <p>A second man, thought to be in his late 20s, was airlifted by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter to hospital in Auckland where he remained.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the accused man was taken into custody about 4pm and charged overnight.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in the Hamilton District Court on Saturday morning and was remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who had interim name suppression, was due to appear in the High Court at Hamilton on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mabbott's mother was a Whangamatā photographer and well-known in the local community, according to a post on Our Place Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
