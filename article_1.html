        <h2>Ministry of Education job cuts may affect school lunch programme</h2>
        <p>
There is concern the team delivering the programme could be halved, while RNZ has also been told it will be "decimated".

            <p>Job cut proposals at the Ministry of Education are affecting those who work in the school lunch programme, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet clear how many roles this could include in the Ka Ora Ka Ako programme, but it could involve close to half of the positions in a team which works on the lunch programme and also in the period products programme in schools.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood this team is made up of contractors and some staff roles.</p>
        
            <p>The free school lunch programme was introduced in 2019 by the previous Labour government, and currently offers meals to 230,000 students in about 1000 disadvantaged schools.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour has previously confirmed the programme itself is under review and is likely to be cut in the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Jobs being disestablished are understood to include nutritionists, those who monitor and evaluate the programme, sustainability and waste, and people who work in regional branches of the team.</p>
        
            <p>One person, who RNZ has agreed not to name, works on the school lunch programme at the ministry and was told their role was being considered for redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>They said they had concerns about whether the programme could continue to be effective with the number of jobs being cut.</p>
        
            <p>Another person close to the matter said the team was set to be "decimated".</p>
        
            <p>Health Aotearoa Coalition co-chairperson Boyd Swinburn said he had also been contacted by someone working on the programme saying their job was expected to be cut.</p>
        
            <p>Swinburn said ministry staff who oversaw the programme were vital to help delivering it, and he did not classify them as "back office roles".</p>
        
            <p>"These people are often characterised as back office in a very derogatory way as if the jobs they do have no value.</p>
        
            <p>"But of course they are incredibly important to the whole programme. I mean they do all of the contracting with the suppliers, they do all the monitoring, all the reporting, they support the schools, they support the suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>"So these are actually really important jobs and I think the whole programme would struggle if there are big cuts with these support people."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he was not involved in the detail of the ministry's restructuring process, but he was confident the programme could deliver the same quality with fewer people.</p>
        
            <p>"We are delivering right across government with less cost and often fewer people working on it than had been required under the previous government. So I believe it will have no effect on the quality of what we deliver."</p>
        
            <p>When pressed how the cuts would affect the programme, Seymour said: "It is possible to get more for the people who are paying the bill, the taxpayers of New Zealand - the people receiving the services - with fewer people in the Ministry of Education."</p>

            <p>The Ministry of Education has declined to provide details of these proposed cuts, and said some staff will be provided with more job cut proposals tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a staff-wide progress update on the status of the job cuts, which will be posted to the Ministry of Education's website.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry's leader of corporate, Zoe Griffiths, said it was premature to speculate on the number of positions, what those positions were, and the number of staff affected.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with the government on delivering priorities. This includes a commitment to retaining food in schools and the period product programme."</p>
