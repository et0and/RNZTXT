            <p>Gale southerlies and heavy rain are easing in eastern parts of the North Island, MetService says, with all previous warnings and watches no longer in force.</p>
        
            <p>However, showers are expected to persist in Wairoa until early Sunday morning with a further 10 to 20 mm possible on top of what has already fallen.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence urged people on Friday in Wairoa to avoid all non-essential travel, as severe weather led to debris and fallen rocks on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence local controller for Wairoa, Juanita Savage, said officials were monitoring the river levels closely.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, it will be mainly fine in the North Island on Saturday, with a few morning showers in Hawke's Bay and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>There is also some rain in the South Island on Saturday, particularly in the south and west, and spreading to Canterbury in the afternoon.</p>
