            <p>A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck Tibet's second-largest city, the China Earthquake Networks Centre says, shaking the area surrounding Shigatse city at 9.05am local time.</p>
        
            <p>The quake had an epicentre depth of 10 km, the report added. Tremors were felt as far away as Nepal's capital Kathmandu some 400 km away, according to Indian media, where residents reportedly ran from their houses.</p>
        
            <p>A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.</p>
        
            <p>An AFP reporter said in Nepal, powerful tremors shook buildings in the capital Kathmandu just before dawn on Tuesday, after the powerful earthquake struck a remote Himalayan region near Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>The US Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.1, and the epicentre was 93 km from Lobuche in Nepal, along the mountainous border with Tibet in China.</p>
        
            <p>Officials in Kathmandu said they were checking for damage.</p>
        
            <p>Areas around Lobuche in Nepal, in the high mountains near Mount Everest, were also rattled by the tremors and a series of aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>"It shook quite strongly here, everyone is awake, but we don't know about any damages yet," said government official Jagat Prasad Bhusal in Nepal's Namche region, which lies nearer to Everest.</p>
        
            <p>Nepal lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, nearly 9000 people died and more than 22,000 were injured when a 7.8-magnitude quake struck Nepal, destroying more than half a million homes.</p>
        
            <p>Southwestern parts of China are frequently hit by earthquakes. A huge quake in Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, there have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 km of the Shigatse quake in the past five years, all of which were smaller than the one that struck on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in neighbouring Nepal, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in that country's worst earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
