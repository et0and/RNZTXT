            <p>The All Whites are one win away from booking their place at next year's FIFA World Cup in North and Central America.</p>
        
            <p>Their emphatic 7-0 win over Fiji was a relief to nervous fans, showcased the talents of their most high profile player and has set them up for date with New Caledonia on Monday night at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Wood, coming in off a landmark season for Nottingham Forest in the English Premier League, gave the Sky Stadium crowd what they'd come for with a hat trick. It only took him six minutes to nod home a Sarpreet Singh cross that gave the All Whites the lead, before Singh scored himself in the 17th minute. A Scott Wara own goal and Tim Payne's strike gave them a 4-0 lead at the break.</p>
        
            <p>While it was obvious the result was settled, Darren Bazeley's side kept the pressure on and Wood struck again within five minutes on the hour mark to complete his hat trick. Kosta Barbarouses then got a big cheer from his hometown crowd when he slotted home in the 73rd minute.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites were favoured to win comfortably against the amateur Fijian side but to do so with such authority will be a pleasing sign for Bazely.</p>
        
            <p>Now all attention turns to Eden Park where his side will face New Caledonia in the Oceania play-off final.</p>
