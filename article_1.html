            <p>Police are on the hunt for a man who aimed a firearm at a police officer before fleeing the scene in Highbury in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>At around 8:30pm on Tuesday night police approached a man and established there was a warrant for his arrest. They attempted to take him into custody.</p>
        
            <p>The man then became agitated and presented a firearm to an officer.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were put up around Brentwood Avenue but officers could not locate him.</p>
        
            <p>Those cordons have since come down.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier that day the same man had also aimed a gun at a member of the public who was walking on Featherston Street.</p>
        
            <p>Police put cordons in place around the area, and armed officers responded, however, he was not located.</p>
        
            <p>ManawatÅ« Area Commander Ross Grantham said police were providing support to the officer involved who was not physically harmed.</p>
        
            <p>They would not accept violence or attempted violence against officers or anyone in the community, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police inquiries are continuing to find the offender.</p>
        
            <p>They are asking for anyone who witnessed the incident or know the person involved to get in touch on either 105 or online using the reference file number 250212/1858.</p>
