            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has travelled to Sydney and met with his counterpart, Anthony Albanese.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been officially welcomed to Australia with a Welcome to Country ceremony, led by Aboriginal elders.</p>
        
            <p>It is his first official overseas visit since taking office.</p>
        
            <p>Albanese warmly greeted Luxon and quipped he was sorry about the weather, with rain expected for parts of Australia on Wednesday after scorching temperatures had been settling in this week.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke from fires in NSW in the north side were now spreading across to the north-west and down into the greater Sydney area, the Guardian reported this week.</p>
        
            <p>In his opening remarks, Albanese said the relationship between the countries was one of friends and partners.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to streamline any further bumps which are there, and I know that you are very keen on that as well, in the interests of both of our nations."</p>
        
            <p>Albanese said he looked forward to their discussions today and building on their personal relationship which they had built over a number of years.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was looking forward to building and deepening the relationship with Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no closer friend or ally than Australia. It is one that I want to put more urgency and energy behind, to make sure we can advance what is in both of our interests a much more secure more stable and more prosperous region."</p>
        
            <p>He also looked forward to discussions on defence, security and the economic agenda.</p>
        
            <p>Before taking off for his trip, he said his priority "first and foremost" was being a good security partner in the region, and he looked forward to discussing the close security and defence relationship between the two countries.</p>

            <p>"I want us to be higher intensity, higher engagement. I don't ever want to take the relationship with Australia for granted," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon would not say whether he felt the previous government had taken the relationship for granted in the security space, only that his government would work constructively with Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to make sure that we're a good partner and holding up our end."</p>

            <p>The emphasis on defence and security prompted questions over whether Luxon intended to move quickly on joining the AUKUS security arrangement.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's nuclear-free status would make joining pillar one impossible, and Luxon was adamant his stance would not change.</p>
        
            <p>"That's non-negotiable. But AUKUS pillar two is rather undefined. It's not in the nuclear space, it's in other areas. As the previous government has said, our position remains the same, which is we're open to exploring what it all means, given it's so undefined," he said.</p>
        
            <p>This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
