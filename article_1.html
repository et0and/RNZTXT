            <p>It's Hollywood's biggest day, as the 96th Annual Academy Awards kick off.</p>
        
            <p>Robert Downey Jr won Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Oppenheimer, while Da'Vine Joy Randolph won Best Supporting Actress for The Holdovers. </p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy, in that order," Downey said in accepting the award.</p>
        
            <p>He recovered from addiction and jail time that almost derailed his career in the 1990s and went on to star as Iron Man in the movies that kicked off the superhero movie boom.</p>

            <p>"Peter Jackson - thank you so much. This film would not have happened without you," says one of the winners.</p>
