            <p>Police are investigating possible arsons after fires at multiple churches in Masterton.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services from the town responded to four different fires at churches on Saturday morning, with the first reported at 4:25am, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said "damage to the churches ranged from moderate to significant".</p>
        
            <p>"The fires are being treated as suspicious and have been referred to police," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The blazes were all thought to have started between 4:25am and 4:35am, and were found at: Anglican Church Of The Epiphany, St Patrick's Catholic Church Masterton, Masterton Baptist Church and Equippers Church Masterton, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they checked on other churches in the town after the blazes were discovered, and had found evidence three other churches had been targeted but did not catch alight.</p>
        
            <p>Police would remain at the churches through Saturday morning with firefighters, and would be patrolling Masterton, Featherson and Carterton, they said.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said crews had responded from throughout the Wairarapa region and from as far away as Avalon Station in Lower Hutt.</p>
