        <h2>Officials warn of fire risk in Canterbury as firefighters remain at scene of two large blazes</h2>
        <p>
Fire and Emergency is asking people not to partake in any activities with a spark hazard - such as welding or grinding to reduce the risk of a fire breaking out.

            <p>Firefighters remain on the scene of two major blazes in the Canterbury region.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, vegetation fires broke out in both Loburn and Amberley, but were contained in the evening.</p>
        
            <p>But Fire and Emergency is warning that the fire risk in the region remains high with stronger winds forecast on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters have been on the ground at the scene of both blazes overnight and were being relieved by crews on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Both fires forced residents to be evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>In Loburn, four separate fires were contained to a 10-hectare cordon, but FENZ said the blaze destroyed several buildings, including a church and two houses.</p>
        
            <p>The fire just outside Amberley had been contained to an area of about one kilometre. Evacuated residents have been able to return home.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of the South Island were already in a prohibited fire season - but all fire permits have been suspended for the rest of Canterbury until Monday because of the ongoing risk.</p>
        
            <p>District manager Rob Hands said they were asking people in the region to not partake in any activities with a spark hazard - such as welding or grinding.</p>
        
            <p>"We just ask that people are, if they have been using fire as a main tool to clean up their section etcetera, that they should go and check their fires, that they are out and extinguish them with water and then restrict the activities that they are doing."</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury was in for another scorcher, with temperatures into the 30s in many places.</p>
        
            <p>Banks Peninsula is forecast to have a high of 33C, and Christchurch is expected to reach 32C.</p>
