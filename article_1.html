        <h2>Watch live: Greens give update on Darleen Tana saga</h2>
        <p>
The party has been in discussions about whether to use the waka-jumping legislation to remove the MP from Parliament.
</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick is expected to reveal the outcome of discussions party members have had over whether to use the party-hopping legislation to remove Darleen Tana from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens have been historically opposed to the party-hopping legislation, but the caucus has made it clear Tana's actions are unbecoming of an MP and want her gone from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The caucus and members discussed the matter behind closed doors on Saturday, and Swarbrick will give an update on how that went on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands party delegates will go back to their branches to discuss the matter, with a special general meeting set down for September.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was ousted by the Greens and asked to quit politics altogether this month after an independent investigation found the MP likely knew about allegations of worker exploitation at husband Christian Hoff-Nielsen's business, and did not disclose them to the party until after last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
