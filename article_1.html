        <h2>Live: Heavy smoke warning for Castle Hill residents</h2>
        <p>
People should stay indoors as a wind shift pushes smoke from the 450ha blaze over the village, FENZ says.

            <p>An out of control scrub fire burning at Bridge Hill in Canterbury has grown to 450 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>It has prompted a warning from Fire and Emergency to residents of Castle Hill village this evening.</p>
        
            <p>They should stay indoors with doors and windows shut as a wind shift pushes smoke over the village, FENZ says.</p>
        
            <p>Nine helicopters, three planes, and 12 trucks, tankers and support vehicles are among the resources being thrown at the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Three school camps staying about a kilometre from the fireground have been evacuated as a precaution, as has Flock Hill Lodge.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 is closed between Castle Hill and Arthur's Pass village.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Otago firefighters from multiple brigades are responding to a rash of vegetation fires in Central and Coastal Otago this afternoon, and strong winds, warm temperatures and low humidity are making some of the blazes challenging to contain.</p>
