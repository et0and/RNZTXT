            <p>Dating apps are so 2023. An Auckland man has decided to go offline - and on his car window - in his search for love.</p>
        
            <p>Northcote asbestos consultant Deejay O'Dowd has started the new year by turning his car into a mobile personal advert. He's customised a family sticker he bought off the internet, noting that the female partner role is 'currently vacant'.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't quite prepared to go on Tinder, but I thought I would give this a go for a bit of a laugh," O'Dowd said.</p>
        
            <p>The other members of the family - 12-year-old Liam and nine-year-old Amelia, plus tabby cat Oreo - are happy with their dad's unconventional way of putting himself out there.</p>

            <p>"I do joke with my daughter all the time that my ideal partner would be [Australian actress] Margot Robbie. We're not too serious about it."</p>
        
            <p>If Robbie doesn't get in touch, 51-year-old O'Dowd (who is 1.78m tall, the same height as Bond actor Daniel Craig) would be happy to meet someone with a good sense of humour who might also be separated with kids.</p>
        
            <p>He's been single for 18 months and is a recovering alcoholic: "it's a bit of a journey, for sure".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a pretty average guy, I guess. I work, I hang out with my kids and take them to their activities. I go to the gym; I do a bit of cycling. I don't really sit around watching TV, I like to stay active."</p>
        
            <p>O'Dowd's had a handful of texts in the last few days since he applied the advert to his car's rear window, and he's been pleasantly surprised that by the response.</p>
        
            <p>"I just did it as a bit of a laugh. It's nice that people are interested."</p>
