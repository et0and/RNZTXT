        <h2>Ticketed in 47 seconds: Even mobility passes not enough</h2>
        <p>
Drop offs are meant to be allowed, but locals say even mobility pass-holding residents are getting pinged for stopping a few minutes.

            <p>Businesses and residents on a central Auckland street that has few options for parking are being stung by ticketing cameras.</p>
        
            <p>Federal Street was made a shared zone for cars, pedestrians and cyclists two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said dropping people off in the zone is allowed - but mobility pass-holding residents say they are being ticketed for stopping on the street for just a few minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The portion of Federal Street between Mayoral Drive and Wellesly Street had what was described as a 'Parisian' makeover in 2022, removing options for parking.</p>
        
            <p>There is a loading zone at each end of the street, between 6am and 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Mobility pass-holding residents say cameras installed this year have driven up tickets, but without mobility spaces on the block, they do not have other options.</p>
        
            <p>Noline Gray lives on Federal Street with her sister, who uses a wheelchair.</p>
        
            <p>She has got a mobility pass and needs to stop near their apartment to drop off her sister before parking somewhere else.</p>
        
            <p>When CCTV cameras were installed, they got hit with parking tickets.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only happened this year, we started getting tickets for stopping outside our apartment. We don't park our car here, we park in a cheaper place. I generally will just unload her and then go and park the car," Gray said, as there are no mobility parks on their block of Federal Street.</p>
        
            <p>She said the tickets were after stopping for only a few minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"Four minutes long, this one is, three minutes... this is three minutes, forty three seconds, is what it's saying on the three tickets I've got in front of me."</p>
        
            <p>A care provider to the family received a ticket after being parked for just 47 seconds, Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the first tickets I received, I wrote back, explained the situation, said we've got our mobility parking ticket, they wouldn't flag the ticket."</p>
        
            <p>She has since spent $100 so she can access their building's garage to drop off her sister.</p>
        
            <p>48 French cafe owner Angel Ngan has a mobility pass for her shoulder injury.</p>
        
            <p>"So my hand cannot lift up too heavy stuff, and my leg cannot stand too long, because [it gets] swollen. So my daughter got me the disabled licence."</p>
        
            <p>She said she needed to park outside her shop to unload stock, and has been hit by parking tickets.</p>
        
            <p>"And then here - just three minutes - and get a ticket, forty dollar.</p>
        
            <p>"After 11 you can't stop anytime - it's unfair."</p>
        
            <p>Her niece Nikki Yeung runs a cake business out of the cafe and said the 11am cut-off for loading zone parking was too restrictive.</p>
        
            <p>She has tried to let Auckland Transport know what they were up against.</p>
        
            <p>"I was telling the AT guy, because he did come and talk to us. I was telling him businesses don't stop at 11 - we still need to get stuff done in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just here I think just to show that we got your email. Whether things will go forward, I don't think so, it was just a formality."</p>
        
            <p>Angel Ngan said the tickets have hit business - with customers risking a $40 fine alongside the price of a coffee.</p>
        
            <p>"And I run a business, the people come buy the coffee and go, oh forty dollar plus coffee, who sell the coffee for 47 in one cup of coffee, I don't think so," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Yeung said it had also made it difficult for her customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine like them carrying two tier cakes, or tall cakes, how hard and inconvenient it is for them. This is just a short distance, but wouldn't it be easier to just have this space at least."</p>
        
            <p>She said Auckland Transport was 'out of touch'.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's really unfair, and I just think that, they need to consider the businesses around here."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Auckland Transport group manager parking services John Strawbridge said it was working closely with the disability community to improve access to the city centre, where space is limited.</p>
        
            <p>He said CCTV cameras are used on Federal Street to monitor parking and a parking officer reviewed the footage before a ticket was issued.</p>
        
            <p>He said Auckland Transport had received complaints about the ticketing on Federal Street, but plans remained to use more cameras to issue parking tickets in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fort Street shared zone is one area we are currently looking at, where we have had requests from businesses and the community to be more present in this area."</p>
        
            <p>Paid parking during overnights and weekends was meant to be introduced this month, but has been delayed until at least December.</p>
