        <h2>Putin lays out his terms for ceasefire in Ukraine</h2>
        <p>
Ukraine immediately branded the Russian president's proposals "offensive to common sense".

            <p>Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine would need to withdraw troops from territories Russia claims to have annexed before a ceasefire could begin - a proposal Ukraine's president called a Hitler-like "ultimatum".</p>
        
            <p>Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.</p>
        
            <p>The Russian president also said Ukraine would have to give up on joining Nato before peace talks could start.</p>
        
            <p>Putin's statement setting out his ceasefire conditions comes as leaders from 90 countries prepare to meet in Switzerland on Saturday to discuss paths towards peace in Ukraine - a summit Russia has not been invited to.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to a meeting of Russian ambassadors in Moscow on Friday, Putin called on the Ukrainian government to withdraw from four regions partially occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p>
        
            <p>He also said Ukraine would need to officially give up in its efforts to join the Nato military alliance for the Russian advance to be halted.</p>
        
            <p>Putin said: "As soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision... an order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute."</p>
        
            <p>Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called the proposal a "complete sham" and "offensive to common sense".</p>
        
            <p>Later on Friday, President Zelensky told Italy's Sky TG24 television: "These messages are ultimatum messages. It's the same thing Hitler did, when he said 'give me a part of Czechoslovakia and it'll end here'."</p>

            <p>US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin also dismissed the Russian demands, saying: "Putin has illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory.</p>
        
            <p>"He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace."</p>
        
            <p>Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Putin's proposal was "not made in good faith".</p>
        
            <p>Russia analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Putin's plan was a set of "maximalist" demands that offered no concessions, timed to devalue the peace conference ahead of it beginning.</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky will be attending Saturday's summit near Lake Lucerne, where he will hope to show he still enjoys wide international support.</p>
        
            <p>The Swiss government has said the aim of the summit was "to provide a forum where world leaders discuss paths towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, based on international law and the UN Charter".</p>
        
            <p>Other attendees will include US Vice-President Kamala Harris, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
        
            <p>Russia was not invited and China has said it will not attend without Russia's presence.</p>
        
            <p>The peace summit comes after G7 leaders agreed to use interest from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine fight invading Russian forces.</p>
        
            <p>Some $US325 billion ($NZ529b) worth of assets were frozen by G7 countries, alongside the EU, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The pot of assets is generating about $US3b a year in interest.</p>
        
            <p>Under the G7 plan, that $3b will be used to pay off the annual interest on a $50b loan for the Ukrainians, taken out on the international markets.</p>
        
            <p>The money is not expected to arrive until the end of the year but is seen as a longer-term solution to support Ukraine's war effort and economy.</p>
        
            <p>On the sidelines of the G7 summit, the US and Ukraine also signed a 10-year bilateral security deal, hailed by Kyiv as "historic".</p>
