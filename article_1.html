            <p>A Dunedin woman has been jailed for drunkenly ramming into a flock of lambs, killing 29 of them as a shepherd attempted to steer them away from a destructive cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>Annabelle Wyant, 43, appeared in the Dunedin District Court this week before Judge David Robinson and was sentenced to two and a-half-years' imprisonment for eight driving charges, including her 12th drink-driving conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Wyant was sentenced to jail in 2015 for the attempted murder of a gang member.</p>
        
            <p>She had been drinking alcohol and using ecstasy throughout the day of the incident and after picking her children up from school, she took a pistol from her bedroom, loaded it and drove to the victim's home.</p>
        
            <p>When the man came out she shot him in the chest without warning.</p>
        
            <p>Nine years later, her alcohol consumption has landed her in jail again.</p>
        
            <p>Counsel Brian Kilkelly said his client had an "awful history of drinking and driving" but had been making an effort to quit.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously a gross understatement to say alcohol is at the core of this offending over a 25-year period," he said.</p>
        
            <p>At 4.30pm on February 12, last year, a young shepherd and his dogs were desperately trying to shift a mob of lambs to higher ground as Cyclone Gabrielle ominously loomed.</p>
        
            <p>Wyant was behind the wheel driving along Tauwhareparae Road in Tolaga Bay with a breath alcohol level of 1032mcg - more than four times the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>She ploughed into the flock, crashing into the back of the shepherd's quad-bike. Twenty-nine lambs died.</p>
        
            <p>Wyant was abusive not only to attending police, but to the young shepherds attempting to help her.</p>
        
            <p>While on bail, on 3 December, Wyant was witnessed driving erratically and weaving between lanes in Mosgiel.</p>
        
            <p>Police noted she was belligerent and clearly inebriated.</p>
        
            <p>Testing procedures showed Wyant's state of intoxication was, again, more than four times the legal limit, with a blood alcohol level of 222mg.</p>
        
            <p>Kilkelly said his client felt terrible and her drinking habit had worsened after the cyclone destroyed her home.</p>
        
            <p>"She was one of the victims who were particularly impacted, quite devastatingly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Robinson voiced his reservations and said his primary obligation was to protect the community from Wyant.</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to another drink-driving incident in December, 2022, when the woman told pursuing police, she "didn't stop because she didn't want to go to jail".</p>
        
            <p>"Others are in danger. A lengthy term of imprisonment is warranted," Judge Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>When the judge granted the ODT's photo application, the defendant aimed abuse at media representatives in court.</p>
        
            <p>Wyant was disqualified indefinitely, ordered to pay $3997 reparation, $115 for blood analysis and her vehicles were forfeited.</p>
