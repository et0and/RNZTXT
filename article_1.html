            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced $60 million in this year's Budget will go towards the renewal of New Zealand's diplomatic post infrastructure in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>It comes alongside the announcement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has found $15m in savings per year - adding up to $60m over the four-year forecast period - from "back-office efficiencies and lower priority activities".</p>
        
            <p>The savings account for slightly less than 1 percent of the ministry's departmental and non-departmental total budget. The ministry - like all other departments in the public sector - had been asked to find savings of 6.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the ministry's Budget allocation this year would balance "two crucial priorities of the coalition government".</p>
        
            <p>"While Budget 2024 reflects the constrained fiscal environment, the government also recognises the critical role MFAT plays in keeping New Zealanders safe and prosperous."</p>
        
            <p>The $60m includes capital and operational funding.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the $15m in savings per year showed the ministry was playing its part in turning around the country's financial position.</p>
        
            <p>"Under new Board leadership, we are also turning around the serious fiscal risks we inherited on the stalled Scott Base Redevelopment project, reducing taxpayer liability for what remains a significant project of national interest," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The balance struck in this year's budget is between risk and opportunity and between back-office savings and front-line investment."</p>
