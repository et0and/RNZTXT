            <p>The executive director of the Covid-19 inquiry and two lawyers assisting the second phase of the inquiry have resigned.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden said she does not wish to speculate on why they had chosen to resign, and she still expected the chairperson to present a final report by next February.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff has reported that executive director Helen Potiki and the assisting counsel - Kristy McDonald and Nick Whittington - are understood to have quit over concerns about the inquiry's processes.</p>
        
            <p>But the minister said she had concerns about timeframes not being met, based on the quarterly report provided by the commissioners.</p>
        
            <p>Potiki had been in the role since October 2024.</p>
