        <h2>Olympics 2024: Trampolining couple fall head over heels before Paris</h2>

            <p>For New Zealand's trampoline gymnastics team, the Paris Olympics will be a labour of love.</p>
        
            <p>Dylan Schmidt and Maddie Davidson were Olympic team mates in Tokyo but are returning to the Games as a couple seeking medals and inspiration from each other.</p>
        
            <p>In a career of ups and downs, former world champion Schmidt became New Zealand's first Olympic medallist in gymnastics when the 27-year-old nabbed a bronze at the Tokyo Games.</p>
        
            <p>He will compete in a third Olympics in the "City of Love" and cheer on his 25-year-old partner Davidson, who became New Zealand's first gymnast to qualify for the women's event at Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>While Schmidt and Davidson can bounce ideas off each other as elite trampolinists both are mindful of the need to keep a healthy split between their sport and private lives.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the first topic that comes up when we go out to dinner," Schmidt told Reuters of their athletic pursuits.</p>
        
            <p>"We tend to leave the advice to our coaches."</p>

            <p>Keeping a professional distance is not as hard as it sounds, given the pair train at opposite ends of New Zealand. Schmidt is based in Auckland, while Davidson is based in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>They try to catch up every couple of weeks.</p>

            <p>Romance between athletes is often forged in the cauldron of competition and Paris will undoubtedly light the spark for a number of future relationships.</p>
        
            <p>United States women's soccer icon Megan Rapinoe met her partner Sue Bird, the former basketball player, at a team photo shoot for the 2016 Rio Olympics and both qualified for Tokyo as a couple.</p>
        
            <p>Australian rugby sevens players Charlotte Caslick and Lewis Holland also competed as an item in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 stole much of the romance from the Games in Japan, where athletes were largely unable to mix outside their entourages due to strict social distancing protocols.</p>
        
            <p>"It was such a different experience," said Davidson, who was among the few New Zealanders able to watch Schmidt's podium moment at the venue in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>"The lead-up also was not ideal for training due to all the travel restrictions."</p>
        
            <p>No such impediments exist this time round for Paris, where the Kiwi couple will arrive well-prepared and with a proper complement of family and friends to roar them on.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson narrowly missed the final in Tokyo but expects to reach new heights at the Bercy Arena after working with a sports psychologist on her mental game.</p>
        
            <p>Like much of gymnastics, any slight mistake in trampoline can have devastating consequences for a routine's score and possibly years of regret for an athlete between Olympic cycles.</p>
        
            <p>An uncharacteristic flop for Hikaru Mori, the reigning women's world champion at her home Tokyo Games, put her out of qualifying and shocked the host nation.</p>
        
            <p>"Your brain and body can become disconnected," said Davidson. "You have to try to stop and appreciate the moment, not be like a deer in the headlights."</p>
        
            <p>Away from the competition hall, Schmidt and Davidson have more practical concerns, including whether they room together in the Olympic village.</p>
        
            <p>While they often travel to competition as a couple, neither are married to the idea of sharing a flat at the village. The New Zealand Olympic Committee has yet to confirm arrangements for the team.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not going to be kicking and screaming if we're not rooming together," said Schmidt.</p>
        
            <p>"We're there for the performance, you know.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not there for a holiday."</p>
