            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has cancelled his visit to New Caledonia, due to unrest throughout the French Pacific territory.</p>
        
            <p>Peters and a delegation of other ministers were due to visit the capital Nouméa later this week.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday demonstrations, marches and confrontations with security forces spread throughout New Caledonia with hot points in suburbs of Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>It came ahead of a vote in Paris's National Assembly on a government-tabled Constitutional amendment.</p>
