            <p>When Gaye Hansen's son couldn't get hold of his mother and his step-father, Helge Hansen, he drove to their rented farm property in West Auckland on Thursday morning to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>The scene that greeted him on Anzac Valley Road was like something out of a horror movie - his mother, 81, and her husband Helge, 82, lay dead in a paddock and a rogue ram was standing guard.</p>
        
            <p>Dean Burrell, Gaye's nephew, says the son was then attacked by the animal.</p>
        
            <p>"He went to the house. He couldn't find them. He went ... to the paddock and found his mum.</p>
        
            <p>"He's gone to her aid but she'd passed away at that point.</p>
        
            <p>"He himself was attacked by this ram from behind. He managed to get it into a headlock and closed the gate and went back to his mum.</p>
        
            <p>"The ram busted through the electric fence and attacked them again so he called the cops."</p>
        
            <p>The ram wasn't done - it became aggressive towards officers when they arrived and they shot it dead.</p>

            <p>Jan Hansen, Helge's ex-wife who was close to him and Gaye, believes Helge had gone out to feed the animals the night before, while Gaye cooked dinner, their normal routine.</p>
        
            <p>When he didn't come back, Gaye went to investigate, she believes.</p>
        
            <p>"That ram must have been waiting for her to come through the gate, I reckon. Don't think that animals can't think.</p>
        
            <p>"A male animal in mating season can be quite vicious."</p>
        
            <p>She adds: "I've never faced so much disaster in one short spat of time. It's appalling that two people can lose their lives like that."</p>
        
            <p>She says Helge was very active and continued to work on their daughter's farm at Kumeu.</p>
        
            <p>"The ram must have come from nowhere to get him like that. You can never trust a ram." She says the ram wasn't a stranger to the property - it had lived there for some time.</p>
        
            <p>Helge and Jan Hansen's son, Antony, a photographer who lives in the United Arab Emirates, says his sister, Leanne, arrived at their father's property around the same time as police.</p>
        
            <p>He received a call around midnight, UAE time, from his sister, saying their dad and Gaye were dead.</p>

            <p>"It's frickin full-on for both of them to get taken out ... under such weird, crazy circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"You know the reality of ageing parents, but you don't expect anything so radical."</p>
        
            <p>Antony Hansen says his father, of Danish descent, used to run a sheep farm at Port Waikato, and knew what he was doing.</p>
        
            <p>"He's an experienced sheep farmer. He knows the potential outcome with rams, as far as being pretty stroppy.</p>
        
            <p>"It [must have] caught him off guard, or he wouldn't be in a paddock with one, because he's always been really cautious around rams."</p>
        
            <p>Hansen says his dad suffered a serious horse riding accident at his farm in the 1970s and had to relocate to Auckland, where he re-trained and went into marketing Alpine car stereos.</p>
        
            <p>He married Gaye 30 years ago - they celebrated their wedding anniversary only a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>Helge already had two adult children, and Gaye three.</p>
        
            <p>More recently his father had sold cleaning products to hotels, worked loading logs on the wharf at Whangarei and renovated houses with Gaye.</p>
        
            <p>He was "super active" and in good shape for his age.</p>

            <p>"He was no couch potato in retirement.</p>
        
            <p>"He enjoyed his morning walk down to open the gate and get the paper and feed the sheep and feed the chickens."</p>
        
            <p>Looking after animals was a passion. He and Gaye loved to travel, and had been to Alaska and China.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen says he's seen videos on YouTube of rams fighting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty brutal - their heads are designed to take the impact, but it's like a sledgehammer swinging at you at 60 to 80 miles an hour."</p>
        
            <p>He believes his father died instantly.</p>
        
            <p>"He's gone about the stuff he loved doing and it's been over very quickly. That's something to give us a bit more comfort - that dad didn't suffer."</p>
        
            <p>He says Helge was a great father - "he was super kind" - and had become a great-grandfather. He and Gaye were a "steadfast, loveable couple" and were "super happy hanging out together".</p>
        
            <p>Hansen is unsure if he'll be able to make it to New Zealand, as Dubai airport has been closed due to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Jan Hansen says she can hardly believe her ex-husband and his wife died like they did.</p>
        
            <p>"It's almost like a not-true story, it's absolutely gutting."</p>
        
            <p>The only good thing was that they died together.</p>
        
            <p>"They were a solid couple - to be killed at the same time and not one leaving the other behind is great."</p>
        
            <p>She says a joint funeral will be held at the Kumeu Showgrounds on Wednesday.</p>
