            <p>A lightning strike has caused a large power outage in Hawke's Bay, Transpower NZ reports.</p>
        
            <p>The strike hit their equipment and caused a fault, the company said on its Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>"We have teams now looking into how power can be restored," the company said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll keep you all updated when we know more."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ listeners have been texting in about the power outage.</p>
        
            <p>"What's happening with the power? Out in Clive, Napier ... perhaps even further," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"No power as far north as Gisborne," another person reported.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has warned of thunderstorms in much of the North Island today.</p>
        
            <p>More to come. </p>
