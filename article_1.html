            <p>Patricia McKay's family say they have no words to express their sadness after her death during a robbery at a California mall.</p>
        
            <p>Newport Beach police said Patricia McKay, 68, was pulled onto the road following a struggle during an attempted robbery and was killed after being hit by a car driven by one of the offenders.</p>
        
            <p>McKay, 68, was the wife of businessman Doug McKay, a former chair of BNZ's board.</p>
        
            <p>He was reported by US media as being with her when the attack happened.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement a family spokesperson asked for privacy as they worked through her death.</p>
        
            <p>"No words can express their sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia."</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Steve Oberon of the Newport Beach Police Department said the incident was "surprising and shocking", especially as it has occurred in a city generally regarded as safe.</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed Doug McKay was with his wife when she was killed.</p>
        
            <p>He said Doug McKay had no visible injuries. However, he had suffered a traumatic loss and has been offered counselling services.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to keep close communication with him to see how we can help in any way possible."</p>
        
            <p>Police had been in touch with the family several times to offer support.</p>
        
            <p>A lengthy investigation was underway and the case would be "fully and thoroughly investigated".</p>
        
            <p>Officers had worked through the night, there was a lot of CCTV footage to be looked at and eyewitnesses to be spoken to, Oberon said.</p>
        
            <p>He was unsure when the case would move to the next stage because it was so complex.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's Deputy Mayor Desley Simpson said in a Facebook post she was "beyond devastated" to hear of McKay's death.</p>

            <p>"Trish was the wife of Doug McKay who was (amongst other significant roles) the inaugural CEO of the amalgamated Auckland Council</p>
        
            <p>"Trish was amazing- funny, loyal, and loving. My absolute deepest sympathies to Doug and her family."</p>
        
            <p>Doug McKay's former employer BNZ said it was a "tragic loss".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, chief executive Dan Huggins said Doug McKay had served on the BNZ board for more than a decade, including most recently as its chairperson.</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of all of us at BNZ I have conveyed our deep sadness and heartfelt condolences to the McKay family for the sudden and tragic loss of Patricia (Trish) McKay."</p>
        
            <p>He said Doug and Patricia had been a big part of the company family.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts at this time go out to both Trish's family, to Doug and the McKay family, and we are doing all that we can to support them at this time."</p>

            <p>Christopher Luxon on Thursday told reporters he knew Doug McKay well.</p>
        
            <p>Trish McKay was a wonderful person, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tragic situation and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this incredibly difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had "incredible respect" for Doug McKay.</p>
        
            <p>He expressed the hope relatives and friends would surround them with love.</p>
        
            <p>A fellow shopper at the mall when McKay was killed says he believes the robbers were initially after her husband's watch.</p>
        
            <p>Dan Sheen said when the shots rang out "everybody just freaked out and ran for cover".</p>
        
            <p>"I was shopping in Whole Foods and I heard some shots ring out as I was walking out.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard the screech of the car, and then I heard what happened afterwards," Dan Sheen told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Sheen believed the robbers were initially after her husband's watch.</p>
        
            <p>"They went after a watch, that he was wearing, from what I understand he was wearing, and then they turned their attention to Patricia with the bag and there was a struggle there."</p>
        
            <p>Later Sheen realised his friend had been involved in trying to hold down one of the offenders.</p>

            <p>"He's the type of person that helps, he's the type of person that will protect someone innocent when something like this is happening.</p>
        
            <p>"He heard screaming... he ran over clotheslined, from what I understand, put his arm out when the guy was running away with the bag."</p>
        
            <p>Sheen said his friend tried to hold onto the man but was shot at by one of the other offenders who was in a car.</p>
        
            <p>"The person jumped in the car, the car sped away really quick and, unfortunately as I understand, ran over Patricia."</p>
        
            <p>Sheen, who has lived in Newport Beach since he was a child, said McKay's death was shocking and nothing like that had happened there before.</p>
        
            <p>LA Times crime writer Richard Winton told Midday Report police were very quick to respond.</p>
        
            <p>"Within minutes they were chasing them on the Southern California freeways, there was a helicopter following them overhead from one of the other local police departments.</p>
        
            <p>"They were essentially captured when they crossed into LA County.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically the police moved in, numerous police cars hemmed them in and they were forced to surrender at gunpoint."</p>
        
            <p>Winton said the three accused are Leroyernest McCrary, 26, from Compton, Jaden Cunningham, 18, from Lancaster and Malachi Darnell, 18, from Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>"Leroyearnest McCrary has a considerable criminal record; he has a history of robbery, he has a history of narcotics... and with a firearm."</p>
        
            <p>Winton said McCrary had previously been convicted for two felonies, and was handed down a two-year suspended sentence and two years' probation.</p>
        
            <p>He did not know much about the other two men, as they were 18 and would be protected as juveniles.</p>
        
            <p>The three men are likely to be charged on Friday, so could be in court by Friday afternoon, he said.</p>
