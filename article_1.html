            <p>Sporadic sightings of an otter-like creature have been reported in the South Island dating all the way back to Captain James Cook, who wrote about seeing an unusual four-footed animal in Fiordland in 1773.</p>
        
            <p>But could there really be native otters living in New Zealand? Or is it more likely the sightings were of seal pups, ferrets or even very large rats.</p>
        
            <p>The South Island otter, also referred to as Waitoreke, is a small folklore creature which is said to resemble something between an otter and a beaver.</p>
        
            <p>German-born New Zealand explorer, Julius von Haast was believed to have acquired a portion of skin from the supposed animal in the 19th century.</p>
        
            <p>In 2003, Jill Linscott, from Thornbury, told The Southland Times, she had seen an otter-like creature swimming across a lagoon on her farm in 1957.</p>
        
            <p>"It had small ears and was a browny-plum colour and about the size of a small cat. It seemed to have two layers of fur and had a rounder, flatter face than either a seal or a rat."</p>
        
            <p>She didn't see it on land, but she does remember her father-in-law having reported two similar animals playing in the same lagoon.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Thomas and his family, from the Lilburn Valley, told the Times they were visiting the Lilburn Stream in the late 90s when their dog disturbed an animal that dived into the water.</p>
        
            <p>"It had sleek black fur and was about the size of a possum. It swam as if it was very much at home in the water. It had a big tail and a short face and was too big for a rat, and it wasn't a possum, ferret or seal."</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill-based natural history specialist and author Lloyd Esler wrote a book about whaling and sealing in Southern New Zealand, spent a chapter examining the legend of the otter.</p>
        
            <p>His interest in the otter began while he spent time working as a teacher at the Southland Museum.</p>
        
            <p>While writing his book, Esler spoke with 15 witnesses who believed they had seen an otter while whaling or fishing in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Despite speaking with witnesses and writing about the otter, Esler himself said he didn't believe in the creature.</p>
        
            <p>"While I may not believe it, these people I've spoken to are absolutely convinced they saw an otter, but there's no evidence of this otter - so what are people seeing?"</p>
        
            <p>The reported sightings all noted the creature was seen swimming in water and was around a foot long in length with a thick brown tail.</p>
        
            <p>Esler noted it was possible people could've seen a baby seal, ferret or a very large rat and mistaken it for an otter.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps, many years ago, an otter escaped from a zoo or travelling circus, which could explain some of the older sightings," Esler mused.</p>
        
            <p>"But, there is no physical evidence an otter ever existed in the wild in the South Island. I believe if this creature did exist we'd have physical proof."</p>
        
            <p>The last sighting of the elusive otter Esler had heard about was around five years ago, but he noted he was still interested to hear from anyone who believed they'd seen an otter in the South Island wild themselves.</p>
