            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) says all of its staff at embassies in Myanmar and Thailand are safe and well, following a strong earthquake on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The magnitude-7.7 tremor has killed at least 144 in Myanmar and nine in Thailand, and toppled buildings in both countries.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said it was "closely monitoring" the quake's impacts.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the affected countries, particularly the people of Myanmar and Thailand where the damage appears to be most significant," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>There were seven New Zealanders registered in Myanmar and 161 in Thailand, who had been sent SafeTravel messaging, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders in the affected areas should follow the advice of local authorities at all times, including any evacuation orders. New Zealanders should also let their family and friends in New Zealand know that they are safe when they are able to.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders who require urgent consular assistance can contact the 24/7 consular emergency line on +64 99 20 20 20."</p>
        
            <p>All its staff in Yangon and Bangkok had been accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>"We are assessing the impact on our embassy operations in both countries. New Zealand will also be closely monitoring the humanitarian situation and response."</p>
        
            <p>It was feared there could be thousands dead, going by the strength and relative shallowness of the quake, which struck right in the heart of Myanmar at just 10km deep.</p>
