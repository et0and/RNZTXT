        <h2>Live: Entire towns told to evacuate as Cyclone Alfred nears</h2>
        <p>
More than 80,000 are without power with more outages likely and hundreds of schools are closed as some low-lying areas become inundated with water.
</p>
        
            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred's centre is expected to hit Australia on Saturday morning, with impacts already being felt across south-east Queensland and northern NSW.</p>
        
            <p>The cyclone continues to track slowely towards Australia, which means the impacts of the weather event will last longer.</p>
        
            <p>Australians in the two effected states have been experiencing persistent rainfall, strong winds and large swells. Tens of thousands of people are already without power in the Gold Coast and New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>The category two system was expected to remain of similar intensity until the centre started to interact with the coast and islands. The most intense weather conditions are expected on Saturday morning.</p>
