            <p>Environment Canterbury chairperson Peter Scott has resigned.</p>
        
            <p>His departure follows revelations in The Press newspaper that his council-provided car exceeded the speed limit more than 600 times, reaching speeds of 157km/h.</p>
        
            <p>In July, Scott received a formal warning following an independent investigation into his own claims he was operating illegally on a South Canterbury farm.</p>
        
            <p>He released a statement saying that while publicity about his behaviour had not been directly related to his work as chair, he recognised the damage it was doing to the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Scott's resignation takes effect from Friday, when councillor Craig Pauling will be acting chair.</p>
        
            <p>... More to come</p>
