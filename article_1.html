            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has announced the approach the government plans to take for requiring judges to hand down tougher sentences.</p>
        
            <p>The moves line up with what the coalition parties campaigned on during the election.</p>
        
            <p>It includes:</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said judges would still have discretion to consider individual circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>During the election, National promised to limit the amount judges could reduce sentences to 40 percent of the maximum, regardless of mitigating factors.</p>
        
            <p>ACT campaigned on making changes to what judges must consider in sentencing, so that risk to victims and the community is taken into consideration and cultural background is not. They also proposed tougher sentences for crimes against vulnerable workers.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition is also proceeding with its plan to reinstate a tweaked version of the Three Strikes legislation, and crack down on serious young offenders.</p>
