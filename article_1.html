        <h2>Transport minister suggests all Roads of National Significance to be tolled</h2>
        <p>
Simeon Brown says he doesn't see any reason tolling would not be recommended for all Roads of National Significance.
</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown has unveiled the final Government Policy Statement on Land Transport, which covers the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>A draft of the plan was released for consultation in March. It proposed to increase fuel taxes by 12 cents a litre in 2027 increasing to 22 cents in 2029, alongside increases to vehicle registration fees by $50 over two years.</p>
        
            <p>This would help pay for new Roads of National Significance and the government's $500 million pothole prevention fund, with $70 billion in spending through to 2034.</p>
        
            <p>Questions remain over just how much those roads may cost. The government has repeatedly said it would aim to use alternative revenue options where possible, including public-private partnerships, and user-pays options like road tolling, equity finance schemes, and value capture.</p>
        
            <p>Brown told reporters at Parliament he expected all the Roads of National Significance could be in line for tolling, to help deliver them.</p>
        
            <p>"We've made it very clear, where we've recommended that they should be a toll road, we'll toll them.</p>
        
            <p>"I imagine we'll be tolling every single one of them which is a recommendation, and I can't see any of them not being recommended."</p>
        
            <p>The plan also makes good on the government's promise to abolish Auckland's Regional Fuel tax, with the tax no longer paid by fuel importers from next Monday, 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>The government intends to support the introduction of congestion charging in various cities, but has not yet set a plan on how it will achieve this.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said a lot of reports have been released on congestion charges, but no decision has been made and it needs to go through the appropriate policy process before anything is announced.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't give you a particular time indication at this stage."</p>

            <p>He said work was also under way on the additional WaitematƒÅ harbour crossing, but much more planning was required including around procurement and geological risk.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a commitment ... there's a huge amount of work that needs to be done, this GPS commits and says we're going to continue with that work because it's critically important to the future of Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the final GPS closed on 2 April, with the final plan expected to be in place by 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>Since the draft was released, the government has also announced two further Roads of National Significance, along with a plan for a replace the New Zealand Upgrade Programme with "Roads of Regional Significance".</p>
        
            <p>When announcing those moves last month, Brown and Finance Minister Nicola Willis said they had been advised of a "significant funding gap of up to $1.5b" and they had agreed to delegate decisions to the NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi to deliver "within the existing funding envelope, as there will be no additional Crown funding".</p>
        
            <p>The government also committed an extra $1b in this year's Budget to top up the National Land Transport Fund.</p>
