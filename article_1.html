            <p>Civil society groups are condemning a US court order that Greenpeace pay over US$660 million (NZ$1.1 billion) in damages to an oil pipeline company as a chilling attack on climate action around the globe.</p>
        
            <p>Environmental defenders rallied behind Greenpeace after the shock ruling by a North Dakota jury fuelled concerns that courtrooms were increasingly being used to smother critics.</p>
        
            <p>"It sends a dangerous message: that fossil fuel giants can weaponise the courts to bankrupt and silence those who challenge the destruction of our planet," Anne Jellema, executive director of advocacy group 350.org, said.</p>
        
            <p>The judgement "is not only an attack on Greenpeace - it is an assault on the entire climate movement, clearly intended to chill the resistance to fossil fuels", she added in a written statement to AFP.</p>
        
            <p>Ana Caistor Arendar from rights monitor Global Witness said it was "an existential threat to activism, protest and to land and environmental defenders, not just in the US, but everywhere".</p>
        
            <p>Energy Transfer (ET), the Texas-based pipeline operator that was awarded the damages, has denied any attempt to stifle free speech by suing Greenpeace.</p>
        
            <p>The company had accused the environmental advocacy group of orchestrating violence and defamation during the construction of the contentious Dakota Access Pipeline project nearly a decade ago.</p>

            <p>From 2016 to 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil fuel protests in US history against the pipeline, and the demonstrations saw hundreds arrested and injured.</p>
        
            <p>The jury awarded more than $660m in damages across three Greenpeace entities, citing charges including trespass, nuisance, conspiracy, and deprivation of property access.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace has vowed to appeal and continue its advocacy work.</p>
        
            <p>Brice Bohmer from Transparency International, a global corruption watchdog, said the lawsuit was "unconscionable" and evidence of a much wider problem.</p>
        
            <p>"This kind of activity is becoming increasingly common across climate action, with fossil fuel actors undermining progress wherever possible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>ET initially sought $300m in damages through a federal lawsuit, which was dismissed.</p>
        
            <p>It then shifted its legal strategy to state courts in North Dakota, one of the minority of US states without protections against so-called "Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation" or SLAPPs.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the years-long legal fight, ET's billionaire chief executive Kelcy Warren, a major donor to President Donald Trump, was open about his motivations, saying in interviews that he wanted to "send a message".</p>
        
            <p>Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network International, a coalition of nearly 2000 non-government organisations, said the verdict should "worry us all".</p>
        
            <p>Matilda Flemming, director of Friends of the Earth Europe, said she was "appalled" by the outcome but warned it was not an isolated case.</p>
        
            <p>"The right to protest is under threat across the world, from big corporations and self-interested politicians who threaten our democracies," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace International is counter-suing ET in the Netherlands, accusing the company of nuisance lawsuits to stifle dissent.</p>
        
            <p>Rebecca Brown, president and chief executive of the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), said the fight for environmental justice would go on.</p>
        
            <p>"No abusive company, lawsuit, or court decision will change that," she said in a statement on Wednesday after the verdict was handed down.</p>
        
            <p>Oil Change International echoed that tone: "We will continue to resist and hold corporations accountable because our future depends on it," said the group's US campaign manager Collin Rees.</p>
