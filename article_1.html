        <h2>Live: Thousands join hīkoi as it heads to Ihumātao</h2>
        <p>
Crowds are swelling in Ōkahu Bay and Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) as well as in Christchurch for the South Island hīkoi.
</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of supporters of the hīkoi mō te Tiriti - a march traversing the length of Aotearoa in protest against the Treaty Principles Bill and government policies impacting Māori - are on their way to Auckland's Ihumātao.</p>
        
            <p>Cars have filled the sides of the road leading into Ihumātao and a car park has been set up nearby to accommodate more vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, crowds are swelling in Ōkahu Bay and Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) in inner-east Auckland as the hīkoi mō te Takutai Moana convoy arrive.</p>
        
            <p>And in the South Island, more than 1000 people have met under the Bridge of Remembrance in Christchurch, with more people filing in from all directions ahead of the hīkoi event there.</p>
