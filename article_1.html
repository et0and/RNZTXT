        <h2>Far from Hollywood's wealth, Los Angeles fire survivors feel forgotten</h2>
        <p>
Residents of Los Angeles suburb of Altadena say they are concerned they are not a priority when it comes to government resources, insurance companies and emergency services.

            <p>In the close-knit Los Angeles suburb of Altadena, where rows of neat bungalows once nestled in the shadow of the San Gabriel mountains, smouldering ruins and the skeletal frames of burnt out cars now lie.</p>
        
            <p>While the fires that had devastated celebrity neighbourhoods near Malibu caught the world's attention, a similar size blaze in Eaton Canyon, north of Los Angeles, had ravaged Altadena, a racially and economically diverse community.</p>
        
            <p>Black and Latino families had lived in Altadena for generations and the suburb was also popular with younger artists and engineers working at the nearby NASA rocket lab, who were attracted by the small town vibe and access to nature.</p>
        
            <p>Many residents told Reuters they were concerned government resources would be channelled towards high-profile areas popular with A-Listers, while insurance companies might short-change less affluent households that didn't have the financial means to contest fire claims.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not going to give you the value of your house ... if they do you really have to fight for it," Kay Young, 63, said as her eyes welled up with tears and she stared at a sprawl of smoking rubble, the remnants of a home that had been in her family for generations.</p>

            <p>Inez Moore, 40, whose family home in Altadena was destroyed by the fire, said communities like theirs would likely suffer financially more than wealthier suburbs because many people didn't have the resources or experience to navigate complex bureaucratic systems.</p>
        
            <p>"You're going to have some folks who are not going to get as much as they deserve, and some folks who may get more than actually they need," Moore, a lecturer at California State University, said.</p>
        
            <p>Moore, Young and several other residents told Reuters they didn't see any fire engines in Altadena in the early hours of Wednesday when they fled flames engulfing their community, fuelling a resentment that their neighbourhood wasn't a priority.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't get help here. I don't know where everybody was," Jocelyn Tavares, 32, said as her sister and daughter dug through the smoking debris of a life upended - a child's bicycle half-melted, a solitary cup miraculously spared from the flames.</p>
        
            <p>Los Angeles County Fire Department did not respond to a request for comment about the residents' complaints.</p>

            <p>Since breaking out on Tuesday night, the Eaton Fire had killed at least five people and grown to 13,690 acres as of Thursday night, consuming much of the northern half of Altadena, an unincorporated community of some 40,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>As late as 1960, Altadena was almost entirely white. As new highways built in urban renewal projects tore apart Los Angeles neighbourhoods, African American families began buying homes in what remained for decades a relatively affordable community.</p>
        
            <p>Residents told Reuters they paid around $50,000 for a three-bedroom home in Altadena in the 1970s. The same house would cost more than $1 million today.</p>
        
            <p>By 1990, nearly 40% of residents were Black. Today, about 18% were Black, 49% white and 27% were Hispanic or Latino, according to the US Census Bureau.</p>
        
            <p>Altadena residents voiced concerns that the area may become more gentrified if families who had lived there for generations could not secure insurance payouts to cover the cost to rebuild a home that they bought cheap decades ago.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the widespread wreckage, many locals were upbeat about the community rising from the ashes, sharing tales of narrow escapes and memories of decades spent growing up together with neighbours who were now sharing in the disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"There are rows of us that went to school together," Young said, gesturing to a vast stretch of scorched foundations.</p>
        
            <p>A clerk in the City of Los Angeles Michael McCarthy, 68, said his home was saved by a neighbour who risked his life by staying behind after everyone else had fled, using a hose to spray water on their roofs.</p>
        
            <p>"I know this community will rebuild, everybody knows everybody here, everybody loves everybody," McCarthy said, who was due to retire this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, I got a new job now, and that's putting all this back together and do what I can for the neighbourhood."</p>
