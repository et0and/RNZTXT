            <p>The man charged with the murder of Yanfei Bao has appeared in court for the first time since her remains were found last month.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao appeared for a callover in the High Court at Christchurch on Friday, via audio-visual link.</p>
        
            <p>The 53-year-old was intially charged with Bao's kidnapping but was later charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>He has pleaded not guilty to the killing and will face trial on 21 October.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the court heard that "all matters remained on track" for his scheduled trial date.</p>
        
            <p>The murder accused, who was wearing a green top, glasses and had visibly longer hair, did not have an interpreter in court.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutor Pip Currie said some Crown witnesses at the trial would require an interpreter.</p>
        
            <p>Police investigating Bao's disappearance confirmed the discovery of remains in an area of private farmland in the Greenpark area south of Christchurch on 30 July.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said on the day she was "confident" the remains - that were exhumed from a shallow grave along a tree line - belonged to the missing real estate agent.</p>
        
            <p>Bao's remains were accepted by the Coroner three days later.</p>
        
            <p>"This news brings to a close a key aspect of our investigation and Yanfei will now be returned to her family," Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year-old real estate agent went missing from the Christchurch suburb of Hornby in July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The scene examination at the property Bao's remains were found at has been completed.</p>
