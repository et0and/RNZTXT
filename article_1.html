            <p>Sir Robert Gillies has been laid to rest at Kauae Cemetery in Rotorua alongside his wife.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds attended a service for the man who was the last remaining member of the Māori battalion, where his body rode on a gun carriage as he went past his marae for the final time.</p>
        
            <p>Waiata and kapa haka ran out across Te Papaiouru Marae as the haukāinga entertained the masses coming to pay their respects to Sir Robert Gillies.</p>
        
            <p>At age 99, he was the last man standing from the Māori battalion, serving in B company from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the service, Major General Rose King read out his contributions during World War Two.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Force Air Marshal Tony Davies said Tā Bom embodied the values of the Māori battalion: spirit, courage, comradeship and commitment.</p>
        
            <p>"Very sad, but it was a time to think about everything that Sir Robert meant to us and to the army and to the entire defence force," Davies said.</p>
        
            <p>He also acknowledged Tā Gillies as the driving force behind getting more recognition for Māori soldiers through a Waitangi Tribunal claim.</p>
        
            <p>Also in attendance was Returned Services Association president, Sir Wayne Shelford, who recalled catching up with Tā Gillies at different parties when he would visit Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Buck's father was also in the 28th Māori Battalion and was on the last flight to Europe with Tā Bom.</p>

            <p>"The Māori battalion were very good at what they done and got treated like crap really, what is sad but that's what happened in those days but still happening today but in smaller parts, in the RSA's it's happening," Sir Wayne said.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Bom was lifted away from his marae to St Faith's church by his whānau.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force conducted a guard of honour, while mourners performed a haka.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Vietnam veteran Miki Apiti who said although his wairua was saddened by his death, coming to the service was the honourable thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unhappy, my wairua is unhappy, it's settled although a bit of a sorrow there but just to be here on this day to say good-bye to this gentleman," Apiti said.</p>
        
            <p>After a small karakia inside St Faith's with his Whānau only, Sir Robert's body was lifted on to a gun carriage as he left the church for the final time.</p>
        
            <p>The defence also performed a gun salute in his honour.</p>
        
            <p>As Tā Gillies was driven down to Tunohopu Marae, one of the men barring the Māori battalion battle honours flag was Harawira Pearless.</p>
        
            <p>Only last year was the first time it was raised publicly, something Sir Bom had been calling for for a long time.</p>
        
            <p>Pearless said although there is still more work to do in certain areas, some of his hopes were met.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Robert's instructions and his wishes were clear and they were fulfilled in that there is also now a 28th Māori battalion campaign and battle honours flag housed at the 28th Māori Battalion memorial house on the Waitangi Treaty grounds," Pearless said.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert was transferred into his own van named Bedford which he had owned for decades. In the back jumped all his mokos as they drove off to Kauae cemetery.</p>
        
            <p>He was buried alongside his wife and leaves behind a legacy of fighting for Māori soldiers, long after returning home from the war.</p>
