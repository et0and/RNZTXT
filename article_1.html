        <h2>'Extremely dangerous': Police hunting for man after fatal Ponsonby Road shooting</h2>
        <p>
Police say members of the public should not approach a man believed to be behind the shooting.
</p>
        
            <p>Police are searching for an "extremely dangerous" man believed to be behind a fatal shooting on Auckland's Ponsonby Road.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry said emergency services responded to reports of a gun being fired outside an address on Ponsonby Road about 10.20pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 10.15pm, a group of four people, including the victim, exited a parked car on Ponsonby Road and walked in the man's direction," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>He said multiple shots had been fired and police later found the victim dead at the scene.</p>

            <p>The group of people who were with the victim at the time of the shooting were co-operating with investigators and were "very upset", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said it was difficult to say whether the multiple shots fired were targeting one person or various people, as the scene examination was still under way.</p>
        
            <p>Police are now hunting a person who they say is extremely dangerous and that members of the public should not approach him.</p>
        
            <p>"If you see him or know who he is, please phone 111 immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone concealing his identity or whereabouts could find themselves facing prosecution, Barry said.</p>

            <p>The man is described as being of large build, with dark hair and facial hair, and has a large tattoo on his left forearm.</p>
        
            <p>"Earlier on Sunday evening, this man tried to enter a bar on Ponsonby Road, however was denied entry as it was closing."</p>
        
            <p>The time between the suspect being denied entry and the shooting was a matter of minutes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>After the shooting, he was seen walking south on Ponsonby Road, in direction of Richmond Road.</p>
        
            <p>The motivation behind the shooting was not yet clear, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can be certain we will piece together why this shocking incident occurred last night."</p>

            <p>It was difficult to say yet if the shooting was gang related, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were aware of the concerns in the community due to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We know unease in the community, particularly as police have not yet made an arrest. However, we would like to reassure Ponsonby residents and the wider community that a dedicated police team are working diligently to hold this person to account," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said a section of Ponsonby Road, between Richmond Road and Franklin Road, was closed due to an incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Avoid this area or expect delays with diversions in place affecting all traffic, including bus services."</p>

            <p>Police scene guards are expected to be stood down later on Monday afternoon, but a police presence will remain in the area.</p>
