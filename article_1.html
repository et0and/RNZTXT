            <p>Downpours and thunderstorms are set to hit large parts of the North Island, with the deluge potentially continuing into Boxing Day for some.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a severe thunderstorm watch, covering Northland, Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Taupo, Taihape from Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"These thunderstorms may become severe bringing localised rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm per hour," MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips."</p>
        
            <p>The rain is expected to set in from the afternoon, with the warning lasting until 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>However, Plenty, including Rotorua, and Waikato, may potentially face heavy rain all the way through to Boxing Day.</p>
