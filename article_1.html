            <p>A vegetation fire burning on Christchurch's Port Hills has been contained.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said three fire crews and three helicopters were continuing to dampen down the fire, but it was now under control.</p>
        
            <p>The helicopters were expected to land shortly and firefighters on the ground would be joined by two high-country brigades to help mop up the fire.</p>
        
            <p>No buildings had been threatened by the fire, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters contained the fire about 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 76 was still closed between Port Hills Road and Chapmans Road, to allow firefighters to carry out their work.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were advised to avoid the area if possible, though alternative routes were available.</p>
        
            <p>A video taken by witness Callum Templeton showed a helicopter using a monsoon bucket to dump water on the fire.</p>

            <p>Angela Fitzgibbon from Avoca Valley earlier said the fire was quite near a property where she kept her horses, so she was evacuating them to another property just to be safe.</p>
        
            <p>The weather is sunny and warm in Christchurch today with just a light breeze. It rained briefly in parts of Christchurch this morning. The Port Hills are relatively green at the moment after a moderately wet spring.</p>
