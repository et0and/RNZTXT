            <p>Hayden Wilde has claimed a silver in the men's triathlon at f the Paris Olympics after a last-minute surge from favourite Alex Yee of Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>After finishing near the middle of the pack in the swimming leg, Wilde made up ground in the cycling.</p>
        
            <p>He took the lead at the start of the running leg and held it for nearly 10km, at one stage opening up a lead of 15 seconds over Yee.</p>
        
            <p>But in the final minute, Yee overtook him to claim the gold.</p>
        
            <p>An exhausted Wilde crossed the line to take silver, while Frenchman Leo Bergere took the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Wilde's teammate Dylan McCullough finished 19th.</p>
        
            <p>During the cycling, McCullough had been part of the lead group for a long time, well ahead of Wilde in the chase group. However, he dropped back to create a slipstream for Wilde and make it easier for him to gain ground.</p>
        
            <p>After crossing the finish line, Wilde waited at the end of the chute for McCullough to finish before going through marshalling.</p>
        
            <p>He gave McCullough a big hug and pat on the back for the work his teammate did for him on the bike leg.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
