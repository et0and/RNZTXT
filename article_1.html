            <p>Investors will only have to remain in New Zealand for 21 days to gain residency under changes to the so-called 'golden visa' to attract wealthy investors to New Zealand, Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced the government was making changes to modernise the visa settings and attract foreign investment.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, the Active Investor Plus visa will be replaced with two, simplified investment categories.</p>
        
            <p>The first, 'The Growth' category, will focus on higher-risk investments, including direct investments in New Zealand businesses.</p>
        
            <p>It will require a minimum investment of $5 million for a minimum period of three years.</p>
        
            <p>The second, 'The Balanced' category, will focus on mixed investments, with the ability to choose ones that are lower risk.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a minimum investment of $10 million over five years.</p>
        
            <p>Other changes include expanding the scope of acceptable investments and removing potential barriers to investment, like the English language requirement.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Morning Report on Monday, Stanford said foreign investors would have to put their money into equity under a new residency scheme, not just leave it in a bank account.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, it doesn't sit in a bank account for a start. I mean, that's a fallacy. It has to be invested in equities, or bonds, or into property development, or commercial property, or philanthropy. Those are the categories.</p>
        
            <p>"And, look, it's really important that we have more capital in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said investors had not raised the issue of being unable to buy a house under the scheme, although she said "we're certainly having those conversations", but instead had brought up the barrier of foreign tax rules.</p>
        
            <p>However, she had confirmed that an investor would only have to remain in the country for a total of 21 days to satisfy the terms of their visa under 'The Growth' category.</p>
        
            <p>While an investor under 'The Balanced' category would have to remain for 105 days.</p>
        
            <p>"If you want to be able to buy a house and become a permanent resident or a citizen, then you need to fulfill the criteria like everyone else, which is a lot more. You need to be a tax resident and spend dozens and dozens."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the requirement for investors to remain in the country was a "turn off".</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, these are incredible investors with tens of millions and they flit all around the world. And when they see something like, 'Oh, I've got to spend multiple weeks per year for the first couple of years in New Zealand', that's a turn off."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Labour's Immigration spokesperson said there is a need for foreign investment, but what the Government's scheme is not a plan for growth.</p>
        
            <p>Phil Twyford told Morning Report the government had loosened the rules to make it easier for people applying for the foreign investor visa to park their money in passive investments that would not necessary create any jobs or economic opportunities for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration lawyer Nick Mason told Morning Report there has always been a lot of interest in coming to New Zealand, but people were being turned away under the previous active investor category.</p>
        
            <p>"The previous category was just too hard. There were too many hoops to jump through. This will make it much easier."</p>
        
            <p>"There's no guarantee that people won't just be passive and that sort of stuff. But we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And so ultimately, I think it's a great thing for the economy."</p>
        
            <p>While Mason agreed being in the country for only one week a year did not seem like a huge committment to New Zealand, he said, in his experience, people will spend far longer than that.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not quite sure why it was set at just three weeks, because it does seem very minimal. But I guess on the other side, you do have at least $5 million of active investment in New Zealand, whether it's a managed fund, which is of limited benefit. But if we are making direct investments into New Zealand companies, that's going to be really worthwhile."</p>
