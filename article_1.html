            <p>Witnesses have described chaotic, confronting and confusing scenes inside Westfield Bondi Junction as multiple people were stabbed before an armed man was killed by police.</p>
        
            <p>Shoppers and employees began to notice something was not right just before 4pm on Saturday, when the first signs of trouble included people running inside the eastern-Sydney centre.</p>
        
            <p>Max Barnsley, who works on the fifth floor, said he initially did not think anything of it.</p>
        
            <p>"But it went on for too long," Barnsley said.</p>
        
            <p>Shops went into lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just in the back room, on the phone with police, trying to figure out what's going on," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A shopper, Kelly, saw people running and screaming.</p>
        
            <p>She also saw an injured man and woman, and initially thought they had been shot after hearing a gunshot.</p>
        
            <p>"All the shops shut their doors," Kelly said.</p>
        
            <p>"We couldn't get in, they wouldn't let us in. We just ran down the fire escape.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I was going to die. I thought we were going to be shot and killed. We thought he had a gun. We didn't know it was a knife."</p>

            <p>Many witnesses sheltered inside locked businesses.</p>
        
            <p>One witness, who asked not to be identified, said he was near the Country Road store when he saw a man in a green shirt start stabbing others "indiscriminately".</p>
        
            <p>"[We just heard] screaming, screaming and it didn't seem that long before we heard 'boom boom boom' of the gunshot and we thought, 'We hope it's the police,'" the witness told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"[A person] is dying 10 metres away... I grabbed towels and there were three people dying around me.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just carnage."</p>
        
            <p>Vernon Michael said he had been at Sourdough Bakery where a woman was stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>Then came yelled instructions to "run".</p>
        
            <p>He said minutes later, he saw a man armed with a large knife on an escalator.</p>
        
            <p>"Just really calmly, he was walking like he was just having an ice cream in the park," Michael said.</p>
        
            <p>Within a minute, he said he heard three gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>An evacuation followed, as dozens of ambulances waited in streets outside.</p>
        
            <p>Brendan Blomeley, who was in the centre with his 13-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son, fled the centre with "thousands of others".</p>
        
            <p>"It was harrowing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in the store with tonnes of other people but the police were brilliant and the response rate was excellent."</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police said the armed man was confronted by a senior officer and shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>Many who were not inside the centre endured anxious waits to find out whether their loved ones were safe.</p>
        
            <p>Others have now headed to hospitals, including St Vincent's, where the injured are being treated.</p>
        
            <p>Outside the hospital, Isaac Weinberg said his wife Yvonne was one of those who was stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't know what had happened. They said [she was] stabbed in the top-right corner of her back.</p>
        
            <p>"She thought she got punched and then she touched herself and there was blood.</p>
        
            <p>"Apart from that she's OK. She's alive and that's all that matters."</p>
        
            <p>Senior police have said they believe the man acted alone.</p>
        
            <p>They say they have so far not discovered anything at the scene to indicate his motive or ideology.</p>
