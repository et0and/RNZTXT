            <p>"I won't be home late tonight," Raymond Mathews said to his wife, Marie, as he shot out the door to join his mates at golf in Ngāruawāhia on the morning of 9 August, last year.</p>
        
            <p>The 80-year-old hopped in his Hyundai and began the approximate 11km trip from his Rototuna, Hamilton home.</p>
        
            <p>Around the same time, Vanessa Helen Railey jumped in her car and pulled away from her house. She was travelling with kids in her car.</p>
        
            <p>It would not be long before their two worlds met in the most tragic circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>A camera on the Horotiu Bridge Rd, about 3km before the golf club, showed Railey's vehicle travelling 34 seconds behind Mathews.</p>
        
            <p>Arriving at the turn-off to the club, Mathews pulled to the middle of the road, turned on his blinker, and waited for oncoming traffic before turning right.</p>
        
            <p>He never made it.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the 37-year-old Railey ploughed straight into the back of him at full speed.</p>
        
            <p>There were no brake marks.</p>
        
            <p>Mathews' vehicle was hit with such force it was shunted 83m down the road into a ditch.</p>
        
            <p>His golf buddies were in the carpark, waiting for him. They heard the unmistakable sound of a crash and ran to the scene, where they discovered it was their mate involved.</p>
        
            <p>Golf was cancelled, and they went inside the clubhouse for a drink in their friend's honour instead.</p>
        
            <p>Mathews died of his injuries nine days later.</p>
        
            <p>Analysis of Railey's blood found it was five times the tolerance limit of meth at 50ng/ml, and three times over the cannabis tolerance at 3ng/ml.</p>
        
            <p>Railey told police she saw Mathews's vehicle as she approached and thought she had enough space to go around him.</p>
        
            <p>She initially denied having taken any drugs and could not explain her high drug readings.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Railey appeared in the Hamilton District Court for sentencing on charges of drug driving causing death and injury. She sat emotionless throughout the marathon hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Mathews' daughter, Lisa, told Railey she'd been waiting one year and four months to speak to her, to outline the "utter devastation and heartbreak" her actions had caused.</p>
        
            <p>"I really struggle with the word accident. Vanessa didn't accidentally consume methamphetamine, nor did she accidentally smoke cannabis.</p>
        
            <p>"It was not an accident that she got into her car... yet you chose to do drugs, you chose to drive under the influence.</p>
        
            <p>"Your actions were deliberate, utterly stupid, and selfish.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that every day for the rest of your life you are reminded of the pain and devastation you have caused."</p>
        
            <p>She also spoke of how active her father was. He mowed up to 30 lawns and played three rounds of golf a week.</p>
        
            <p>Lisa added he would be "gutted" to know he'd been killed by a drug-driver given he worked 43 years as a sales rep, travelling up to 50,000km a year, and not once been involved in a crash.</p>
        
            <p>Before counsel Gerard Walsh got a chance to speak, Judge Philip Crayton told him Railey's explanation about how much, and when, she consumed drugs before the crash "just couldn't be true".</p>
        
            <p>Railey told two separate report writers that she'd smoked "two puffs" of meth two nights prior, and smoked cannabis the night before.</p>
        
            <p>"Walsh you know that doesn't stack up, everyone here knows that doesn't stack up... it's just absolute rubbish."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Crayton adjourned the case briefly so Walsh could talk to his client to see if she could refresh her memory.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh returned to tell the judge she accepted drug use was a daily occurrence at that point and drug tests "speak for themselves".</p>
        
            <p>He added that she was genuinely remorseful and did want to attend a restorative justice conference but it was declined.</p>
        
            <p>"She is so, so sorry. Whatever she says cannot bring people back and cannot undo the harm that has been done."</p>
        
            <p>Her "addiction was ruling" at the time of the crash, but she was currently in the "early days" of turning a corner on that, as she had begun taking rehabilitative courses.</p>
        
            <p>He pushed for the judge to hand down a home detention sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Crown solicitor Kasey Dillon told the judge given the lengths he had to go to get Railey to accept her drug-driving culpability during the hearing, she was not genuinely remorseful.</p>
        
            <p>"Two puffs a couple of nights before? I do not accept that you can ascribe the remorse as genuine in this case."</p>
        
            <p>Dillon suggested the judge hand down a short jail term instead of converting it to home detention, if he got below two years.</p>
        
            <p>As he began to deliver his decision, Judge Crayton explained he could not find any case law in a case like this where an offender who was sentenced to less than two years did not get it converted to home detention.</p>
        
            <p>He then told Railey that if she didn't "allow this event to be a transformative and life-changing event for you then you will not... have shown what I would call true remorse for your actions".</p>
        
            <p>"This should be a life-changing event for you because you took somebody's life.</p>
        
            <p>"You have affected all these people by your choices, by your decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"It should be a turning point and if this isn't, I do not know what it would take."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Crayton said she should have admitted her drug use a lot earlier.</p>
        
            <p>"To be blunt with you, that should not have been a difficult concession given your description of drug misuse and drug use given to various report writers."</p>
        
            <p>She knew she was high on drugs at the time but had struggled to accept it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no escaping it. It wasn't your driving, it was your decision to drive when you were in that state."</p>
        
            <p>He accepted Dillon's submission about remorse and declined to issue any discount given the "deceptive nature" to which she recounted her drug use to report writers.</p>
        
            <p>After taking a starting point of three years and eight months' jail, and applying various discounts, he got down to two years' prison.</p>
        
            <p>He agreed to convert that to 12 months of home detention with conditions banning drugs and alcohol and urged her to take part in driving courses including the Right Track programme.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Crayton also disqualified her from driving for three years and ordered her to pay reparation of $400 to cover the insurance excess, and costs of $1784.77.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to NZME outside court, Mathews' daughter Kim said they knew Railey would never go to jail.</p>
        
            <p>"Right from the get-go we've had little faith in the justice system and we knew that she wouldn't get anywhere near what we wanted.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to see her go to prison, even if for a short amount of time to give her some solitude to think about how she lives her life."</p>
        
            <p>As for attending a restorative justice conference, Kim felt she only wanted to do it for the discount.</p>
        
            <p>"Not once has she ever made any effort to apologise to us. We've had nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Barry Mathews noticed how Railey sat stoically in the dock throughout proceedings, not showing any emotion.</p>
        
            <p>The fact she got a speeding ticket the day after the fatal crash also showed a lack of insight and only fuelled the family's cynicism about her ability to remain drug-free, he said.</p>
