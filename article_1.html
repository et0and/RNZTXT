            <p>The woman found dead in Wellington harbour was a 60-year-old Hutt Valley woman who had recently been living in Levin.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called about 8am on Sunday after the woman was found in the water off M훮hina Bay, between the suburbs of Point Howard and Eastbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said police had now formally identified her but were not in a position to release her name yet.</p>
        
            <p>"We send our condolences her family and friends at this difficult time and are providing ongoing support.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are continuing to make inquiries to establish the circumstances of how she entered the water."</p>
        
            <p>A resident who lived near Marine Drive told RNZ on Monday the area was peaceful and "everyone knew everyone".</p>
        
            <p>"It's really unfortunate, you know, finding about the news," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty sad, yeah, it's quite shocking."</p>
        
            <p>Another man living in York Bay, less than one kilometre away from M훮hina Bay, said he was horrified by what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm from Los Angeles, so I'm used to bad areas, but this has always been a very safe place - that's why we moved here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Tupua Horo Nuku project - a 4.4km walking and cycling path on top of a new seawall - has been under construction on Marine Drive near York Bay since January.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter observed that that the walking path at M훮hina Bay was very narrow and crumbly with a steep slope down onto the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Police asked that if anyone had information that could assist them with the investigation that they call 105 or make a report online at 105.police.govt.nz using 'Update Report' and reference file number 240421/0290.</p>
