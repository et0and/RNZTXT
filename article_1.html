            <p>Donald Trump is safe and a shooter and a male adult bystander dead after multiple shots rang out at a rally by the Republican presidential candidate in Pennsylvania.</p>
        
            <p>Two other men were critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of FBI Pittsburgh field office, said the FBI was not prepared to identify the shooter and did not have a motive for the incident that left one person dead and two injured.</p>
        
            <p>"This evening, we had what we are calling an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. It's still an active crime scene," Rojek said during a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>The FBI was still working out his motive. It is expected his name will be released in the next few hours.</p>
        
            <p>US media say the gunman is a 20-year-old from Pennsylvania.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has now left the area where the shooting occurred, and footage has been posted by one of his staff of him walking unaided down the steps of his plane.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple inquiries are underway. The FBI is the lead investigator and its director, Christopher Wray, has briefed US President Joe Biden and the National Security Council. The Secret Service is under scrutiny over potential failings in how it handled security at the site of the rally, the BBC says.</p>
