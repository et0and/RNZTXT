            <p>Politicians past and present have paid their respects to Dame Tariana Turia - with Labour MP Willie Jackson saying the party should consider a formal apology to her whānau over her treatment during the Foreshore and Seabed controversy.</p>
        
            <p>The final group of manuhiri was welcomed onto Whangaehu Marae south of Whanganui on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Among the speakers was Sir Pita Sharples - who led Te Pāti Māori with Dame Tariana at its founding.</p>
        
            <p>Many other politicians were in attendance, including Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, accompanied by Ministers Nicola Willis, Tama Potaka, Mark Mitchell and Shane Jones.</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Bill English - a close friend of Dame Tariana - was also there.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of the opposition Chris Hipkins and several other Labour MPs also paid their respects.</p>
        
            <p>During his speech on the marae, leader of the Labour Māori Caucus Willie Jackson apologised to Dame Tariana for her treatment during the Foreshore and Seabed controversy.</p>
        
            <p>"My own personal view is that I think Labour should consider an apology in the future to her whānau and iwi because I think what happened to her was tragic in many ways," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said there should have been a way for her to give her view while retaining her ministerial position within Labour.</p>
        
            <p>The wider party should consider a formal apology to Dame Tariana and her iwi, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau spokesperson Che Wilson said it was heartfelt to hear the apology on the marae today.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day organisers of the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti were among the manuhiri - they posthumously gifted a banner that was carried at the front of the hīkoi to Dame Tariana.</p>
        
            <p>November's hīkoi, which culminated in 40,000 people descending on Parliament, was inspired by Dame Tariana's advocacy for Māori rights, organiser Eru Kapa-Kingi said.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow is the final day of the tangi - ending with the nehu or burial of Dame Tariana.</p>
        
            <p>Che Wilson said the services tomorrow will begin with karakia followed by a church service to 'send Auntie on her way.'</p>
        
            <p>"She'll [then] be taken to the urupā by Uncle George [Turia] and all the family and then once that's finished we really ask people to stay to have a kai, because we will be catering for everyone and it's often really easy for people to leave but there will be takeaway boxes."</p>
