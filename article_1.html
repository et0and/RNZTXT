            <p>Low fog across Wellington has caused major travel disruption for flights in and out of the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Four departing flights were cancelled and at least eight have been delayed, with three of them postponed indefinitely.</p>
        
            <p>The longest delay was for the 5pm flight to Christchurch, which was delayed by an hour and a half.</p>
        
            <p>Nine flights due to arrive in Wellington have also been cancelled and two were diverted.</p>
        
            <p>These included an Air New Zealand flight from Invercargill that diverted to Dunedin and a flight from Rotorua that was diverted to Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>The fog was visible to Wellingtonians on Sunday afternoon, with the peak of Mt Victoria and the hills near Ngaio and Khandallah hidden by cloud.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport spokesperson Phil Rennie confirmed the disruption was due to low visibility.</p>
        
            <p>"Several arriving flights have been diverted to other ports and several departing flights have been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>"Passengers are advised to check directly with their airlines for the latest information."</p>
        
            <p>According to Wellington Airport, delays and cancellations are expected until later this evening, with the latest flight affected being the 8.30pm service from Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists have also been impacted, with fog causing visibility issues over the Transmission Gully Motorway near the Wainui Saddle.</p>
