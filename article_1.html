        <p>
MetService has extended its heavy rain warnings for Hawke's Bay until 11pm.

            <p>MetService has extended its heavy rain warnings for Hawke's Bay until 11pm - but those for Gisborne have been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>While further periods of rain or showers are expected on the East Coast through until Friday, the amounts are expected to be well below warning criteria, the forecaster says.</p>
        
            <p>And previously flooded roads are reopening across Gisborne and Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>However, despite some roads reopening, NZTA is warning people to avoid unnecessary travel in Hawke's Bay and Tai RƒÅwhiti as strong winds and heavy rain continue.</p>
