            <p>The crash happened during the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa about 2pm on Sunday, and also killed 15-year-old driver Brooklyn Horan, who was named earlier on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes to the teen have emergied on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Hodgson Motorsport posted on Facebook on Monday: "It is with a very heavy heart that today we heard the absolutely devastating news that Brooklyn passed away doing the very thing we grew to love together as families.</p>
        
            <p>"It's times like these that you remember that the sport we chose comes with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows."</p>
        
            <p>"Brooklyn you were an amazing kind loving happy kid and that hadn't changed years later when we crossed paths again back at off-roading last year, the cheeky smile was still the same, you had just grown a weeee bit taller."</p>

            <p>ORANZ, the governing body for off-road racing in New Zealand, posted: "Our thoughts go out to family & friends of Brooklyn Horan from all of the off roading community. You were a huge talent in multiple motorsports."</p>
        
            <p>A large number of the motorsport community on Facebook turned their profile pictures black in tribute.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, MotorSport New Zealand confirmed two competitors died after one car went off the road at the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa.</p>
        
            <p>Police and emergency services were called to the scene at approximately 2pm, but the competitors died before they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of these two competitors and all involved with the Arcadia Road Rallysprint," said MotorSport New Zealand president Wayne Christie at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole motorsport community will be understandably shocked and upset by this terrible tragedy. We will be offering support to all those involved in the coming days."</p>
        
            <p>MotorSport New Zealand said it would cooperate with all investigating agencies as well as undertake its own full and thorough investigation.</p>
        
            <p>According to the rules on the MotorSport New Zealand website, the junior driver program "allows people aged between 12 and 16 the ability to obtain a competition licence with a few extra steps".</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Elton Goonan told Morning Report they were still trying to compile the details of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"The car veered off the road into a ditch, and that's as much as I know at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no suggestion rules needed to change at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our rules we set in alignment with our international governing body and they've been in place nearly 75 years now, so it's something we definitely don't want a knee-jerk reaction on, but it's something that will definitely be looked at very very closely."</p>
