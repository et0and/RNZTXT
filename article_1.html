        <h2>Watch live: Luxon in the hot seat at first Question Time of 2025</h2>
        <p>
Chris Hipkins and the prime minister are set to clash for the first time this year as Parliament gets back to business.
</p>
        
            <p>We'll be livestreaming Question Time at the top of this page from about 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>MPs are sitting for their first Question Time of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>While Parliament has resumed this week, on Tuesday there was no Question Time due to the Prime Minister's statement and the debate in reply.</p>
        
            <p>There are still nine hours and 45 minutes of that debate remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the new Transport Minister Chris Bishop confirmed the reversal of speed limit reductions on 38 sections of state highway.</p>
        
            <p>He will face a question on that announcement from the Wairarapa MP Mike Butterick, who was also at the announcement.</p>

            <p>Nicola Willis will face her first question in the Economic Growth portfolio, while there will also be questions from government MPs to ministers on their recent announcements around Invest New Zealand, education, and digital nomads.</p>
        
            <p>These questions, nicknamed 'patsy' questions, allow ministers to get announcements they have already made recorded into Hansard, Parliament's permanent and public record.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister will face questions from all three opposition parties. Labour will also ask Nicola Willis about her Economic Growth role.</p>
        
            <p>New Health Minister Simeon Brown will face his first question from the opposition, with Labour's Peeni Henare set to ask him about equitable healthcare.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Kieran McAnulty will ask Tama Potaka about emergency housing, and his colleague Cushla Tangaere-Manuel will ask the new Tourism Minister Louise Upston for more specifics on the digital nomads announcement. Upston will also face a question from the Greens' Ricardo Menéndez March about child poverty reduction.</p>
        
            <p>1. Cameron Brewer to the Minister for Economic Growth: What are her priorities for the economic growth portfolio?</p>
        
            <p>2. Rt Hon Chris Hipkins to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?</p>
        
            <p>3. Mike Butterick to the Minister of Transport: What announcements has he made regarding speed limits?</p>
        
            <p>4. Chlöe Swarbrick to the Prime Minister: E tautoko ana ia i ngā kōrero me ngā mahi katoa a tōna Kāwanatanga? (Does he stand by all of his Government's statements and actions?)</p>
        
            <p>5. Hon Barbara Edmonds to the Minister of Finance: What responsibility, if any, does she have for economic growth, and does the current recession reflect on her execution of that responsibility?</p>
        
            <p>6. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?</p>
        
            <p>7. Hon Peeni Henare to the Minister of Health: Is he committed to equitable healthcare for all New Zealanders; if not, why not?</p>
        
            <p>8. Carl Bates to the Minister of Education: What actions has the Government taken to lift achievement in literacy and numeracy as part of its plan to teach the basics brilliantly?</p>
        
            <p>9. Hon Kieran McAnulty to the Associate Minister of Housing: Does he agree with Andrew Crisp, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, who said that "both the register and people that apply does not represent effectively ... severe housing deprivation"; if so, is he confident that the need for emergency housing has reduced?</p>
        
            <p>10. Nancy Lu to the Minister for Trade and Investment: What recent announcements has the Government made about boosting economic growth?</p>
        
            <p>11. Cushla Tangaere-Manuel to the Minister for Tourism and Hospitality: How many additional tourists are projected to visit New Zealand as a result of the digital nomads policy, and what, if any, is the estimated amount of economic benefit from this policy?</p>
        
            <p>12. Ricardo Menéndez March to the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction: Does she accept that children living in material hardship are more likely to do poorer in school due to a lack of food; if so, why did the Government remove food insecurity from the Child Poverty Related Indicators?</p>
