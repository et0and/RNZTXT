        <h2>Watch live: Prime Minister and Economic Growth minister speak to media</h2>
        <p>
Since National's State of the Nation speech last week, the pair have been visiting businesses to learn what they need from the government.
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister and Economic Growth minister are speaking to media, following a visit to Fisher and Paykel Healthcare in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are scheduled to speak from about 3.15pm. You can watch via the stream at the top of this story.</p>
        
            <p>Since National's State of the Nation speech last week, Christopher Luxon and Nicola Willis have been visiting businesses to learn what they need from the government in the economic growth space.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the pair visited IT company Datacom, to learn about Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Friday, the health minister confirmed the government's plans for the Dunedin Hospital inpatient building, confirming it will have 351 beds, with the capacity to expand to 404.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown said the hospital would be future-proofed so it would be able to expand according to the community's needs. The hospital had become a controversial issue for the government after it put the build on hold last year, amid concerns with cost blow-outs.</p>
        
            <p>Resources Minister Shane Jones has also released the government's minerals strategy, releasing a list of 37 minerals alongside a strategy document that outlined the government's plan to double mineral sector exports to $3 billion by 2035.</p>
        
            <p>Jones is also refusing to back down on his "send the Mexicans home" comment made in the House on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Ricardo Men√©ndez March has written to the Speaker on the comments, while Mexico's ambassador has raised the matter with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
        
            <p>Despite spending much of the week defending Jones' comments, Winston Peters has now said that "on reflection" the comments "may have been expressed differently."</p>
        
            <p>Jones, however, was unapologetic.</p>
        
            <p>"I was surprised actually, how one colourful remark in Parliament has gathered such traction. But know this from me, these Green five-minute wonders, they'll think twice before taking on the matua again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has so far refused to explicitly condemn Jones' comments, and those made by Peters towards Green MPs Lawrence Xu-Nan and Francisco Hernandez.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, he said those were "not remarks I'd make myself" but told all parties to watch their language.</p>
