        <h2>Squatter waits hours for help after falling three storeys in derelict building</h2>
        <p>
The person waited hours for help to arrive after falling through a collapsed stairwell.

            <p>A squatter has been hurt after falling three storeys through a collapsed stairwell at a boarded-up building in downtown Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Initial reports said multiple people had been injured in the derelict Amora Hotel, but the incident happened at the Pringle House, next door.</p>
        
            <p>The injured person waited hours for help, but was alive and able to speak, Fire and Emergency assistant commander Martin Wilby said.</p>

            <p>Firefighters were planning a floor-by-floor sweep of the building to see if there was anyone else inside, once it was deemed safe to enter.</p>
        
            <p>A number of police cars, ambulances and fire vehicles were parked outside.</p>
        
            <p>The company that owned the building said it had been under control of its insurance company until recently.</p>
        
            <p>Jason Dunn from Prime Property said the empty building was sealed off with security fencing, and internal access has been partially blocked.</p>
        
            <p>There had been issues with people breaking into the building a number of times, with fires being lit in the top floor.</p>

            <p>"They were cutting through all of the steel, all of the ply shutters to actually access that. So we pulled all of that down, sealed the building off, put security fencing against all of the inner walls so that if they broke into the carpark building, they couldn't get in."</p>
        
            <p>Dunn said he had been through the building with five different police squads in the last three months to stop people from entering.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Free Ambulance said it transported one patient in a moderate condition to Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Locals said the building had been a magnet for rough sleepers for months.</p>
        
            <p>"They slept very often just on the walkway, under the small shelter here, against the wall of the building," Anna Proc, who worked next door, said.</p>
        
            <p>But in recent months, she had noticed fewer people outside.</p>
        
            <p>Gabriel Heimler said his landlord's garage, which shared an alleyway with Pringle House, had been broken into and lived in about two months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Since they have closed this building, they are all the time here, I think since Covid."</p>
        
            <p>Dunn said since Prime Property had taken back control of the building from the insurer in February, they had gone to great lengths to secure the building, and rough sleepers had been going to great lengths to break in.</p>
        
            <p>Feasibility studies were under way to decide what to do with the quake-prone building, he said.</p>
