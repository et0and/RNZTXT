        <h2>Tighter seismic risk standards bump up building costs</h2>
        <p>
The higher national standard for seismic design is adding to construction and design costs.

            <p>Building costs are increasing due to tougher design standards to help them withstand earthquakes.</p>
        
            <p>Seismic risk guidelines have been tightening since the 2016 Kaikōura quake - and are rising again.</p>
        
            <p>In one instance, changes since 2022 had added millions to a $90 million water treatment project in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council confirmed to RNZ that cost increases related to addressing seismic risk were around $5m due to higher design and construction prices, including for the building of a large water-retaining structure at the Te Mārua water treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>This comes as the government consults on a higher national standard for seismic design, with the aim it eventually becomes mandatory.</p>
        
            <p>Commercial property lawyer Doran Wyatt said early estimates showed the tighter standards could add 5 to 7 percent to new building costs.</p>
        
            <p>Central to the issue is the national seismic hazard model, which was updated 18 months ago.</p>
        
            <p>Following this, assessed hazard more than doubled in some areas, including in parts of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. It indicated that worse shaking could be expected in a quake than previously thought.</p>
        
            <p>In response, a committee of engineers came up with a new design standard, moving it closer to those in other areas of high seismicity, such as Japan and California, Wyatt said in a post.</p>
        
            <p>While it was only a guideline for now, the standard was on track to be made mandatory, and "it would be sensible to take [it] into account now in the design of new buildings", he said, adding: "A failure to do so could well mean a new building that underperforms."</p>
        
            <p>The cost blow-out for the Wellington water treatment project - which is right next to the Wellington Fault - was due to an earlier design revision.</p>
        
            <p>"The guidance was updated in 2022 and highlights that seismic risks are higher than previously understood," the council said in a statement.</p>
