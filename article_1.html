            <p>Train services in Auckland have mostly been restored, after grinding to a halt earlier on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Now, all rail services are operational, with the exception of the Onehunga line which has been suspended until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said commuters should expect delays and some cancellations while the network recovered from the stoppage.</p>
        
            <p>Technical issue resolved; all rail services are now able to move, except Onehunga line is still currently suspended until further notice.Please expect delays and some individual train cancellations while recovery is in place. Buses are accepting AT HOP cards and rail tickets. https://t.co/4nJsg3k0UW pic.twitter.com/YtxfstwUv7</p>
        
            <p>In an earlier travel alert Auckland Transport said the stoppage was due to a KiwiRail track infrastructure issue meaning all rail services had been held until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers were advised that buses were accepting all AT Hop cards and rail tickets.</p>

            <p>Auckland councillor Richard Hills criticised KiwiRail for shutting down the entire network.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not an engineer but surely there's a better way to manage a track issue than closing down an entire network."</p>
        
            <p>It seemed that although the government had invested $330 million to upgrade the track network it seemed to be less resilient than before.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll say it again Kiwirail must up their game urgently."</p>
        
            <p>I’m not an engineer but surely there’s a better way to manage a track issue than closing down an entire network.Govt only just invested $330m to finally upgrade track network but it feels less resilient than before.I’ll say it again Kiwirail must up their game urgently. https://t.co/wxwXY2T7ZP</p>
        
            <p>There have been a series of train cancellations and delays this month, which have angered Auckland mayor Wayne Brown.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of commuters trying to travel on the Western, Southern and Eastern line train services were affected over one three-day period.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said it was working hard to upgrade train tracks so they wouldn't be affected by heat restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Some trains have been cancelled as speed restrictions were imposed when the tracks became too hot.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agencies overseeing the rail network said the problems causing delays and cancellations needed to be promptly resolved.</p>
        
            <p>Senior leaders from the agencies attended a please explain meeting with Brown on 14 February.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint statement, Auckland Transport, KiwiRail and Auckland One Rail said they would keep Brown updated as they worked together to fix problems.</p>
