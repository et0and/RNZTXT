            <p>Cabinet minister Todd McClay has apologised to the House, after making a comment causing personal offence to a Mexico-born MP.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March, who is from Mexico, raised the comments as a matter of personal offence on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"After the point of order I did in relationship to Tamatha Paul's question, Todd McClay, the minister of trade, threw a barb back saying, quote, as best as I can understand, 'you're not in Mexico now, we don't do things like that here'."</p>

            <p>Menéndez March said he had sought advice from the clerk and consulted with Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Greens MP Teanau Tuiono to confirm what McClay had said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaker Gerry Brownlee asked McClay if that comment was an interjection offered across the House, adding if it was he should withdraw and apologise.</p>
        
            <p>McClay did not deny making the comment, and responded swiftly: "I withdraw and apologise".</p>
        
            <p>MPs in the House could be heard breaking out into more commentary, with some saying "oh my gosh" and "far out", before resuming the session.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Hauraki-Waikato MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke was at the centre of a squabble over her laptop stickers during a session in Parliament.</p>
