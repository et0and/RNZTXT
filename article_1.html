        <h2>Claim Crown agrees evidence against Gail Maney is unreliable</h2>
        <p>
However, the Crown is yet to speak in court in the case relating to a West Auckland murder two decades ago.

            <p>The lawyer for a woman convicted of a West Auckland murder two decades ago says there is agreement from the Crown that the only evidence against her client can no longer be relied on - although the Crown is yet to speak in court.</p>
        
            <p>Gail Maney is appealing her conviction for the murder of Deane Fuller-Sandys alongside Stephen Stone, her brother Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen in the Court of Appeal in Wellington today.</p>
        
            <p>Deane Fuller-Sandys was a West Auckland tyre-fitter who went missing in 1989, and was initially thought to have drowned while fishing on Auckland's west coast.</p>
        
            <p>Maney was found guilty by a jury of ordering Stone to kill Fuller-Sandys after he stole some of her belongings, including drugs. The story was told in the 2018 RNZ/Stuff podcast Gone Fishing.</p>
        
            <p>In the Court of Appeal on Tuesday, Maney's lawyer Julie-Anne Kincade KC said the Crown had agreed there was no reliability to the evidence that implicated her client.</p>

            <p>The evidence was the testimony of one witness, whose name is suppressed, who was the only person to link Maney to the murder.</p>
        
            <p>She later recanted, saying she was leaned on by police to give that story, and has since died.</p>
        
            <p>Kincade said she had shared a written document laying out the problems with the evidence with the Crown's lawyers, Mark Lillico and Don Lye, who had expressed their agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown has not yet been given the opportunity to reply, but Lillico nodded as Kincade spoke.</p>
        
            <p>Kincade also told the court she understood there was new DNA being tested, but Justice French pointed out that even if this returned positive results, it would not prove Maney had instructed Stone to kill Fuller-Sandys.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to her client: "There's simply no case at all, there never was."</p>
        
            <p>The lawyer for Maney's co-defendant Stephen Stone, Annabel Maxwell Scott, said the evidence against her client, too, was so contaminated it should be rendered inadmissible.</p>
        
            <p>For this reason, they were seeking an acquittal rather than a retrial.</p>
        
            <p>She cited unrecorded conversations, the feeding of information to witnesses, site visits before accounts were taken and the sharing of witnesses' statements between witnesses as reasons for the evidence being "irreparably damaged".</p>
        
            <p>She said the evidence did not have "the ring of truth" to it, and the frequently changing story of one of the key witnesses in particular made his evidence "totally unbelievable".</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is continuing.</p>
