            <p>Three teenagers have been arrested in Auckland over the stabbing of a supermarket security guard.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a group of 13 and 14-year-olds were allegedly stealing from the New Lynn store on Totara Avenue at about 6.30pm on Sunday and a security guard was stabbed when she confronted one of them.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to hospital but was not seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>"The injury has penetrated the security guard's vest and into her torso," WaitematƒÅ CIB detective senior sergeant Megan Goldie said.</p>
        
            <p>"She was transported to hospital and thankfully hasn't suffered any serious injuries; however this would have been an extremely frightening incident for the victim and we are providing her with support.</p>
        
            <p>"The violent behaviour on display last night was totally unacceptable, directed toward someone who was just doing their job."</p>
        
            <p>Charges were now being considered.</p>
