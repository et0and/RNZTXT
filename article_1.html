Asked multiple times if the public will be consulted on joining the defence pact, Luxon repeatedly said that was yet to be worked through.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will not say if the government will consult the public on joining the AUKUS defence pact.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters on the third leg of his Southeast Asia trip, from Manila in the Philippines, Luxon was asked multiple times whether the public would be consulted.</p>
        
            <p>He repeatedly said that was yet to be worked through, adding that the government was open to exploring it but had a "long way to go".</p>
        
            <p>His trip so far has taken in political and business engagements in Singapore, and in Thailand.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, back in Wellington, Labour invited AUKUS critics to Parliament for a discussion on the security pact and New Zealand's possible future involvement.</p>
