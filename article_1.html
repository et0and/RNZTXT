        <h2>Woman found dead on beach was victim of 'foul play'</h2>
        <p>
Joanna Mai Sione-Lauaki was reporting missing in August, and later found dead near Dargaville.
</p>
        
            <p>A Dargaville woman found dead on a beach was the victim of foul play, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Joanna Mai Sione-Lauaki, 38, was reported missing on the morning of 2 August after she failed to return home the night before.</p>
        
            <p>She was discovered later that day by a member of the public on Ripiro Beach, on the west coast north of Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Al Symonds - who is leading the investigation - on Friday announced police had launched a homicide probe after injuries on her body revealed she was the victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>"As of today we are treating the death of Joanna Mai Sione-Lauaki as a homicide inquiry."</p>

            <p>He declined to say what the injuries on Sione-Lauaki's body had been.</p>
        
            <p>Police had not given any updates since early August, saying they were treating the death as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>Symonds defended the time the update had taken.</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking for the public assistance to find clothing she was wearing prior to her death - a white Nike t-shirt with a red tick, dark grey trackpants, and red Adidas scuffs.</p>
        
            <p>They're seeking sightings of a distinctive white 2012 Toyota Hilux ute with no registration plates, an orange hazard light on the roof and aluminium dog cages on the back.</p>

            <p>"We're particularly interested in any sightings of that vehicle in the area as well. We believe that that vehicle was in the area where Jo's body was discovered around that time."</p>
        
            <p>Sione-Lauaki's black Mitsubishi Outlander was also parked at the entrance to Omamari Beach some time after 7pm on 1 August, police said.</p>
        
            <p>It was information from the public that would solve this, Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>"No piece of information is insignificant."</p>

            <p>Police also wanted to hear from anyone with dash cam or cellphone recordings.</p>
        
            <p>Sione-Lauaki partner's gang connections were not an avenue of inquiry, Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>"Jo's a mother who was going about her daily business."</p>
