            <p>Britain's King Charles spent a short time under observation in hospital on Thursday after experiencing side effects from treatment for cancer, Buckingham Palace said.</p>
        
            <p>The king has been having treatment for the illness since he was diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer in February last year following tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate.</p>
        
            <p>The Palace said he had returned to his home Clarence House, and that as a precaution his engagements for Friday would be rescheduled.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
