        <h2>Super Rugby Pacific used to be a 'borefest'. This year is anything but.</h2>
        <p>
Halfway through the season, Super Rugby has ditched expectations and crowds are taking notice.

            <p>Super Rugby Pacific has been called boring and predictable by its many critics but even Australian commentators are gushing about the competition this year.</p>
        
            <p>Halfway through the 16-week competition, rugby fans have been watching history in the making with the Queensland Reds topping the table for the first time in more than a decade, Moana Pasifika beating the Crusaders on their home ground and Fijian Drua claiming a world record as having the most viewers per head of population.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ sport and First Up presenter Nathan Rarere is delighted that for once, he doesn't know who will win the championship.</p>
        
            <p>"Normally I'd go 'Crusaders will win', I really don't know right now."</p>
        
            <p>But the two teams bringing a new feel and a new "joy" for fans are the relative newcomers and they are close to or at the bottom of the table, Moana Pasifika and Drua.</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless, the 45-25 "hiding" Moana Pasifika gave to the Crusaders could be the turnaround, Rarere says, thanks partly to captain Ardie Savea.</p>
        
            <p>"Ardie Savea matters. It matters because you've finally got some belief. It's not just that we've got this champion in our team, it's like he chose to play for us."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Drua's success at home goes way beyond the 80 minutes on the field and the noisy, packed stadiums, says Randall Kamea, former rugby professional and editor and owner of Teivovo magazine.</p>
        
            <p>Each of the home games is estimated by Drua's managers to be worth $10 million to the country through ticket sales, increased tourism income from visiting teams' supporters as well as jobs for local people, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never had a professional sporting team, we've never had a professional rugby team, even our sevens and fifteen teams have never been professional, so it's really exciting for fans, it's something to do, we don't have much in the way of live entertainment on the island.</p>
        
            <p>"And for aspiring rugby players it is a pathway that's very achievable because they get to see it every week."</p>
        
            <p>Add to the competition shakeup the reduction in Australian teams with the exit of Melbourne Rebels which has improved the quality of the remaining four, and a couple of rule changes, and the game has been given some much-needed oomph this year, says Rarere.</p>
        
            <p>The renewed interest is good timing with a new broadcast contract to be signed this year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is ideal timing to all of a sudden have these teams, because you're going to market with it, teams that you can bargain with. You can go 'yeah a couple of years ago you thought nah, no one wants it'. Well now people do."</p>
        
            <p>The injection of excitement and unpredictability has rugby fans flocking back to the game in Australia, according to commentator Sean Maloney of Between Two Posts rugby show.</p>
        
            <p>"I tell you, I tell you, I can't remember a better season to get us started," Maloney said on his show. "What's got me pumped about this is that people who ordinarily wouldn't be watching Super Rugby Pacific at this time of the year, casual rugby fans who'll generally wait till the Wallabies hit the track are now starting to come back - and not just a trickle, it's a bit of a flood."</p>
