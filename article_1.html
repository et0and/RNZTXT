            <p>Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins says the coalition government is unfairly targeting Māori and "enough is enough".</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins is speaking at a hui at Auckland City Mission's Home Ground on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are here after a week in Parliament that, like all other weeks in Parliament under this government, has seen Māori unfairly targeted," he said Iin prepared remarks.</p>
        
            <p>He said that the Royal Commission of Inquiry's report on Abuse in State Care released this week "bring into clear daylight our shameful history of abuse".</p>
        
            <p>"Māori were disproportionately targeted. Cut off from their whānau, their whakapapa, their culture and identity, subjected to outright racism. Beaten, starved, raped, and abused.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard all parties acknowledge the findings, speak of their horror at what had occurred, and pledge that it should never be allowed to happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"And then quite literally minutes after the debate on the Royal Commission's report had ended, the government once again targeted Māori as they reversed legislation that gives Māori a seat at the table on local councils," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said that decision ignored council wishes.</p>
        
            <p>"Councils are asking the government to butt out and leave them be - but the government, powered by disgraceful right-wing lobby groups and the racist coalition agreement, continue to resist and override both councils and Māori."</p>
        
            <p>The Labour leader also condemned the decision to bring back boot camps for youth offenders.</p>
        
            <p>Nine out of the 10 teenage participants at the first one set to open are Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"The government continues with their agenda to re-introduce boot camps, even though they were found to be places where some of the worst abuse happened."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins also criticised the draft Treaty Principles Bill pushed for by the ACT Party which will soon be made public.</p>
        
            <p>"Each week they find new ways to keep Māori down - and I want to be very clear - they do not speak for all non-Māori in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"I think most New Zealanders want to see us come together. I think most New Zealanders want us to work on improving outcomes for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"I think most New Zealanders celebrate Māori culture and identity and the fact that it makes us so unique in the world.</p>
        
            <p>"Who doesn't swell with pride when the All Blacks perform a haka at the start of a test match?"</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins issued a call to reject what he called "racist and revisionist history".</p>
        
            <p>"We have nothing to fear from Māori doing well - and everything to gain.</p>
        
            <p>"When Māori flourish, we all flourish. When we stand together, we support one another, and we collectively benefit."</p>
