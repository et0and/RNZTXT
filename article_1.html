            <p>Traffic is expected to be chock-a-block across the country as holidaymakers begin their journeys for Easter weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Police have issued warning that they are on the hunt for "bad eggs" and will be monitoring driver behaviour closely.</p>
        
            <p>Road policing director Superintendent Steve Greally said it had been a "disappointing" start to the year on Aotearoa's roads but there had been an improvement in rates of death and serious injuries from crashes.</p>
        
            <p>But "we can and must do much better".</p>
        
            <p>Our officers will be out patrolling roads throughout Aotearoa over Easter weekend and will follow through the appropriate enforcement action if drivers and riders are deemed to be risking the safety of themselves and others.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a serious stance we are taking to ensure we don't see more lives lost on our roads."</p>
