        <h2>DOC survey to begin for rare Māui dolphins</h2>
        <p>
The last survey of Māui dolphins, put the worldwide population at just 54 individuals aged over a year old.

            <p>Scientists will start work next week to update their population estimate for one of the world's rarest marine mammals.</p>
        
            <p>The last survey of Māui dolphins, which was carried out in 2021, put the worldwide population at just 54 individuals aged over one-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>The dolphins, which have distinctive grey, white and black markings and a rounded dorsal fin - likened in shape to a Mickey Mouse ear - are found only on the North Island's west coast.</p>
        
            <p>Like their close relative, Hector's dolphin, they are much smaller than the more widespread common and Bottlenose dolphins.</p>

            <p>Department of Conservation (DOC) ranger Cara Hansen said the survey, which was conducted every five years, used a genetic mark-recapture method.</p>
        
            <p>That involved using a small biopsy dart to collect DNA samples from live, wild dolphins.</p>
        
            <p>Analysis would provide vital information about population size, genetic diversity and movement patterns.</p>
        
            <p>"The Māui dolphin is critically endangered, and every sighting or sample contributes to our understanding of the species and its future survival," Hansen said.</p>

            <p>The survey would be carried out over two summers with field teams operating between the entrance of Kaipara Harbour and the Mokau River in Taranaki, the dolphins' known range.</p>
        
            <p>Staff from DOC's Taranaki, Auckland, and Waikato districts and marine species team, the University of Auckland, and Ngāti Te Ata would work together on the project.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen said the new survey would provide an updated population estimate and would help guide conservation efforts.</p>
        
            <p>She said the public could play a role in Māui dolphin conservation by reporting any sightings to the DOC hotline, 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468), or the online marine mammal sighting form.</p>
