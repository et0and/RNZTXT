            <p>The coalition government has designated the political wing of Hamas as a terrorist entity.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist entity in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>"What happened on 7 October reinforces we can no longer distinguish between the military and political wings of Hamas," Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"The organisation as a whole bears responsibility for these horrific terrorist attacks."</p>
        
            <p>The designation means any assets of the terrorist entity in New Zealand are frozen.</p>
        
            <p>It will become a criminal offence to participate in or support Hamas' activities.</p>
        
            <p>More to come </p>
