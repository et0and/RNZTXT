            <p>Forty-eight New Zealanders are still stuck in riot-torn New Caledonia as the fiery protests that have gripped the French territory stretch into their third week.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people have died in the riots, which were sparked by a controversial electoral reform that some said would weaken the indigenous Kanaky vote.</p>
        
            <p>Cars and businesses have been torched and shops looted, particularly in the capital, Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said a Defence Force plane carrying 60 passengers from New Caledonia landed in Auckland just before 9pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a repatriation flight on Saturday that carried about 57 people.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said there were 48 further New Zealanders left in New Caledonia who wished to leave.</p>
        
            <p>We are pleased that another 60 people have arrived back from New Caledonia on a New Zealand Government flight into Auckland tonight. We are aware of 48 New Zealanders left in New Caledonia who wish to leave, and plan a further flight tomorrow. We continue to work with New… pic.twitter.com/mdav19Hv0N</p>
        
            <p>There were plans for another repatriation flight on Monday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Details of that flight were yet to be finalised.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work with New Zealanders on the ground, French authorities and other countries that have asked for help," Peters said in a post on X.</p>
        
            <p>The safety of New Zealanders in New Caledonia remained an "urgent priority", a ministry spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is deeply concerned about the political unrest in New Caledonia, and we call for calm and dialogue to prevail."</p>
        
            <p>Seating on the repatriation flights had been prioritised based on two considerations, the spokesperson said: urgent needs and "the ability for passengers to safely travel to central pick-up points in Nouméa".</p>
        
            <p>Almost all of the New Zealanders who wanted to depart New Caledonia had now relocated to Nouméa, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent death in the French territory was on Friday evening, when a police officer fatally shot a 48-year-old man.</p>
        
            <p>According to local media, the officer said he used his gun after he and a colleague were attacked by a group of about 15 people.</p>
