        <h2>West Coast sand mining operation gets go-ahead</h2>
        <p>
The mine will have reduced hours due to its location next to wetlands and concerns for native birds.

            <p>The Environment Court has given the go-ahead for a sand mining operation near Barrytown, on the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The TiGa Mineral Sands Mine was granted consent by an independent panel of commissioners appointed by the West Coast Regional Council and Grey District Council in April.</p>
        
            <p>It was then appealed by the Coast Road Resilience Group over concerns about the impact on the rural community, coastal environment and its wildlife including the Westland petrel.</p>
        
            <p>The director-general of conservation and Forest & Bird joined in support of aspects of the appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Te R큰nanga o Ng훮ti Waewae supported the consent being granted.</p>
        
            <p>TiGa managing director Robert Brand said the company now had the required permits and approvals to allow mining to commence.</p>
        
            <p>"The parties had all agreed to amended conditions to address concerns, while still enabling mining activity to operate."</p>
        
            <p>The key changes related to wetland setbacks and reduced hours of operation for trucking, loading of trucks, mining, overburden and topsoil stripping, bund development and related activities.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the site location - it is within the coastal environment and adjacent to wetlands - the changes that were agreed to were to further reduce the risk of adverse effects on indigenous birds, such as the Westland petrel.</p>
        
            <p>The Barrytown Mineral Sands Project hopes to produce $63 million of export earnings per year. Mining will occur on privately owned dairy pasture, with five hectares being mined at any one time and the land rehabilitated as the mine progresses.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Regional Council chair Peter Haddock said the decision followed successful mediation and negotiation between the parties, with environmental concerns resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"The TiGa project was advanced through close engagement with Te R큰nanga o Ng훮ti Waewae Arahura and will achieve economic and social benefits for the West Coast."</p>
        
            <p>He said the regional council would now monitor and enforce the resource consent conditions.</p>
