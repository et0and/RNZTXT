        <h2>Gold medal winner wheeled off track with Covid diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
It emerged after the race that Lyles had tested positive and the 27-year-old had to be helped off the track.

            <p>Botswana's Letsile Tebogo claimed a surprise Olympic 200m gold medal as Noah Lyles was denied a sprint double at Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Tebogo, 21, stormed clear of his rivals to clock an African record of 19.46 seconds and finish ahead of American Kenneth Bednarek, who crossed the line in 19.62.</p>
        
            <p>Lyles, crowned the world's fastest man by five-thousandths of a second in a historically quick 100m final on Sunday night, was unable to compete at the head of the race and matched his Tokyo bronze in 19.70.</p>
        
            <p>It emerged after the race that Lyles had tested positive for Covid and the 27-year-old had to be helped off the track in a wheelchair.</p>
        
            <p>Having burst out on to the track to huge cheers before the race, Lyles was seeking to become the first man since Usain Bolt in 2016 to complete a 100m and 200m double at an Olympic Games.</p>

            <p>But Tebogo had other ideas.</p>
        
            <p>A world bronze medallist over the distance last year, Tebogo also took 100m silver in Budapest as Lyles completed a golden treble.</p>
        
            <p>That was a dazzling return for Tebogo at his first global championship, but it was nothing compared to his achievement at the Stade de France as he marked his first Olympics with a gold.</p>
        
            <p>Tebogo, sixth in the Paris 100m final, lined up with a 200m personal best of 19.50 - notably down on the favourite's 19.31.</p>
        
            <p>Showman Lyles made his entrance to huge excitement, seemingly ready to seize his moment with the eyes of the world fixed upon him, but he remained third throughout following a slow start.</p>
        
            <p>Bednarek held out to equal his silver of three years ago in Tokyo - a medal he also won at the 2022 World Championships - but could not overhaul Tebogo.</p>

            <p>Tebogo dedicated Olympic gold to his mother Seratiwa, who died in May of this year after a brief illness, and held his spikes, displaying her date of birth, up to the camera following his victory.</p>
        
            <p>"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field," Tebogo said.</p>
        
            <p>"To take her [with me], it gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy."</p>
        
            <p>Having ended Lyles' 26-race winning streak over the distance in the semi-finals, Tebogo announced himself on the global stage as he repeated that victory over the man who has long been tipped as Bolt's heir apparent.</p>
        
            <p>Tebogo entered the home straight with an advantage and, as his rivals threatened to pull alongside, he surged away in the closing stages to clinch an emotional - and hugely significant - triumph.</p>
        
            <p>Lyles, the fastest man over 200m this year before this race and a three-time reigning world champion over the distance, produced his usual theatrics before the serious business began.</p>
        
            <p>But this performance in his favoured event was not at his usual world-beating standard and it soon became apparent why as news broke of the American's illness.</p>
        
            <p>Bolt, the fastest man in history and winner of eight Olympic gold medals, completed the sprint double at three successive Games in Beijing, London and Rio - and he remains the only man to ever enjoy such a dominant streak.</p>
        
            <p>Lyles had targeted a remarkable four golds in Paris, including both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays, but it remains to be seen whether he will be fit to contest those finals.</p>
