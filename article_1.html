            <p>Several schools in Taupō have been put in lockdown as police try to find a "person of interest".</p>
        
            <p>Taupō's Tauhara College is among those in lockdown but said on Facebook it did not yet know the reasons for being locked down.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to provide updates on our Facebook as often as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"Please do not come to the school or phone the school as you will not be attended to and this may cause disruption to the management of this incident and could potentially place yourselves and/or our staff and student's safety at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Staff and students were safe in locked classrooms, the school said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the public were to avoid the Hilltop area and cordons were in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons are in place on multiple streets in the area, and schools have been placed into lockdown as a precaution. More information will be released when we are in a position to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Intermediate School and Tauhara Primary School are also in lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Lake Taupō Christian College has asked parents to avoid the school.</p>
        
            <p>"Do not be alarmed, we are all safe. We are under police guidance and ask parents not to come to school until we are given the all clear," it said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Hospital said it was not in lockdown and patients and staff were safe.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the hospital is within the cordons as police are dealing with an incident in the area. If anyone is needing to go to the hospital, Police are allowing people through."</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking all residents to stay inside and contact them on 111 and reference event number P057866209 if they see anything of concern.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
