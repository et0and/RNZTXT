Planning to take your fur baby away by sea, air or water this summer? Here's what you need to know.

            <p>Lola was 12 weeks old when she arrived in an airline cage from Auckland with her two half-siblings, Billie and Coco. Since then, our two-year-old labradoodle has got used to all forms of transport.</p>
        
            <p>When we head north from Wellington to stay with family, a typical day will involve an Uber, a flight, a ferry ride, and a bus trip. Our gorgeous girl takes all of this in her stride - she's rarely fazed when we lead her from one form of transport to another.</p>
        
            <p>If you're planning to hit the road with your fur baby this summer, travelling with a pooch - or a cat, rabbit or any domestic animal - adds another layer of administration and the occasional dose of drama. It can also be costly.</p>
        
            <p>The journey begins with picking your travel provider carefully. Jetstar doesn't allow pets. Air New Zealand does, but they must travel in an airline-approved cage and be stored in the hold. The rules vary for smaller airlines, such as Air Chathams, Sounds Air, and Barrier Air. For example, Sounds Air will take pets for a $40 fee, but they must be small ones that fit inside a 37cm-high cage and be accompanied by their owner. Space is limited on these smaller aircraft, so plan if you're thinking of taking to the skies with your pet.</p>

            <p>Each time we take Lola on an Air New Zealand flight, one of us must book a seat and a bag. Lola is big enough to need a "giant'' carrier, which cost us $565 at Animates (you'll find cheaper ones online). She also slinks into the 'large dog' category - with her crate she weighs over 25 kilograms - so it costs another $100 each way for her trip; pets plus cage under 25 kilograms cost $75, if you've got two pets weighing less than 14 kilograms they can go in one cage, according to Kate Boyer, Air New Zealand general manager airports.</p>
        
            <p>The airline carrier must be big enough for the pup to stand up and turn around in, and you've also got to provide a water bowl. The team loading and unloading the pets are trained to handle them (over the last year, they transported 9184 pets domestically and internationally). On board, Boyer says pets and animals are secured in a climate-controlled space in the light-dimmed aircraft hold which is pressurised for their comfort.</p>
        
            <p>If you're travelling by sea, Interislander and Bluebridge allow pets on board: both have kennels for hire. Pets can stay in the car, as long as they've got water and the vehicle is well-ventilated. The Interislander has a special hanger you must leave on the rear-view mirror so staff know to check on the pet in the car. You can also take your horse (as long as the swells are under three metres), says Duncan Roy, GM Interislander operations manager. Pets are allowed on some Auckland ferries, but conditions vary depending on the service.</p>
        
            <p>Sally Cory, head of veterinary services (companion animals) at the New Zealand Veterinary Association, says it's wise to get pets used to the car from a young age. This kind of training will pay off when you're heading on holiday, but there are still rules to follow.</p>

            <p>Cory recommends non-medical calming aids and pheromone products (synthetic substances that mimic calming scents) rather than sedating pets for the trip.</p>
        
            <p>Dogs should be harnessed with a dog safety belt, or in a cage. They should not be allowed to roam around the car, and definitely not allowed to pop their head out the window to admire the view.</p>
        
            <p>When planning a car journey, factor in toilet stops every couple of hours, and make sure your pet is well-fed and hydrated. Vehicles should be cool and well-ventilated, and never leave pets unattended, she says.</p>

            <p>"Everyone got a dog or a cat during lockdown," Maynard says.</p>
        
            <p>"There are so many of us with pets we love, and we want to have our pet included in part of our day-to-day travel.''</p>
        
            <p>With about 11,000 followers on her Facebook page, she allows pet-friendly moteliers, Air Bnb owners, and eateries to advertise for free.</p>
        
            <p>A growing number of accommodation places allow dogs or cats. Some have conditions, such as only admitting pets if they sleep in the car or outside in a crate, or they'll restrict the size or the breed. Some hotel chains, such as Scenic Hotels, have dog-friendly rooms.</p>
        
            <p>"We think of our pets as part of our families so the more places that welcome them the better,'' Maynard says.</p>
