            <p>Several people have died due to heat-related ailments over the past 24 hours as temperatures continue to soar in northern and central India.</p>
        
            <p>Ten fatalities were recorded at the government hospital in Odisha's Rourkela region on Thursday, authorities told Reuters news agency.</p>
        
            <p>Heat-stroke related deaths have also been reported from the states of Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand and the national capital, Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>The searing heat comes as India is holding its general election, the results of which will be declared on 4 June.</p>
        
            <p>Mahendra Kumar, district magistrate of Bhojpur district in Bihar told the Times of India newspaper that three election officers and a policeman had died in the city on Thursday due to heat stroke.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the hottest day, and despite having medical facilities at all centres, they collapsed. One home guard [volunteer policeman] became unconscious where he was staying," Kumar said, adding that the man died in the hospital while being treated by doctors.</p>
        
            <p>He also said that around 30-40 people had been admitted to the same hospital on Thursday due to heat-related ailments.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitals in the region are recording a rise in admissions due to heat-related ailments.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, a labourer admitted with a heat stroke died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a "life-threatening" condition with a mortality rate of 40 to 64 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The heat in northern, central and parts of western India has been unrelenting for the past two weeks, with maximum temperatures hovering around 45-46C for days at a stretch and even climbing up to 50C in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>Several regions are experiencing severe water and electricity shortages due to a rise in consumption. The soaring temperatures have led to a surge in fires across India and authorities are employing drones to monitor forest fires in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
        
            <p>In the past week, capital Delhi and surrounding regions experienced record-breaking temperatures nearing 50C.</p>
        
            <p>Videos of residents in Delhi jostling for water from water tankers have been widely shared on social media. Many parts of the capital are also experiencing frequent power cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Officials are still investigating whether the recorded temperature of 52.9C in the Mungeshpur area on Wednesday was a result of a sensor malfunction at the nearby weather station.</p>
        
            <p>India saw a 55 percent rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021, a study published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found.</p>
        
            <p>Exposure to heat also caused a loss of 167.2 billion potential labour hours among Indians in 2021, the study noted.</p>
        
            <p>While many parts of the country have regularly experienced heatwaves in summer, experts have said these are now becoming longer, more intense and frequent.</p>
