            <p>A prominent former political figure has been found guilty on eight charges of indecent assault dating back to the 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>The man has been on trial in the Auckland District Court for sexually abusing two teenage boys in West Auckland and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>The man has had name suppression for the duration of the trial, but it can be reported he is not an MP.</p>
        
            <p>Judge David Sharp has allowed him 14 days of continued name suppression to determine whether a permanent application for name suppression will be made.</p>
        
            <p>Both the crown and media opposed continued name suppression, with prosecutor Rebeckah Thompson arguing the need to maintain fair trial rights had passed.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the abuse, the man was a mentor to the two teenage boys at a sports club in West Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Delivering the Crown's closing statements last week, Thompson said the man had an interest in teenage boys and supplied them with alcohol and drugs.</p>
        
            <p>"[The defendant], a man in his late 20s or early 30s at the time, had an interest in adolescent boys and the accounts of [the first complainant] and [the second complainant] tell us that he was prepared to act on that attraction in very similar ways.</p>
        
            <p>"Supplying them with alcohol, encouraging them with the consumption of alcohol and taking advantage of them when they had succumb to its effects."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said the defence's suggestion the complainants had misremembered what had happened did not stack up.</p>
        
            <p>"Important, significant, traumatic things like that; you remember them. You remember as a teenage boy an adult man touching your penis. That's not something you just imagine or misinterpret."</p>
        
            <p>The man will be sentenced on 22 November.</p>
