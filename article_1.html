        <h2>Migrant workers settling down slowly after struggling for months</h2>
        <p>
After enduring months in crowded houses without jobs, some workers have finally started to settle down in New Zealand.

            <p>Vinu Choodal is slowly settling in the South Island, building a new life after a rough first four months in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Life is okay - finally," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Choodal, 36, was one of the 115 workers trapped in six properties across Auckland a few months ago, prompting an Immigration New Zealand investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation made its first arrest in October after a licensed immigration advisor was charged with two charges of providing false information, carrying a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>The incident also prompted the under-fire Labour government to put the accredited employer work visa scheme under review.</p>
        
            <p>In September, the government unveiled an initiative aimed at rescuing scammed workers from further exploitation, offering temporary accommodation and cost-of-living support payments to help them get back on their feet.</p>

            <p>Choodal says it was a challenging experience being crammed into a crowded house in Papakura for several weeks with 30 other workers from India and Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bad experience, one that I never expected from a country such as New Zealand," Choodal says.</p>
        
            <p>The houses in Papakura were finally vacated after Auckland Council issued notices highlighting the properties' unsanitary condition.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't go to the temporary accommodation because a friend arranged a job for me in Dunedin," Choodal says.</p>
        
            <p>A welder by trade, Choodal had worked in India for the past few years and paid $20,000 to an agent for a visa and related job in New Zealand. Choodal currently works as a panel beater in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>After his accommodation ordeal in Auckland, Choodal demanded a refund from his agents in India.</p>
        
            <p>"I got $4000 back but will try to get more of my money back because I paid for a service and I didn't get that," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, he plans to lodge a complaint against the agency with NORKA (Non-Resident Keralites Affairs) Roots, a government department that handles the grievances of migrants from Kerala.</p>
        
            <p>Choodal says that he's still a bit worried about his visa. He's now on migrant exploitation protection work visa that is valid through 31 March.</p>
        
            <p>"My new employer has told me that they are ready to support my visa," Choodal says.</p>
        
            <p>Prasad Babu, who had been living with Choodal at the Papakura house, has since found employment in the construction industry.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm grateful for the job but I'm worried about my visa," says Babu, who's also on a migrant exploitation protection work visa that is valid through 31 March.</p>
        
            <p>Babu says he was sick for a few days and struggled to get immediate treatment in Auckland as he had to wait more than eight hours to be seen by a doctor.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really depressed after that and I'm thinking whether I want to stay here for long or not," Babu says.</p>
        
            <p>However, he still hopes that things will improve.</p>
        
            <p>Choodal, on the other hand, describes life in Dunedin as good.</p>
        
            <p>He has found people from Kerala, his hometown, which has made his experience better. He stays in touch with a few individuals from the Papakura house, noting that some have moved to Napier and also appeared to be content.</p>
        
            <p>"They all seem pretty happy over there," he says.</p>
