            <p>The mother of Grace Millane says there is still a lot of work to do to get justice for victims of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the Love Grace handbag appeal kicks off in New Zealand on Friday to help women experiencing domestic abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Gillian Millane has campaigned against the rough sex defence used by Grace's murderer Jesse Kempson.</p>
        
            <p>The British backpacker was strangled to death by Kempson in 2018, after a Tinder date in Auckland on the eve of her 22nd birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Scott Beard, who lead the investigation into her death, was also vocal on the defence re-victimsing the Millane family through the rough sex defence.</p>
        
            <p>Gillian Millane told Nine to Noon bureaucracy is getting in the way of change.</p>
        
            <p>"We have helped to change the law in England and Wales, unfortunately there's a long way to go. But that's probably down to politicians and lawyers and me but I stand by that, I think it should be called what it is, it's murder, not rough sex," Millane said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would be in favour of following Australia's lead to introduce a code of conduct for dating apps that was enforced in October.</p>
        
            <p>"I wholeheartedly support anything that would make woman, anybody safe, you know it's got to be a good thing."</p>
        
            <p>Millane spoke about the ongoing affect Grace's death has had on her.</p>
        
            <p>She said to channel her grief she's been training to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Everest Base Camp which has given her a sense of purpose and a reason to get out of bed in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>"I climb mountains every day... even if it's getting out of bed. Anybody that lives in this world, whether you've had someone taken from you, you know a win is getting up and having a shower sometimes.</p>
        
            <p>"So for me, I think right, I climb mountains everyday so why not climb a real one so that's what my thought process was for Kili and then I thought well Everest is there so why not do that one."</p>
        
            <p>She talked about leaving stones behind to represent her late husband David and her daughter Grace.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as I'm concerned they're travelling with me, and if someone picks them up and puts them somewhere else, they go somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>Millane started the charity Love Grace in honour of her daughter which saw her receive an OBE from Prince William and an award from former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>When it started in 2019, it started off with between 50 to 100 handbags and has now filled over 23,000.</p>
        
            <p>Last year the appeal set a target of 1500 handbags for the whole country, but was surprised to see 5269 were donated to local Women's Refuges around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>This year there are 120 drop off points throughout the country and 163 volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>"My driving force is really, I just don't want another family, another mum, dad, brother, sister, aunty, friends, have to live the life that we do. I just want help... to sort of hopefully raise the awareness, hopefully change things... that's what I'm hoping," Millane said.</p>
        
            <p>Each bag has six key items including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush and other luxury items which are gifted to Women's Refuge.</p>
        
            <p>Each bag also contained a poppy drawn by Grace and a note saying "you matter".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand co-ordinator Kylie-Anne Kearney said she was amazed with last year's response and how quickly her team has grown from only seven people in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"This year we've doubled the amount of co-ordinators, doubled the amount of drop off points so we're expecting that is going to be even bigger which we're super excited about," Kearney said.</p>
        
            <p>The Love Grace handbag appeal runs until 8 March.</p>
