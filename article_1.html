            <p>It's a very wet looking end to the week with multiple warnings and watches across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Between 100 to 140 millimetres of rain could fall in the Tasman district northwest of Motueka today, which is under an orange heavy rain warning.</p>
        
            <p>An orange warning was also in place for the ranges of Westland, and in the North Island, around Taranaki Maunga.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said the heavy rain could change the landscape of rivers and streams quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a fairly significant amount of rainfall to come through, it may well lead to things like streams and rivers rising pretty rapidly in some of these areas.</p>
        
            <p>"[There] are watches and warnings on your classic spots where people like to get out and about in, so as always it's ... worth checking the forecast before you plan to head out on any of those tramps."</p>
        
            <p>There was likely to be "flashes of lightning, rumbles of thunder and some pretty intense bursts of rainfall," Law said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were also several heavy rain watches in place, for the likes of the central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taup≈ç, Tongariro National Park, the Kaimanawa Mountains, and even further east like the Bay of Plenty and Rotorua could get hit with downpours of 25 to 40 mm per hour.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, the Taraua Ranges also has a heavy rain watch, as does Buller, Richmond and Bryant ranges, including the Rai Valley and Fiordland, north of Doubtful Sound.</p>
        
            <p>And while other parts of the country were not forecast to get to watch or warning level, "we're going to get a bite of rainfall", Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rain is spreading quite nicely across most of the North Island and even on that eastern side of the South Island, we'll have a spell of rain for a time before it clears out."</p>
        
            <p>So does that mean it will be a soggy start to the new year?</p>
        
            <p>It will depend on how fast the current weather system from the Tasman sweeps through. MetService said by the middle of Saturday most areas should see an improving trend, through a few showers will linger about mountainous parts of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said the last wet weather front of the year was forecasted to move across on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether 2023 ends on a wet or a dry note will depend on how fast that front moves through.</p>
        
            <p>"The outlook is favourable for the Deep South and Otago at the stroke of midnight, however things may be a bit dicey elsewhere. It is worth saying though, being a few days away, there's still some wiggle room with those timings."</p>
        
            <p>As the sun rises on 2024, a ridge of high pressure was forecasted to arrive and should bring settled weather to the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Apart from some showers in the western South Island and windy westerlies along the Southland coast, the outlook for Monday and Tuesday is not a bad way to start a new year," Makgabutlane said.</p>
