            <p>Rob Appleton, who rode the length of New Zealand on his beloved bike, has died.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in 2024, RNZ published Rob's story - the tale of the race to reunite a dying man and his stolen bike, affectionately known as Big Jeff.</p>
        
            <p>Big Jeff had carried Rob on a charity cycling tour of the country, all the way from Cape Reinga to Bluff, so it was a blow when he came to find it had been stolen.</p>
        
            <p>That was in August 2023. And just two months later, tragedy struck.</p>
        
            <p>Rob was diagnosed with stage four oesophageal cancer, and given just six months to live. Since then, his daughter Kate has been on a mission to find Big Jeff so Rob could enjoy one last ride.</p>
        
            <p>On 5 December 2024, more than a year after his diagnosis, Rob died peacefully at home surrounded by whānau.</p>
        
            <p>And though Big Jeff never returned to his life, his story captured hearts across the nation.</p>

            <p>"The response to the story was so lovely," Kate says.</p>
        
            <p>"All kinds of people reached out and shared their love for Rob, and we heard how heartwarming, and heartbreaking, they found the story ... Rob even had an offer from a local here in Christchurch to rebuild him an exact replica of Jeff, and that just goes to show how much kindness is out there."</p>
        
            <p>Kate says Rob lived a very full life until the day he died. Just nine days after his diagnosis, he attended Kate's wedding, organised on the fly, "full carpe diem", as the family did not think he had much time.</p>
        
            <p>On 7 November, one month before his death, Rob proposed to his partner of eight years, Ana, and had a wedding ceremony of his own on 23 November.</p>
        
            <p>"If Rob's wedding was better than mine it's because he had a whole extra week to plan," Kate says.</p>

            <p>Rob was 59 years old when he completed the Tour Aotearoa cycling tour for Pet Refuge back in 2021. He had ridden the length of New Zealand in 24 days, covering more than 100 kilometres each day, with Ana and their dog George trailing behind in a campervan.</p>
        
            <p>Kate was inspired seeing her dad on an adventure, and now, she is preparing to ride Tour Aotearoa herself in his memory.</p>
        
            <p>"We may not have found Big Jeff in time for him to go on that ride, but the search won't end here... I live in hope that one day years down the line, we might get a phone call reuniting us.</p>
        
            <p>"Just because we didn't achieve our goal does not mean it was all for nothing. So many people got to express their friendship and love and got in touch."</p>

            <p>Rob was a community mental health nurse for 33 years and was widely loved, Kate says.</p>
        
            <p>"My dad always saw the best in people, he was a very loved colleague everywhere he worked, and he knew how to make people laugh.</p>
        
            <p>"His last few months were spent living life to the full. He married his partner Ana in a beautiful ceremony in the park, and there were no dry eyes that day.</p>

            <p>"They went on adventures together on Ana's days off, and he made time for every single phone call and message from loved ones, sometimes spending entire days and evenings on the phone.</p>
        
            <p>"He still fit all his hobbies like the occasional bike ride, voraciously reading and painting war-gaming miniatures as long as he was able.</p>
        
            <p>"We will all love and miss Rob forever, because he made it impossible not to."</p>

Rob Appleton died on 5 December.
