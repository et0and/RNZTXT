            <p>Te Whatu Ora has apologised to a North Shore woman after she fractured both her legs while under hospital care.</p>
        
            <p>Her daughter, Kotie Matson, claims the incident was not only completely avoidable but also says what she deems is a lack of remorse and communication following the fall, has left her family further disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>Aletta Langeveldt, 71, went to North Shore Hospital with pneumonia but left with two fractured legs after she fell while walking with a physio in her hospital room on 25 August.</p>
        
            <p>Langeveldt had been given morphine one hour before the fall, and she told the physio as a result of this she was drowsy and didn't want to walk.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, the physio tried to get Langeveldt to walk, Matson said.</p>
        
            <p>Matson said there was even signage on her bed advising that two people must be present to help with walking and a frame must be used.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, she was told to hold onto the windowsill.</p>
        
            <p>"The moment her legs gave in, she said [she] could hear the cracks, her bones cracking."</p>
        
            <p>As a result of the fall, Langeveldt fractured both her legs and had to undergo surgery for over six hours, Matson said.</p>
        
            <p>In the immediate aftermath, no one contacted her family members or emergency contacts to let them know there had been an accident and she was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Wondering why her mum was not replying to her texts, Matson called the hospital at around 8.30am the following day and discovered what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just unacceptable," Matson said.</p>
        
            <p>WaitematƒÅ Te Whatu Ora chief medical officer Laura Chapman said they were determined to learn from the incident and make improvements to prevent it from happening again.</p>
        
            <p>"We deeply regret that Aletta had a fall, resulting in fractures to both legs, whilst in our care.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been in touch with Aletta's family and we appreciate that these injuries have had a profound impact on them all."</p>
        
            <p>Chapman admitted the family should have been contacted earlier after the fall.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear that we could have done better at communicating earlier with Aletta's family about the fact she had experienced a fall and about her injuries once they were confirmed by X-ray results.</p>
        
            <p>"We are sorry for these shortcomings and have apologised directly to Aletta's family."</p>
        
            <p>Chapman said there is a strong focus on fall prevention, and events like this are rare and fully investigated when they happen.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been an initial clinical review into the circumstances of Aletta's fall and whether changes could be made to reduce the risk of a similar future event.</p>
        
            <p>"A key finding was that the potential for Aletta to have a fall was underestimated as a previous fall was not taken fully into consideration.</p>
        
            <p>"We are sorry the level of risk relating to falls was not revised as it should have been."</p>
        
            <p>Matson said she was unhappy that Te Whatu Ora did not recognise that her mother felt pushed into walking against her will that day.</p>
        
            <p>"Mum said to her, I already had my morphine an hour ago, but [the physio] nagged and nagged.</p>
        
            <p>"She was very, very sick," Matson said.</p>
        
            <p>Langeveldt still cannot walk by herself and has a framing with pins around her leg.</p>
        
            <p>"She still sometimes has a bit of post-traumatic stress from the whole thing."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora did not answer questions about whether the employee was a student physio, whether they were permitted to be alone with a patient who struggled with weight bearing/balance, and if further training has been offered to the staff member.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no empathy. I just want them to be accountable," Matson said.</p>
