            <p>A Hawke's Bay town has been put under immediate level four water restrictions after the discovery of a major leak in the town's supply.</p>
        
            <p>The district council said Waipukurau's Pukeroa Reservoir was "rapidly" loosing water on Wednesday morning and residents needed to urgently conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>"We need residents to urgently conserve water or there is a real risk Waipukurau could run out of water."</p>
        
            <p>At 7.45am, the council said reservoir levels were sitting at 26 percent. That was down from 40 percent at 6.30am.</p>
        
            <p>"As we approach our peak water use period we need Waipukurau residents to remain urgently conserving water.</p>
        
            <p>"We can currently make 60 litres of water per second and are currently using roughly 230 litres."</p>
        
            <p>The council had confirmed a major leak on Porangahau Road was the cause of the sudden water loss.</p>
        
            <p>There were no other breakages across the network.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a risk we may need to apply a boil water notice to Waipukurau if water use does not reduce.</p>
        
            <p>According to the council's website, level 4 restrictions meant there was a total ban on outdoor water use.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were asked to only use water for emergencies, not to use washing machines or dishwashers, do not "rush to flush", and limit showers to two minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were asked to report any major losses of water by calling 06 857 8060.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it would keep locals up to date.</p>
