            <p>The Deputy Prime Minister has stepped in to host the PM's weekly briefing as Christopher Luxon visits Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's trade mission was almost derailed during a brief stopover in Papua New Guinea after two fuses blew in the official Defence Force Boeing 757 while it was being refuelled.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon caught a commercial flight out of Port Moresby to salvage the start of his three-day programme in Japan, leaving Trade Minister Todd McClay to look after the 52-person business and media delegation.</p>
