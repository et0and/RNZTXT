            <p>Anyone with a social media account has most likely come across the phrase "All Eyes on Rafah", but what's the story behind the slogan?</p>
        
            <p>It has been circulating on social media in recent months, but has significantly gained momentum globally over the past few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The phrase was searched on Google in New Zealand more than 10,000 times yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>On social media, an AI template image with the phrase "All Eyes on Rafah" surrounded by tents in a desert setting has been shared almost 32 million times, and the hashtag #alleyesonrafah has featured on videos viewed millions of times on TikTok.</p>
        
            <p>Activists and humanitarian groups are using the phrase to draw the word's attention to the plight of Palestinian people in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has continued its offensive in the city of Rafah, now reportedly reaching the heart of the city, despite the large civilian population and international outcry.</p>

            <p>Rafah is situated in the far-south of the Gaza strip. It borders Egypt and had been a place many Palestinians had fled to at the start of the conflict, to escape Israeli bombardment.</p>
        
            <p>As many as 1.4 million people were thought to be in the city earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>However, since Israel began its operation in and around Rafah three weeks ago, the UN has estimated more than a million people have now left the city, to once again try and escape the fighting.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday night local time, an Israeli airstrike caused a fire at a camp for the displaced, killing dozens of people, many of whom were women and children.</p>
        
            <p>Israel said it was investigating and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu labelled the situation a "tragic incident".</p>
        
            <p>Since then, Israel has been accused of another strike on a camp, west of Rafah, killing another 21 Palestinians.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services in Gaza said tank shells hit a cluster of tents in al-Mawasi, a place where Israel had told Palestinians to move to to escape fighting in Rafah.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has denied striking al-Mawasi.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the UN's Court of Justice issued a ruling for Israel to halt it military offensive in Rafah.</p>
        
            <p>Professor of Marketing Analytics at Massey University Dr Bodo Lang said the situation in Gaza was complicated and it could be difficult for people to agree on a stance.</p>
        
            <p>"But what is really easy to agree on is that innocent civilians have been killed, and as a result it illicits really strong emotions. The slogan allows people to share their values in a really socially acceptable manner."</p>
        
            <p>Lang said when strong emotions were involved, something was more likely to go viral.</p>
        
            <p>He described the statement as having "message fluency," meaning the slogan was easy to understand.</p>
        
            <p>He also noted that post like this could give people a sense of agency, when they felt they had little control over what was happening in the world right now.</p>

            <p>Dozens of images have emerged from Rafah, some of them very graphic in nature, including those who have been seriously injured and killed in the violence.</p>
        
            <p>Lang said the appeal of the AI image was that it conveyed the message of hope.</p>
        
            <p>"If you want anything to go viral, it needs to have an emotional appeal and generally speaking positive emotions are more powerful than negative emotions.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think using an AI generated image can be really useful for side-stepping those strong negative emotions."</p>
        
            <p>There has been strong international pressure on Israel on its offensive in Rafah, with social media users urging leaders around the world to do more to stop the violence.</p>
        
            <p>But can a social media post really make a difference? Lang thinks so, and said there were lots of examples to back this up.</p>
        
            <p>"There are many examples of how social movements started on a small scale. You could go back to to how American slavery was abolished, it arguably goes back to a book written by a woman.</p>
        
            <p>"You can also look at Black Lives Matter, climate change, Greta Thunberg and Ukraine support."</p>
        
            <p>He said a phrase was a beautiful way to get a social movement going, before lobbying politicians.</p>
