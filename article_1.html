            <p>Parliamentary security has made at least one referral to the police in relation to threats against MP Benjamin Doyle, says the Green Party.</p>
        
            <p>Doyle will not be returning to Parliament this week following accusations at the weekend of inappropriate language on a social media account.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters drew attention to Doyle's private Instagram account on Saturday, asking what the handle 'BibleBeltBussy' meant.</p>
        
            <p>The term "bussy" is used by some members of the rainbow community to refer to a man's anus.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party on Monday demanded the prime minister step in over Peters' statements, saying they had led to an "immense" number of death threats against Doyle.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Doyle's language was "really inappropriate", adding threats of violence against anyone were "totally unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that Parliamentary security had made at least one referral to the police in relation to threats against Doyle.</p>
        
            <p>The confirmation comes as the party's co-leader Marama Davidson said the scale and nature of threats have ratcheted up since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"The threats have ramped up even more so and so my focus right now is the safety of Benjamin and their whānau," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just more [threats], many deeper and unprecedented is what we're also hearing from the likes of people doing the analysis of what the threats are."</p>

            <p>Speaking alongside Davidson, Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March confirmed Parliamentary security had made at least one referral to the police.</p>
        
            <p>"Parliamentary security has told us that they will be referring things to the police as appropriate and we're trusting and working with them on their judgement on when and how to choose to refer things to the police. That's the standard advice from them."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said Doyle was feeling "scared and worried about their whānau".</p>
        
            <p>"This is an organised, coordinated attack. If all of us MPs in this House were to have such an attack on us no one would come into this House.</p>
        
            <p>"That danger has been purposeful and intentional to a member and the safety of that person is my first and utmost priority right now."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he did not accept any responsibility for the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It was happening days beforehand, they told us themselves, and now they're in excuse mode and trying to blame everybody else. They should refer those to the police. It's inexcusable.</p>
        
            <p>"I take no responsibility at all because I don't play any part in it at all. I'm just telling you to do your job and finally you're starting to do it."</p>
        
            <p>Labour MPs from the rainbow community have come to the support of Benjamin Doyle after a reported spike in death threats against the Green MP.</p>
        
            <p>Labour spokesperson for rainbow issues Shanan Halbert said he did not personally use the term, but described Peters' comments as a political attack.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad that there is a targeted attack by the deputy prime minister on a rainbow member of Parliament."</p>
        
            <p>"The real issue here is the death threats that he has received as a result, and I certainly think any responsible government members shouldn't be flaming that fire."</p>
        
            <p>Halbert said politicians should not pretend their decisions have no impact on others.</p>
        
            <p>"We can all bury our heads in the sand... [but] I would like to see leadership, as I've called for from the prime minister previously, to stand up and ensure the safety of the rainbow community."</p>
        
            <p>Halbert said the coalition's policies and rhetoric had made the rainbow community "vulnerable".</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly politicised. We've not only seen it in this case, we've seen it over the Pride period, we've seen it with the removal of the relationship and sexuality guidelines from schools.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, it's tools like that that ensure the safety of our community, particularly our tamariki and the government, when they politicise these things, really leave all of us vulnerable."</p>
        
            <p>Labour MP Ayesha Verrall said Peters' comments were out of line.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely distressing and despicable to see death threats being levelled against an MP and I'm very disappointed in Winston Peters' involvement in that.</p>
        
            <p>"Death threats do not help our democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Verrall said she was particularly concerned Doyle's child had been caught up in the story.</p>
        
            <p>"As a lesbian woman in Parliament, I certainly find the idea that members of Parliament's children can be brought into these sorts of debates extremely distressing."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said it was not responsible for Peters, as deputy prime minister, to be devoting time to Doyle's social media account.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think the way this is being politicised is really unfortunate for Benjamin. I think that some of the aspersions being cast on Benjamin's character are really horrific and really ugly, and portray an ugly side of New Zealand politics that I just don't want to add fuel to."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Monday, Peters said he was "just asking questions", including of the mainstream media.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm asking of the mainstream media: why don't you do your job when it comes to some MPs and spend your time trying to besiege other MPs who in this case, in my case, were utterly innocent?"</p>
        
            <p>Peters denied playing any part in the reported spike in death threats because "the Green Party came to our office well after the threats had been given to tell us that this had been happening".</p>
        
            <p>"We had already posted by that time at nine o'clock in the morning. So for 24 and more hours before that, that was happening. We are not responsible therefore, on the chronological grounds that I've just given to you."</p>
        
            <p>Parliamentary Services was working with Doyle and the Green Party around the received threats, escalating them to police where deemed necessary.</p>
