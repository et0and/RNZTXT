            <p>Brad Shipton, the former police detective convicted of raping Louise Nicholas in a case that had far-reaching consequences for New Zealand law and policing, has died aged 65.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholas, his victim told Stuff she had been informed that Shipton had died in April.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been dead to me for a long time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Shipton had been in a rest home suffering from early-onset dementia.</p>
        
            <p>Shipton confessed to his role in Nicholas' gang rape in 2009, decades after the offences and when he had already served three years for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>At the time he said his whole life had been "full of disgraceful, disgusting behaviour" and he knew he had ruined his victim's life.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholas first made her claims in 2004, in an explosive interview in The Post (then the Dominion Post).</p>
        
            <p>That came after years of investigation by Post reporter Robert Kitchen that would ultimately lead to revelations that a senior officer, John Dewar, had perverted the course of justice in order to secure mistrial acquittals for other policemen, including Shipton, over the course of several trials.</p>
        
            <p>This included not disclosing to a jury that Shipton was already in jail at the time of the trial for an earlier rape.</p>
        
            <p>Dewar himself was eventually convicted on four charges of attempting to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholas has gone on to become a renowned campaigner for victims of rape and sexual violence.</p>
