            <p>Debris on a runway caused delays at Auckland Airport on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The airport said in a statement, "A departing international aircraft reported an issue during takeoff roll just after 7.30pm tonight and left the runway shortly afterwards, returning safely to the departure gate."</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of travellers is always Auckland Airport's top priority and we quickly carried out a routine inspection of the airfield, meaning the runway needed to close for a short time."</p>
        
            <p>I'm stuck on a plane at one of the gates, all we've heard so far is that they're sweeping debris off the runway</p>
        
            <p>After discovering debris on the runway, the airport dispatched two sweeper trucks to clear it.</p>
        
            <p>The short closure of the runway created a number of flight delays and some diversions for arriving flights, the airport said.</p>
        
            <p>The runway has now safely reopened.</p>
