            <p>Everybody likes to use the end of the year to collate lists on the big events and favourite entertainment of the past 12 months, and RNZ is certainly no exception.</p>
        
            <p>2023 might already feel like a distant memory in the bright light of the new year, but RNZ's staff and contributers have plenty of suggestions for the best movies and music you might have missed:</p>
        
            <p>To help digest the year, start thinking about the new one, or just discover some stories you might have missed, here's a selection of the best journalism in 2023 from RNZ's In Depth team.</p>
        
            <p>Claire Concannon, host of RNZ's award-winning science and nature podcast Our Changing World, presents a few of her favourite episodes from 2023 - "Prepare to be intrigued and entertained by Aotearoa's fascinating researchers".</p>
        
            <p>And if you really need to catch up on some of the weird and wildest stories of the year, there are the oddest news RNZ covered in 2023. Or maybe you just need the best animal news stories.</p>
        
            <p>If you've found it hard to keep up with modern music, there's a good reason for that, writes Charlotte Ryan, with 120,000 new music tracks released every day on music streaming platforms. She looks back at the best of times, the worst of times of 2023 in music.</p>
        
            <p>Charlotte also picks her 10 favourite interviews of the year, from Dolly to Florence.</p>

            <p>RNZ resident music guru Tony Stamp names his best singles of 2023 for The Sampler, and if that isn't enough music for you, there is also Tony's best local albums of 2023.</p>
        
            <p>For the best in movies, RNZ film critics nominated their favourite international and local movies of 2023 here, while Simon Morris looked back at the year and found that while 2023 started out the same as the last 10 years - a few blockbusters, a couple of Oscar hopefuls, and a dumb movie starring Jason Statham - things started changing after that.</p>
