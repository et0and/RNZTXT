            <p>Some supermarket shelves have been stripped of stock as south-east Queensland prepares for the onslaught of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which is forecast to cross Australia's coast on Thursday or Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Queenslanders are heeding warnings to stock up on essentials, such as bottled water, batteries and bread, leaving shelves bare in shops across the south-east.</p>
        
            <p>Premier David Crisafulli has warned millions of south-east Queenslanders they should prepare to be without power and water supply.</p>
        
            <p>"The message to the supermarkets is restock the shelves as much as you can, and to Queenslanders, it's heed the warning and buy what you need," Crisafulli said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that people have sufficient food and water, and I understand why Queenslanders want to do that. It's important for supermarkets to do their bit as well."</p>
        
            <p>But Coles's Queensland general manager Joanne Brown has raised concerns about a repeat of Covid-19 panic buying after customers started rushing to supermarkets to stock up on groceries ahead of the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>Some shops say toilet paper has been disappearing fast, mirroring pandemic panic buying.</p>
        
            <p>Brown reassured Queenslanders the supermarket had "large amounts of stock" in the state to replenish shelves.</p>

            <p>"There's no need to worry about stock shortages," she told ABC Radio Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we're in Queensland, we are quite accustomed to dealing with severe weather events."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the supermarket's distribution centre at Redbank, west of Brisbane, was equipped to handle the increase in demand.</p>
        
            <p>"As people went out and started stocking up this morning, we could see those numbers and we already ramped up that distribution centre," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It can actually cope with supplying other states and we don't even blink.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pushing more stock into stores to make sure people stocking up can get what they need.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no shortage of food or water in Queensland."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths has placed temporary limits on the purchase of bulk water, reducing customers to two packs per transaction.</p>
        
            <p>The retail giant's Brisbane Regional Distribution Centre (BRDC) will receive an extra 1,400 pallets of stock on Wednesday, including large amounts of bottled water.</p>
        
            <p>"We're increasing the amount of key products such as pasta, rice, soup, nappies, baby food and formula, milk, and frozen vegetables being sent to stores," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Additional supplies of water, bread, and other pantry essentials are being delivered to our Brisbane Regional Distribution Centre, which will then be sent to stores across the regions.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to work closely with the local and state governments and authorities to ensure we can continue to support local communities as much as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Newmarket resident David Black went to the shops to buy some extra toilet paper along with his normal groceries.</p>
        
            <p>"Just preparation in case things run out because we've heard there's panic buying already," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Black said his daughter rang him this morning and "couldn't believe the amount of people walking out with trolleys of toilet paper and water".</p>
        
            <p>South-east Queenslanders are advised to ensure they have enough bottled water and non-perishable food for five to seven days, including pets.</p>
        
            <p>They should have batteries for torches and a portable radio and backup batteries for mobile phones.</p>
        
            <p>Parents should stock up on baby formula and nappies to get them through the weather emergency and people are also advised to have enough medication available.</p>
        
            <p>Automated teller machines and EFTPOS will not work in a blackout so Queenslanders in the cyclone impact zone should have some cash on hand.</p>
        
            <p>If Alfred makes landfall, as expected, later this week, it will be the first cyclone to cross the southern Queensland coast in half a century.</p>
