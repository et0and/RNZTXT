            <p>Wellington's Mayor Tory Whanau and most of the city's councillors have officially requested that Wellington Water chairperson Nick Leggett resign.</p>
        
            <p>Summaries of reports by AECOM and Deloitte into Wellington Water were released on Monday, finding its maintenance spend was far higher than four other comparative councils, and that it had not managed contractors well, with poor financial oversight.</p>
        
            <p>In a covering note attached to the full AECOM report released on Thursday, Wellington Water said its higher spend was because the network was older and in poorer condition - so it broke frequently and cost more to fix.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water's shareholding councils - Wellington City, Greater Wellington, Porirua, Hutt City, Upper Hutt and South Wairarapa - make up the Wellington Water Committee.</p>
        
            <p>A letter to the committee on Thursday from Wellington's mayor, supported by most councillors - aside from Diane Calvert, Nicola Young, Tony Randle and Nureddin Abdurahman - called for Leggett's resignation.</p>
        
            <p>"The public response to the reports is one of anger and frustration. Rightly so given that millions of dollars in hard earned rate payer money has lined the pockets of contractors while our pipes have further deteriorated over recent years," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"As it stands myself, and a majority of Wellington City Councillors and pouiwi, do not have confidence in Nick Leggett as chair of the WWL and Leanne Southey as the board member responsible for audit and risk."</p>

            <p>They proposed the committee should remove Leggett as chairperson.</p>
        
            <p>If the committee did not agree, they wanted Leggett, Southey, and Wellington Water chief executive Pat Dougherty to front the council, answer questions and apologise to ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>However, they wanted it known they supported Dougherty.</p>
        
            <p>"He has taken on a huge challenge and, for he first time in years, we are getting straight talking and real action to improve things at Wellington Water."</p>
        
            <p>As well as Leggett's resignation, councillors wanted:</p>
        
            <p>"These actions to deal with the issues at Wellington Water Limited recognise the severity of the failings at the organisation," the letter concluded.</p>
        
            <p>"If we fail to act appropriately then ultimately those failings will be our own.</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to discussing these with you and hope you will support all these actions so we can provide united leadership on behalf of our residents."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday Leggett said he was "taking soundings" on whether he should resign after a scathing report revealed possible theft and problems at his organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"I could be the sacrificial lamb," he told Morning Report on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He could also help with the fix, he told the programme.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
