            <p>The victim of a fatal dog attack in Katikati was a young child, a local marae spokesman says.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson for Tuapiro Marae Shaan Kingi said the death of a young child has sent shockwaves throughout the small Katikati community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just.... it's what we call aituā ohorere which is a real shock and tragedy that's hit our community."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were alerted that two people had sustained dog bite injurie, at 2.50pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>One person was transported to the Katikati Medical Centre in a critical condition, and they died a short time later. Another person received moderate injuries and was transported to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Kingi believed the child was only four years old, "just starting off his life", but said in his few short years, he'd made a huge impact.</p>
        
            <p>He said the child was known as a "boisterous young boy, very playful, adventurous".</p>
        
            <p>"He built up his reputation by getting to know some of his neighbours and community, and so even though it's immediate family (grieving) it's really sent ripples through his neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a loving, young, happy-go-lucky boy."</p>
        
            <p>Kingi said the community was wrapping around the whānau affected.</p>
        
            <p>"Sending positive vibrations and prayers of love to the family of our young boy, but also the family of the person that is recovering in hospital at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Kingi said it was too soon to talk about how to prevent a future tragedy, but said teaching people about the risks of animals was important.</p>
        
            <p>Animal management staff have taken the dogs involved in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police are making enquiries into the incident on behalf of the coroner.</p>
