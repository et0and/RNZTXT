        <h2>Would you give someone up for a cash reward?</h2>
        <p>
"$80,000 isn't so much when you've got someone looking for you afterwards" was one man's response.
</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked residents in Ōtorohanga if they would turn someone in for a cash reward - here's what they had to say.</p>
        
            <p>The question was prompted by the reward police announced this week for assistance in finding the Phillips family, who have been missing for two and a half years.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police are out in the tiny King Country settlement of Marokopa as they hunt for the children of fugitive Tom Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>Ember, eight, Maverick, nine, and Jayda, 10, have been missing since December 2021, when they were taken by their father to an unknown location.</p>
        
            <p>Police cars and vans have been seen in and about the King Country town and checkpoints have also been set up.</p>
        
            <p>While there has been plenty of tip-offs, police said, so far there has not been a breakthrough.</p>
        
            <p>So what do residents of Ōtorohanga - about an hour from Marokopa - make of the situation? Would they cooperate in return for cash?</p>
        
            <p>"No. I would give them up but I wouldn't want the reward," one senior citizen said.</p>
        
            <p>She believed Phillips was doing something wrong and she would want to act on behalf of the children but was adamant she did not want the reward.</p>
        
            <p>"If there definitely was a chance of danger, of criminal activity from them, yes I would," another woman said.</p>
        
            <p>Another man was prepared to act as long as one of his family members was not involved and "the price is right".</p>
        
            <p>Others disagreed.</p>
        
            <p>One woman responded that it would depend on the situation, but as far as the Phillips family were concerned it was a definite 'No'.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't give them up for the world," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Two young men agreed with her, one saying he would not do it for the reward.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot of money but he's a good man I hear, and he's looking after those kids well."</p>
        
            <p>The second man said: "It's not my thing, it's nothing to do with me, and if I'm going to win any money I'll try and do it on the Lotto ticket I suppose.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't know what the consequences are going to be; ... I suppose $80,000 isn't so much when you've got someone looking for you afterwards."</p>
