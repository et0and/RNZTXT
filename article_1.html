            <p>The Defence Force (NZDF) will fly into New Caledonia to bring home New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says New Zealand is waiting for the go-ahead from French authorities, based on safety.</p>
        
            <p>"Ever since the security situation in New Caledonia deteriorated earlier this week, the safety of New Zealanders there has been an urgent priority for us," Peters wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>"NZ authorities have now completed preparations for flights using NZDF aircraft to bring home New Zealanders in New Caledonia while commercial services are not operating.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ready to fly, and await approval from French authorities as to when our flights are safe to proceed."</p>
        
            <p>Noum√©a descended into chaos on Monday, with armed clashes between indigenous Kanak pro-independence protesters and security forces.</p>
        
            <p>Peters urged any Kiwis in New Caledonia not already registered with SafeTravel to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"Those already registered should update their details if their circumstances change."</p>
        
            <p>The unrest was sparked by anger at a proposed new law that would allow French residents who have lived there for more than 10 years to vote - which some say will weaken the Kanak vote.</p>
