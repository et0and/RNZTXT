        <h2>Watch live: Luxon fronts after Mike King's controversial comments</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon is speaking to media in Auckland.
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister will speak to media after Labour called for funding for Mike King's Gumboot Friday to be halted over comments he made about alcohol being a mental health solution.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon has been visiting TransNet in East Tamaki, Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey says the government will continue to back Gumboot Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the government has announced $2.5 million to help teens who failed critical NCEA reading, writing and maths tests earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was due to talk to media about 10am. You can watch RNZ's livestream of that at the top of this page, you may need to refresh. </p>
