            <p>Kiwi cruiserweight David Nyika is headlining a card stacked with homegrown talent at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika will meet American Tommy Karpency for the first time as he continues his impressive run to a cruiserweight world title.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika's bout is expected to begin sometime around 11pm, but there will be several fights beforehand on the card.</p>
        
            <p>The American was a late-notice replacement after Nyika's original opponent, Blake Caparello, was forced to withdraw after failing a pre-fight drug test.</p>
        
            <p>This bout is Nyika's first time headlining a major boxing pay-per-view card - and the first of four annual headline fights for the Olympian and two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi star's homecoming party follows an impressive KO win over undefeated German, Michael Seitz, on the undercard of the massive Tyson Fury v Oleksander Usyk showdown in Saudi Arabia in May.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ sports reporter Jonty Dine is at the fight and brings you all the live action here: </p>
