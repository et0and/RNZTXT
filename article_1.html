            <p>Three bodies believed to be those of the missing fishers have been found on the shore at Māhia this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said formal identification was under way but the bodies were believed to be of the fishers who were reported missing on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police's thoughts are with their families at this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne mayor Rehette Stoltz told Morning Report the news the bodies had been found was heartbreaking.</p>
        
            <p>"Our community is in mourning."</p>
        
            <p>She said her love and thoughts were with the families.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is waking up to this news and our community is right behind them."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said the region was experiencing some of the worst weather it had seen, which made the search difficult.</p>
        
            <p>The search and rescue operation was suspended at 7pm Tuesday and had been due to resume today.</p>
        
            <p>The boat carrying the three missing fishers was reported overdue on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The bulk carrier ship - the African Tiger - spotted two men in rough seas off Māhia Peninsula on Tuesday but could not reach them. Those on board threw life rings and flotsam into the water.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force's P8 Poseidon also dropped a life raft in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand suspended the search shortly after 7pm Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Eastland Helicopter Rescue Trust chairperson Patrick Willock said searchers looking for the missing crew in horrendous conditions yesterday were nothing short of heroic.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter from the trust had been helping with the search.</p>
        
            <p>Willock said the missing people were well known in local hunting and fishing circles. He knew two of the missing men through family connections, he said.</p>
