            <p>New Zealand will send a six-member Defence Force team to help protect shipping in the Red Sea from Houthi attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Defence Minister Judith Collins confirmed the plan after Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, the first of the year.</p>
        
            <p>They said no ships would enter Yemen.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint statement, Luxon said the deployment was a "continuation of New Zealand's long history of defending freedom of navigation both in the Middle East and closer to home".</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the decision should not be conflated with New Zealand's position on the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"These efforts support international security and the free flow of trade on which New Zealanders rely," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any suggestion our ongoing support for maritime security in the Middle East is connected to recent developments in Israel and the Gaza Strip, is wrong. We are contributing to this military action for the same reason New Zealand has sent defence personnel to the Middle East for decades - we care deeply about regional security because our economic and strategic interests depend on it."</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the Houthi attacks showed a disregard for international law, peace and stability, and the coalition response was an inevitable consequence of their actions.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand supports global stability and this deployment shows our commitment to efforts to address a serious threat to that stability."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
