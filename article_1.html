            <p>Kiro said she 'wore three hats' for her visit today - as governor-general, on behalf of the people of Aotearoa, and to mourn as a sister with whakapapa to the Kiingi.</p>
        
            <p>She gave paid tribute to the manaakitanga of the Kiingi and Kiingitanga, and their work in bringing people together, referencing the national hui held at Tuurangawaewae in January.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that when Kiingi Tuheitia called the national hui a tau, only here could you have made that work with 10,000 people coming to that call.</p>
        
            <p>"That is a testament, to you koro as you rest, but also to your people."</p>
        
            <p>(A tau is a cord or binding that ties things together.)</p>
        
            <p>Kiro said she supports the Kiingi's call for Māori to be proud of their identity.</p>
        
            <p>She formally read aloud the letter that was issued from King Charles after Kiingi Tuheitia's death, passing on his sadness to hear of Tuheitia's passing, and sending condolences to his whaanau and friends.</p>
        
            <p>More iwi are expecting to be welcomed onto the marae at 2pm, and a Kiingitanga spokesperson said they expect the number of attendees to double in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Police have advised motorists there would be daily road closures around Tuurangawaewae Marae until Thursday, when Kiingi Tuheitia would be laid to rest.</p>
