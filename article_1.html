            <p>Emma Twigg was unable to defend her Olympic title, settling for silver as she was pipped in the women's single sculls final by Dutch rower Karolien Florijn in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg powered home in the final stretch on Saturday night NZT, but could not close the gap on Florijn in a frantic finish.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi made a strong start to sit just behind her Dutch rival.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg stretched the gap between herself and third as she began to chase down Florijn.</p>
        
            <p>Closing in on the 1000m mark, Twigg edged closer to the front as she found another gear.</p>
        
            <p>Just 500m to go, and Twigg was storming home with Florijn fading.</p>
        
            <p>At the final marker just one second separated Twigg from first, both women emptying the gas tanks as the finish approached.</p>
        
            <p>In an intensely tight finish, the gap proved too much for Twigg, as the Dutch claimed the gold and New Zealand claimed silver. Lithuania took the bronze medal.</p>
        
            <p>Paris marked the 37-year-old's fifth Games and the result brings New Zealand's rowing medal tally to four, after the team claimed a bronze, silver and gold earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>The total haul sits at seven.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg told RNZ that she "couldn't have asked for more" from the race.</p>
        
            <p>"That race, I really put it all out there and looked across with 500m to go and was level with Karolien and I thought for a moment there that I was just going to keep walking, but the legs only got me to about the 1800m mark today. But yeah, really proud of that."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was up against some amazing competition.</p>
        
            <p>"Karolien is an amazing sculler, she has really set the benchmark over the last three years and I'm proud as a 37-year-old that I'm keeping up with a 25-year-old, so I can't ask for more."</p>
        
            <p>Twigg said she was proud that she "emptied the tank" in the race.</p>
        
            <p>Getting a silver was "phenomenal", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been to three Olympics where I have been so disappointed, just missing out on a medal, so very proud."</p>
        
            <p>Twigg told Sky Sport the race was the perfect way to end her career.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing to come away with a medal and be a part of a wider team effort that has just blown my mind."</p>
        
            <p>She admitted she was questioning her form leading up to the Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I was proud after Tokyo so this was always going to be a cherry on top. It certainly had its ups and downs so this week has been a blast for me and I didn't want it to end."</p>
