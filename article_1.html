            <p>A well known Australian lifeguard refused evacuation orders in the midst of a stabbing attack at a Sydney mall to help severely injured victims.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday afternoon, chaos erupted at Westfield Bondi Junction when 40-year-old Joel Cauchi began stabbing people.</p>
        
            <p>Australian police have said Cauchi, who was shot dead by a police officer at the scene, struggled with mental health-related issues.</p>
        
            <p>Six people have died while others remain in hospital in serious conditions. One victim in hospital was just nine-months-old.</p>
        
            <p>Of the six deceased victims, five were women.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Reid, known for his role on Australian lifeguard TV show Bondi Rescue, was in the shopping centre at the time of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Reid told The Panel he was buying a bunk bed in Myer when a sales assistant told him they had to evacuate as people were being stabbed outside.</p>
        
            <p>He went to leave the shop but the roller doors were already closed by this time. Walking closer to the shutters, Reid heard two gunshots and looked down to the level below, where he could see a woman on the floor, bleeding.</p>

            <p>Reid said he quickly went down to the lower level of Myer and asked to be let out of the shop to help the woman.</p>
        
            <p>From what he could see, there appeared to be a victim every 50 metres, all with "pretty bad wounds".</p>
        
            <p>Reid helped work on three women, including one who paramedics said was not going to make it.</p>
        
            <p>He recalled seeing an empty pram, thinking it was strange as no one was around it and all shops were closed up.</p>
        
            <p>He later learnt his friend Ashlee Good and her nine-month-old baby had been taken to hospital after being attacked.</p>
        
            <p>Good died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"I put two and two together and realised that was probably her pram and that's what had happened and she just happened to get out of there, but sadly she didn't make it either.</p>
        
            <p>"Her little baby is still with us at the moment, which is good. Serious but stable condition. Just a horrific event in general."</p>
        
            <p>Reid said watching footage of the incident had given it "so much more depth".</p>

            <p>"We see some pretty gnarly stuff on the beaches â€¦ nothing compares to that."</p>
        
            <p>Reid said it was horrible to know a friend of his was there and did not make it.</p>
        
            <p>He said he would get the professional help to make sure he was looked after mentally.</p>
        
            <p>Leanne Devine, who owns a hair salon just outside the mall, kept her shop open for people to seek refuge in the wake of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Devine told The Panel she could not stop thinking about what happened and had never seen anything like the scenes she saw on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>People were running with fear on their face, shouting and crying, Devine said.</p>
        
            <p>Older women with shopping trolleys sought refuge in her shop, not being able to run any further.</p>
        
            <p>"I just feel so sorry for the people shopping in Westfield and seeing that horrendous event happening. The stories we've heard."</p>
        
            <p>Devine said emergency services also went to her shop for a breather and a drink while dealing with the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared Monday a national day of mourning for the victims, ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>Government buildings would fly flags at half mast and the Sydney Opera House sails would be lit up with a black ribbon to honour the victims.</p>
