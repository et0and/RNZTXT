            <p>A "monster" wasp nest in South Auckland has been destroyed with exterminators taking two days to get rid of over 200,000 wasps.</p>
        
            <p>The multi-generational nest was in a Conifer tree on a farm in Karaka, and stood at 1.6 metres high, and 1.5 metres wide.</p>
        
            <p>It took two technicians two trips to treat it completely and is the biggest nest lead exterminator and wasp expert Lloyd Carpenter had seen above ground in 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of those nests that's been living away undisturbed for the last few years," he told Morning Report. </p>
        
            <p>"Probably because we've had such warm winters, as generally they die off each winter, but if it's a warm enough winter, the nest just keeps going and we get these monster nests in Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>"Quite large in size, and quite a surprise for the homeowner (as) she found it as well."</p>
        
            <p>Carpenter described the noise of that many wasps sounded like a Formula One car was in the backyard.</p>
        
            <p>He said special tools are required to get rid of a nest that big.</p>

            <p>"We actually have a pressure duster...imagine a fire extinguisher on steroids.</p>
        
            <p>"We put the powder in, we charge it up with compressed air, and that allows us to shoot the powder at quite a high rate."</p>
        
            <p>He said two technicians go in from either side in multiple spots, and inject the powder straight into the nest, which is covered off and kills the wasps.</p>
        
            <p>"It does agitate them while we do it, so we did have bit of an angry wasp crowd but it's all part of the job really," Carpenter said.</p>
        
            <p>He said generally his team are required when nests reach a size bigger than a tennis ball, with sprays from most hardware stores sufficient for those smaller.</p>
        
            <p>Carpenter said it is difficult to prevent wasp nests, with bait such as Vespex only effective certain times of the year when wasps on feeding on different things.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite often with our wasp control, because it's reactive, people get in the garden on a nice weekend, find that wasp nest, and at that stage, it's kind of too late really," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He also explained the differences between stumbling on a wasp nest as opposed to a beehive.</p>
        
            <p>"I always describe it as when you get close to a beehive, it's 'hi, how are you?', when you get close to a wasp next, it's 'what do you want?', so they are a lot more aggressive," Carpenter said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was cases last summer where they were attending houses every day for a couple of months where someone had been stung by a wasp.</p>
