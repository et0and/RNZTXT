        <h2>NZ First disagrees with Cabinet over Covid-19 inquiry</h2>
        <p>
Winston Peters says the party disagrees with allowing the inquiry to continue as-is and with its current chair who, he says, risks a perception of bias.

            <p>Winston Peters says New Zealand First disagrees with the decision to allow the Covid-19 inquiry to continue in its current form and with its current chairperson who, he says, risks a perception of bias.</p>
        
            <p>The move marks the first use of the "agree to disagree" provisions in the coalition agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden has been leading the process for expanding the inquiry's scope, and on Tuesday afternoon announced it would mean a "second phase" that would focus on matters of ongoing public concern.</p>
        
            <p>This would include:</p>
        
            <p>The commission last year delayed hearing public submissions until 2024 while the National-led coalition government reviewed its scope.</p>
        
            <p>The government began public consultation in February on expanding the scope, and what should now be included.</p>
        
            <p>Van Velden said more than 13,000 submissions were received from the public, and the second phase would begin in November, aiming to deliver final recommendations by February 2026.</p>

            <p>Elements of the second phase would be conducted in public, and current commissioners Tony Blakely and John Whitehead would resign in November after the first phase was delivered.</p>
        
            <p>Peters announced the party's position in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, saying NZ First supported establishing a "second phase" for the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we disagree with allowing the current inquiry to simply continue as 'phase one' in its current form, the current chair remaining in place, and the further extension of its report back period," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that 'phase one' of the Royal Commission is simply a continuation of the current inquiry, which is far too narrow in scope and remains compromised by the current Chair's direct involvement with the previous government's administration and direct planning of the Covid pandemic response.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand First campaigned on the fact that the current Royal Commission was nothing more than a Labour Party political tool, being used to craft a message through its lack of scope and lack of suitability of the commissioners. We believe the public perception of bias of the current chair represents a reputational risk for 'phase one' of the inquiry."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said New Zealand must have an independent and robust report on the lessons learned from the Covid-19 response which could be used for any future pandemics.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand First respects Cabinet's decision to invoke the 'agree to disagree' provisions in the coalition agreement," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The agreements with both ACT and NZ First committed the government to expanding the scope of the Covid-19 inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the pandemic response was announced in December 2022, saying it would be wide-ranging and examine the economic response, what can be learned from the pandemic and how it can be applied to any future pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>However, individual decisions and how policies applied to individual cases or circumstances would be considered out of scope along with judgments and decisions of courts, tribunals and other agencies, private sector operations, and the Reserve Bank's independent monetary policy committee.</p>
        
            <p>Changes to court proceedings and parliament proceedings because of the pandemic will not be looked at, nor will the conduct of the 2020 general election, along with vaccine efficacy, nor the "specific epidemiology" of the virus and its variants.</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Professor Tony Blakely in December said the commission welcomed the opportunity to work with the new government on what an expanded remit will look like.</p>
        
            <p>Van Velden said Cabinet has agreed to the several points as an "indicative scope of the terms of reference for the second phase":</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Blakely for comment.</p>
