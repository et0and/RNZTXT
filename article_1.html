        <h2>Pre-Christmas Budget to be a 'mini, mini, mini Budget' - PM</h2>
        <p>
With only three weeks in government, the pre-Christmas Budget will be a "mini, mini, mini Budget", says Christopher Luxon.

            <p>With only three weeks in government, the pre-Christmas Budget will be a "mini, mini, mini Budget", says the Prime Minister.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis is set to release that budget on Wednesday which will coincide with the Treasury's latest economic update.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon told Morning Report that he thought the coalition government had "done really well" in its first three weeks in power.</p>
        
            <p>"The economy has been under major strain, there's been a hell of a mess that's been left behind by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have a mini, mini, mini budget in our three weeks in government. We've been able to undertake some action that we think will start to ... restore some confidence in the economy and the management of those books."</p>
        
            <p>The government has been making no apologies as it powered through repealing the Labour government's legacy piece by piece - as promised ahead of the election.</p>
        
            <p>The dual mandate was first to go, followed by Fair Pay Agreements and the Clean Car Discount as the next items crossed off National's to-don't list.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
