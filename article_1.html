        <h2>Watch: Christopher Luxon's first post-Cabinet media briefing</h2>
        <p>
PM Christopher Luxon, at his first post-Cabinet media briefing, said the government's work started today - and it was an "ambitious" programme.
</p>
        
            <p>PM Christopher Luxon began his first post-Cabinet media briefing this afternoon with a cheerful "Well, kia ora, good afternoon everybody".</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop was also present to speak about business in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Welcome to what is our very first press conference in the beginning of the 54th Parliament," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say it's been a very busy three days for our new coalition govenrment which was sworn in on Monday ... it was a really special occasion for myself and I think for all my ministers that were sworn in on Monday."</p>
        
            <p>He said he laid out his expectations of his ministers in yesterday's initial Cabinet meeting, "and reminded them of why were are all here, which is to deliver and get things done for the New Zealand people".</p>
        
            <p>"The last few years have been incredibly hard for so many New Zealanders, almost everyone is struggling with the cost of living. Just today we've seen again the Reserve Bank warning that high inflation means interest rates may have to be raised."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the government's work started today, "because today I am outlining our work plan for this coalition government's first 100 days in office. It is ambitious but it is necessary in order to bring about the relief to New Zealanders who have been doing it tough for way too long".</p>
        
            <p>"Put simply, that means more money in your pocket, safer homes and workplaces, better, faster and more reliable healthcare, and an education for your children that delivers them the better choices for their futures."</p>
        
            <p>Parliament will sit next week and begin to put in place the 49 actions in the plan, he said.</p>

            <p>The governor-general will give the speech from the throne next week to open the new Parliament. Bishop said the week will start on Tuesday with the election of the new speaker, with National nominating Gerry Brownlee for the role.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday at 11am, the MPs will meet for the state opening and governor-general's speech, other presiding officers will be elected, followed by the response from MPs - particularly, the party leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday will have the first Question Time at 2pm, followed by the continuation of the address in reply debate.</p>
        
            <p>"There are 42 maiden speeches in the new Parliament," Bishop said. "Not all the maiden speeches will be able to be done this side of Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>He said the final two weeks of the year for Parliament would include more of the debate, maiden speeches, and the Parliament moving into urgency.</p>
        
            <p>Depending on progress, the house will rise in the week starting 18 December, and the exact time will depend on the opposition, "and we will see how we go", Bishop said.</p>

            <p>It is only two days since the new government was sworn in, but it has already faced national and international criticism over its plan to scrap smokefree legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Asked how the government could deliver better health outcomes for MƒÅori when it was going to repeal the smokefree legislation, Luxon said the way it had been presented had been disingenous.</p>
        
            <p>"Smoking rates have come down under successive governents, and they'll continue to come down under our government.</p>
        
            <p>"All the parties under our coalition actually opposed that legislation or components of that legislation - we think it's wrong for example to have a single store in Northland as a target for crime and for ram raids and for gangs and to ultimately drive for a bigger black market.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not unwinding smoking legislation, we're just sticking with the status quo and we'll continue to drive smoking rates down."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister has attacked media on more than one occasion since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>That prompted opposition leader Chris Hipkins to say Luxon had already lost control of his government.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon laughed when asked about Peters' comments about media being bribed.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, it's not the way I would describe it but I don't actually support the fund either ... what I'd just say to you though is we are now in a coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be different personalities, there'll be different ways of expressing things, it may not be the way I would express everything all the time but it's important everyone understands that."</p>
        
            <p>"Yes we're going to say things in different ways, as different leaders and as different members of that team as a coalition government and that's fine, that acceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he found Peters' remarks acceptable, Luxon said: "Well, it's not the way that I would have expressed it but I understand the frustration with the fund as many New Zealanders do as well.</p>
        
            <p>"There was different criteria that was actually put to actually using those funds, we have a difference of opinion about that, and there's lots of people with different views about that. I just don't think it was a good idea or a good programme."</p>
        
            <p>He said it led to perceptions of bias - rightly or wrongly - and "whether that's real or not, doesn't really matter. That's the perception that it creates".</p>
        
            <p>Peters' comments were "not at all" a distraction from more important work, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, we have serious challenges in this country and we are focused on those things. And so personalities and being able to build within a team of a diverse range of views, a diverse range of personalities, is a good thing."</p>
