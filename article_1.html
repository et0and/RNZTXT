            <p>Tradespeople are being warned that if they are given gift cards as part of a rebate or discount, they probably need to pay tax on them.</p>
        
            <p>Inland Revenue said it was common for trade suppliers to offer rebates to trade customers in the form of discounts.</p>
        
            <p>It was aware that it was increasingly common for this to happen in the form of product or gift card rebates, and sometimes they were passed on to employees.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was aware that in some instances these were being viewed or promoted as tax-free, but this was incorrect.</p>
        
            <p>Inland Revenue gave examples, including that of a farm business buying farming supplies.</p>
        
            <p>If the supplier gave customers a rebate in the form of a gift card of $100 for every $1000 of purchases, this should be counted as business income for the purchasing farm business, it said.</p>
        
            <p>But if the business did not report it for tax purposes it could be liable for a shortfall penalty.</p>
        
            <p>In another example, if a builder buying materials received a gift card and passed it on to a non-shareholder employee, it would also have tax obligations.</p>
        
            <p>If it did not account for the value of the card as business income and did not pay fringe benefit tax (FBT), it could be liable for a penalty for both the FBT shortfall and the omitted business income.</p>
        
            <p>Deloitte tax partner Robyn Walker said it was likely that many people had been overlooking this obligation or treating the amounts as a gift that could be ignored for tax purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the increased prevalence of suppliers looking to offer loyalty schemes it is timely that Inland Revenue has put out some guidance to ensure there is a level playing field.</p>
        
            <p>"I am aware that some suppliers have been offering more generous benefits to trade customers and in some instances advising that amounts received were tax-free. The new statement from Inland Revenue makes it clear that this isn't the case."</p>
