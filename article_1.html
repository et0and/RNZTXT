        <h2>How Wellington's windy weather has been turned into dazzling art</h2>
        <p>
A simulation captures eight years of P≈çneke weather, with a day's worth of data shown every second.

            <p>Eight years of Wellington's weather data has been turned into an art simulation.</p>
        
            <p>Delainy Jamahl's exhibition, Rivers of Wind, is the first body of work to be shown at new immersive digital art gallery The Grid Art Space in Te Aro.</p>
        
            <p>The gallery was founded by Jamahl and Shannon Brosnahan Inglis and opened last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Rivers of Wind turns eight years of weather data from Wellington Airport's weather station into an artistic simulation.</p>
        
            <p>The piece runs for 48 minutes, with a day's worth of data shown every second.</p>
        
            <p>Jamahl said the piece had moments of stillness, "moments of of complete chaos", and everything in between.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the beauty of it because it's recorded nature and you can't create that randomness that you can with computers."</p>
        
            <p>Although an artistic simulation, Jamahl said it was possible to see the data from major weather events within the piece.</p>
        
            <p>Although the simulation contained a range of data, wind played a strong role in the piece.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the work would give people a different perspective on Wellington's wind.</p>
        
            <p>"Living in Wellington, everyone has their own relationship with the weather here. For me personally, I really love it, I've come to love it and I can often miss it when I leave.</p>
        
            <p>"So I really wanted to share a bit of that and hopefully offer a different perspective to the weather through this work."</p>
