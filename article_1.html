        <h2>Coalition talks to resume in Auckland</h2>
        <p>
As National's negotiating team gathers in Auckland this morning, Labour's Carmel Sepuloni says the slow pace of coalition talks "speaks volumes".

            <p>Coalition talks to form the next government are expected to resume at a different hotel in Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>A month on from the election, and nearly two weeks after the official results were released, National leader Christopher Luxon is yet to sign an agreement with ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>The deal-making took a symbolic step forward yesterday with Luxon meeting David Seymour and Winston Peters at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the photo released of the three leaders, they are yet to reach a deal, though Seymour says they're getting closer.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands National's negotiating team will gather at a different hotel in Auckland this morning, though it is not clear who they will be meeting with.</p>

            <p>Deputy Labour leader and caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni said the time it was taking to form a government spoke volumes about the coalition's future.</p>
        
            <p>She told First Up the ongoing coalition talks were obviously difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"The time that it's taken goes to show that bringing those three parties together is not going to be easy - which I think speaks volumes on what may happen moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't a surprise that coalition talks were taking so long, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the dialogue in the lead-up to this maybe underestimated how difficult this could be - but we always knew it was going to be difficult."</p>
