            <p>Think back a year ago to where Vern Cotter and Rob Penney were. The Blues had just thumped the Crusaders and it was clearly apparent that something was very, very wrong with the perennial champions.</p>
        
            <p>Right now, it's Cotter's Blues that are trying to figure out their many deficiencies, while the Crusaders are looking very much like they could be contenders for the title again.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues are coming in off yet another loss, last weekend's 32-31 result against the Chiefs the most heart-breaking of the lot. Meanwhile, the Crusaders laid waste to the Force in a 55-33 win.</p>

            <p>Stephen Perofeta returns to the number 10 jersey after Harry Plummer and Beauden Barrett have both had turns trying to get the Blues' backline firing. Hoskins Sotutu returns after his suspension and should add his physicality to kick-start their gameplan, while Xavi Taele gets another start at second five. Patrick Tuipulotu is very likely to be a non-starter after leaving Blues training early during the week, although he's been given up to kick-off to prove his fitness.</p>

            <p>Macca Springer scored five tries last weekend and has been dropped - that's the situation Penney can engineer with the talent at his disposal in the outside backs. Up front, there is a bit of a hiccup with Codie Taylor ruled out on Friday, however, Ioane Moananu has been in very good form through the early part of the season. Ethan Blackadder is also out, replaced by Tom Christie at openside.</p>

            <p>The Crusaders have won 32 games against the Blues in Super Rugby Pacific, the joint-most wins of any team against a single opponent in the history of the competition.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues have lost four of their last five Super Rugby Pacific games including each of their last two by margins of one point. Only once in Super Rugby Pacific history has any team had three consecutive games decided by that margin (Kings from Round 15-17, 2017).</p>
        
            <p>Sevu Reece (Crusaders) has scored five tries across his last two Super Rugby Pacific games and has scored 14 tries across his last 11 games. His next try will be the 65th of his career, drawing him level with TJ Perenara with the most in Super Rugby history.</p>
        
            <p>Crusaders 29 - 27 Blues</p>
        
            <p>One of the few moments of joy for the Crusaders last year, this result really came out of nowhere against a Blues side that had steamrolled pretty much everyone in the preceding weeks. It helped that Codie Taylor was back to bolster the Crusaders, he played a leading hand in two tries as they caused a big upset.</p>
        
            <p>Is this the week the Blues finally figure out their 2025 identity? Sotutu's return should help, after all he was a big part of their only win this year so far. So, expect a heavy diet of him running off the back of the scrum and in midfield. The Crusaders will be wary of Perofeta's influence but will miss Blackadder's effectiveness on shutting down that inside channel, however can count on Sevu Reece, Will Jordan and Chay Fihaki out wide.</p>
