            <p>A Coromandel man accused of murdering a pig hunter and attempting to murder another has been granted bail until his trial in 2027, his lawyer says.</p>
        
            <p>Stuart Edmondson, 77, appeared at the High Court in Hamilton on Tuesday where, through his lawyer Ron Mansfield KC, he entered not guilty pleas to the charges.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Mabbott died in the incident near Coromandel Town and another man was taken to hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>Mabbott, 41, was a father-of-five and was described by his loved ones as a "loveable ratbag".</p>

            <p>A trial date of 17 May 2027 was set - almost two-and-a-half years on from the initial incident.</p>
        
            <p>Edmondson, a farmer, who was known internationally for wild pigs he treats as pets, had a bail hearing on Tuesday afternoon, but the decision of Justice Matthew Muir was reserved.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield confirmed to RNZ on Wednesday evening that he had been granted bail and would be released on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the pigs Edmondson cared for and his dogs have been relocated by Wellington Animal Shelter Huha.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page for the pigs raised $59,386 toward the $66,000 needed to fence them in their new home.</p>
