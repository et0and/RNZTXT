            <p>Four people including a police officer were injured in a stabbing attack in Sydney early on Sunday, police said, the latest in a series of knife assaults in Australia's biggest city this year.</p>
        
            <p>A man who ran from the scene has been taken into custody, police said in a statement. There is no ongoing threat to people in Sydney, said New South Wales state Police Minister Yasmin Catley.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they did not believe anyone was killed in the attack, which followed a crash in the southern suburb of Engadine.</p>
        
            <p>Aerial footage of the scene by the Australian Broadcasting Corp showed two crashed cars cordoned off with police tape.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney, a city of 5 million, has experienced a spate of knife attacks this year, prompting the New South Wales government to toughen its knife laws. The state parliament passed laws in June giving police electronic metal-detecting scanners to check people without a warrant at shopping centres, sporting venues and public transport stations.</p>
        
            <p>In April, six people were killed and 12 injured in a knife attack at a mall in Sydney's Bondi area.</p>
