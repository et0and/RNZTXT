            <p>A vigil for slain Nelson police officer Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming on Friday evening will help the community grieve and support each other, the organiser says.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was killed after she and another officer, Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsey, were struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square in the early hours of New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsey remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man was due to appear in the Nelson District Court on Friday facing eight charges, including murder and attempted murder.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 people were expected to attend the vigil at 7pm on the steps of the Christ Church Cathedral in Nelson's Trafalgar Square, organiser Shelley Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>She did not know Fleming, but felt compelled to act when she heard of the officer's death.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually cried, I've never met her, but I cried."</p>

            <p>Bishop realised the whole community was grieving as she read more about Fleming and what a "treasure" she was to many locals.</p>
        
            <p>"I put up a post on Facebook about her passing away and the outpouring of grief was immense, and I thought, 'we need to show our support', so basically within 10 minutes I came up with that idea," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Locals had been donating candles and crafting blue ribbons for the vigil, which would involve performances from a bagpiper, as well as a local talent singing 'Amazing Grace'.</p>
        
            <p>The council had been organising traffic management and the police were invited to have a representative speak if they wanted, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>Those who could not attend were encouraged to put blue ribbons on their letterboxes as a show of support.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop hoped the vigil would bring the community together, and perhaps ease the "glum" feeling in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just quite surreal, it's just so sad, one police officer ... the ripple effect has literally affected the entire region as well as New Zealand," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was the first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty, Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>She was remembered as a "very much loved" leader who served for 38 years, and as a daughter, mother and wife who was long involved in community sport.</p>
