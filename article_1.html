            <p>Significant fire safety defects mean residents of City Garden Apartments on Albert St need to evacuate on short notice.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council has issued a Dangerous Building Notice for the building.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were told on 12 April that they needed to leave by 22 April, in a notice posted on the window at the entrance of the building.</p>

            <p>Also posted is a letter to the apartment's body corporate from Fire and Emergency dated 21 August 2023. It outlines a series of major safety concerns it has about the building.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter, FENZ said the building had not had a warrant of fitness since 2017, that it was unclear whether the building's fire alarms could reliably alert occupants to a fire, or that residents could reliably find the escape routes due to the condition of the signage.</p>
        
            <p>It also said the escape routes did not offer protection to anyone using them from a possible fire, and that it was unclear whether they could deliver water to the upper levels of the building in the event of a fire.</p>
        
            <p>One resident said the occupants were told they would need to vacate this weekend if the building did not pass fire testing on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>But another said they had been told they would be given an extra week to vacate if it failed the test.</p>
        
            <p>A third person, who has been living at the Albert Street tower for more than a year, said he was unaware of any order to vacate.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said living conditions at the apartment were poor, including a cockroach infestation, and the fire alarm frequently went off - up to six times a day.</p>
        
            <p>He had found a new place to live from next month.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reporter Lucy Xia, who was at the scene, said firefighters might struggle to access the building in the event of a fire, due to extensive roadworks on Albert Street.</p>
        
            <p>The 16-storey tower is located on Albert St, and back in 2018 was found to have the same type of highly combustible cladding as London's Grenfell Tower, where more than 70 people died in a rapid-fire.</p>
