            <p>A digger has damaged the main fibre cable between WhangƒÅrei and Dargaville, leaving thousands of homes and businesses in the Kaipara District without internet since 8am.</p>
        
            <p>A Northpower spokesperson said the Spark-owned cable supplied broadband to all customers in Dargaville, Ruawai, Paparoa and Maungaturoto.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2070 customers were affected, with many businesses forced to close or switch to cash-only transactions.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower said the damage was caused by a digger pulling up the main fibre cable.</p>
        
            <p>Dargaville resident Rose Dixon said there were huge queues at the town's supermarket because Eftpos was down and customers without sufficient cash had to fill in credit notes instead.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands Spark technicians have now reached the breakage site but repairs will likely continue into the night.</p>
        
            <p>There is currently no estimate for the restoration time.</p>
