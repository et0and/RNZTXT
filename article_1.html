            <p>Storms are forecast for much of New Zealand this weekend, with a swathe of yellow and orange weather warnings and watches across the motu.</p>
        
            <p>The heaviest rain is expected in the South Island, while thunderstorms are expected to move up the North Island during Saturday and into Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The angry weather will sweep up much of the North Island overnight from midnight Saturday through to 7am Sunday, MetService forecasters say. It could become severe or bring flash floods and dangerous driving conditions, with wind gusts up to 110kmh or stronger.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of these thunderstorms may generate localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm an hour, especially from Waitomo southwards," a MetService spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Wind gusts of this strength can cause some structural damage, including trees and power lines."</p>
        
            <p>The west of the South Island is expected to cop the heaviest dumpings of rain for the country this weekend, along with the headwaters of the lakes and rivers of Otago and Canterbury, MetService forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, strong winds will buffet many parts of the mainland.</p>

            <p>And forecasters say while Otago, parts of Southland and Fiordland have been weathering strong winds on Saturday, they had eased for the day by 1pm, but northwesterly severe gales are expected to back from Sunday afternoon.</p>
