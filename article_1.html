            <p>Two New Zealand brothers remain behind bars after appearing in a Phuket court, following a scuffle with a Thai police officer earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>Hamish and Oscar Day have been charged with multiple offences including robbery, assaulting an officer, attempted bribery and driving a motorcycle without a license.</p>
        
            <p>The brothers were allegedly speeding and fled from the police officer on Saturday. The officer was later tackled by one of the brothers and a gun was wrestled off him, causing a bullet to be fired. Nobody was injured.</p>

            <p>Phuket News journalist JP Mestanza told RNZ Checkpoint today that the two brothers appeared in court on Monday, but it was just a formality.</p>
        
            <p>"When someone is arrested over the weekend, they hold them until they have a court appearance on the next available date."</p>
        
            <p>They would be held in a jail at the back of the courthouse until authorities decided on how to proceed, said Mestanza.</p>
        
            <p>He said the police officer who was assaulted in the incident was at home recovering.</p>
        
            <p>Mestanza said local police were still sorting out exactly what happened, but there appeared to be an offer of a bribe, and the fight began when the officer took out his phone to take a photo of the license plate.</p>
        
            <p>He said the incident was part of a larger crackdown in Thailand over foreigners in Thailand.</p>
        
            <p>One case in Phuket - involving a Swiss ex-pat who kicked some Thai people who were sitting on the steps of his villa - has seen the Phuket governor and immigration police pledge to deal more strongly with people who were breaking Thai law.</p>
        
            <p>"This is two tourists and a police officer, so hard to tell if it's an anti-foreigner sentiment, but it is in the middle of this whole thing."</p>
        
            <p>The brothers' parents - millionaire businesspeople Laurence and Katrina Day - are likely to travel to Thailand soon.</p>
