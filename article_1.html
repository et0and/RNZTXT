            <p>Weather officials are warning thunderstorms and heavy rain could hit the upper North Island on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>As at 8am, MetService had three watches and one warning in place.</p>
        
            <p>Severe thunderstorm watches were on Coromandel Peninsula and the Bay of Plenty, while the former also had a heavy rain watch and the latter a heavy rain warning.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel's heavy rain watch was for 3am - 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Periods of rain and thunderstorms are expected," MetService said. "Rainfall accumulations may approach warning criteria in a few areas. Moderate chance of upgrading to a warning."</p>
        
            <p>The severe thunderstorm watch for both Coromandel and Bay of Plenty was in place up to 11am Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"Lines of heavy showers and thunderstorms embedded in a moist northerly flow are expected to affect the upper North Island overnight and [Saturday]. There is a risk that some of these showers and thunderstorms may bring localised downpours of 25 to 40mm per hour for Great Barrier Island, Coromandel Peninsula and Bay of Plenty, including Rotorua."</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty's orange-level heavy rain warning was for basically the whole of Saturday - up to 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Expect 80 to 120mm in periods of heavy rain and thunderstorms. Peak rates of 25 to 40mm/h possible in localised downpours. Minimal chance of upgrading to a Red Warning.</p>
        
            <p>"Streams and rivers may rise rapidly. Surface flooding, slips, and difficult driving conditions possible."</p>
        
            <p>MetService advised motorists to take care, and residents to avoid low-lying areas and clear their home's gutters.</p>
        
            <p>The next update was expected at 10am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty Civil Defence on social media urged locals to "keep an eye on the conditions".</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane on Friday told Morning Report that a southerly working its way up the country would hover over the motu this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"In the lead-up towards Christmas it is unfortunately an unsettled one. I know at this time of year there is a lot of travel happening, a lot of planning for the big day."</p>
        
            <p>The southerly was a "bit of a throwback" to winter, bringing rain on Friday and unsettled weather for this weekend, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a low pressure system just east of the country and that has been feeding through south-easterly winds. I know here in Wellington they can be quite biting and chilly, and a lot of places have been feeling that."</p>
