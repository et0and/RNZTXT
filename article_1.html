            <p>Shane Edwards' mother says she is relieved her son's body has been found, after police confirmed remains discovered in Tokoroa earlier this month are those of the 45-year-old father-of-four.</p>
        
            <p>Timua Brennan told RNZ her son's whānau now has closure after the confirmation.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards was reported missing in May 2022 and police said there were unusual circumstances surrounding his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"He's not lost anymore," Brennan said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got closure and absolute relief that he's decided to pop his head up and be found.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew he wasn't going to come back through the door and say 'Hi mum'. After two-and-a-half years we knew that was not the case.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was the closure and we can hold a tangi and we've all got somewhere to go now to see him. Before we didn't have anywhere to go, he was still lost. There was nowhere to go, but now there is - for all of us and his sons. So we're relieved."</p>
        
            <p>The family still had many questions, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"How did he go from being in the kitchen helping with the boys at dinnertime to where we are today?" Brennan said.</p>
        
            <p>"How did he get from the house at dinner time to being on a missing persons list and a police investigation for two and half years?</p>
        
            <p>"Something's not right there."</p>
        
            <p>The whānau had waited more than two years for answers.</p>
        
            <p>"The truth will come out in the end," Brennan said.</p>
        
            <p>But the family's immediate concern was now planning Edwards' tangi and saying goodbye.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very fortunate - the data tells us that there's 500+ missing persons in New Zealand, Shane is no longer one of them. He was and he's not, so we're very blessed because there's families out there that are still waiting," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're blessed that we get to have him back.</p>
        
            <p>"We can say to the families out there still waiting - don't give up hope. Don't give up hope.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't give up on hope of Shane being found. We just had to be patient and wait and just let the police do their job. So we're very grateful to the police as well. We have a we have a wonderful outcome for ourselves and for his sons."</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed the investigation into Edwards' death was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Ryan Yardley said there were some unusual circumstances surrounding his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"We are determined to uncover what happened and to provide answers for his family and loved ones."</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to hear from anyone with information about Edwards' movements prior to his disappearance or how he came to be located near Mossop Road in Tokoroa.</p>
        
            <p>Even the smallest detail could be crucial, Yardley said.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge anyone who may have seen Shane leading up to his disappearance in May 2022, or who has any information, to contact us. Anyone with information is asked to contact Police online or via 105 quoting file reference number 220518/6338. Information can also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111."</p>
