            <p>The golden era of trade is over and New Zealand needs to push hard to diversify its trading partners, the deputy secretary of trade says.</p>
        
            <p>Vangelis Vitalis made the comments at the Primary Industries Conference in Wellington on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Vitalis said primary industry exports went through a boom between 1995 and 2017 but since then, things had become much harder.</p>
        
            <p>Countries were more protective of their own industries, and superpowers like the US and China were stepping outside of regular trading relationships, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ask any Australian be they a wine exporter, barley exporter, coal exporter how challenging the geo-politics is, because China closed them down.</p>
        
            <p>"The geo-politics is getting harder and more difficult. The big powers are now stepping outside the rules-based trading system. And we, the smaller and medium states, are increasingly the collateral damage to that. We need to find ways to mitigate that risk."</p>
        
            <p>Vitalis said Aotearoa could not afford to rest on its laurels especially if it want to reached the goal of doubling the value of exports in the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very important to remember, as the prime minister said, that the policy is 'China and..'."</p>
        
            <p>China took 23 percent of New Zealand's exports and was "critically important", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But while we have a trade agreement with China and Hong Kong, we also have an agreement with CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) partners. And that group of partners is 27 percent of our trade."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand was trying to "hedge" against risks.</p>
        
            <p>"Then you add ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). The big story there is the growing market of Indonesia, and the growth of Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was trying to grow its trade network through its agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Vitalis said as well as opening new markets, we needed to make the most of deals we already had in place.</p>
