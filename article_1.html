            <p>Police have identified the man who is missing after reportedly going overboard on a Wellington ferry last week.</p>
        
            <p>The East By West ferry was travelling towards Days Bay, Eastbourne from Queens Wharf and left just after 6am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The man was the only passenger onboard, and was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Rachel Boyd said police would not be releasing any details of his identity at this stage.</p>

            <p>The Wellington resident is yet to be found, but a potential location of interest had been identified in the Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the report of a man falling overboard Maritime New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre NZ coordinated a thorough on-water search effort using detailed modelling and analysis of the harbour and search efforts," Boyd said.</p>
        
            <p>"The search involved up to 14 vessels and a rescue helicopter at its peak."</p>

            <p>Boyd said police will continue to update the man's family as the search for him progresses and are providing them with support.</p>
