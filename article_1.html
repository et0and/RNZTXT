            <p>Three households have self-evacuated and farm buildings have been destroyed as firefighters battle multiple wildfires in two rural areas of the Waitaki District.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the fires, which were reported shortly after midnight, were now contained.</p>
        
            <p>In the Nenthorn area, about 30km from Middlemarch, Fire and Emergency incident controller Bobby Lamont said crews had been working on three separate fires, burning in windy conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont told Morning Report that they had 12 appliances and about 35 firefighters working on putting out the blaze overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just switched them out for some fresh crews. We've got five appliances and three tankers, supported by three helicopters at the moment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The fires has burned through 78 hectares of farmland.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said the crews overnight did an amazing job to protect houses in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"One came very, very close to being extremely damaged so they've done a really, really good job."</p>
        
            <p>While no homes were lost, Fire and Emergency said a small number of farm buildings were destroyed or damaged at Nenthorn</p>
        
            <p>Work to consolidate the fire perimeters and extinguish hotspots was under way.</p>
        
            <p>It said residents who self-evacuated from the Nenthorn fire on Sunday night were not yet able to return as crews were still working near their homes.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would be examining the area where one of the fires started to establish the cause.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said that two other fires were started by embers blown by the wind from the original blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Nenthorn, Ramrock and Butter and Egg roads were all closed.</p>
        
            <p>Another fire burning in the Earthquakes area about 7km from Duntroon has burned through about 30 hectares of conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>The Incident Controller at that fire, Jason Sarich, said firefighters had worked very hard in challenging conditions to contain the fire, with galeforce winds on the fireground overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Another 30 firefighters and two helicopters were working on the fire Monday morning .</p>
        
            <p>They would be joined by two crews of firefighters from the Department of Conservation today. Fire and Emergency's command unit from Timaru was also at the scene.</p>
