        <h2>Live: Forest lodge destroyed by out of control blaze</h2>
        <p>
Convoys are being escorted across a reopened SH73 in Canterbury, as crews continue to try to contain a fire from the air and ground.
</p>
        
            <p>An out of control fire in Canterbury has doubled in size to nearly 980 hectares as crews battle to contain it.</p>
        
            <p>One building, the Holloway Lodge - a former Forest Service hut near the peak of Bridge Hill - has been destroyed by the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze is still not contained, Incident Commander Brian Keown says.</p>
        
            <p>SH73 was closed overnight, but reopened at midday with stop-go signs in place and motorists requiring an escort to pass through.</p>
