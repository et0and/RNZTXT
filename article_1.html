            <p>Te Matatini officially got underway in New Plymouth on Monday with an emotional pōwhiri from the Taranaki hau kāinga, welcoming the more than 50 haka groups and kuini Nga wai hono i te po.</p>
        
            <p>The biennial national kapa haka competition is being held at the Bowl of Brooklands in New Plymouth from Tuesday to through to Saturday, 1 March with a record 55 teams competing.</p>
        
            <p>The welcome highlighted the history of the local iwi and showcased their special connection to the poi - the poi and drum replicating the sound of the peoples heart beats.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kāhui Maunga Society chair Elijah Pue told RNZ  the people of Taranaki were excited for the festival to get underway.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pō'hiri day [and] the people are coming... there is no time to be nervous, no time to worry about anything. Right now is the time for us to be excited to welcome the motu, the Queen and Te Matatini into Taranaki," Pue said.</p>
        
            <p>He said this year's festival was called 'Te Kāhui Maunga, He Kāhui Tipua, He Kāhui Wairua', which was put on display by the unique poi performance done by the wāhine of Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of people say 'what is the job of Te Kāhui Maunga? Elijah, what is your job?' Our job, first and foremost, is to look after the people. We are looking after the motu, the Queen [and] the mauri of Te Matatini."</p>
        
            <p>It has been a sad start to the year for the Taranaki rohe with the death of Former MP Tariana Turia and more recently Parihaka matraich Maata Wharehoka.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a difficult year for Te Ao Māori, in terms of the loss that we have experiences [but] right now its so great that we are all together, we're all celebrating and having fun," Pue said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes there has been some loss, yes its been a pretty rough to the year but boy are we grateful to have Te Matatini here at Te Kāhui Maunga."</p>
        
            <p>The hau kainga have been practising their poi and rehearsing the pōwhiri since March 2024. Local kuia Kura Niwa said the process had generations of whānau come together over the last year, who today, got to pour their hearts out to manuhiri.</p>
        
            <p>"The movement is so empowering for our people in Taranaki so for me, it means a lot because for myself here [at the stadium], I've got four generations standing here in this poi [pōw'iri] group."</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Taranaki Maunga was given back to ngā iwi o Taranaki - the eight iwi of Taranaki, in which Niwa said it was the start of the healing journey for the people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a stepping stone for us, Taranaki, and we can move forward on behalf of the generations that have gone before us."</p>
        
            <p>"To have our taonga given back to the people, it's been a celebration for Taranaki."</p>
        
            <p>During the powhiri, trophies were returned which leaves new and returning rōpū a chance to put their best foot forward over the next five days.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of Te Kapa Haka o Ngāti Whakaue, Te Ngawari Wright - who took out the title of best female leader two years ago - said she is excited to see te ao Māori come together this week.</p>
        
            <p>"Ko tetahi o ngā kaupapa nui ki au mo te wiki nei ko te kotahitanga o ngā kapa, o te iwi Māori i runga i ngā āhuatanga kua pā mai ki a tātau i ēnei marama tata nei."</p>
        
            <p>"One of the big things for me about this week is seeing all the groups and all Māori come together especially given everything that has happened to us over the last several months."</p>

            <p>Wright said her rōpū are feeling calm but excited for the challenge of the week ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Te Matatini Life Member Trevor Maxwell is looking forward to seeing the groups bring their A game, and after months of practice the pressure is on.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling excited. Here's my mokopuna... they come all the way down from Rotorua, but that's what I'm saying even for the little ones. Shucks, I can remember back to the first [festival] in 1972."</p>
        
            <p>The first haka groups perform tomorrow morning at Pukekura the Bowl of Brooklands.</p>
        
            <p>Te Matatini o Te Kāhui Maunga will be broadcasted live on TVNZ 2, TVNZ+, Whakaata Māori, and online on Māori+. It will also be translated into six different languages via Te Matatini app and selected channels.</p>
