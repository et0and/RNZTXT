            <p>Something must be in the water, as Wellingtonians have been treated to a large pod of dolphins and multiple orca sightings in the past two days.</p>
        
            <p>The pod of dolphins was seen whipping up a storm around many of Wellington's bays yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A pod, likely the same one, was also seen today.</p>

            <p>One poster in Whale and Dolphin Watch yesterday described "A sea full of dolphins sussing the East-West ferry out."</p>
        
            <p>"Insane. Must be hundreds of them," said another.</p>

            <p>Orca sightings were also reported in the group across Wellington, including Island Bay, Princess Bay and Pariwhero/Red Rocks.</p>
        
            <p>"Unreal encounter with a pod of orca in Island Bay today," one poster said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never seen them this close to the shore before."</p>
