        <h2>Watch: Parliament's first Question Time and Gaza ceasefire motion</h2>
        <p>
The new Parliament's first Question Time today is coming after a motion from the Foreign Minister calling for urgent steps towards a ceasefire in Gaza.
</p>
        
            <p>Having been formally opened earlier in the week, Parliament is gradually shifting back to its usual processes.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday this week, that includes this new Parliament's first Question Time, and a motion from Foreign Minister Winston Peters urging those involved in the Gaza conflict to take urgent steps towards a ceasefire.</p>
        
            <p>Peters had made a statement saying New Zealand was calling for the move last Friday. The motion on Thursday will bring that official position to Parliament and allow other political parties to respond.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins had last month made a stronger call for an "immediate ceasefire" in the conflict while the coalition was still in negotiations to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>National accused Hipkins then of "playing politics" over the matter, saying while the party supported a ceasefire the conditions for one "have not existed so far".</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party, meanwhile, accused both of playing politics and urged an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, in line with what other countries, the UN Secretary General and the Red Cross had called for.</p>
