            <p>After a whirlwind month in American politics, new Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is set to formally reintroduce herself in a highly anticipated speech on the final day of the convention in Chicago.</p>
        
            <p>US Vice President Harris, 59, is the first Black woman and South Asian woman to ever be a party's presidential nominee.</p>
        
            <p>After a busy week in Chicago where several former presidents and current President Biden endorsed her, her speech tonight will be a key test of her campaign.</p>
        
            <p>In her speech Reuters says Harris plans to tell the story of who she is - the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother - and of her plans to help the middle class with cuts in prices on groceries and housing and in taxes and to advance personal freedoms including abortion rights, aides and advisers said.</p>
        
            <p>The convention kicks off at 11am NZT (6pm Chicago time), but Harris is not expected to speak until sometime in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Just a few months ago, such a scene would have been unthinkable, but after Biden had a dismal debate performance in late June he ended up withdrawing as a candidate last month, and Democrats quickly lined up to endorse Harris.</p>
        
            <p>She will face former president, Republican Donald Trump, in the 5 November election in a match quite unlike any in recent American history.</p>
