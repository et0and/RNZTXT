            <p>The Green Party is responding to the findings of an independent investigation into Green MP Darleen Tana.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was suspended by her party leadership on 14 March following accusations about her husband's business.</p>
        
            <p>Independent investigator and barrister Rachel Burt has been carrying out the inquiry. By May, the probe had cost $43,000, from the the Green Party leaders' office budget.</p>
        
            <p>Separately, the Electoral Commission has referred Tana and a publisher to police over an alleged failure to include a promoter statement in an election ad.</p>
