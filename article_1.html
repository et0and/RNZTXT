            <p>About one in eight Kiwi adults would rather go online and look at houses they cannot afford than have sex, a new survey has found.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me Property said more than a third would rather browse unaffordable property listings than watch rugby and more than half preferred it to looking for a partner on a dating site.</p>
        
            <p>With New Zealand having some of the least affordable housing in the developed world and [https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/07/22/home-ownership-rates-fall-below-60-report/ fewer people living in their own houses in almost a century, Trade Me's survey found more than half - 59 percent - of adults admitted scrolling through listings of homes they cannot afford.</p>
        
            <p>But rather than consider it an extension "doom-scrolling", voted New Zealand's 'word of the year' in 2020, Trade Me - which makes up to $2299 per sale conducted through its site - prefers to call it "dream-scrolling".</p>
        
            <p>"We've coined the term 'dream-scrolling', which perfectly captures the 'what-if' mentality," Trade Me Property customer director Gavin Lloyd said in a statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"What if I won the Lotto? What if I could leave everything behind and move to the middle of nowhere? It's a way to momentarily escape reality and indulge in the fun of imagining what our lives could look like if we owned those dream properties."</p>
        
            <p>He said the survey found almost all of us - 95 percent - would like to own our own home, a fifth of us spending at least an hour each week looking around.</p>
        
            <p>"Owning a home is still the big Kiwi dream for most people, even with the economic challenges we've faced in recent years," Lloyd said.</p>
        
            <p>"Home ownership is still central to many New Zealanders' long-term financial security, with purchasing a property one of the biggest financial decisions many of us will make in our lives.</p>
        
            <p>"A mortgage-free home also makes up an important part of many people's retirement plans. We're a country that's clearly obsessed with property. It's also pretty telling that 80 percent of people still regularly check out houses online, even when they're not seriously looking to buy."</p>
        
            <p>Rather than see that as desperation in a market whose median price has doubled in the past decade, and doubled in the decade before that, Lloyd said Kiwis kept browsing dream homes "for more emotional reasons like finding a bit of inspiration, giving us something to aim for or even simply for pleasure".</p>
        
            <p>"About a fifth of respondents admitted to adding homes to their watchlist, even though they didn't consider these properties were realistic options."</p>
        
            <p>There was a difference in the kinds of places different demographics looked at, Lloyd said.</p>
        
            <p>"Younger Kiwi are all about lifestyle blocks and city apartments, while those over 35 are still dreaming of beach houses."</p>
        
            <p>Women were more interested in lifestyle blocks than men, who were more into beach houses and city apartments.</p>
        
            <p>A recent report found in 25 years, there will be fewer homeowners than renters in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The survey, carried out by external research agency Perspective, interviewed 1074 New Zealanders.</p>
