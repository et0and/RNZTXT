            <p>A defence lawyer in the Angela Blackmoore murder trial has told jurors the Crown's key witness is a liar whose evidence cannot be trusted.</p>
        
            <p>Closing arguments finished earlier on Tuesday in the second trial of David Hawken and Rebecca Wright-Meldrum for the murder of the Christchurch woman back in 1995.</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Powell pleaded guilty to the murder in 2020 and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole period of 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>A pregnant Blackmoore was bludgeoned and stabbed 39 times in her Wainoni home while her two-year-old son slept in a nearby room.</p>
        
            <p>The first trial was abandoned in May after new material came to hand that lawyers needed time to review.</p>
        
            <p>Powell was previously called as a Crown witness, and told the court Hawken offered him and Wright-Meldrum $10,000 for Blackmoore's murder.</p>
        
            <p>He also said Hawken threatened to kill his family if he did not murder Blackmoore.</p>
        
            <p>Wright-Meldrum's defence counsel, Philip Shamy, took aim at Powell during his closing remarks, casting doubt over the integrity of the Crown's star witness.</p>
        
            <p>"He's tried very hard to sell himself, again he turned himself into a victim.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of whether he's a psychopath… I don't know.... but what I suggest, in what he's demonstrated to you, is that he's a liar, he's a murderer and, to use an old word, he's a pervert. He's a very odd man."</p>

            <p>The defence called out Crown arguments around the presence of extreme pornography on Powell's devices, which Shamy believed were tempered by the fact he deleted the objectionable files.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never heard the Crown defend someone who has that on their computer in close to 40 years of practice… I've never heard that."</p>
        
            <p>Shamy also argued that prosecutors chose to overlook forensic evidence of the crime scene where he argued there were holes in their case.</p>
        
            <p>He concluded with assertions there was insufficient evidence to convict Wright-Meldrum of murder.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Rachel Dunningham will sum up the evidence from Wednesday morning. The 12 jurors will then retire to deliberate on a verdict.</p>
