            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand has temporarily suspended all Australian tomato imports, to be reviewed in seven days, after the detection of tomato brown rugose fruit virus.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries had previously paused some Australian exports but was still allowing tomatoes in from Queensland, where the virus is not present, and was testing seeds which can also contain the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV) which effects affects tomatoes, capsicums, and chillies, has been found in two properties in South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The virus causes spotting, discolouration and deformities, impacting the fruits market value - it has no impact on human health.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand said it was being especially cautious.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's imported tomatoes come from Queensland where there has been no sign of the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity spokesman Stuart Anderson said Australian authorities are trying to trace the virus and until that work is completed, no tomatoes from across the Tasman will be imported.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was nothing to suggest the virus had reached New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But Tomatoes NZ chairperson Barry O'Neil told RNZ greenhouse tomato growers were really concerned about the discovery.</p>
        
            <p>"If ToBRFV was to get to New Zealand, it could have dire consequences for our greenhouse tomato and capsicum industry because the virus spreads extremely easily and has such a major impact on production, with reported crop losses of up to 80 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The best line of defense is to keep the virus out of New Zealand. We are in discussions with government officials and the industry about how to achieve this."</p>
        
            <p>O'Neil said the second-best defense was for growers to follow strict hygiene measures to try and stop ToBRFV from entering a particular property, if it did arrive in the country.</p>
