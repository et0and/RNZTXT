            <p>New South Wales residents have been told to prepare for a "pretty nasty set of weather" heading for a large part of the state this week as Tropical Cyclone Alfred hovers off the Queensland coast.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclone Alfred is about 410 kilometres north-east of Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast as of Monday morning, according to Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).</p>
        
            <p>It is expected to be upgraded to a category two system on Monday night and is likely to maintain that intensity as it approaches the coast.</p>
        
            <p>Manager of hazard preparedness Steven Bernasconi acknowledged that a cyclone being within reach of NSW was "unusual".</p>
        
            <p>"We don't often have tropical cyclone watches and warnings in the New South Wales jurisdiction," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In 1990 Tropical Cyclone Nancy brushed NSW and in 1974 Tropical Cyclone Zoe made landfall in the state.</p>
        
            <p>"For New South Wales, we'll be seeing a tropical cyclone watch issued sometime today and that means that we'll be within 24 to 48 hours of experiencing gale force winds," Bernasconi said.</p>
        
            <p>Marine hazard warnings for strong winds and powerful swells and waves are already in place from Byron Bay to the Coffs Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The cyclone was moving at about 12 kilometres per hour in a south-easterly direction, Bernasconi said on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"It will continue to move away from the Queensland coast today in that south-easterly direction, and then it's expected to slow down and turn to the west sometime on Tuesday."</p>
        
            <p>As it turns towards the west, there will be "greater confidence in its direction" as it moves towards the coast, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Northern Rivers region, from Coffs Harbour to Lismore and up to the Queensland border, are expected to be most affected in the state, however wider NSW has also been encouraged to prepare and be vigilant.</p>
        
            <p>A flood watch is in place for all coastal catchments from Tweed down to Camden Haven for moderate to major flooding, as of Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>However, the rest of the state, including metro areas, will experience rain and wind later in the week.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, noticeable winds and waves in the "damaging range" will pick up towards Lord Howe Island before the potential impact to the mainland on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Winds will start to be noticeable and will become more damaging, waves are likely to be damaging as well," Bernasconi said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tides again will be abnormally high and Wednesday is when we should start to see our rainfall increasing into the evening, with potential for locally intense falls moving into Thursday and Friday."</p>
        
            <p>Authorities said it is expected to make landfall on Thursday or Friday with a location to become clearer over the next couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>Bernasconi said widespread rain of 100 to 300 millimetres is possible towards the end of the week.</p>
        
            <p>"But as the tropical cyclone moves over land, the wind and swell will start to abate, and the focus will turn to widespread rain and flooding impacts."</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Scott McLennan from the NSW State Emergency Service (SES) said the cyclone's landfall would bring significant erosion issues, wind speeds of approximately 89 to 11 kph as well as gusts of up to 125 kph in the Northern Rivers.</p>
        
            <p>The area is also seeing 2 to 9 metre waves, and is expecting heavy rainfall from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are asking our residents and our visitors to also be prepared," McLennan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Take the time now to clean your gutters, clean your drains, make sure that any loose items including trampolines and pot plants are tied down.</p>
        
            <p>"Make sure that you have checked your medication supply and that you are limiting your travel from Wednesday onwards."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The NSW SES has been providing sandbags to people throughout the region ahead of the severe conditions forecasted.</p>
        
            <p>At the Ballina collection site, Ros said she was feeling "a bit apprehensive", but after experiencing the record-breaking 2022 floods, she "knows how to get prepared".</p>
        
            <p>A meeting for residents of the Northern Rivers is scheduled for Monday evening, with the SES due to provide an update on the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>Bernasconi said tropical cyclones are categorised into five categories, with five being the most extreme. Anything over a category three is considered severe.</p>
        
            <p>Winds have the potential for significant damage on land and at sea the cyclone has the "potential to really raise those swells over a long time and bring them into the coast".</p>
        
            <p>"So the coastline will really cop quite a battering from this," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities urged members of the public to stay out of potential flood areas, clean loose items from around the house and sandbag their properties.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important that all members of the public prepare for the event," NSW Minister for Emergency Services, Jihad Dib said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Northern Rivers area suffered its own major flooding and quite a difficult situation three years ago, we will do everything that we can in working with that community, in making sure that our communities are well prepared, well protected, and can respond to whatever comes our way."</p>
        
            <p>Dib asked the public to stay alert and informed through the SES and BOM websites and the Hazards Near Me application for the latest advice.</p>
        
            <p>"We need you as a community to do your bit, to be prepared, to know the circumstances, to know your individual area and what challenges there are," he said.</p>
