        <h2>AA puts fuel companies on notice ahead of fuel tax's removal</h2>
        <p>
The AA says it will be watching closely to make sure fuel companies pass on savings to customers once they are no longer collecting the Auckland regional fuel tax.

            <p>The Automobile Association says it will be watching closely to make sure fuel companies pass on savings to customers once they are no longer collecting the Auckland regional fuel tax.</p>
        
            <p>Fuel prices in the region are expected to drop by 11.5c on Monday, as the fuel tax expires.</p>
        
            <p>The government passed legislation in March to abolish the tax, which was implemented on 1 July 2018, and meant to be in place for 10 years to raise money for infrastructure in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>AA principal policy adviser Terry Collins says a report by the Commerce Commission about oil companies being slow to lower their prices was as a warning to the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"What the Commerce Commission did then was seen a shot across the bars of the oil companies with the regional fuel tax ending to say, 'Hey, we expect those prices to come down like a rocket. You know the date it's happening and we expect to see the full 11.5c reduction on all fuelsâ€¦ both petrol and diesel."</p>
        
            <p>When the report was released, commissioner Bryan Chapple said the findings "suggest that petrol prices shoot up at the pump in response to increased costs, but there is a noticeable lag in retail prices being lowered in response to decreases in underlying costs".</p>
        
            <p>As of last September, the regional fuel tax had raised about $780 million.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ chief executive Jon Duffy said the fuel tax will make a difference, but overall it was a small part of how fuel prices were determined.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd really encourage consumers to continue to shop around and use apps like Gaspy to try and find the best deal.</p>
        
            <p>"Just because this tax is no longer on the price of fuel doesn't mean that all the other factors that go into fuel pricing, you know, still exist."</p>
        
            <p>Duffy said Aucklanders who could hold off fuelling until Monday should do so, to save that extra 11.5c per litre.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown in February said scrapping the tax would make it harder to fund desperately needed transport infrastructure, if it was not replaced with other funding.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he acknowledged Auckland was facing huge infrastructure challenges, "but this fuel tax has actually not been used to deliver them - instead it's been delivered more cycle lanes, red light cameras, and speed humps".</p>

            <p>He promoted the tax's cancellation as helping Aucklanders with the cost of living. A few weeks after the announcement, Transport Minister Simeon Brown announced plans to hike nationwide petrol tax by 20c over the coming years, including a 12c hike in 2027, plus an increase to the price of vehicle registration.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon on Sunday said despite getting rid of the fuel tax, the governmentwas "delivering a record investment in transport, including in Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>"Nearly $4 billion has been set aside to fix and prevent potholes on the state highway and local road network over the next three years - including $478 million set aside for local road pothole prevention in Auckland, a 74 per cent increase over the previous three-year period.</p>
        
            <p>"And funding for public transport services nationally is also set to rise by 41 per cent compared to the previous three years."</p>
        
            <p>The AA's Collins said in the coming weeks, savings from the fuel tax may disappear as oil prices recover.</p>
