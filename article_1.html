            <p>Dozens of jobs are on the line at the Department of Internal Affairs, as it continues cost-cutting measures that began last year.</p>
        
            <p>The department on Tuesday proposed getting rid of 180 positions and creating 116 new ones, reducing its headcount by 64.</p>
        
            <p>Separately, 69 fixed term contracts which were due to end in September would not be renewed. A DIA spokesperson said that was always going to happen, and it was not because of the restructure.</p>
        
            <p>Internal affairs secretary Paul James said the department had been in the process of change for some time in an effort to improve efficiency and cut costs while delivering for communities and ministers.</p>
        
            <p>"To do this, we must organise our work in a way that reduces management layers and minimises duplication of work in different areas of the organisation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would add some comfort for staff that I am not expecting further change of this nature and scale once this second phase has been completed."</p>
        
            <p>It would consult with staff until 15 April, and make final decisions in early June.</p>
        
            <p>Last year hundreds of jobs were slashed at the department following the government's cost-saving targets, and big projects like water reform winding up.</p>
        
            <p>At the beginning of 2024, Finance Minister Nicola Willis outlined a plan to reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion, asking all government departments to identify savings.</p>
        
            <p>It came amid tough economic times, and followed a 34 percent rise in the number of public servants under the former Labour government, between 2017 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 40 organisations were given a specific target. Internal Affairs was asked to save 6.5 percent of its budget.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association would be opposing the latest cuts, said national secretary Fleur Fitzsimons.</p>
        
            <p>"Internal Affairs purpose is to serve and connect 'people, communities and government to build a safe, prosperous and respected nation'," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These cuts coming on top of the damaging cuts from last year will make achieving that purpose all the more difficult."</p>
        
            <p>The department has a varied remit, including issuing passports, registering births, deaths and marriages, ensuring gambling is legal, promoting internet safety, guarding against money laundering and providing IT services to the government.</p>
        
            <p>Restructuring last year saw the loss of key staff keeping children safe from online harm, and those stopping scams and international crime syndicates engaging in money laundering, said the PSA.</p>
