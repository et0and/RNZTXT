            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-founder and former government minister Dame Tariana Turia has suffered a stroke, her iwi says.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, Te Ranga Tupua said she had a stroke earlier this week and was surrounded by the love and support of her whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"She is still with us, but unfortunately hasn't been given much time with us all."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana joined parliament in 1996 as a Labour Party list MP before leaving the party in 2004 over the foreshore and seabed controversy.</p>
        
            <p>She resigned from Parliament and stood again in the Te Tai Hauāuru by-election for the newly formed Te Pāti Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori Party supported the National Party as a minority government in 2008, and Dame Tariana returned to roles as a minister outside of Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>She retired from parliament in 2014 and became a dame for services as a member of parliament in 2015.</p>
