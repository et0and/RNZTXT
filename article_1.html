            <p>Sir Rodger Fox - who has been synonymous with big band jazz in New Zealand - has died aged 71.</p>
        
            <p>The jazz legend founded the Rodger Fox Big Band in 1973 and toured extensively here and overseas, playing at international jazz festivals including Montreaux, Monterey and New Orleans.</p>
        
            <p>He also taught at the New Zealand School of Music in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The trombonist was knighted in 2022 for his services to music.</p>
        
            <p>Fox was only 18 when he began playing with a dance band in the Wellington / Porirua area.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ in 2022 that two of the biggest highlights were playing at Europe's legendary Montreaux Jazz Festival in 1980 - the first-ever NZ band invited to play at an international jazz festival - and hosting American jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker's visit to New Zealand to celebrate the Rodger Fox Big Band's 30th anniversary.</p>
