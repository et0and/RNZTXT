            <p>A Te Whatu Ora employee accused of stealing Covid 19 data and using it to spread misinformation about vaccine-related deaths has appeared in court.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Young, 56, is charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years' prison.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora has alleged Young leaked the data, which was published on an overseas website.</p>
        
            <p>Young appeared briefly in Wellington District Court on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>His case was put back to the afternoon after police indicated they would be opposing his release on bail, because of the risk he could continue to spread misinformation.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Matthew Hague has told the court the police had no evidence Young presented any risk.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Andrew Nicholls said he would consider the application once it was made, and make a decision on Monday afternoon.</p>
