        <h2>Swarbrick pleads for cross-party support for Israel sanctions</h2>
        <p>
The Greens co-leader says just six government MPs could get her member's bill imposing sanctions into Parliament, skipping the biscuit tin.

            <p>Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick says the need for New Zealand to impose sanctions against Israel has only grown more urgent after airstrikes on Gaza resumed, killing more than 400 people.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick lodged a member's bill in December and says with all opposition parties backing it, the support of just six backbench government MPs would mean it could skip the biscuit tin and be brought to Parliament for a first reading.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel as though every other day there is something else which adds urgency, but yes - I think as a result of the most recent round of atrocities and particularly the public focus, attention, energy and effort that is being that has been put on them, that, yes, parliamentarians desperately need to act.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick claimed there were government MPs who were keen to support her bill, saying it was why her party was publicly pushing the numbers needed to get it across the line.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the most whipped parliament in the Western world," she said. "We would hope that parliamentarians would live up to all of those statements that they make about their values and principles when they do their bright-eyed and bushy-tailed maiden speeches.</p>
        
            <p>"The time is now, people cannot hide behind party lines anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"I know for a fact that there are government MPs that are keen to support this kaupapa."</p>
        
            <p>Standing Order 288 allows MPs who are not ministers or undersecretaries to indicate their support for a member's bill.</p>
        
            <p>If at least 61 MPs get behind it, the legislation skips the "biscuit tin" ballot.</p>
        
            <p>If answered, Swarbrick's call would be the first time this process is followed.</p>
        
            <p>Labour confirmed its support for the bill last week.</p>
        
            <p>A coalition spokesperson said the government's policy position on the matter remained unchanged, including in response to Swarbrick's bill.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has consistently advocated for a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick pointed to New Zealand's support - alongside 123 other countries - of a UN resolution calling for sanctions against those responsible for Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories, including in relation to settler violence.</p>
        
            <p>The government's support for the resolution was conditional and included several caveats - including that the 12-month timeframe for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories was "unrealistic", and noted the resolution went beyond what was initially proposed.</p>
        
            <p>None of the other 123 countries which supported the resolution have yet brought sanctions against Israel.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, in the several months following that resolution in September of last year, our government has done nothing to fulfil that commitment," Swarbrick said.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' permanent representative to the UN Carolyn Schwalger in September noted the Resolution imposed no obligations on New Zealand beyond what already existed under international law, but "New Zealand stands ready to implement any measures adopted by the UN Security Council".</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in December said the government had a long-standing position of travel bans on extremist Israeli settlers in the occupied territories, and wants to see a two-state solution developed.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said its military pressure against Hamas was to secure the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack, and "this is just the beginning".</p>
        
            <p>Israel continues to deny accusations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. South Africa has taken a case of genocide against Israel to the International Court of Justice, the case remains ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>The attack in 2023 left about 1200 people dead, with more than 250 hostages taken, and reports of widespread rapes.</p>
        
            <p>UN Secretary General António Guterres in a tweet said he was outraged by the Israeli airstrikes.</p>
        
            <p>"I strongly appeal for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be re-established and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally," he said.</p>
