            <p>A woman is facing charges after firefighters rescued two pre-school-aged children from a smoke-logged house in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours called emergency services to the Eureka Street property in Aranui, where a smoke alarm was going off at 10pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>They found the children alone in the house and rescued them before a fire started.</p>
        
            <p>The children were not hurt.</p>
        
            <p>A 35-year-old woman is facing two charges of ill-treatment of a child, as well as a charge of resisting police and possession of a cannabis plant.</p>
        
            <p>She is due to reappear in court later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked the neighbours who called for help, saying they prevented a tragedy.</p>
