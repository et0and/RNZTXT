            <p>The Warriors fought back from 14 points down in a heartbreaking NRL golden point thriller against the Dolphins in Brisbane, to ultimately lose 34-32.</p>
        
            <p>With the scores tied at 32-all at Suncorp Stadium when the hooter sounded, both sides missed desperate field goal attempts in a hectic final three minutes of regulation time.</p>
        
            <p>The Dophins had the finishing touch when it mattered as hero playmaker Sean O'Sullivan booted the winning drop goal from 42 metres out and a fair way off-centre, to sink the Warriors' hearts in golden point.</p>
        
            <p>While the Dolphins had the run of play in the first half to lead 20-6 at halftime, it was the Warriors who came alive in the second.</p>
        
            <p>After a rocky finish to the first half when Dylan Walker was sent off on the stroke of halftime for a high shot on Mark Nicholls, it was a more determined Auckland side that fronted in the second.</p>
        
            <p>Second half tries to Kurt Capewell, Ali Leiataua, Te Maire Martin and a first NRL try to Demitric Sifakula set the game alive.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides had difficulty completing a set in the frantic last 10 minutes, however with five minutes to go a grubber kick saw Mitch Barnett in line to score.</p>
        
            <p>He was unable to get the ball down, but the replay showed Kodi Nikorima grabbing his jersey and pulling him back.</p>
        
            <p>With the penalty try awarded and the conversion safely over, the match was set for a crazy finish at 32-all with three minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors gave it everything in the second half but couldn't close out the game through their two drop goal attempts.</p>
        
            <p>They scored six tries to the Dolphins' five, but missed conversions from Chanel Harris-Tavita saw them back on points.</p>
        
            <p>The Dolphins are back in the top eight as Wayne Bennett's men chase a finals spot for the first time in the history of the club.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors languish in fourteenth on the ladder.</p>
