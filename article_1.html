            <p>A ram was in the paddock where two people were found dead at a rural property in West Auckland on Thursday morning, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>A man and woman were found dead in a paddock at the Anzac Valley Road address in Waitākere before 7.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Police are continuing to investigate the deaths on behalf of the Coroner to understand the circumstances around what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a family spokesperson for the pair, Dean Burrell, said the deaths involved an animal kept on their property.</p>
        
            <p>The ram confronted police when they arrived at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Another person at the scene also suffered a minor injury after being attacked by the ram.</p>
        
            <p>"On undertaking a risk assessment, the ram was shot and died at the scene," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said the pair, who were found dead, were in their 80s and lived alone.</p>
        
            <p>The family had not heard from the pair in a couple of days and they were found by their son, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My auntie and her husband live at this property, they've lived here for about eight years. Unfortunately they've both lost their lives through a tragic accident.</p>
        
            <p>"They're nice people, they don't deserve what happened. I guess it is what it is.</p>
        
            <p>"The family are requesting privacy, please, and everyone's in shock as to what's happened. They're very upset."</p>
        
            <p>Post mortems were due to be carried out on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination has been completed.</p>
