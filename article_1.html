            <p>Two Auckland rail workers are in hospital after being injured by powerlines in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Trains throughout the city have been delayed and the Britomart station has been closed.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said a maintenance vehicle came into contact with overhead powerlines between Newmarket and Britomart at about 1.40am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>St John said one of the workers was in critical condition and the other was seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>Britomart train station is closed and the Onehunga line is suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Most trains are running at a reduced 20-minute frequency and are stopping at Newmarket. Buses are then taking passengers between Newmarket and Britomart.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said power had been isolated in a section of the rail network for inspections on the overhead power systems to take place as part of routine maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>The maintenance vehicle was still on the line, preventing power being restored between Newmarket and Britomart, including Britomart station.</p>
