        <h2>Is there such thing as healthy drinking?</h2>
        <p>
Let's not water this down. For many, alcohol and the good life just don't mix. But for those who just want to cut back, the question is: when does a tipple become a tipping point?
</p>
        
            <p>Is it time to listen to the research on drinking? It might be a tough topic to swallow when summer's finally starting to hum and the gin and tonic is singing to you.</p>
        
            <p>But like it or not, research continues to reveal that while a drink or two may feel harmless - or even beneficial - there are good reasons to rethink how much and how often we drink.</p>
        
            <p>According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2022 guidelines, there is no safe level of alcohol consumption. Ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. This means it conclusively causes cancer in humans, and the more alcohol we drink, the higher the risk.</p>
        
            <p>A factsheet released by the Royal Society Te ApƒÅrangi, titled Alcohol Causes Cancer, puts it like this:</p>
        
            <p>Drinks Per Week:</p>
        
            <p>0: No cancer risk (from booze, obviously)</p>
        
            <p>1-3: Risk of breast cancer and bowel cancer increases slightly.</p>
        
            <p>4-8: Risk of cancer increases, including breast, colon, mouth, throat and liver cancers</p>
        
            <p>9 or more: Risk of cancer, heart disease and stroke radically increases.</p>
        
            <p>The paper defines "a drink" as one 330ml bottle of 4 percent strength beer; one 100ml glass of wine; or 1 shot glass of spirits.</p>
        
            <p>It also alarmingly reports that more than 4 out of 5 New Zealanders "don't know that drinking alcohol cause cancer".</p>
        
            <p>Yet, despite this knowledge gap, many Kiwis - particularly younger generations - are drinking less.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Andy Towers, an addiction and mental health specialist at Massey University, points out that youth drinking rates in New Zealand have declined over the past few decades.</p>
        
            <p>"Youth aged 25 and under are drinking less, and many simply don't want to drink," says Towers. "This is partly due to 30 years of public health campaigns discouraging excessive drinking and drink-driving. This generation has grown up with these messages as a constant backdrop."</p>

            <p>He adds that many younger people are also influenced by their parents' experiences. "They are the children of a generation that drank a lot. Parents are more cautious now and don't necessarily encourage drinking."</p>
        
            <p>This shift also aligns with broader lifestyle trends.</p>
        
            <p>"Young people are more health-conscious than previous generations," Towers explains. "Social media plays a role too. Their public-facing profiles mean they're investing more in health and less in substance use."</p>
        
            <p>Social dynamics have also evolved. "Drinking has traditionally been a social lubricant for older generations. Today's youth socialise differently, often online, where alcohol plays a smaller role."</p>
        
            <p>While younger New Zealanders are cutting back, those aged 40-65 remain a concern. Towers notes that this cohort has always preferred alcohol as their "drug of choice".</p>
        
            <p>"Many in this age group are drinking at levels comparable to what they consumed in their 20s, and we classify them as hazardous drinkers," he says. Public health professionals are particularly worried about this group's high consumption levels.</p>
        
            <p>However, there's a silver lining. Many in this age group are also leading conversations about quitting alcohol, often sharing their personal journeys with addiction or heavy drinking. Towers cites figures like Lotta Dann, Hayley Holt, and Guyon Espiner as examples of people who've captured public attention. "Their stories resonate because they aren't kids. They're respected professionals, and their experiences carry weight."</p>
        
            <p>For those not ready to give up alcohol entirely - or have no intention of doing so - intermittent sobriety is becoming a popular alternative. It's basically the latest way of saying "I should probably stop drinking every day." Cutting out alcohol during the week or partaking in "dry" months can be beneficial, according to Towers.</p>
        
            <p>"At a minimum, any time off alcohol is good for you," he says. "We forget that ethanol is a literal poison, and consuming it over time causes a range of harmful effects, from blackouts and injuries to long-term risks like cancer, heart disease, and cognitive decline."</p>
        
            <p>However, intermittent sobriety isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Towers explains that light drinkers are best positioned to adopt this approach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good self-test to see how well you can cope without alcohol. Many people use alcohol to reduce stress or cope with other issues, so taking a break can help identify whether it's become a crutch."</p>
        
            <p>Heavy drinkers may find intermittent sobriety more challenging. "Those who drink most days of the week may have started developing a psychological or physical dependence," Towers warns. He says the heaviest drinkers should avoid abrupt breaks without medical supervision, as withdrawal can be dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>GP Sue Crengle, who co-authored the Royal Society Report on the cancer risks of alcohol, echoes these concerns. "The recommendations around safer drinking in New Zealand include having at least two alcohol-free days per week," she says. "Dry months or cutting out alcohol during the week can be beneficial, but it's important to consider whether you're binge drinking at other times."</p>
        
            <p>For those looking to embrace intermittent sobriety, Towers offers some practical strategies:</p>
        
            <p>But if those options have you instantly reaching for the nearest cold one, there are, of course, other alternatives out there ...</p>
        
            <p>Changing drinking habits are affecting New Zealand's hospitality industry, but not as dramatically as other factors, says Jos Ruffell, co-founder of Garage Project.</p>
        
            <p>"Excise tax increases over the last three years have significantly impacted independent breweries more than changing drinking habits," Ruffell explains. "But people's drinking habits are evolving. Over the past decade, we've seen a shift toward more flavourful and interesting beers, and now there's growth in non-alcoholic options."</p>
        
            <p>Non-alcoholic beers, in particular, are experiencing a surge. "They're growing at a much faster rate than the wider beer market," says Ruffell. "For many people, the taste and flavour of the best non-alc beers have been a game changer."</p>
        
            <p>Brewing high-quality non-alcoholic beer isn't easy, though. Ruffell shares that Garage Project spent over a year on research and development before releasing its non-alcoholic beer, Tiny. "The secret is that they're real beers. We use the same ingredients-great malt and hops-but specific yeasts that don't produce alcohol. It's a careful process that preserves the flavour and aroma."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's relationship with alcohol is evolving. Whether it's the younger generation's move toward sobriety or older drinkers rethinking their habits, there's never been a better time to jump on the wagon - even if it's only to trundle along to the next special occasion.</p>
        
            <p>Just make sure to step off gracefully instead of faceplanting onto the footpath.</p>
        
            <p>"The goal is to support people who want to use any drug, including alcohol, in a way that reduces harm," says Towers. "It's about knowing how much is enough and making informed decisions about when to stop."</p>
