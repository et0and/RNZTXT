        <h2>'Bitterly disappointed': Mother of slain police officer on coroner's decision</h2>
        <p>
Diane Hunt says her son was killed because of his police uniform - and she doesn't think the organisation is any better equipped to stop similar deaths. Audio

            <p>The mother of an unarmed police officer killed on the job is bitterly disappointed an inquiry into his death will not go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Coroner Janet Anderson ruled out an inquest into the fatal shooting of Constable Matthew Hunt by Eli Epiha in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Anderson said it was not necessary because any recommendations she could make to prevent similar deaths have already been addressed by police.</p>
        
            <p>But Diane Hunt said she did not think police were any better equipped now than they were when her son was killed.</p>
        
            <p>"Matthew is dead because of his police uniform and with that in mind, I believe an inquest should have taken place to gain transparency."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt told Morning Report the new frontline training improvement programme, mentioned in the coroner's report, focused on negotiation skills and would not have made a difference.</p>

            <p>"We've heard from Constable David Goldfinch [Constable Hunt's partner] on that day that he tried negotiating with the killer but the killer wasn't going to listen to what he had to say.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes you wonder how this new training would have changed the outcome that day if the emphasis is on negotiating skills."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt wanted to see training include situations where police were unarmed, like her son was the day he died.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing that would have made a difference was if Matthew and David had access to their safety equipment, i.e. guns."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt said she will have to reassess what to do next in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't understand her [the coroner] reasoning for putting it out five days before Christmas. I'm kind of hurt that that's happened and I'll have to deal with that first."</p>
        
            <p>Epiha is currently serving a sentence of 27 years in prison before he can be considered for parole.</p>
