            <p>Fire brigades from around the Canterbury region say that another scrub blaze that erupted this afternoon has been contained.</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out just before 3pm on the north side of the Waimakariri River, at Swannanoa, 35 kilometres northwest of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Assistant Commander Des Irving said the fire is deep in scrub and firefighters are facing challenging conditions, but have stopped it spreading further.</p>
        
            <p>Forty firefighters and four helicopters have attended the blaze. A fire investigation has begun.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighting will continue through the night and into tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>The full extent of the fireground is still being mapped but its estimated to be burning an area roughly 12 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said some resources have been released from the fire that broke out in Amberley on Friday, which is now under control.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commander Brian Keown said with wind and heat in Canterbury are making it challenging to bring vegetation blazes under control.</p>
        
            <p>At least two homes and a church were destroyed after four scrub fires also broke out in Loburn in North Canterbury on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were dampening down hotspots today.</p>
