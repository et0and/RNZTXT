            <p>King Charles III is set to attend hospital next week for treatment for an enlarged prostate.</p>
        
            <p>Buckingham Palace said the King's condition is benign but he will undergo a "corrective procedure".</p>
        
            <p>The 75 year old's public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation, the Palace said.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement comes shortly after it was revealed the Princess of Wales is in hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood the King was keen to share his diagnosis with the public to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked.</p>
        
            <p>"In common with thousands of men each year, the King has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Benign prostate enlargement - which is non-cancerous - is common in men over 50 and is not usually a serious condition, according to the NHS website.</p>
        
            <p>Around one in three men over the age of 50 will have some symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which is a gland that sits just below the bladder.</p>
        
            <p>While it is not usually a serious threat to health, it can cause symptoms and problems, including difficulty passing urine or emptying the bladder.</p>
        
            <p>The condition does not mean the patient has an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. The NHS has published guidance on how it is treated.</p>
        
            <p>While it is unclear what corrective procedure the King will undergo, there are a few ways of managing it including surgery, lasers and even a steam treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement from Buckingham Palace was the second significant piece of health news about senior royals to emerge on Wednesday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>The Princess of Wales will spend up to two weeks in hospital recovering from abdominal surgery on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Her procedure was planned and successful, Kensington Palace said. Further details about her condition were not disclosed, but it is understood not to be cancer-related.</p>
        
            <p>Details about the health of senior royals are rarely disclosed, so it is striking for two updates about two separate figures to be released on the same day.</p>
        
            <p>Buckingham Palace does not routinely provide a commentary on health conditions and releases limited information on the occasions when it does provide public updates.</p>
