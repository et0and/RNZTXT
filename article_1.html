        <h2>Unstable land under train line could be 'catastrophic'</h2>
        <p>
Land under the Wairarapa line could have major consequences, documents released under the Official Information Act reveal.

            <p>Unstable land under the Wairarapa line could have "catastrophic" consequences for the tracks, according to documents released to RNZ under the Official Information Act</p>
        
            <p>The modelling for the land under the line - 1.4 kilometres north of the Remutaka train tunnel - shows there is a medium to high risk of a slip occurring.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said there was an area of loose fill material, or localised instability, just below the railway line on an embankment.</p>
        
            <p>If the slip did occur, KiwiRail rated the consequences as "critical / catastrophic".</p>
        
            <p>"This means that if a slip were to occur, the track could be undermined and potentially closed for a number of weeks, preventing rail services from running."</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail has completed design work to install metal piles, designed to stabilise the land, but construction has not started.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said it was commercially sensitive to say how much the work could cost, and that no contract has been let at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council Transport Committee chair Thomas Nash told RNZ that New Zealand's roading and rail network were vulnerable to slips and severe weather events.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why the most important investment we can make in transport at the moment is to make sure our existing connections on rail and road are solid."</p>
        
            <p>Nash said if specific transport links were knocked out, it had severe consequences on peoples' daily lives and the economy.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported earlier this month that KiwiRail was investigating if new overhead lines in Wellington were badly installed, and whether they caused commuter trains to grind to a halt for hours in early January.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council released a report in December that stated there was a $1 billion shortfall in funding for the capital's rail network.</p>
        
            <p>The report also identified a significant backlog of maintenance renewal programmes that KiwiRail has to deliver in the region.</p>
