            <p>Sir Ian McKellen has been taken to hospital after falling off stage during a performance of Player Kings at the NoÃ«l Coward theatre in London.</p>
        
            <p>The 85-year-old actor was in a fight scene when he lost his footing and fell. It is not clear whether he has sustained any injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The audience was evacuated from the theatre and informed that the evening show was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Player Kings is a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, and started its 12-week West End run in April.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Ian - who plays John Falstaff - was circling a battle scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy, when he fell off the front of the stage.</p>
        
            <p>As the house lights came up, the actor cried out and staff rushed to help.</p>

            <p>One member of the audience told the BBC the incident was "very shocking".</p>
        
            <p>"I really hope that he is going to be alright," Sandro Trapani said.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Ian's previous Shakespeare credits include roles as Richard II, Coriolanus, Iago, Richard III, King Lear and Macbeth. He is also set to star as</p>
        
            <p>Hamlet, in a new film adaptation directed by Sean Mathias.</p>
        
            <p>His on-screen credits include Gandalf in the in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, and Magneto in the X-Men movies, as well as roles in Beauty and the Beast, The Da Vinci Code and Mr Holmes.</p>
        
            <p>The actor also appeared in 10 episodes of the ITV soap Coronation Street as the scheming romance author Mel Hutchwright.</p>
        
            <p>Five years ago, Sir Ian was forced to cancel a King Lear showing at London's Duke of York theatre after sustaining a leg injury while running to catch a train, but ensured the audience was in for a good time, by sitting on stage and answering questions.</p>
