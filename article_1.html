        <h2>Live: Death toll from Taiwan quake rises</h2>
        <p>
People are trapped in seven of 26 collapsed buildings in the Hualien County, with rescue efforts underway after the rush-hour earthquake.
</p>
        
            <p>Deaths and injuries are growing after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan's east coast today.</p>
        
            <p>About 5.30pm, Taiwan's government said four people died in the mountainous, sparsely populated eastern county of Hualien - the epicentre of the earthquake - with more than 50 injured.</p>
        
            <p>People are reportedly trapped under buildings after Taiwan's strongest quake in 25 years.</p>
        
            <p>The quake that hit Taiwan was M7.2 but the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the quake that hit Japan magnitude to 7.7.</p>
        
            <p>Military personnel have been dispatched to help with disaster relief and schools and workplaces have suspended operations as aftershocks hit Taiwan, CNN is reporting.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says there are 137 New Zealanders registered with it in Taiwan and 428 in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>It says Kiwis in areas affected in Taiwan and Japan should follow the advice of local authorities.</p>

            <p>Japan has also issued an evacuation advisory for the coastal areas near the southern prefecture of Okinawa after the tsunami warning.</p>
        
            <p>Waves up to 3 metres were expected to reach Japan's southwestern coast around, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.</p>
        
            <p>Its epicentre was in the waters off the eastern coastline of Taiwan, according to the country's Central Weather Administration.</p>
        
            <p>A tsunami measuring 0.3 metres has already reached Yonaguni island, in southwestern Japan, NHK has reported.</p>
        
            <p>Japan was rocked by its deadliest quake in eight years on New Year's Day when a 7.6 magnitude temblor struck in Ishikawa prefecture, on the western coast. More than 230 people died in the quake that left 44,000 homes fully or partially destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about one-fifth of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.</p>
        
            <p>On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami. Those events triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.</p>
