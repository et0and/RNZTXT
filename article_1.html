            <p>One of New Zealand's oldest department stores, Smith & Caughey's, has reopened to customers two days after announcing a proposal to close in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It was announced on Wednesday the 144-year-old store would start consulting with staff about the potential closure of its retail operations on Auckland's Queen Street, Newmarket, and online.</p>
        
            <p>A cyber attack following the news saw the store remain closed an extra day.</p>
        
            <p>Smith & Caughey's chairperson Tony Caughey said over the last five years there had been a 40 percent decline in revenue in the physical stores, due to increasing competition from malls, more luxury brand stores, and roadworks in the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>The Queen Street store appeared quiet on Friday morning, with a few passerbys querying if it was open at all.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin's Marelda O'Rourke-Gallaher was heading into the store and said she always visited when in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of the last stalwarts of luxury department stores in New Zealand, it's tragic that it's going, but it's a sign of the times," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Young ones just buy online now."</p>

            <p>O'Rourke-Gallaher said when she heard the news about the closure, she knew she wanted to go and take a look.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be quite sad when it is closed - I like the variety of what they have here, there's a lot of really good labels and a wide range of different clothing sizes.</p>
        
            <p>"The staff are lovely too, and I feel for them. I can see why it's closing but it is really sad."</p>
        
            <p>It was expected more than 200 workers will be impacted if the two stores do close.</p>
        
            <p>For Keith, who did not want his last name used, going to Smith & Caughey's for his morning coffee was a daily ritual.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very sad to see all the department stores closing up shop because they can't compete in the modern environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's difficult for them, but I was still surprised to hear of the closure, they always seemed to be doing quite well and had their online sales too and are a trusted name."</p>

            <p>Another shopper, who had been keenly waiting at the doors for the 10am opening, said Smith & Caughey's had always been "her happy place".</p>
        
            <p>"It was the main reason I moved back into town and got a central apartment. So for me, hearing it's closing is quite devastating."</p>
        
            <p>She said the city had changed a lot in recent years and she could understand why the store would close but hoped things in the city would start to improve soon.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful old building too, so I really hope it's replaced with something else."</p>
