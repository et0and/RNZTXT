        <h2>'Not much room to get worse' - Mayor on AT losing powers</h2>
        <p>
Auckland's mayor is promising the shake-up of the city's transport is great news for residents - but some see risks in the change.

            <p>Auckland's mayor is promising the shake-up of the city's transport is great news for residents - but some are worried it is risky.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport will be stripped of its decision-making powers to focus on running public transport, while a new Regional Transport Committee will tackle policy and planning.</p>
        
            <p>Just hours after the announcement, Aucklanders told RNZ the transport issues they wanted to see fixed as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"The roads," said one man. "They're terrible, potholes, the surfacing is horrendous.</p>
        
            <p>"And the speed needs to go back up to pre-Labour speed-limits," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Cycle lanes, completely," one woman said.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to cycle to work quite a lot, nowadays I just don't risk it, because I used to be able to go early, got children now, have to go later, don't want to face the traffic."</p>
        
            <p>The transition meant Auckland Transport would focus on delivering bus, train and ferry services.</p>
        
            <p>
Auckland mayor Wayne Brown said at Tuesday's announcement that the existing model was broken because of a "badly designed system".

            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown did not pull any punches.</p>
        
            <p>"Delivery is one of the most important things for them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that it will only be better... there's not much room to get worse to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the move put Aucklanders in the driver's seat.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're taking away is the issues around policy, and planning, and strategy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's where many of those decisions have been frustrating Aucklanders, where they see an agency not reflecting their views."</p>
        
            <p>Matt Lowrie, director of the Greater Auckland transport advocacy website, was sceptical.</p>
        
            <p>"Often the best decision is not always the most politically popular one, and Auckland Transport hasn't always used their independence properly to make sure those decisions are made well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But, this means that a populist decision might be chosen over an evidence-based decision simply because the politicians don't want to upset people."</p>
        
            <p>Under the new model, local boards would have authority over certain transport decisions like setting speed limits and approving things like cycleways and pedestrian crossings.</p>
        
            <p>Lowrie said this may be risky.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing that quite concerns me is the local boards having much more say in outcomes on local roads," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some local boards that are very good and do look at evidence-based issues, and there are others that are quite the opposite, and so we could have quite a mixed bag of outcomes as a result."</p>
        
            <p>Devonport-Takapuna local board chair Toni van Tonder said the transition made good sense.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're going to be quite excited to be able to collaborate better and help to co-design and shape some of these projects, so that they reflect the community aspirations a bit more fulsomely."</p>
        
            <p>But there was still a way to go, as the changes to Auckland Transport required new legislation to make its way through parliament over the next 12 months.</p>
