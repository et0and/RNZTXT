            <p>A mother says her child was in 'severe pain' with a gastric illness, as Te Whatu Ora confirms case numbers are rising.</p>
        
            <p>The health agency said seven public pools in the Greater Wellington region had been linked to cryptosporidiosis, a stomach bug that can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting.</p>
        
            <p>As of 24 March, there were 39 cases of the illness, with 23 of those being people who had been to a pool or lived with someone who had.</p>
        
            <p>A Hutt City Council spokesperson said some cases in the outbreak were linked to the toddlers pool at Te Ngaengae and the Huia Hydro Pool.</p>
        
            <p>They said both pools had been treated and drained to prevent the spread of cryptosporidiosis.</p>
        
            <p>"The draining of the pools was an extra precaution because it was apparent there were many cases still in the community," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Further measures would be considered if required, but nothing was planned at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Bobbi, a mother who visited the Wellington Regional Aquatic Centre on 8 February, said her three-year-old daughter had become unwell after swimming in the pool.</p>
        
            <p>"I noticed after we visited the pool she had tummy bug symptoms, but as the week went on it was progressing."</p>
        
            <p>Bobbi took her daughter to the doctor four days later, where she was told her child had a gastro bug.</p>
        
            <p>But a week later her child was still unwell.</p>
        
            <p>"She had intense cramping and was refusing to eat anything," Bobbi said.</p>
        
            <p>"The intensity of the gastro bug was getting worse," she said. "I took her to the A&E."</p>
        
            <p>Bobbi described her daughter's symptoms as "more than just a normal bug".</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said it had been made aware last week of a couple of cases connected to its pools, but that it had remained in close contact with Te Whatu Ora about the outbreak.</p>
        
            <p>It said it "reminded parents and caregivers of affected children not to use swimming pools, hot tubs, or splash pads for at least two weeks after symptoms stop".</p>
        
            <p>Dr Jill McKenzie, medical officer of health at the National Public Health Service, said "cryptosporidiosis is a bug that is regularly detected in our communities and at times can cause outbreaks linked to institutions, or bodies of water such as public swimming pools".</p>
        
            <p>She said it particularly affected preschool children, school-aged children, their parents, and whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"There are likely to be more cases in the community because not everyone with a gastro illness is tested," she said.</p>
        
            <p>People should follow the advice of Te Whatu Ora to stop the spread of cryptosporidiosis and avoid the illness, she said.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie said the biggest health risk from cryptosporidiosis was dehydration.</p>
        
            <p>"If someone in your whānau develops crypto symptoms make sure they keep their fluids up.</p>
        
            <p>"Seek help early if you are concerned, particularly for babies and young children."</p>
        
            <p>People could also contact Healthline for advice, McKenzie said.</p>
