            <p>Cordons are in place at the Royal New Zealand Air Force base in Woodbourne, near Blenheim, after a suspicious package was found.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand Defence Force spokesperson said police were called to the base earlier on Thursday, after reports of a suspicious package.</p>
        
            <p>A cordon has been set up near the southern side of the base where some personnel have been evacuated and would remain until the incident was over, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the base remained operational, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were "responding to an incident in Woodbourne" but would not give any further details.</p>
        
            <p>The cordon has disrupted traffic to the nearby Marlborough Airport, with people needing to access the airport terminal encouraged to do so via Godfreys Rd.</p>
