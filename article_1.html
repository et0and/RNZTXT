            <p>About 50 people have been evacuated from their homes in central Wellington after a chemical leak.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were alerted to the problem around the intersection of Salamanca Road and Kelburn Parade shortly before 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>There were reports of a strong chemical smell and a misty cloud were seen earlier at a property on the road, and that property was evacuated because the occupants had trouble breathing and started coughing.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone within a roughly 200 metre perimeter were forced to leave their properties, but the cordon opened at about 10.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>The substance has not been identified, although the police had described it as a potential gas leak.</p>
        
            <p>People are being asked to avoid the area and anyone who feels unwell should phone 111 immediately.</p>
