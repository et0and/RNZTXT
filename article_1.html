            <p>Severe weather has seen multiple Queenstown flights unable to land, potentially leaving many keen runners unable to race in the annual marathon on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Due to crosswind conditions, at least four flights had to abort their landings and return to their original airports - three from Auckland, and one from Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the weather disruptions are frustrating, and appreciate the patience and understanding of our customers as our airport and customer teams rebook them to alternate flights. This includes additional recovery flights when weather permits to get our customers to their destination as quickly as possible," Air New Zealand said.</p>
        
            <p>Air NZ had added an extra 3550 seats across 22 extra flights in and out of Auckland this week due to the increased demand, but it now looks like many marathongoers will miss the event.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Marathon had been made aware of the issue, and organisers sought to ease those worried they would miss Friday's 8pm check-in to collect race bibs.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't stress! If you are able to make it in time for your race start tomorrow, we will have your bib ready for you to collect at the start line info desk," their Facebook post said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have pre-purchased a shuttle ticket, please have your purchase confirmation ready to show our team at the pick-up point. Please refer to the Event Schedule on our website and app for shuttle times for your event."</p>
        
            <p>Those affected had replied to the post, sharing their own experience of their flights being diverted or delayed, with many stranded in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"In the help desk queue at Auckland. Not a lot of info being told. Not many smiles though," a commenter wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Stuck in Christchurch. They are telling us probably no flights to Queenstown before 8am. Such a shame ... but that wind was scary," another wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"We left Auckland this afternoon and are now stuck in Christchurch as we were diverted. Unfortunately, it isn't practically possible for us to make the race," a third said.</p>
        
            <p>Others have also sought clarification on the latest they can start the race, while other runners had accepted defeat and conceded they would have to wait another year.</p>
