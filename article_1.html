            <p>Cuts in government funding, sponsorship and the cost of living crisis have led to the popular science education programme becoming unsustainable, its co-founder says.</p>
        
            <p>For eight years Nanogirl Labs brought science to young people - through live shows, education programmes and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) kits. But a tough business environment has seen it placed in liquidation, with the first liquidator's report due out today.</p>
        
            <p>Nanogirl Labs was founded by Dr Michelle Dickinson and her husband, Joe Davis. It aimed to demystify science and inspire creativity through workshops and theatre shows, both in New Zealand and overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Winding up the company is another blow for the science community - which has seen hundreds of jobs cut and the demise of funding projects like the National Science Challenges.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Dickinson told Nine to Noon that after months of hoping for some sign of new science funding, the decision had been taken this week that bookings up to Christmas would be honoured but it would be unfair to accept any for next year.</p>
        
            <p>She and her husband had not drawn any salaries for over a year to try and keep the business afloat.</p>
        
            <p>All the profits had been reinvested in the business which functioned as a social enterprise bringing science to those children and communities who might not experience it otherwise.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1 million children had taken part in various programmes over the last eight years and that was not counting those who had accessed online content.</p>
        
            <p>In the process children and their communities had been offered advice on how to be an innovator and what careers might be available within science.</p>
        
            <p>However, revenue sources had "dried up" with the biggest setback being the cut to MBIE's $1.6 million Curious Minds funding, which supported community science programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Nanogirl had also received funding from other government departments, including the Ministry of Education (for teacher training) and MFAT which had been undertaking science curriculum work in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>All had been cut by the government, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Its nationwide theatre tours had also begun to cost more at a time industry sponsorship had fallen away.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a whole sector challenge and then people don't have money in their pockets right now because the cost of living crisis means that it's really hard."</p>
        
            <p>Dickinson said those involved thought they were building a resilient business "with pockets of funding" involving different money streams but it was "a tough time".</p>

Dr Michelle Dickinson hoped the business was resilient but things have got too tough to carry on.

            <p>She said many large companies told her they could see the value in what was being offered but when they had laid off staff themselves, they couldn't be seen offering sponsorship to her business.</p>
        
            <p>"We had so much support from people, industries, philanthropists, who said we love it, but everybody has their hand out right now, there's a lot going on."</p>
        
            <p>Everyone working in the science sector was competing for the same pool of money, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The pandemic had cost Nanogirl Lab its international business and it had been forced to pivot several times in the years since.</p>
        
            <p>Dickinson said it was easy to cut science funding now but its impact on future generations needed to be considered.</p>
        
            <p>If she had a magic wand, she would not cut budgets based on the short term and she'd want to equip tamariki with the competitive skills that other international students are acquiring.</p>
        
            <p>She cited education systems in Singapore, China and India.</p>
        
            <p>"I worry that our young people are not going to have the exposure or the actual knowledge of some of the amazing future technology skills that we need."</p>
        
            <p>Dickinson said Education Minister Erica Stanford was mainly focused on promoting the teaching of structured literacy and new maths and that was "great".</p>
        
            <p>"So we as a science sector are falling behind and I know it's on their list, it's just that organisations like ours can't wait for things to move."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Peter Gluckman was also undertaking a review but in the meantime organisations like hers were closing their doors.</p>
        
            <p>There were many others who had shut up shop which meant tamariki were missing out on valuable aspects of science education.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not this year's focus of the government."</p>
