            <p>Rachel Boyack has been confirmed to have won the Nelson electorate by a margin of 26 votes.</p>
        
            <p>The margin is three votes smaller than it was in the Electoral Commission's final vote count last week.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Boyack said she was delighted to have been confirmed as the winner, but acknowledged the campaign run by her opponent.</p>
        
            <p>"It is the privilege of my life to be the MP for Nelson and I'm looking forward to continuing my work as a strong advocate for the Nelson region," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge Blair Cameron from the National Party who ran a strong campaign in Nelson."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to getting back to Parliament and working alongside my colleagues under Chris Hipkins' leadership to hold the new government to account. Labour will be a formidable opposition and I intend to play my part as a strong local MP for Nelson - ensuring investment continues in public transport, the Nelson Hospital Upgrade, housing and significant economic development projects."</p>
        
            <p>She also acknowledged Labour colleagues who would not be returning after the party's election results.</p>
