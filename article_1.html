        <h2>Trump shooter's NZ links revealed in probe</h2>
        <p>
The gunman's "overseas accounts" have piqued the suspicion of a congressional taskforce member.

            <p>The gunman who tried to assassinate former United States president Donald Trump had encrypted messaging accounts on platforms based in New Zealand, an investigation has shown.</p>
        
            <p>Republican representative Michael Waltz, a member of a congressional taskforce investigating the assassination attempt carried out by 19-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, revealed the link to media this week.</p>
        
            <p>Waltz said Crooks used encrypted messaging accounts on various platforms located in Belgium, New Zealand and Germany.</p>
        
            <p>According to the New York Post, the "overseas accounts" piqued Waltz's suspicion immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"Why does a 19-year-old kid who is a health care aide need encrypted platforms not even based in the United States, but based abroad - where most terrorist organisations know it is harder for our law enforcement to get into?" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a question I've had since day one."</p>

            <p>Crooks attempted to shoot Trump on 13 July, firing multiple times toward the former president as he spoke at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore, who was at the rally as a spectator, died in the shooting, while two other people were critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>Trump suffered an injury to his ear and was quickly led away by members of his security team. A photo of him with blood on his face and his fist raised in the air made headlines around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Counter-snipers shot Crooks dead shortly after he fired.</p>
        
            <p>In his press conference at the Trump Hotel in Chicago, Waltz went on to criticise the Secret Service and the FBI for declining to release the full findings of their investigation into the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General is also investigating the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle has resigned over the shooting, saying she took "full responsibility for the security lapse".</p>
