            <p>RNZ understands Finance and Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis will this weekend announce decisions taken by Cabinet to incentivise and encourage a third supermarket player into the market.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet has agreed to its next steps in its war on the country's supermarket duopoly, set to be announced by the Finance Minister on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis took over responsibility for the supermarket delegation earlier this month, after newly appointed Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson proactively identified a conflict of interest, understood to be a close family member owning a supermarket.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Bayly had been doing the job but quit his ministerial warrants last month after an incident with a staffer in his office.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands Willis, who is also Economic Growth Minister, will this weekend announce decisions taken by Cabinet to incentivise and encourage a third player into the market.</p>
        
            <p>It's required sign-off by Cabinet on several additional levers it can pull to improve access.</p>
        
            <p>Those levers could be related to tax incentives or infrastructure assistance, for example, government-owned land being freed up at significant sites for a new operator.</p>
        
            <p>While Willis has already indicated there is interest from businesspeople in New Zealand considering consolidating to create a supermarket chain, she has also been working on how to incentivise an international player entering the market.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands no announcement or confirmation of a third player will be made on Sunday, as that work is still ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Willis used her speech at the opening of the two-day Economic Forum in Hamilton to make a case for greater competition in the supermarket sector.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, she said her preference was for a local company to take on the duopoly giants - Foodstuffs and Progressive.</p>
        
            <p>She noted there had already been expressions of interest from overseas but would not say who or how many, citing commercial sensitivities.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs and Progressive have already been prosecuted by the Commerce Commission over "inaccurate pricing and misleading specials" and a probe by the commission into the wholesale market is due to wrap up and report back by the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Willis told RNZ a quicker, but less preferred, fix would be splitting up one or both of the existing duopoly, or requiring them to give up unused land to new competitors.</p>
        
            <p>She's open to the recommendations from the commission's investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"The alternative is to not do anything and to let the current arrangement become more and more entrenched," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's better to be taking action now."</p>
