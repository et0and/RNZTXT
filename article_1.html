            <p>Stuff has announced its Sunday News newspaper will wrap up at the end of July.</p>
        
            <p>The paper, which has been going for 61 years, was infamous for its sensationalist headlines.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff announced the closure in a news article in its paper and on its website on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff masthead publishing managing director Joanna Norris said they had been reviewing their portfolio over the past 12 months and decided that Sunday News was no longer a good fit.</p>
        
            <p>The news comes just days after Stuff said it was shutting its last remaining Northland community newspapers.</p>
        
            <p>Rival publisher NZME said it was cutting staff at most of its regional newspapers so it could divert resources to major centres.</p>
        
            <p>The first edition of Sunday News was published in 1961. The final edition will be published on 28 July.</p>
