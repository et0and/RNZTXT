            <p>More than 100 union members and some politicians have gathered outside the office of ACT Party leader David Seymour in the Auckland suburb of Epsom to protest plans to scrap Fair Pay Agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Delegates from FIRST, E Tū, NZEI, and Unite are stationed on Gillies Avenue with banners and flags and chanting against the changes. There are also some politicians in the crowd including Labour's Phil Twyford and the Green's Ricardo Menéndez March.</p>
        
            <p>First Union general secretary Dennis Maga said he had hoped to enter the office and meet with the ACT leader, however the front doors of the building have been locked.</p>
        
            <p>Maga said the decision to scrap FPAs has been done without a select committee and without the consultations of unions and workers.</p>
        
            <p>'No respect for workers lives' and 'Stand-up, fight back' are just two of the many slogans the crowds are chanting.</p>
        
            <p>Many members of the public were driving by and tooting their horns in support, RNZ's reporter at the scene said.</p>
