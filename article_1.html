            <p>New details have been revealed about planned changes to make stalking illegal, with offenders facing up to five years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>The law change would include behaviours like recording someone, tracking them, following them, or loitering nearby, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Committing three of those activities within 12 months could lead to a conviction.</p>
        
            <p>The changes would also include four other stalking-related amendments, Goldsmith said.</p>
        
            <p>This would mean courts are able to make restraining orders and harmful digital communications orders at sentencing, for those convicted of a stalking offence.</p>
        
            <p>Two new stalking-related aggravating factors would be introduced, extending sentences for stalkers convicted of other crimes.</p>
        
            <p>The definition of psychological violence in the Family Violence Act would also be clarified to specifically include stalking.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, those convicted of stalking would also be disqualified from holding a firearms licence.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said every New Zealander deserved to feel safe in their community, and the government was committed to ensuring victims were at the heart of the justice system.</p>
        
            <p>"The public is clearly concerned about stalking, and we are moving quickly to create a new stalking and harassment offence as part of our plan to restore law and order," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This comes as part of the Government's commitment to ensuring there [are] 20,000 fewer victims of serious violent crime by 2029, and delivers on the promises made in our Q4 Action Plan."</p>
        
            <p>He had in June committed to introducing such legislation by the end of 2024, having previously only committed to doing so before the next election.</p>
        
            <p>A member's bill submitted by Labour's Ginny Andersen would also have made stalking a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. It would have pointed also to aspects of family violence that could constitute stalking.</p>
        
            <p>It was drafted after the death of 21-year-old Farzana Yaqubi in December 2022, after she was threatened and stalked for weeks - including receiving messages from the offender threatening to throw acid on her face.</p>
        
            <p>She had complained to police via the 105 reporting system and made a formal statement earlier in the month of her death, but her complaint had not been progressed.</p>
        
            <p>However, the bill has remained in Parliament's biscuit tin, not yet drawn for consideration.</p>
        
            <p>A petition signed by almost 8000 people was also submitted to Parliament urging Goldsmith to make stalking a crime.</p>
        
            <p>He had already committed ahead of last year's election to look into stalking legislation.</p>
