        <h2>Live: TVNZ job cuts: 'No one's pretending it's easy'</h2>
        <p>
Former Labour MP and now union specialist Michael Wood says TVNZ needs to work with staff, rather than "dictate and predetermine the outcome".

            <p>TVNZ has announced it plans to cut up to 68 jobs in a proposed restructure.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ chief Jodi O'Donnell told staff on Thursday "tough economic conditions and structural challenges within the media sector" have hit the company's revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Presenter Miriama Kamo said the news was "devastating" not just for TVNZ but with the likely demise of Newshub there were "dire implications for our democracy".</p>
