            <p>"Police are working to establish the origin of the correspondence. Cordons are in place and a visible Police presence will be in the area while enquiries are ongoing."</p>
        
            <p>A message on the school's website said it had closed the school and any students not already at school should stay home.</p>
        
            <p>"School is in lock down effective immediately. As a precaution we are going to close the school for the day," the message said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to do a managed evacuation as follows: We ask that students are collected by parents or caregivers - pick up point is Musselburgh Rise by the bus stop which will be manned by Police. PLEASE STAY IN YOUR CAR. Please message your son or daughter when you arrive and they will be escorted off-site by Police. No student will be allowed to leave unless they are picked up by parents or caregivers."</p>
