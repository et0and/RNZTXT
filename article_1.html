            <p>There was commotion and excitement at a popular beach north of Auckland yesterday after yet another shark sighting - but experts say it was common over summer and that most sharks did not pose a risk to swimmers.</p>
        
            <p>Omaha beach was packed with holidaymakers when the bronze whaler was spotted late afternoon yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>The beach was abuzz as people left the waters and waited for 30 minutes for the shark to pass by</p>
        
            <p>Ocean swimmer Ritchie Wattson who encountered a shark the day before at the same beach said it was not uncommon.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of sharks, I mean it's not a case of if there are sharks, it's a case of how far away they are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was not too concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all heading around the corner to goat island to have a feed anyway, they don't really want us, so I'm not terribly concerned," he said.</p>

            <p>Clinton Duffy from the Department of Conservation's marine species team said bronze whalers were the most common large shark species in northern New Zealand at this time of the year.</p>
        
            <p>He said they ate fish and squid and were generally not a risk to people out on the water.</p>
        
            <p>"They're quite often just seen swimming amongst people at the beach, but the swimmers and other water users themselves are completely unaware that the sharks are there,</p>
        
            <p>"And the sharks are swimming along the beach, swimming around people, that's how disinterested in people bronze whalers are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Marine scientist Riley Elliott shared a similar view.</p>
        
            <p>He was out with his drone capturing shark behaviour at Pauanui in the Coromandel yesterday when he captured seven bronze whalers in a 20 minute flight.</p>
        
            <p>"With drone perspective, you see these animals are very passive, very calm, and in fact in some of the imagery when swimmers and surfers come out in the water,</p>
        
            <p>"Sharks from a distance will get curious, come up and about 50 metres away, realise there's a person, and they actually avoid them, they turn directly around and swim the other way," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Elliott said the creatures were not doing anything out of the ordinary.</p>
        
            <p>He said the golden rule was to not dump fishing carcasses where people swim regularly - and vice versa, for people to avoid swimming in areas where others are fishing.</p>
