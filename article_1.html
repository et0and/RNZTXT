            <p>A prominent Bay of Plenty farming family is donating to the community 100 hectares of farmland that has served them for the past 60 years.</p>
        
            <p>Notable farmer Ian Noble of Katikati sold up his herd on Thursday (9.05) and gifted the large grazing site to the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, where he put his heart and soul into his work as a regional councillor for more than 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Katikati farm on Hot Springs Road was an ecologically significant site in the Western Bay district, home to mature and endangered native bush species, native birdlife and streams and creeks.</p>
        
            <p>Located at the base of the Kaimai-Mamaku Forest, a number of trails and tracks could be accessed through the farm.</p>
        
            <p>Access could continue with the support of the regional council and the QEII National Trust, as an open space covenant will be registered for the property to forever guarantee its protection.</p>
        
            <p>The family wished to keep the land undeveloped, its natural features looked after and for community access to be continued for the trails as well as outdoor education.</p>
        
            <p>Noble said the donation was a way to give back to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a privilege to farm in the Western Bay of Plenty over the last 60 years," he said. "As a family, we have seen significant changes, and it has been an honour to be part of a number of them."</p>
        
            <p>Noble was formerly the region's Federated Farmers provincial president and a Queen's Service Medal holder for his services to farming and the community.</p>
        
            <p>He said his late wife Joyce was one of his biggest supporters without whom, he said, none of this donation could have happened.</p>
        
            <p>"She did great things for the community in her own right, always making herself available to help others. I'm incredibly proud of her for all the support she gave our family and those around her.</p>
        
            <p>"Community is what supports you to make things happen. You can't do it alone".</p>
        
            <p>They had four children, now scattered around the Tauranga area and one down in Christchurch. None were currently involved with farming.</p>
        
            <p>Eldest daughter Jill Noble said the donation was about leaving a legacy in the community, where her parents had worked for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"My family, both my parents, have real community spirits. They've both been heavily involved in the community. I feel that he really wants to see a legacy and wants to see something that is of benefit to his community."</p>

            <p>Jill said her father was still very engaged with farming and the issues that surrounded it.</p>
        
            <p>"He really enjoys being involved and having good conversations and dialogue and critical thinking around [where] farming's heading and what's happening with the climate and the environment.</p>
        
            <p>"He's keeping very well and enjoying the opportunity to be part of this piece of work."</p>
        
            <p>QEII National Trust chair Alan Livingston said the trust recognised opportunities like this did not happen every day.</p>
        
            <p>"This is why we are keen to work alongside regional council and the Noble family," Livingston said. "Our covenant will satisfy Ian's wish of permanent legal protection over the property, to preserve and enhance the property's significant biodiversity and ensure the landscape is protected for future generations."</p>
        
            <p>Regional council chair Doug Leeder said the council was grateful to the Noble family for entrusting them with the future of this land and the family legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"Land of this size and scale, that contains numerous significant ecological attributes, is a rarity.</p>
        
            <p>"We sincerely thank Noble for this generous opportunity and for recognising the contributing role regional council can play in helping protect it for future generations to come."</p>
