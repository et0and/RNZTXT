            <p>A union is calling for stab-proof vests and personal alarms for nurses after one was stabbed while on the job.</p>
        
            <p>The nurse was hospitalised on 28 December after being stabbed during an after-hours callout to the Rotorua suburb of Ngongotahā.</p>
        
            <p>She was part of Te Whatu Ora Lakes' acute mental health response team.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Nurses Organisation - Tōpūtanga Tapuhi Kaitiaki o Aotearoa - is now calling for nurses to be issued with vests and alarms.</p>
        
            <p>It and the Public Service Association are also calling for a full investigation by Te Whatu Ora and WorkSafe, and for the matter to be referred to the Health Quality Safety Commission.</p>
        
            <p>Other mental health nurses were "so worried about their safety", the NZNO said.</p>
        
            <p>Incidents like these had become more frequent in recent years, spokesperson Mitchell McLaughlan told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing escalating aggressive behaviours in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"More members of our society are presenting as highly distressed due to their social and financial situations, increased drug use along with a swell in anti-social behaviours.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to discuss whether extra security measures such as personal alarms or stab-proof vests should be worn from now on by nurses and kaiāwhina working in mental health."</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlan said the nurse who had been stabbed was "extremely traumatised" and had quit her job of more than 20 years as a result of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"A personal alarm is very helpful because, in that particular situation, there were two people there, [and] it would have allowed the other person to quickly denote where the individual had got to.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned that, due to the nature of the business, we are going to see more of these incidents in the future."</p>
        
            <p>In August, then-Police Commissioner Andrew Coster announced the police would start the transition to no longer respond to every mental health-related call from 1 November.</p>
        
            <p>Nurses had become increasingly vulnerable as a result, NZNO mental health nurses section chair Helen Garrick said.</p>
        
            <p>In October, Mark Quinn from the Ambulance Association called for stab-proof vests for all workers.</p>
        
            <p>However, PSA health national sector lead Sue McCullough said it was not something the union had heard from its members.</p>
        
            <p>"It's concerning that we would get to that stage where people need that kind of protection, to be honest," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"In mental health units, the staff tend to wear plain clothes, rather than being in anything that looks like a uniform, and that could also exacerbate issues.</p>
        
            <p>"But, certainly, we want our members to be safe, and it is about preventing these things happening rather than having something to protect them when it does."</p>
        
            <p>McCullough said incidents like these highlighted the consequences of the government's "relentless" cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"These funding cuts, along with short staffing, will continue to endanger the entire health care system and all New Zealanders' health and wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora and the Minister of Health Dr Shane Reti have been approached for comment.</p>
