            <p>At least four Nelson schools and the hospital are in lockdown as police respond to a family harm incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Armed Offenders Squad is assisting as a precaution, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Motueka Street at the intersection of Tipahi Street, is closed.</p>
        
            <p>St John has been placed on standby and an ambulance, rapid response vehicle and a manager have been sent.</p>
        
            <p>Victory Primary School told RNZ it is in lockdown and were told to do so just after 10:30am.</p>
        
            <p>It was waiting for further instructions from police.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Intermediate School is also in lockdown and says all students are safe, accounted for and in classes with staff.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson College and Hampden Street School both also confirmed on Facebook it was also locked down.</p>
        
            <p>...more to come</p>
