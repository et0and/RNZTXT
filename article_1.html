        <h2>Confusion as Trump says NZ has a 20% tariff against the US</h2>

An economist says he is surprised to see the US' claim.

            <p>An economist says he is surprised to see a US chart stating that New Zealand imposes 20 percent tariffs on imports from the United States.</p>
        
            <p>US President Donald Trump has been announcing his global tariff plan in a speech from the Rose Garden on the White House.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will face a 10 percent tariff on its imports to the US, with rates between 20 and 50 percent for countries judged to have major tariffs on US goods.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand exports were worth about $9 billion last year, meaning theoretically New Zealand exporters will be penalised about $900 million.</p>

            <p>A US chart says New Zealand imposes 20 percent on US imports, which is not explained given most goods from the US have low or no tariffs imposed.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac chief economist Kelly Eckhold said it was surprising to see New Zealand listed as imposing a 20 percent tariff on the US.</p>
        
            <p>"My best speculation here is that is probably a combination of the GST rate plus we do have some tariffs against the US in some products set at a minimum WTO agreed level. What I'm confused about is why they say Australia is 10 percent. They also have a GST, and similarly the United Kingdom is assessed at 10 as well and they have a value-added tax."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not good news for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
