            <p>Pregnant staff in Christchurch Hospital's radiology team have been offered advice by Health New Zealand after they inhaled toxic fumes from a construction site.</p>
        
            <p>Health union APEX said at least 30 staff had become sick from an industrial chemical used in painting work at the nearby hospital tower block that got through the air conditioning.</p>
        
            <p>Workers suffered headaches, breathing problems and rashes, with one ending up in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Te Waipounamu deputy chief executive Martin Keogy said they were aware of pregnant staff on the radiology team.</p>
        
            <p>"We care deeply about their health and understand their concerns. We have offered expert advice and guidance to them via the independent occupational health physician we have engaged and our foetal medicine service."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has obtained a memo sent to staff on Tuesday, by Keogh, that stated the fumes may have originated from spray-painting of fire-retardant paint products being applied to the steel structure of the Tower 3 site.</p>
        
            <p>"Because the root cause of the fumes experienced by radiology staff remains unclear at this time, I have ordered all construction works across the entire Christchurch Hospital campus that creates and generates fumes to stop until we have clarity all works are safe to resume.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of radiology staff have developed symptoms which include a range of respiratory and/or skin/rash symptoms, ranging in severity from very minor to very serious, including one staff member who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit."</p>
        
            <p>The memo said Te Whatu Ora was working hard to identify staff or patients who may have been exposed.</p>
        
            <p>It talked about hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), what the substance actually was and what the health risks were.</p>
        
            <p>The memo said it was used as a thickener and hardener for two-pot paints. It can cause irritation of the respiratory tract, dizziness, irritation and headaches.</p>
        
            <p>There could be long-term immunological reactions, which could cause adult-onset asthma, skin reactions and gastro.</p>
        
            <p>It also said for the pregnant staff, there was no risk that HDI is teratogenic (changes in unborn children) or carcinogenic (able to cause cancer).</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said construction remained paused on Wednesday. WorkSafe had been notified.</p>
