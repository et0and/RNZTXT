            <p>The founder of Te Pāti Māori Dame Tariana Turia will be laid to rest at her marae at Whangaehu.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana died on Friday, aged 80, after earlier suffering a stroke.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands have arrived in the small settlement south of Whanganui over the last four days to pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau spokesperson Che Wilson said Tuesday's proceedings would begin with karakia followed by a church service to send off the woman affectionately known among her iwi as Auntie Tari.</p>
        
            <p>The nehu, or burial, is set to begin about11am.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said the whānau were encouraging people to stay behind after the nehu for the hākari, or feast, which usually signaled the end of a tangihanga.</p>
        
            <p>He said the village of Whangaehu may be small, but the entire Māori community on both sides of the Whanganui river had come together to farewell one of their own.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't be from one side of a river and not from the other side of a river, or connected to the many rivers along here, so ... as a wider rohe (region) we're supporting each other to ensure we can do the things we need to do to honour our Queen."</p>

            <p>Colleague and close friend Sir Bill English told Morning Report the Māori health provider movement and Whanau Ora will be Dame Tariana's lasting legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"In Whanganui, she started one of the early Māori providers...and it was all based on a view that government services weren't designed around people.</p>
        
            <p>"She set about doing a bit more than just talking about it, she started essentially the movement of Māori health providers and Whanau Ora."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Bill said Dame Tariana had a deep faith in the capacity of people to know what was best for them which allowed for progress if you gave them a little room to do it.</p>
        
            <p>He also said she was quite sceptical about the structures and delivery of the welfare state.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana resigned from the Labour Party in 2004, before forming Māori Party, which Sir Bill said took immense courage to do.</p>
        
            <p>"Willie Jackson noted this yesterday at the tangi, it takes a great deal of courage to break - particularly with a government - and form your own party because there's so much uncertainty about whether it will work or won't work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Secondly, in her case, along with Pita Sharples, who was there yesterday, she focused very much on the mana-enhancing way of doing politics."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Bill said under Dame Tariana's leadership, the Māori Party focused very much on a style of politics which he believed people would find irrelevant today because of factors like social media.</p>
        
            <p>He credited Māori Party at the time for their research, constructive and well-thought-through speeches in the House, and conducting themselves with mana, which he said was very effective.</p>
        
            <p>"Within a few years of leaving the Labour Party, she was part of a government, and able to conduct the Māori Party's relationship in a government with quite a lot of tension, but always with integrity and that coalition lasted nine years and allowed her to persist with ideas like Whanau Ora and a lot of unrecognised work she did within the disability community as well."</p>
