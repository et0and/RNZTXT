            <p>New Zealand has claimed it's fifth Paralympic medal with Anna Grimaldi winning bronze in 100m final on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Will Stedman won a silver medal in the Men's 400m T36 final.</p>
        
            <p>Competing a little under 16 hours after finishing fourth in the Long Jump, the 24-year-old Christchurch-based athlete produced an outstanding display to record a national record time of 52.92 behind defending champion James Turner of Australia who set a world record mark of 51.54.</p>
        
            <p>For Stedman it was the fifth Paralympic Games medal of his career and a third successive Paralympic Games medal in the Men's 400m T36 after winning bronze medals at both the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I only got three-and-a-hours sleep last night (following the long jump final) and I was worried about that but as I warmed up, I got a good feeling," Steadman said afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>"I ran a good first half of the race and felt good around the bend and pushed it hard. With 50 metres to go I had nothing in the legs, I was trying to hold on and I almost tripped over a couple of times.</p>
        
            <p>"To run 52.92 - a 0.44 PB is crazy. I knew I could run well today, but I didn't think that well given the sleep I had. I'm over the moon with that performance."</p>
        
            <p>On winning silver he said: "It means a lot to me, especially as a lot of other athletes in the field ran well today. I had to run well to get the silver. This year I've improved my 400m PB by quite a bit. It is cool to see the hard work I've put in over the past three years pay off."</p>
        
            <p>Steadman, who competes in the Men's 100m T36 on Saturday, said he plans to celebrate by eating some ice cream in the Village today and then rest up ahead of his final event at Paris 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really looking forward to the 100m. I'm in really good shape, we'll give it a go and then see what happens."</p>
