        <h2>Council braces for new miners as gold price soars</h2>
        <p>
As the price of gold soars to a record NZ$5000 an ounce, the West Coast is bracing for an influx of miners new to the industry - and its environmental rules.

            <p>As the price of gold soars to a record NZ$5000 an ounce, the West Coast Regional Council is bracing for an influx of miners new to the industry - and its environmental rules.</p>
        
            <p>The council issues resource consents for the earthworks and water use needed in alluvial goldmining and it deals with recurring complaints about creeks running dirty, allegedly from mining operations.</p>
        
            <p>That keeps West Coast Regional Council (WCRC) compliance staff on the hop - checking out the cause and making site visits to see if miners are sticking to the conditions of their consents.</p>
        
            <p>The council's Resource Management Chair Brett Cummings - himself a goldminer - warned last week that the council's workload was likely to intensify.</p>
        
            <p>The gold price was likely to attract new players inexperienced in running alluvial mining sites, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The council's latest compliance report shows five goldminers were pinged with enforcement action - usually an infringement notice and fine - for failing to keep to the rules.</p>
        
            <p>Two were exceeding the area they were allowed to dig up; one had dug a bigger pit than his consent allowed, and two had caused dirty water or sediment to flow into local waterways.</p>
        
            <p>And one repeat offender was now before the courts.</p>
        
            <p>But not all complaints about goldmining were well-founded.</p>
        
            <p>One about an access road being built had involved private land and breached no rules.</p>
        
            <p>Three more, about dirty water in Waimea Creek, the Little Grey River and at Awatuna, proved groundless - or not the fault of miners.</p>
        
            <p>In another case, dirty water leaching from an old mining tunnel was fixed on the spot by the current miner, who sealed it off with gravel.</p>
        
            <p>People were entitled to raise concerns about pollution of waterways, but should bear in mind that staff time and travel was involved, Cummings said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still getting a lot of complaints that turn out to be minor or not significant. People have a right to complain, but they should be aware that these staff visits are all costing the ratepayers."</p>
        
            <p>WCRC chair Peter Haddock, a retired goldminer, confirmed to LDR that the council is upping its compliance game, with a focus on repeat offenders, and not just in goldmining.</p>

            <p>It recently hired former police officer Chris Maitland on a fixed term contract to beef up its investigations.</p>
        
            <p>Haddock said prosecutions are a last ditch measure: council policy was first to engage with consent holders, educate them, empower them - and if all else fails, enforce, he told LDR.</p>
        
            <p>Education was the key to making sure the expected newcomers to goldmining, and some old-timers, kept to the rules, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The WCRC chair last week took five compliance staff on a tiki tour of alluvial gold mining sites to show them what good practice looks like.</p>
        
            <p>The council was also looking to upskill miners - and new ones in particular, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with Minerals West Coast to hold workshops for consent holders, using experienced miners to help and advise them."</p>
        
            <p>The workshops planned for later this year would focus on gold miners in the Waimea catchment north-east of Hokitika, the area that generates more than its share of complaints about water quality, Haddock said.</p>
        
            <p>There are other signs that the openly pro-development council is getting tougher with polluters.</p>
        
            <p>It recently prosecuted one of the West Coast's major industries - CMP Kokiri (Anzco Foods).</p>
        
            <p>The beef processor pumps $133m into the West Coast economy annually and employs 190 people.</p>
        
            <p>But staff reports over its performance have become increasingly blunt, describing the company's yearly environmental self-reports as "not being credible for the past three years."</p>
        
            <p>The company will be sentenced next month for discharging contaminants to water.</p>
        
            <p>The WCDC is also prosecuting the owners of the controversial private dump known as the Taylorville Resource Park, for discharging contaminants to land.</p>
        
            <p>That case comes up next month in the Greymouth District Court.</p>
