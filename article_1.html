        <h2>Aussie teen finds NZ Navy's rugby ball lost over-board</h2>
        <p>
It was a one-of-a-kind situation for 15-year-old Max El-Tahche, who found the washed-up rugby ball on Blanche Beach in Tasmania.

            <p>It all happened on the last weekend of the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Max El-Tahche and his family were at the beach enjoying the sunshine in Tasmania, Australia, when he stumbled upon a lost treasure... a New Zealand Navy ship's rugby ball.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd just gone to the beach as a family to relax, and we had just found the ball sitting at the edge of the water," the 15-year-old said, who found the ball washed-up on Blanche Beach.</p>
        
            <p>"When we found it, saw that there was words on it and but it wasn't a name. So my dad had searched up the name and found out that it was a Navy ship."</p>
        
            <p>The ball was marked with HMNZS Aotearoa, the Royal New Zealand Navy's polar-class sustainment vessel.</p>
        
            <p>HMNZS Aotearoa had recently passed Tasmania after it took a fuel stop at Geelong, the Royal New Zealand Navy said in a post on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>The post said the vessel was on a re-supply mission to Antarctica.</p>

            <p>The ship's information officer Sub Lieutenant Ben Redmond confirmed a sailor lost the rugby ball overboard after an "over-exuberant and off-target kick from a sailor on the flight deck".</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite common unfortunately with losing some balls over the side. It's usually a case of getting another ball out of the locker and getting on with it, but sometimes it can cut the games short."</p>
        
            <p>However for El-Tahche, it was a one-of-a-kind situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's weird, but it's amazing to, I guess, finding the ball that belongs to, that has been washed up and belongs to like a Navy ship."</p>
        
            <p>Max El-Tahche's father Bashir El-Tahche said it was a good way to end the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] something that I guess Max will never forget," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The El-Tahche family are in touch with the Navy to organise a special trade - the rugby ball's return for some ship merchandise.</p>
