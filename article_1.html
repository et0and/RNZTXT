        <p>
The problems - which hit businesses and even parliament - came just hours after a cyber-attack affected services around the world.

            <p>Microsoft says it is looking into reports some of its services are down around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Products such as Outlook, Azure cloud computing and Teams were affected.</p>
        
            <p>There were thousands of reports of Microsoft failures across the country, according to DownDetector, a site which monitors internet outages.</p>
        
            <p>Parliamentary Services said the Parliament precinct was experiencing problems, suggesting a downed server might be to blame. Police shortly after 10am said they had not recieved any emails since 8.20am. Email service resumed about 10.15am.</p>
        
            <p>The reports began shortly before 8.30am on Thursday. Around 9.45am, many users online began reporting the services were functioning again.</p>
        
            <p>"We're investigating reports of access issues with Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, for users in New Zealand," it said on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Later, the company said it did had "rerouted network traffic to alternate infrastructure and are seeing improvements in service ability. We'll continue to closely monitor telemetry as we work to identify the underlying cause of the network issue."</p>
        
            <p>Its next update was due around 11.30am (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>It came a day after Microsoft services including Outlook and Minecraft were subject to a cyber-attack, and nearly two weeks after a botched software rollout by a third party took down millions of computers running Microsoft Windows.</p>
