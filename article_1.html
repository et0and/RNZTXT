        <p>
The category two system is may to cross the coast on Friday night as residents brace.
</p>
        
            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred's centre is expected to hit Australia on Friday night or Saturday morning, with impacts already being felt across south-east Queensland and northern NSW.</p>
        
            <p>The category two system was expected to remain of similar intensity until the centre started to interact with the coast and islands.</p>
        
            <p>Energex, the electricity supplier for Queensland, was reporting widespread disruption to its power network on the Gold Coast.</p>
