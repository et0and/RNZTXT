            <p>Warning: This story discusses graphic details of violence.</p>
        
            <p>Teenager Ariki Rigby was brutally murdered following an argument sparked by her wearing a gang member's t-shirt, it has been revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Jimmy Heremaia, a 32-year-old orchard worker from Auckland, has pleaded guilty to the murder of 18-year-old Ariki Rigby.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay teenager Ariki Rigby was murdered following an argument over a Mongrel Mob t-shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Heremaia pleaded guilty at the High Court in Napier on Friday to the murder of the 18-year-old, whose body was found in a burnt out car in Havelock North in September 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Ropine Paul, 29, a labourer from Havelock North, pleaded guilty to arson.</p>
        
            <p>The summary of facts, detailing the events leading to Rigby's death, can now be reported.</p>
        
            <p>It said Heremaia - a patched Mongrel Mob member - and Rigby met three weeks before her death, forming a close connection and communicating regularly.</p>
        
            <p>On 31 August, Rigby wore Heremaia's Mongrel Mob t-shirt out in public.</p>
        
            <p>"She ... was confronted by another patched member of the Mongrel Mob who saw the act as a serious breach of the gang's rules," the summary said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Heremaia was instructed by his seniors to retrieve the t-shirt from Ms Rigby, which he did later that day."</p>
        
            <p>A few days later Heremaia learned his patch had been taken from his family home. The Crown said that was because Rigby had worn the t-shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Heremaia picked up Rigby and took her to "an isolated location" where they argued before she swung a weapon at him.</p>
        
            <p>"He blocked her, before overpowering her and taking the weapon from her," the summary said.</p>
        
            <p>"He went on to use it to strike her several times including to the head."</p>
        
            <p>Rigby died from those injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Heremaia then placed her body in the car and drove to Paul's home, requesting his help to "get rid" of the body.</p>
        
            <p>They drove to a remote car park by a river and used petrol to set fire to the car, with Rigby's body inside.</p>
        
            <p>Heremaia and Paul will be sentenced at the High Court in Napier on 11 April.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector David De Lange of Eastern District Police said he acknowledged Ariki's whānau, "who have waited so long to see the person responsible held accountable for her tragic death".</p>
        
            <p>"We also acknowledge those Police staff who worked meticulously over a long period of time to piece together the evidence that has brought about this result today".</p>
        
            <p>At the time of Rigby's funeral, a family spokesperson said she was a beautiful, passionate person, who lived life at "full throttle".</p>
        
            <p>Heremaia was arrested in September last year, and Paul was arrested the following month.</p>
        
            <p>The arrests followed a plea from Rigby's family for people to come forward with information.</p>
        
            <p>Rigby's death was initially treated as unexplained, before police launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>They reviewed their response after officers checking on the car failed to realise there was a [. https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/474252/police-to-investigate-how-officers-missed-body-in-car-for-days body inside it for two days] - initially thinking it was the body of an animal.</p>
