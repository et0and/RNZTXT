        <p>

            <p>At-risk children are no safer now than they were after a series of recommendations after the horrific death of a 5-year-old Malachi Subecz, according to the Independent Children's Monitor.</p>
        
            <p>The assessment comes in a follow-up report by the Aroturuki Tamariki / Independent Children's Monitor into whether the system has improved since the boy's murder.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered months of abuse at the hands of his carer, Michaela Barriball, including being beaten and burned, before he was murdered in November 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In the wake of his death, a review by Dame Karen Poutasi was commissioned and six government agencies reviewed their work.</p>
        
            <p>But the latest report, called 'Working towards a stronger safety net to prevent abuse of children', stated: "We are not confident that tamariki in similar situations to Malachi are any more likely to be seen, or kept safe by the system, than they were when Malachi died."</p>
        
            <p>Aroturuki Tamariki chief executive Arran Jones said it was "disappointing to see the lack of priority given to this by government agencies over the last two years".</p>
        
            <p>"The gaps identified by the Poutasi review were not new and have been raised by previous reviews over decades."</p>
        
            <p>Agencies had taken some steps in their own reviews since the latest report was finalised, Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>The report said the system change that Dame Karen had called for had not happened.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
