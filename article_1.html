            <p>Fire investigators have discovered the cause of massive fire that raced across 1000 hectares of Canterbury high country over the past five days.</p>
        
            <p>The Bridge Hill fire is now under control, with drone teams up overnight checking for hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury District Commander Dave Stackhouse told Morning Report investigators have found the cause and are working with police.</p>
        
            <p>But he said it was too soon to announce their findings say if the fires was deliberately lit, as the investigation is still wrapping up.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said they have have spoken with schools that were holding camps in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Commander Stackhouse said crews will continue to mop up hotspots on Tuesday, and will meet with landowners on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, wind caused flare ups at the site of a large vegetation fire in West Melton overnight, but firefighters were able to prevent flames breaching containment lines.</p>

            <p>Incident Commander Dave Key said the flare-ups happened when wind fanned partially burned vegetation and trees into flame.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which began on Sunday night, has burned across more than 130 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>Homes and a caravan park were briefly evacuated in the early hours of Sunday morning, but all were allowed home.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were also at the nearby Kirwee fire, which has been burning since Saturday and is mostly contained.</p>
        
            <p>There are 75 firefighters, two helicopters and heavy machinery operators extinguishing hotspots across the two fires.</p>
        
            <p>Stackhouse said there are two fire investigators on site at West Melton on Tuesday working to find the cause of the blaze.</p>
