            <p>The Highlanders have held off a brave late fight by Moana Pasifika, surviving for a thrilling 31-29 win in Albany.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders struck with a screamer after just two minutes, Nathan Hastie finishing off a superb sweeping movement.</p>
        
            <p>The hosts hit back through a close range try for Sione Mafile'o followed by some slick backline work to put Willy Havili over to square the ledger, two missed conversions by Havili keeping things locked up after 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Then the floodgates opened as the visitors ran in three on the trot, to</p>
        
            <p>Tanielu Tele'a, and Mitch Dunshea, and a 90 metre runaway intercept for Caleb Tangitau to really drive the knife in.</p>
        
            <p>Having conceded 21 unanswered points, Moana needed something special and it came through their skipper, as Ardie Savea leapt into the air to snaffle a high ball and streaked 50 metres to bring his side back in the contest.</p>
        
            <p>A lengthy delay then ensued after Cam Millar was taken from the field after a brutal collision with Danny Toala.</p>
        
            <p>Havili's second, the first try Moana were able to convert, brought them back within nine.</p>
        
            <p>A sharp set play from a tap then sent Semisi Ta'eito over and the Moana fans into raptures, as they trailled by just two with five minutes to play.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Highlanders held their nerve and the ball deep inside the 22, as the clock wound down and the siren eventually sounded, bringing the curtain down on another classic.</p>
