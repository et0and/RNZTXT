            <p>Police are still searching for a Wellington man who has been missing since early October.</p>
        
            <p>Duncan Hill was last seen at his Waihoanga Road home in Ōtaki on 5 October.</p>
        
            <p>His family said they were desperate to find out what happened to him.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody is putting a tremendous effort in to find Duncan in rugged, remote and challenging terrain, for which we are truly grateful," the family said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Not knowing where he is, or whether he is safe, is becoming increasingly difficult to endure and we are gravely concerned for his wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Police believed he was still in the area around Waihoanga Road, but the terrain was very rugged to search.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Thompson said police widened the search area with specialist groups on 9 November as many of the search areas were steep and bush-covered.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Ōtaki Gorge was also of interest to police.</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said Hill had limited mobility and there were concerns he would have run out of medication which he needs on a regular basis.</p>
        
            <p>He was urging anyone who had seen Hill or may have information to come forward.</p>
