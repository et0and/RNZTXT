            <p>Census data has revealed one in 20 New Zealand adults identify as LGBTIQ+ - or part of the rainbow community.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time ever, the 2023 Census collected data about gender, sexual identity and variations of sex characteristics.</p>
        
            <p>The LGBTIQ+ or rainbow population includes people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex, or have other "minority genders or sexual identities", StatsNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Data released on Thursday revealed the population's size in 2023 was 172,383 - or 4.9 percent of adults.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington had the highest proportion of people belonging to the rainbow community, at 11.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That was followed by Dunedin at 7.3 percent, Christchurch at 6 percent, Palmerston North at 5.8 percent and Hamilton at 5.6 percent, with Auckland sitting at 4.9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Rainbow communities had been lobbying for decades to have this information recorded and to see themselves reflected in the data, said StatsNZ principal analyst Adele Quinn.</p>
        
            <p>There was also demand from government agencies who would use the data to better understand communities and ensure they have the services and support they need, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2023 Census, 144,960 people over 15 years old reported a sexual identity other than heterosexual.</p>
        
            <p>Just over half - 54 percent - identified as bisexual, about 30 percent identified as gay or lesbian, and the remaining 13 percent had a different sexual identity that had not been classified.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, more than 26,000 people said they were transgender when filling out the Census. That equated to 0.7 percent of the adult population.</p>
        
            <p>More than 15,000 of these people identified as "another gender" while just over 5,000 identified as transgender male, and nearly 6,000 identified as transgender female.</p>
        
            <p>Less than half a percent of adults identified as non-binary.</p>
        
            <p>On average they were younger than the general population, with a median age of 24.8 years compared with 38.1 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Census delivered Aotearoa's first official statistics about the intersex population.</p>
        
            <p>Intersex describes a range of natural variations in the human body, specifically the innate variations in someone's sex characteristics, of which there are over 40 under the umbrella term.</p>
        
            <p>Sex characteristics can include hormones, chromosomes, internal and external anatomy.</p>
        
            <p>It found 0.4 percent of the population, or just over 15,000 people, stated they knew they were born with a variation of sex characteristics.</p>
