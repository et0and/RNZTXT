            <p>Carpark chaos at an Auckland mall over the weekend has prompted concerns about whether the city's roads can handle the holiday demand.</p>
        
            <p>Shoppers at Westfield Newmarket were trapped in the carpark for hours at a time as traffic ground to a halt on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>That caught the eye of New Zealand's Automobile Association (AA), which is calling on Auckland Transport (AT) to urgently address traffic management issues in the shopping district.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen this once before," AA's Auckland issues spokesperson Martin Glynn said.</p>
        
            <p>"People just couldn't get out and some of that appears to be [because of] how the roads are configured around the mall."</p>
        
            <p>He said the traffic lights did not leave enough room for drivers to exit the carpark at a reasonable pace.</p>
        
            <p>Newmarket Business Association Chief Executive Mark Knoff-Thomas said the rest of the city was congested, too.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a perfect storm," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The motorway was gridlocked, the on-ramps and off-ramps were choked up. There was this ongoing domino effect, so yeah, we didn't have the best day."</p>
        
            <p>He said the demand was enormous.</p>
        
            <p>"Newmarket would've seen upwards of 70,000 people visit the precinct on Saturday alone," Knoff-Thomas said.</p>
        
            <p>"Historically, from research we've done, 60 percent would be coming by car - so therein lies the problem."</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged shoppers to take advantage of the nearby bus lanes and train station.</p>
        
            <p>With demand driven by Black Friday sales, and poor weather pushing shoppers indoors, Glynn said preventing the carpark chaos would have been difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"When you get all that demand at once I don't know if you can prevent it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more about how it's managed when these incidents do happen, it's really about how you respond to it rather than trying to prevent it."</p>
        
            <p>Both Westfield and AT could have done more, Glynn said.</p>
        
            <p>"Westfield, as a mall operator, as soon as they could see how bad it was becoming I think they needed to get in touch with Auckland Transport. That may have happened, but it's hard to tell," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Transport could've made some changes to the phasing of the traffic lights to help start clearing the delay."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped Saturday's mishap would prompt a response. "I'd like to be optimistic that this is a bit of a wake up call," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this scale, you could argue that there needs to be a formal response to address it."</p>
        
            <p>Knoff-Thomas said the Newmarket Business Association was engaged with AT and Westfield to avoid repeat incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be working very closely to see what we can do to increase the flow of traffic; there are things Auckland Transport Operations Centre can do to clear the roads," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Westfield themselves have got more staff on for the weekends to make sure they can handle any traffic management issues. We'll be well prepared going forward."</p>
        
            <p>Glynn encouraged would-be shoppers to think twice before visiting a mall at peak times.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be tempting to go to a mall on a really rainy day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But [it's worth] thinking carefully and knowing you could face delays, because the majority of people who go to malls still go via car."</p>
