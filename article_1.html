            <p>Iconic film and television director David Lynch has died.</p>
        
            <p>His family announced his death in a Facebook post on Friday (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole'."</p>
        
            <p>He previously revealed he suffered from emphysema after many years of smoking.</p>
        
            <p>He was 78.</p>
        
            <p>Lynch, an auteur director known for surrealistic and idiosyncratic style has been a major presence in film and a fan favourite since his 1977 independent horror Eraserhead.</p>
        
            <p>However, he was probably best known for his work on films Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and television show Twin Peaks.</p>
        
            <p>His 1980 filmThe Elephant Man was nominated for eight Oscars.</p>
