        <p>
Parking penalties have jumped 70 percent around Aotearoa - but is it fair, and can you get out of them? Audio

            <p>Parking penalties have jumped 70 percent throughout Aotearoa - but is it fair and can you pass the buck?</p>
        
            <p>Parking fines are up for the first time in 20 years and misbehaving parkers will now be facing stricter penalties across the board.</p>
        
            <p>What used to be a $40 fine for not paying for parking in Wellington is now $70.</p>
        
            <p>If you miscalculate how long you need the spot, those penalties are also increasing - going up to almost $100 if you really overstay your welcome.</p>
        
            <p>We have all been guilty playing roulette when it comes to parking, but is the price of not paying worth the potential pay off?</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ's Vanessa Pratley has written about the ins and outs of parking fines, and said it was really hard to say whether the 70 percent increase was fair.</p>
        
            <p>"Councils are free to set parking fines as they like, in the same way that they set rates.</p>
        
            <p>"In the same vein, whether a 70 percent increase on fines is fair isn't really a question we can answer without looking into the particular circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>Even if you get stung and think it's unfair, it is unlikely you'll be able to get out of it.</p>
        
            <p>"You're only likely to avoid a council parking fine if it was given erroneously," Pratley said.</p>
        
            <p>For example: "if the time was read incorrectly or the parking machines on the street weren't properly functioning.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've overstayed or haven't paid when you should have, you won't be able to get out of paying."</p>
        
            <p>She said there was always the option to appeal the fines, but how you do so, and on what grounds would change from council to council.</p>

            <p>That being said, different rules apply to private operators like Wilson Parking.</p>
        
            <p>Private parking breaches sit around the $65-$85 mark, often with additional charges if you don't pay in time.</p>
        
            <p>When you drive into these locations and park up, you automatically accept the terms and conditions of that parking lot (there should be at least one sign spelling those out.)</p>
        
            <p>Pratley said if you don't pay, or you overstay, you're in breach of the contract and liable to pay a fee, generally set out in advance.</p>
        
            <p>But is a fee of $65 for a teeny bit of overstaying fair?</p>
        
            <p>Pratley said no.</p>
        
            <p>"The parking fee should be reasonably reflective of the actual loss suffered by the operator. Anything out of proportion to what's reasonable is likely to be an unenforceable penalty.</p>
        
            <p>"While fines can be set to deter people from breaching the contract, it's still got to be reasonable."</p>
        
            <p>So for example, $65 for overstaying 10 minutes in a free supermarket car park - might not be considered reasonable.</p>
        
            <p>But in 2020 the law changed, which might alter your chances of getting off the hook.</p>
        
            <p>"The law shifted from assessing whether a penalty was fair in light of the actual financial loss of the innocent party, in parking cases - the operator, to assessing whether the penalty is out of all proportion to the legitimate interests of the operator," Pratley said.</p>
        
            <p>"This changed the threshold against which fines imposed by operators are considered unreasonable or not, and therefore how the Disputes Tribunal decides cases like this"</p>
        
            <p>I.e. it has moved from how much did the supermarket lose while you were overstaying in their car park to a place that gives companies more power to enforce these rules when it comes to financial losses.</p>
        
            <p>However, each adjudicator is different, and the Disputes Tribunal also does not have to follow its own precedent cases.</p>
        
            <p>In short, the Tribunal is less forgiving than it used to be.</p>

            <p>Despite all this, Pratley said it was still worth fighting a fine if it was unreasonable or erroneously given - especially if it was over $100.</p>
        
            <p>In a recent case someone used a private car park with signage stating: "No Parking Private Property, this prompted a $95 fine.</p>
        
            <p>The man disputed the fine and paid $2 of the fee instead. The Tribunal did not agree, and he was forced to pay up.</p>
        
            <p>In another case, OX v QT Ltd, the Tribunal found that $95.00 was "more than sufficient" for 5 to 10 minutes parking.</p>
        
            <p>If you decide to dispute the fee there is a cost of $59 to have the case heard at the tribunal if the claim is less than $2000.</p>
        
            <p>Pratley said even if you win, you don't get that fee back.</p>
        
            <p>"It's worth weighing up whether the fine is high enough to displace that filing fee."</p>
