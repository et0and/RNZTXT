            <p>The Black Caps have slumped to a 172-run defeat in the first test against Australia at the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Australian spinner Nathan Lyon ripped through the Kiwis' batting lineup, taking 6/65 as New Zealand were dismissed for 196 on day four.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon claimed 10 for the match, making the key breakthrough of Rachin Ravindra for 59 first up this morning.</p>
        
            <p>With the Black Caps chasing an unlikely 369 to win the game, Lyon's three quick strikes for just two runs quashed any serious hope for the hosts.</p>
        
            <p>Tom Blundell was next to go for a duck, with Glenn Phillips falling two overs later, as Lyon claimed his third.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Kuggeleijn and Daryl Mitchell offered some resistance with 26 and 38 respectively, before Cameron Green had Kuggeleijn caught behind.</p>
        
            <p>The wickets of Matt Henry, Tim Southee and Mitchell followed soon after. Mitchell was the last man to go, caught and bowled by Josh Hazlewood.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon finished with match figures of 10/108 while Cameron Green was awarded man of the match for his 174 in the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>The second test in Christchurch gets underway on Friday.</p>
