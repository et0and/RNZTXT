            <p>Tens of thousands of people past retirement age are still paying off their student loans, government figures show.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch woman Sarah, who does not want to be identified, has been paying off a student loan for much of her adult life.</p>
        
            <p>She initially completed a bachelor's degree in sociology and geography and has an event management qualification, too. She graduated with about $40,000 in debt.</p>
        
            <p>She has since paid that down to $5000 but is now facing the prospect of adding to it again so that she can retrain as a teacher.</p>
        
            <p>"I do find it demoralising to be 40 still with a loan. I feel like I'll never get ahead and I made so many decisions that just did not set me up to be financially successful."</p>
        
            <p>Financial mentors say student loan debt can stick with people for a long time.</p>
        
            <p>One Auckland financial mentor said people who had been on low incomes through their lives were sometimes shocked to discover their superannuation was being docked to repay a student loan.</p>
        
            <p>"They wouldn't be repaying it on a benefit ... I don't think people realise when they go on to a pension they have to start repaying their student loan from a pension.</p>
        
            <p>"When I've said 'look they just don't have any money' you get told 'they have to pay it back sometime'. I think lots of people who haven't earnt a lot of money after studying will be quite surprised about that."</p>
        
            <p>She said half to three-quarters of the pensioners she dealt with had a student loan.</p>
        
            <p>Financial coach Shula Newland said someone with a student loan could also find that income from KiwiSaver and other investments was used to pay it off.</p>
        
            <p>She said beneficiaries were often encouraged to study as a way to get off the benefit, but they could be left with a loan for a qualification in a field that did not pay well.</p>
        
            <p>It was possible to apply to have student loan repayments put on hold on hardship grounds, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Fincap senior policy adviser Jake Lilley said there should be a mechanism for people collecting debt to look at the wider picture of what was being achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"To take a step back and say 'hang on a minute what are we trying to achieve here overall?' We want this person to be able to live a comfortable life and not having flow-on problems from poverty that arises when you can't afford things and you end up with a bad outcome that has a cost attachment with that, [like] hospitalisation ... if Studylink debt leads to someone not turning on the heater if they need it."</p>
        
            <p>At present, people are required to make payments of 12 percent of every dollar earned over $24,128 a year. A single person living alone would receive a pension of just over $31,500 a year.</p>
        
            <p>Government data showed at 30 June 2023, there were 21,710 student loan borrowers aged 65 and over. Of those, just under 16,600 were New Zealand-based.</p>
        
            <p>Sarah said she was concerned about the prospect of having a loan stretching into the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Previously I treated it like a tax that I'd just have. Now I'd like to have the money instead but if I want a better career option, I need to do it."</p>
