            <p>A Manurewa resident says the neighbourhood is "in shock" after waking up to a crime scene where two men were found seriously injured inside a car.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police have set up a cordon on Addington Avenue after the two men were found and taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic specialists have been examining a green sedan that appeared to have crashed into a van parked on the street.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Charlton Leo said the area was normally very quiet.</p>
        
            <p>"This is quite unusual ... no one comes here, it's fairly quiet at night.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone's in shock, really."</p>
        
            <p>He had returned home last night after watching the fireworks in town and went to bed.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw some flashing lights around about 3am, we didn't think anything of it. We just thought maybe [it was] the police catching some drunk.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we woke up this morning to see everything outside, the street blocked ... we didn't really know anything."</p>
        
            <p>Leo said he did not notice anything out of the ordinary last night.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a few people lighting flares ... people just having fun. We didn't think anything of it, and went to bed."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking people to avoid the area but said there was no immediate risk to public safety.</p>
