        <h2>Tornado-like winds wreck Oamaru planes</h2>
        <p>
The planes were secured to the ground using concrete poles and strong ropes but were still flipped over by the wind.

            <p>Severe winds flipped and destroyed three tied-down planes at the New Zealand Airline Academy (NZAA) in North Otago.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot training school - based at the Oamaru Airport - may have to "write off" the three aircraft after they were badly damaged in a sudden wind change.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, from about 7.30pm, a strong southerly wind change buffeted the Oamaru area.</p>
        
            <p>Academy chief executive Jonathan Manuel said the resulting "sudden gusts of winds, like a tornado" had flipped three of the flying school's planes over.</p>
        
            <p>"They were near the hangar ... they were tied down."</p>
        
            <p>He said the planes were secured to the ground using concrete poles and strong ropes.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the mountings were completely ripped out of the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"It bent the wing of the plane and tossed it around and flipped them over - the damage was very severe. Three planes are a total write-off," Manuel said.</p>
        
            <p>That brings the academy's plane loss to four in a year.</p>
        
            <p>It lost another plane due to severe weather in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>Manuel said the Kiwi-owned academy now had a fleet of 25 planes, with only one hangar that could accommodate 12 planes at a time.</p>
        
            <p>Because of that, the remaining planes have to be parked outside.</p>
        
            <p>The business' website lists 18 Tecnam single-engine aircraft, believed to be the planes damaged.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had been lengthy discussions with the Waitaki District Council over available land at the airport, which was currently "fenced off", where the academy hoped to build another hangar.</p>
        
            <p>The North Otago Aeroclub yesterday confirmed it had not been affected as it stores its aircraft in a hanger.</p>
