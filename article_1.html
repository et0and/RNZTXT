            <p>Some Kiwis are paying nearly $3000 a year to insure their Toyota Aqua cars, with one insurer denying cover unless the vehicle has an immobiliser.</p>
        
            <p>The high price was because the Toyota Aqua is the most stolen car in the country, according to data provided to RNZ by three insurance companies.</p>
        
            <p>Cove Insurance says it is simply too much of a risk without an immobiliser.</p>
        
            <p>"That level of risk doesn't work for anyone - the customer having the car stolen, us as Cove or our other customers paying higher premiums to cover it.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted a solution that would allow people to keep their cover in place at a reasonable price and an immobiliser solves the issue by dramatically reducing the risk."</p>
        
            <p>But that was not enough to put off drivers from buying these fuel efficient cars.</p>
        
            <p>For 22-year-old software engineer Kian Jazayeri, buying a Toyota Aqua as his first car was a no-brainer.</p>
        
            <p>"In Christchurch it's very flat, so it's basically the best place for the car and just one of the fuel savings that comes from it.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm only filling up fuel like $80 per month or even like $80 per month-and-a-half really."</p>
        
            <p>He bought it second hand for $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>But what he saved in fuel, he paid for in his insurance premium</p>
        
            <p>"I'm paying around $250 per month for comprehensive and theft [insurance]"</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still wondering whether I should go with third party instead, just to save that money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the data was not enough to deter Tracy and her husband from Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>They bought a second hand Aqua in 2022 for $12,000, and liked it so much they decided to get another one for the same price.</p>
        
            <p>But this time the couple were in for a surprise.</p>
        
            <p>"The original one was a key start, the second one was push start."</p>
        
            <p>When she contacted her insurance company about the new car, she was quoted a premium was a lot higher than she paid on her original Aqua.</p>
        
            <p>"So then I asked them how much will my insurance be on the older car when I renew it, and it skyrocketed as well."</p>
        
            <p>During the time they owned their first Aqua, the model had climbed the ranks of New Zealand's most stolen vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>AA Insurance head of motor claims Beau Paparoa said the high number of claims involving Aquas affected the owners' premiums.</p>
        
            <p>He said while AA insurance encouraged their customers to install security features such as immobilisers, that would not reduce the premium.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely that is one of many factors that will be built into considering what premiums we charge.</p>
        
            <p>"Our premiums are calculated across a number of other factors as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We take a really close look at what the full cost of claims are and we want to make sure that we're collecting enough money to be able to pay for those claims."</p>
        
            <p>AMI Insurance data also showed the Toyota Aqua had been the most stolen car for two years running.</p>
        
            <p>Favio Nazareno and his girlfriend bought their Aqua in 2023. Within 12 months, their insurance premium went up by nearly 25 per cent from $946 to $1180.</p>
        
            <p>The insurance company told them the increase was influenced by a range of factors - including location, type of car, number and types of claims.</p>
        
            <p>Nazareno said those factors had not changed in the year he owned the car.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing changed, no accidents.</p>
        
            <p>"We both are drivers with full driver licence, we both are more than 30 years old and we didn't change our location."</p>
        
            <p>But Paparoa said despite the theft data, the Toyota Aqua was a good buy.</p>
        
            <p>"They're a pretty cool car actually, economical and the right price range for a lot of people."</p>
