            <p>Residents and workers in Auckland's Ponsonby are feeling uneasy as the man involved in a fatal shooting remains at large.</p>
        
            <p>The man who was gunned down after he and a group of friends got out of a car in Ponsonby Road had not been approaching the shooter, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry told Checkpoint it appeared the victim just happened to be on the street on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched and a hunt is under way for the man police believe is responsible for the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>The motivation for the shooting was yet unknown, police said.</p>
        
            <p>
Police are now hunting a person who they say is extremely dangerous and that members of the public should not approach him.

            <p>Leonie Hynds, who has lived in Ponsonby for 30 years, said the fatal shooting was disturbing news for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"These sort of things seem to be happening more and more around New Zealand, particularly Auckland. The worrying part is the guns."</p>
        
            <p>She said she walked down Ponsonby Road most mornings and hoped the man involved was found.</p>
        
            <p>A worker in the area, who wished to stay anonymous, said crime and tension had been ramping up in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not great coming to work and seeing armed police with big machine guns standing down Ponsonby Road, not far from where you are working. It's definitely a bit of an uneasy feeling especially when you just work in a shop."</p>
        
            <p>A blessing took place at the scene, where a man was seen sprinkling water on the ground and speaking, as others watched on.</p>
        
            <p>A woman and a young boy were seen entering the cordoned-off area. They were seen hugging those giving the blessing.</p>
        
            <p>The section of Ponsonby Road, between Richmond Road and Franklin has now reopened. Police are continuing to patrol the area.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency staff have been investigating the ceiling above the scene of the shooting.</p>
