            <p>Glenfield College principal Paul McKinley has died, and the school will be open to support students on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The school, on Auckland's North Shore, put out a notice to parents on Sunday advising them that it would not run on the usual timetable on Monday, 26 February.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be open for students who wish to come into the school for support and guidance. The school will have a counselling team and year level deans available."</p>
        
            <p>It said students who needed to be onsite would be cared for.</p>
        
            <p>"Our love and thoughts are with Paul's family at this very sad time," board of trustees presiding member Donna Kahaki said.</p>
