            <p>Senior doctors have settled their pay dispute with Te Whatu Ora after months of strikes and industrial action.</p>
        
            <p>Their union, the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS), said doctors had received an average pay rise of just over 5.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year the doctors had their first ever nationwide strike, frustrated that they were effectively having their pay cut because it was not keeping up with inflation.</p>
        
            <p>Further strike action planned for October was cancelled after the parties agreed to facilitated bargaining by the Employment Relations Authority (ERA).</p>
        
            <p>The union last month told members it had agreed on a settlement and indicative ballot of members over the proposed terms of settlement was to be held.</p>
        
            <p>The ASMS has thanked New Zealanders for their patience, saying they had had to fight tooth and nail just to stop sliding backwards.</p>
