            <p>MetService has issued several watches and one orange heavy rain warning for extensive parts of the country this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It is predicting a a weekend of wet and windy weather for many.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday is expected to get wetter as the day goes on for the North Island as a weather system connected to a low pressure system in the Tasman Sea approaches.</p>
        
            <p>Showers are expected to turn into more steady rain from Saturday afternoon in Auckland, meaning rugby fans will need parkas and brollies as they head to Eden Park for the second test against the Pumas.</p>

            <p>After a brief reprieve early Sunday morning, another pulse of rain is expected to sweep across the North Island, with rain extending to parts of the South Island as well.</p>
        
            <p>From Sunday afternoon and into Monday, colder, showery southwesterlies bring the possibility of snowfall to inland areas of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said: "This is an early heads up to farmers with young stock, as well as road users who might be travelling along some of those elevated roads and mountain passes.</p>
        
            <p>"Into next week, however, there is a chance the snow could go down to lower levels for places like Southland and Otago."</p>
        
            <p>While the South Island will experience cold temperatures by the end of the weekend, the east of the North Island will see a period of warmer-than-average temperatures, ranging from 17 to 21°C.</p>
