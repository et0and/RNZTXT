            <p>The Silver Ferns have consigned Australia to their eighth straight loss on New Zealand soil and continue to defy expectations by taking a two-nil lead in the Constellation Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand backed up their outstanding first Test win, by beating the world champions 63-52 in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Just last week the Silver Ferns dropped from second to third in the world rankings after losing a recent series to England but they look like a different side.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua started with the same line-up that delivered a 14-goal win in Test one.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't take long before goal keep Kelly Jackson started having an impact as she used her long reach to put off the rhythm of the Australian shooters.</p>
        
            <p>Kimiora Poi, who has been a revelation at wing attack, fired some spectacular balls into shooter Grace Nweke and the Silver Ferns won the first quarter 17-11.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian defenders struggled to come up with a game plan to negate Nweke.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the court Jackson, goal defence Karin Burger, and Kate Heffernan at wing defence continued what they started in Test one, stemming the flow of the Australian attacking end.</p>
        
            <p>Diamonds captain Liz Watson was benched after the first quarter, and Australian coach Stacey Marinkovich made several changes throughout.</p>

            <p>Claire O'Brien came on for Poi late in the second quarter and pulled off an intercept, which was converted just before half-time and New Zealand led 33-23 at the main break.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns struggled at times to score off balls that they won on defence and Poi came back on at wing attack late in the third quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Australia won the third term by one goal but the Silver Ferns still had a nine-goal lead going into the final spell.</p>
        
            <p>The Diamonds just couldn't gain any real ascendancy and the Silver Ferns won the final quarter by two goals.</p>
        
            <p>Nweke scored 47 goals at 92 percent accuracy and captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio supported her beautifully with 16 goals.</p>
        
            <p>Parris Mason got her first taste of what it's like to play the world number one side, when she came on with eight minutes left.</p>
        
            <p>The four-test series now heads to Australia with Test three in Perth on Sunday.</p>
