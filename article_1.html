            <p>Australian troops were seriously injured Saturday in a major road crash while responding to ex-Cyclone Alfred, which has battered a swathe of the eastern coast and cut power to more than 330,000 properties.</p>
        
            <p>The former tropical cyclone - now downgraded to a tropical depression - made landfall in the late evening over Bribie Island on the Queensland coastline after lingering for days offshore.</p>
        
            <p>The weather system has whipped up gale-force winds that toppled trees, brought down power lines, and damaged buildings.</p>
        
            <p>And it is still creating heavy rainfall, swelling rivers in parts of a 400-kilometre stretch of the coast straddling southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales, government forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>Near the flood-prone New South Wales city of Lismore, two Australian Defence Force (ADF) trucks deployed to help the community were involved in a crash, resulting in 36 injuries - some serious, government officials and emergency services said.</p>
        
            <p>Patients were transported to four hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now our focus is on the welfare of those involved and their families," Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ADF heroes were on their way to help Australians in need," he said in a joint statement with the defence minister.</p>
        
            <p>A 61-year-old man's body was found earlier in the day after his four-wheel drive pick-up truck was swept off a bridge into a river in northern New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>He had clambered out of the vehicle and tried in vain to cling to a tree branch in the river before disappearing into the rapid waters on Friday, police said.</p>

            <p>The prime minister warned people not to underestimate the threat posed by the wild weather.</p>
        
            <p>"While it has been downgraded, very serious risks remain so it is important that people do not take this downgrading as a reason for complacency," Albanese said.</p>
        
            <p>Utility companies said 295,000 properties in southeast Queensland and another 42,600 in New South Wales were without power, warning that floods could hamper repairs.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the largest ever loss of power from a natural disaster in Queensland's history," said the state's premier, David Crisafulli, estimating that about 750,000 people had been impacted since the blackouts began.</p>
        
            <p>Although the weather system "stalled and began weakening", the bureau of meteorology warned that intense rain and damaging wind gusts were a risk throughout the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"Rivers are already starting to respond to the heavy rainfall, with many Minor to Major Flood Warnings current," the bureau said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuation orders had been issued for thousands of people in New South Wales, where 30 flood rescues have been carried out over the past 24 hours, emergency services said.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference the emergency was not over.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not over for the following reasons: The rivers are full. The rain is continuing and expected to keep falling in the days ahead. And wind conditions are very high and extreme," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Paramedic Ginny Burke, 30, said she was at work when the wind uprooted a large gum tree that smashed through the house she is renting in Elanora on the Gold Coast in Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>Burke told AFP she returned to her crushed home, where her sister recounted that she had heard the tree fall on Friday evening but described the calamity as "really unexciting".</p>
        
            <p>"What can you do?" the paramedic asked. "It's just stuff. Everyone's safe."</p>
