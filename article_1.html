        <h2>Spaced out: Your best New Zealand comet images</h2>
        <p>
Star snappers have been going wild this weekend capturing a visitor to our skies. Here's some of their best. Audio

Comet A3 up close on 19 October from Wellington, before it set behind the Skyline. Although the clouds came quick, I managed a fast capture within a clear window just above the horizon, between 7 and 3 degrees.

            <p>Look, up in the sky! If you're quick, and can avoid Aotearoa's omnipresent cloud cover, you might see a fiery interstellar visitor this evening.</p>
        
            <p>The arrival of Comet C-2023 A3 over New Zealand skies has had stargazers grabbing their gear to capture the rare sight.</p>
        
            <p>It's been the event of the weekend for astrophotographers like Rohit Vg, who told RNZ on Saturday that it was a "very memorable experience to photograph a visitor from outer space that only comes around every 80,000 years!"</p>
        
            <p>Comet C/2023 A3 is about 85 million kilometres away and only comes along once in a human lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>It has not been seen in New Zealand skies for 80,000 years.</p>
        
            <p>Stardome astronomer Josh Aoraki told RNZ the comet would soon start to dim as it leaves the solar system.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be up to a week, maybe even two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"The problem with the comet at the moment is because it's leaving the solar system it's moving away from the sun, so it's losing its brightness.</p>
        
            <p>"The later you leave it the dimmer it's going to get and eventually it'll just fade out of view."</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki said the comet was best seen by looking to the western horizon, just below the brightest star and to the right, between 8pm and 9pm.</p>
