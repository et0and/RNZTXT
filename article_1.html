            <p>MetService is warning those on the West Coast of the South Island and Mt Taranaki to expect downpours.</p>
        
            <p>There is a heavy rain warning to 3pm Sunday for Fiordland about and north of George Sound, and Westland about and south of Haast, with a further 50mm-70mm of rain expected. Rain will clear from the south by the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Residents and visitors are warned that heavy rain may cause streams and rivers to rise rapidly. Surface flooding and slips are also possible.</p>
        
            <p>Up the coast, a period of heavy rain is predicted to 8pm today for the ranges of Westland between Haast and ÅŒtira.</p>

            <p>There is a heavy rain watch in place, too, for the headwaters of the Otago lakes and rivers to 2pm today. Rainfall may approach warning criteria.</p>
        
            <p>And in the Canterbury high country, MetService was advising that northwest winds may approach severe gales in exposed places to midnight tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, there is a heavy rain watch in place for Taranaki, about and north of the mountain, from 2am to 2pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The forecast is for periods of heavy rain, and amounts may approach warning criteria.</p>
        
            <p>For the rest of the country, MetService said a front will move slowly northwards onto the southern and central North Island during Monday, while an increasingly humid northerly flow affects northern New Zealand. A low originating in the subtropics should also move into the area west of the upper North Island.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday some parts of the country were warmer than the tropics, as temperatures skyrocketed above 30 degrees in many places.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Tuporo Marsters said that Hanmer Springs in Canterbury took the top spot at 34C.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin, Blenheim and Oxford also reached 31C, and heat alerts were in place for many places across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Marsters said a warm northwesterly flow of air coming around from the tropics drove temperatures up.</p>
