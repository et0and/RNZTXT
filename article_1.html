            <p>A victim Support worker joked about hitting his children during a talk at Destiny Church.</p>
        
            <p>The worker was filmed making the comments at a Sunday gathering in late February.</p>
        
            <p>In the video, he tells the congregation, who can be heard laughing on the recording, about smacking his kids.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of you have heard my story. I had a cane, I had a long cane. When the law says don't smack your kids well, I broke the law.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a cane. Bend over, whack! The other son comes. Bend over, bend over, stop lifting your head, whack!"</p>
        
            <p>He then goes on to joke about smacking one of his children more for resisting punishment.</p>
        
            <p>"Okay, you're going to get another one. Up and down, whack! Whack! You got three, son, because you kept going up and down. You're like a yo-yo!"</p>
        
            <p>Independent victim advocate Ruth Money said the video was "absolutely shocking".</p>
        
            <p>"It's an elder of Destiny Church bragging about harming his children. It's illegal to hit your children," Money said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it would be bad enough if the person concerned was a volunteer liaising with vulnerable people, but for a person working in an organisation that is supposed to helping the vulnerable it was "absolutely disgusting".</p>
        
            <p>When approached by RNZ, Victim Support said it was recently made aware of the video and had "immediately taken steps to commence an investigation into the matter".</p>
        
            <p>"Victim Support does not condone the statements in the video," chief executive James McCulloch said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We strive to support and empower victims, including victims of physical violence, and it is essential that all our team uphold our values."</p>
        
            <p>Money said it was hoped an independent investigation, its findings still secret, two years ago had improved systems at the taxpayer-funded charity.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been down this path before with Victim Support for many years. Victims and the staff at Victim Support deserve a lot better than 'we've immediately taken steps to think about doing something'.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that natural justice needs to prevail, however, I would hope that an inquiry happens immediately. That would have been the only appropriate response."</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Church has been approached for comment.</p>
