            <p>A driver has died and their two passengers have been badly injured in a crash after initially fleeing police.</p>
        
            <p>Acting central district commander Inspector Clifford Brown said a stolen ute, wanted in connection to a robbery in ÅŒtaki on Friday evening, was signalled to stop just south of Levin shortly after 10.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police pursued the ute but abandoned the chase "within several minutes" due to the manner of driving.</p>
        
            <p>The ute continued heading south "at speed" on State Highway 1, and about 10.50pm was spotted turning back onto the highway from Waikanae, heading north in the southbound lane.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen minutes later, the ute collided head-on with another vehicle, just south of Lawlors Road.</p>
        
            <p>The ute's driver was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The two other occupants of the crash were seriously and critically injured, while the four occupants of the other vehicle were moderately and seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>The man in critical condition remained in Wellington Hospital on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the serious crash unit attended and the incident would be "fully investigated".</p>
        
            <p>Police had also referred the matter to the Independent Police Conduct Authority, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"An outcome like this is never something police wants, and our thoughts are with those in the other vehicle who were needlessly injured."</p>
        
            <p>Potential charges against those in the ute would be considered "in due course", he said.</p>
