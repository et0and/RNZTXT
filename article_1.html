            <p>Rotorua Girls' High School student Casey Paul has had a perfect attendance record since her first day of school at age five - even turning down a family trip to Hawaii to stay in class.</p>
        
            <p>She is determined to keep her record going in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Paul said she did not know how she had managed to achieve such solid attendance saying "it just happened".</p>
        
            <p>She said in her first year at primary school she discovered there was a ceremony to recognise children's school attendance that was run by then-mayor Steve Chadwick and she was inspired to get one of the certificates that was given out there.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a 100 percent attendance ceremony so [for] anyone that hadn't had a day off in that entire year."</p>
        
            <p>Paul said at times she had been ill, but never on a school day.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been sick but surprisingly have only been sick in the holidays or in the weekend."</p>
        
            <p>Paul said she has only had Covid-19 once but it was during the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Paul turned down a family holiday to Hawaii so as not to ruin her perfect attendance record.</p>
        
            <p>She said she tried to convince her family to go anyway "but they didn't want to leave me behind".</p>
        
            <p>Asked why she was so keen never to miss a day of school, Paul said mainly it was because she did not want to fall behind in her classes.</p>
        
            <p>It is Paul's final year of school this year and she said she hoped to go on to do a Bachelor of Health Science majoring in paramedicine to become a paramedic.</p>
        
            <p>Paul was already a St John youth cadet saying she did it one night a week and you could earn badges, go to camps and "there's a lot of different opportunities within it".</p>
        
            <p>"The reason that I wanted to become a paramedic is because I love being able to help people when and where I can."</p>
        
            <p>Providing an incentive helped children to want to attend school, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My school, that's Rotorua Girls' High School, offers a lunch for, I think it's anyone above 85 percent attendance each term and it is a free lunch kind of thing from Pita Pit, like the school will buy a range of food from Pita Pit and we go into the staff room and have lunch as like a celebratory thing to try and drive kids to be able to reach the 85 percent attendance mark."</p>
