            <p>The search for a small boat missing off the Northland coast and thought to be involved in a major drug smuggling operation is on hold until new information comes to light.</p>
        
            <p>The boat's last known location was about 50 nautical miles off the Bay of Islands, with police saying on Wednesday they had serious concerns for its crew and the Air Force was helping with the search.</p>
        
            <p>The boat is thought to have run into difficulties while trying to bring in 700 kilograms of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesman said there was no search currently underway, but any new information would continue to be assessed.</p>
        
            <p>Police said earlier that two shore parties had tried unsuccessfully to rendezvous with the boat.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand, which operates the Rescue Coordination Centre, and the Defence Force both referred all enquiries to the police.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not comment on the type of vessel that was missing but it had been previously reported to be a 3.5-metre skiff with two people on board.</p>
        
            <p>Police did say, however, their investigation into trans-national drug smugglers, called Operation Fantail, had so far led to 10 people being arrested in Northland and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>They had been charged with conspiracy to import a class A drug and participating in a criminal organised group.</p>
        
            <p>All 10 had appeared in court with nine remanded in custody and one granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>Police had seized about $130,000 in cash, two rifles, four handheld GPS units, two satellite phones, a small quantity of class C drugs and cellphones during the investigation.</p>
