            <p>US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been told he will not be Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's running mate, sources told Reuters on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Advisers for Trump, who is expected to formally announce his vice presidential pick later on Monday (Tuesday NZT), had viewed Rubio's residency in Florida as a drawback.</p>
        
            <p>The US Constitution bans the electors who formally select the president and vice president from voting for both from their home state - and both Trump and Rubio call Florida home.</p>
