            <p>Consumer price inflation has slowed to its lowest level in three and a half years.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said the annual inflation rate for the September quarter was 2.2 percent - falling to the Reserve Bank's 1 to 3 percent target band for the first time since March 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The annual rate was 3.3 percent in the June quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent in the September quarter on the back of higher rates, food and rents, which offset cheaper fuel, and childcare costs, Stats NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>The reimposition of prescription charges lifted medical costs, but the Family Boost scheme drove the fall in education charges.</p>
        
            <p>Local body rates rose more than 12 percent, the highest since 1990.</p>
        
            <p>With inflation falling back in the 1-3 percent target zone, economists expected the Reserve Bank to continue slashing rates, with another 50 basis point cut expected next month.</p>
