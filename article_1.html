        <h2>Live: Communities still isolated, large slips and water supply limited</h2>
        <p>
The Transport Agency still has numerous road warnings around Otago and Southland. Follow RNZ's blog for the latest weather updates.

            <p>Emergency response teams in Otago say floodwaters in the city are receding.</p>
        
            <p>Light drizzle is continuing to linger but roads and streets are beginning to drain after the deluge which brought Dunedin's wettest day in a century.</p>
        
            <p>Some roads and highways are still affected and NZTA is aiming to have State Highway 1 north of Dunedin re-opened by this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are working to remove 300 cubic metres of rock from a slip south of Waikouaiti and there are many smaller slips on the highway's shoulders.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Civil Defence group controller Matt Alley says teams are also still working to provide support to communities, restore roading and support people who have had to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>He says it's too early to say how many homes and businesses have been affected, or the cost of damage.</p>
