            <p>Healthcare workers walk off the job again today as the nurses union's dispute with Health NZ (HNZ) over pay and resourcing continues.</p>
        
            <p>The impact of strike action is also in contention with each side claiming victory from a recent nationwide walkoff, where tens of thousands of union members protested against what they say is low pay and inadequate staffing.</p>
        
            <p>The series of rolling strikes begin on Tuesday in Auckland, and will target a different region each day through until 19 December, with nurses walking off for a four-hour window from 1pm-5pm.</p>
        
            <p>The Nurses Organisation (NZNO) said nurses, midwives, and healthcare assistants were planning to be on the picket line, with the strike window - which falls across a shift changeover - deliberately chosen to have maximum impact on services, while reducing the impact on individual nurses.</p>
        
            <p>The rolling strikes follow a nation-wide strike on 3 December that saw 36,000 union members walk off the job for eight hours.</p>
        
            <p>Nurses Organisation (NZNO) chief executive Paul Goulter said anecdotal evidence suggested last week's walk-off caused a good deal of disruption.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly did have an impact on Te Whatu Ora and that will continue with the rolling strikes."</p>
        
            <p>But HNZ northern region deputy chief executive Mark Shepherd said the 3 December strike acted as a dry run for contingency planning and had left the organisation feeling confident patients would experience little disruption from the rolling strikes.</p>
        
            <p>He said last week's strike gave the agency valuable information about its capacity to cope.</p>
        
            <p>"That feedback was built into our ongoing contingency plans so we feel very prepared... for the rolling strikes that are affecting different hospitals and districts."</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd said patients should attend appointments on strike days unless they hear otherwise.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ said it could not provide data on rescheduled procedures or clinic closures caused by the strikes until after the entire strike action had ended.</p>
        
            <p>Goulter said while he was hopeful, he was not confident mediation scheduled this week would be fruitful - and said part of the battle was to get the health agency to agree to a minimum number of nurses on wards.</p>
        
            <p>He said his members did not trust that Health NZ's revamped staffing system will be safe enough for patients on hospital wards.</p>
        
            <p>"[We're] pressing hard for what we call nurse-patient ratio in order to create at least a minimum enforceable floor that Te Whatu Ora as the employer, is held to meet.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll do our best to try and negotiate this problem out, but I have to say the parties are a long way apart."</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd said the health agency's staffing system - called Care Capacity Demand Management - was being improved and would be reintroduced in the new year either in January or February.</p>
        
            <p>He said being in the room together to negotiate was important, and Health NZ was committed to a settlement, however it would have to reflect the "ongoing reset of Health NZ" to get back to budget.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Brooke van Velden introduced a bill yesterday that would allow employers to deduct pay for partial strike action.</p>
        
            <p>Council of Trade Union chief economist Craig Renney said the nurses rolling strike action amounted to a complete withdrawal of labour - not partial - and therefore would not be targeted by such legislation.</p>
