            <p>Smith & Caughey's has announced it is in talks to shuts its central Auckland and online stores, likely in early next year.</p>
        
            <p>The department store, which has been in business for about 144 years, said its proposal would be under consultation with staff for about five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>It is considering feedback from staff as well as any other avenues to potentially continue.</p>
        
            <p>Smith & Caughey's chairperson Tony Caughey said it was a "deeply emotional" time for customers, suppliers and staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Since its founding by Marianne Smith, nee Caughey, in 1880, Smith & Caughey's has focused on serving the people of Auckland, whilst preserving the traditions cherished by generations of discerning shoppers.</p>
        
            <p>"However, over the last five years we have experienced a 40 percent decline in revenue from our physical stores from factors largely outside our control.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, the company is trading at a significant loss which is unsustainable. Sadly, we do not believe sales can be restored to levels necessary to continue to operate."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
