            <p>It’s the biggest day of the year for record stores throughout the country, with music lovers out in force.</p>
        
            <p>Record Store Day has been held annually since 2007 to celebrate independent record stores and the music they sell.</p>
        
            <p>Many artists release special records to mark the day.</p>

            <p>At Real Groovy in Auckland, there was a magic show, face painting and a street party, while at Flying Out Records, local musicians including Luka Buda, Ebony Lamb and Thee Golden Geese performed in-store all day.</p>
        
            <p>At Aotearoa's longest-running independent record store, Slow Boat Records in Wellington, a queue started forming at 3.15am.</p>
        
            <p>Co-owner Jeremy Taylor told Music 101 that Record Store Day was "actually bigger than Christmas now".</p>

            <p>In 2023, Taylor Swift's Folklore: The Long Pond Sessions was the hot item. This year, it was Olivia Rodrigo's cover of Noah Kahan's 'Stick Season' on 7-inch vinyl, he said.</p>
        
            <p>People were also excited about new Pearl Jam and Beyoncé releases, as well as Atomic City, a U2 album recorded live at The Sphere in Las Vegas.</p>
        
            <p>Some shoppers were inevitably disappointed as there was only limited stock of each album, but vinyl released for Record Store Day often had a more general release later, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Another reissue of that great record is probably not too far away."</p>

            <p>Overall, the day had a "really nice vibe", and shoppers were there to "celebrate music and community", Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>"Record shopping's occupied a very dear place in my heart throughout my life and made a lot of good friends through record stores in one way or another, and it's great to see that tradition continuing, despite everything."</p>
