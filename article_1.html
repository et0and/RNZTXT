            <p>New Plymouth's mayor admits he is nursing a broken wrist and a "fat lip" after crashing off a bike at a community event on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Neil Holdom was in attendance of the opening of a new skatepark at Otupaiia Marine Park in Waitara earlier in the day.</p>
        
            <p>The community leader said he was riding his single speed bike around the park before "catching a rail" then face planting.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, Holdom said he sustained a broken wrist and a fat lip.</p>
        
            <p>"Stoked to see Waitara's new skatepark officially opened today at Otupaia Marine Park," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unstoked to catch a rail when riding my single speed around the park, face planting, copping a fat lip and busting my wrist in the progress.</p>
        
            <p>"Note to self - skateparks and washed up downhill mountain bikers are not an ideal mix."</p>

            <p>Despite his injuries, Holdom appeared to be philosophical about the episode, in what resulted in his 12th broken bone,</p>
        
            <p>"Shit happens."</p>
        
            <p>He shared an x-ray of his broken wrist to Facebook, whilst paying tribute to the local GP clinic for patching him up so "quickly and professionally".</p>
        
            <p>"Pain is simply [weakness] leaving the body," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Love this place, roll on 2025."</p>
