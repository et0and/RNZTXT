        <h2>Extremely rare whale washes ashore in Otago</h2>
        <p>
The beaked specimen found near Taieri Mouth is thought to be a spade-toothed whale.

            <p>A type of beaked whale species has washed ashore in Otago - and it is so scarcely seen, scientists say it could take weeks to confirm its DNA.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation said its staff were told a whale about five metres long had washed ashore near Taieri Mouth on 4 July.</p>
        
            <p>After inspection and consultation with marine mammal experts from DOC and Te Papa, it was believed the creature was a male spade-toothed whale.</p>
        
            <p>Coastal Otago operations manager Gabe Davies said if confirmed, it was a very significant scientific find.</p>
        
            <p>"Spade-toothed whales are one of the most poorly known large mammalian species of modern times.</p>
        
            <p>"Since the 1800s, only six samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The species was first described in 1874 from just a lower jaw and two teeth collected from Pitt Island, Rēkohu (Chatham Islands), Davies said.</p>
        
            <p>That sample, along with skeletal remains of two other specimens found on Whakaari/White Island and Robinson Crusoe Island, west of Chile, had enabled scientists to confirm a new species.</p>
        
            <p>Two more recent findings, in Bay of Plenty and north of Gisborne, helped describe the colour pattern of the species for the first time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A specimen this fresh offered the first-ever opportunity for a spade-toothed whale to be dissected, Davies said.</p>
        
            <p>Genetic samples had been sent to the University of Auckland to curators at the New Zealand Cetacean Tissue Archive.</p>
        
            <p>It may take several weeks or months for the DNA to be processed and a final species identity to be confirmed, Davies said.</p>
        
            <p>"The rarity of the whale means conversations around what to do next will take more time because it is a conversation of international importance," he said.</p>
        
            <p>DOC had been working in partnership with Te Rūnanga ō Ōtākou from the outset on making a plan for the whale's remains.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to ensure appropriate respect for this taoka is shown through the shared journey of learning, applying mātauraka Māori as we discover more about this rare species," Te Rūnanga ō Ōtakou chair Nadia Wesley-Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>The whale had been carefully removed from the beach by local contractor Trevor King Earthmoving, local rūnaka members and Otago Museum.</p>
        
            <p>It was now being preserved in cold storage until the next steps were decided.</p>
