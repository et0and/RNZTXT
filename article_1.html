            <p>The Commerce Commission has filed criminal charges against two construction companies and two directors for alleged bid rigging of publicly-funded construction contracts in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It's the country's first-ever criminal prosecution for cartel conduct, with the criminal proceedings filed in the Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The commission said it followed an investigation into allegations the unnamed companies and their directors colluded over bids for infrastructure projects in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Commission chair John Small said the charges send a strong message to businesses that the competition watchdog would not tolerate cartel conduct.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
