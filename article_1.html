            <p>A pod of pilot whales has stranded at a beach near Māhia on the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>A video posted on a Facebook community page shows the whales thrashing in the shallows of a rocky beach and waving their tales, surrounded by white water.</p>
        
            <p>Whale conservation group Project Jonah and the Department of Conservation are mobilising a team to attempt to save the animals.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah manager Daren Grover said the team planned to assess the scene and triage the whales based on which were in most urgent need of care.</p>
        
            <p>He said the beach was isolated and this was a major stranding for an area where there were not many people nearby to help.</p>
        
            <p>But Grover said any locals wanting to help should not get in the water with the stranded whale because it could be unpredictable and dangerous.</p>
