            <p>The police armed offenders squad have surrounded a property on Tutuki Street in the Auckland suburb of Waterview and are ordering someone to come out.</p>
        
            <p>Two loud bangs were heard coming from the property, at about 4:40pm, a person at the scene said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers using a loudspeaker could be heard saying: "Come out now and show us your hands", while the Armed Offenders Squad are approaching the property behind shields from the street</p>
        
            <p>Police cordons have been set up at the incident and include Hadfield Street and Fir Street from Great North Road, while the police Eagle Helicopter was hovering above, and three ambulances were also at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>At 5.15pm, armed officers at the scene asked for residents who were standing on their driveways watching, to go back into their homes.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Police said they were trying "to engage with an occupant of an address on Tutuki Street: "While the Police operation is still ongoing, there is currently no wider risk to the public," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were widening the cordon at 4:30pm, and asking members of the public to move further down Fir Street away from Tutuki Street, as it was "not safe where you are standing anymore."</p>

            <p>Police commenting on the operation said officers were armed as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson asked members of the public to stay clear of the cordons. A small group of people unable to get home have gathered at the Fir Street cordon.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby Great North Road remained open for traffic.</p>
