            <p>National Party faithful are relishing last year's election result at their annual general meeting in Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>Cashed up delegates, who have flown in from all corners of the country, have forked out $350 a ticket for the conference.</p>
        
            <p>A rough head count has attendees at about 480 people, and ticket sales of about $168,000.</p>
        
            <p>The room stood to sing the national anthem before the crowd gave National's caucus a standing ovation as they gathered on stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our victory last year is a testament to your commitment and to your dedication so can I just say thank you, thank you, thank you for everything that you do for us," National leader Christopher Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>He lamented the former Labour government's legacy and told the meeting National was getting the country, economy and law and order back on track.</p>
        
            <p>"I've gotta say, this time last year the country was in a mess. Reckless spending, high inflation, interest rates that have gone through the roof, a wave of ram raids, violent crime and a government that frankly puts criminals first and victims last.</p>
        
            <p>"And public services that were falling apart. Schools in decline, a botched health merger and a tidal wave of Kiwis on the jobseeker benefit while businesses were crying out for workers."</p>
        
            <p>Party president Sylvia Wood encouraged members to ask like minded people in their lives, and then friends of friends, to become National Party members.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to work very hard to grow the membership base and I ask for your support, I ask for your buy in. I will drive this. I am absolutely committed to it, as is the board."</p>

            <p>National's Finance Minister Nicola Willis talked about the government's tax cuts that kicked in this week and told the crowd spending cuts were not just a Budget exercise.</p>
        
            <p>"On our watch, there may be fewer people wearing lanyards on Lambton Quay, but there are gonna be a lot more people wearing high vis and hard hats and I say bring that on."</p>
        
            <p>There was a strong police presence in and around the Due Drop Events Centre for the conference with at least half a dozen police cars and one police van parked up around the back.</p>
        
            <p>A small group of people gathered on the road outside to protest the government's response to the war in Gaza with signs and flags.</p>
        
            <p>Protester Barry Lee said the group wanted the war to be on the conference agenda, and for Prime Minister Luxon to take a stronger stand on it.</p>
        
            <p>"We want them to think about actually breaking with the United States and making a firm stand supporting the genocide case against Israel, and joining the 143 other countries, out of 190, that recognise the state of Palestine."</p>
        
            <p>Countries like New Zealand were obliged to take action, Lee said.</p>
