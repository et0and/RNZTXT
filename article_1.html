            <p>An anti-Covid lockdown protester was warned about his behaviour after posting a video online in which he spoke of a judge being "hung in the street".</p>
        
            <p>Vinny Eastwood was found guilty of intentionally failing to comply with the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act by organising and attending a protest, following a trial at the Auckland District Court in December 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Eastwood was convicted along with conspiracy theorist Billy Te Kahika.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were handed short jail sentences in March, but their lawyers immediately asked for their clients to be granted bail, pending an appeal being heard in the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Days before the appeal was to be heard, Eastwood posted a video on his Facebook page featuring him and two others talking about his court case.</p>
        
            <p>One of the others in the video thanked Eastwood and hoped he would make another appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Eastwood responded: "Next time you see me, the judge who sentenced us will have been hung in the street," before laughing.</p>
        
            <p>A woman on the video says: "Don't say that. You want this to stay up."</p>
        
            <p>Eastwood responded: "I can dream, I can dream, can't I? I'm not going to let them kill my dreams, god-damn it," before laughing.</p>
        
            <p>The woman invited him to do another interview after his appeal was heard.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a spokesman confirmed police followed up on the comments soon after the video was posted in July.</p>
        
            <p>"The individual was identified and spoken to by police, and warned about his behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Justice Neil Campbell released his appeal decision. He declined to quash Eastwood and Te Kahika's convictions but allowed the sentence appeal and discharged them.</p>
        
            <p>Eastwood did not respond to an approach for comment from Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard Eastwood has since got a job with a broadcaster in Texas which transmits a blend of comedy and conspiracy content.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff also asked the Chief District Court Judge Heemi Taumaunu if the matter had been referred to him and court security.</p>
        
            <p>His office said they would not be commenting.</p>
