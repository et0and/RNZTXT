            <p>Te Whatu Ora has paid out almost a quarter of a billion dollars owed to staff for breaches of the Holidays Act.</p>
        
            <p>It is tied up in a many-years-long project to pay back an estimated $2 billion, as well as updating two dozen outdated hospital payroll systems.</p>
        
            <p>It has so far paid $246.5 million to clear 13 years of holiday pay mistakes for 34,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>This, along with fixes to seven payroll systems, extends to current staff in three districts in Auckland, Counties Manukau and WaitematƒÅ, and to four shared health services that used to operate - Health Alliance, Health Partnerships, Health Source and Northern Region Alliance.</p>
        
            <p>The 17 districts outside Auckland will not get payouts until next year and are mostly running behind.</p>
        
            <p>Former staff also will not see any payouts until next year at the earliest.</p>
