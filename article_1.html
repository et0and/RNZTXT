            <p>Lawyers have made their opening arguments in the trial of a man accused of murdering Nigel Wilson who was attacked while he was out walking his dog in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson, 62, was found by relatives lying badly injured with multiple stab wounds at Bexley Reserve in November 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He died a week later in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Messervy, 20, is charged with his murder, and has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>In the Crown's opening address, Crown prosecutor Mitchell McClenaghan outlined how Wilson was on a routine walk with his dog in the morning when he was the victim of a brutal stabbing attack.</p>
        
            <p>"Most days he would get up early, sometime after 4.15am, and take the dog for a walk around Bexley Reserve. And that is just what he did on 14 November 2022. However, that morning Mr Wilson did not return home," McClenaghan said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson and Messervy became involved in an argument where Wilson called out Messervy for driving his vehicle at speed through the reserve, McClenaghan said.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard Wilson shut the gates at the entrance and confronted Messervy, and the defendant stabbed the 62-year-old eight times, with four blows to his abdomen.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said Messervy's associate stole Wilson's phone following the assault, leaving him unable to call for help.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson's dog returned home without him, which raised the alarm, McClenaghan said.</p>
        
            <p>His relative found him at the reserve.</p>
        
            <p>"He was hunched over the gate. He was able to utter the word 'ambulance' to her," McClenaghan said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but he was unable to recover due to the extensive blood loss he suffered.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken off life support and died the afternoon of 22 November 2022.</p>
        
            <p>McClenaghan told the jury the Crown's position was that Messervy knew that death could result from his attack, making it a "reckless killing".</p>
        
            <p>"The Crown say here the defendant through the conduct, actions, and number of stabs inflicted with the knife intended to kill Mr Wilson," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Messervy's lawyer, James Rapley KC, told the jury his client accepted it was his fault that Wilson died.</p>
        
            <p>"Bailey Messervy stabbed Mr Wilson and caused his death. His killing was shocking, senseless and should never have happened," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But he Rapley said Messervy, who was 18 at the time of the assault, never intended to kill Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>"In the heat of the moment, it never entered his mind, that if he continued to do what he was doing, there was a real risk Mr Wilson could die as a result. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt otherwise."</p>
        
            <p>The jury trial before Justice Rachel Dunningham could last up to three weeks.</p>
