            <p>A man is in a serious condition after being shot by police in Whanganui after allegedly attacking officers and a police dog.</p>
        
            <p>At around 3.55am officers who were patrolling with a police dog came across a man acting suspiciously outside an address on Talbot Street in Whanganui East.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man ran away to the rear of a property, and the officers followed him, before he then turned and charged at police staff.</p>
        
            <p>He has allegedly refused to comply with them attempting to take him into custody, and continued to assault them.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they used a series of tactical options, including sponge rounds, Taser, and OC spray, but these had no effect on the man and his behaviour kept escalating.</p>
        
            <p>The man has allegedly attacked and injured the police dog and has continued to assault our staff.</p>
        
            <p>He was subsequently shot by police and is in a serious condition undergoing surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the Armed Offenders Squad was called to assist as a precautionary measure, both at the hospital and at the Talbot Street address.</p>
        
            <p>Central District Commander Superintendent Scott Fraser said having to use a firearm was the last thing any police officer wanted to do.</p>
        
            <p>"In this instance our officers had no other option available."</p>
        
            <p>Locals in Whanganui East can expect to see an increased police presence in the area today, as a scene examination continues.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority will be notified, and a Critical Incident Investigation is underway.</p>
        
            <p>Support is being offered to the man's family, and to the officers involved.</p>
