            <p>Several Cook Strait ferry sailings have been cancelled on New Year's Eve due to large swells and rough weather.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge cancelled six services between Picton and Wellington on Tuesday; the 2am, 8.15am and 1.30pm sailings from Wellington and the 2.30am, 7.45am, and 7.15pm sailings from Picton.</p>
        
            <p>Affected customers were being contacted by the ferry service for alternate sailing options.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge's website said "storm-force southerly winds and large swells" were forecast for Cook Strait from late Monday 30 December and throughout most of New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander cancelled two morning sailings of Aratere - the 6.15am from Wellington and the 11am return from Picton.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers had been shifted to other sailings and the swells were due to slowly ease from this afternoon, it said online.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who was worried about seasickness should sit at the back of the ship and should not sail on an empty stomach, it said.</p>
