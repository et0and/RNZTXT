            <p>A water outage caused by a burst water main in central Wellington is spreading further in the city as crews battle to patch up the rupture.</p>
        
            <p>Water was covering nearly three lanes of Kent Terrace and parts of Cambridge Terrace on Wednesday morning, with drivers going to the airport warned to take an alternate roue.</p>
        
            <p>In an update Wellington Water said a shutdown of water in the area - needed to fix the pipe - had been extended to cover Courtney Place, Kent Terrace, Cambridge Terrace, Hay Street and Telford Terrace.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors were at the scene before 5am on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Commuters were warned to take care in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it was a major repair and was expected to take eight to 10 hours to fix.</p>
        
            <p>It was asking motorists heading to the city's airport to go via Oriental Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, we don't expect a shutdown to affect any properties but will provide more information as the repair progresses."</p>
