            <p>The Silver Ferns shock series win over the world champion Australians is the result of a side that's realising its full potential, says captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio.</p>
        
            <p>The Silver Ferns won the Constellation Cup for just the third time in 14 series on Sunday night, after beating Australia 61-43 in the third Test in Perth.</p>
        
            <p>It is also the first time since 2006 that the Silver Ferns have had three consecutive wins against the Diamonds.</p>
        
            <p>After stunning the world champions in the first two Tests in New Zealand by margins of 14 and 11, the Silver Ferns were expecting a tougher test on Australian soil.</p>
        
            <p>They were on a five-game losing streak across the Tasman but a brilliant second half from the Ferns saw them beat the number one ranked Diamonds by 18 goals.</p>
        
            <p>Up until last night, the Australian Diamonds had every trophy in the cabinet, including Commonwealth Games gold and the Netball World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio admitted she was a little bit stunned by what they had achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"I just can't believe it but at the same time I totally can as well ... I feel like we're reaching our potential and I'm seeing what people are capable of, and I'm seeing people be super comfortable in who they are and bringing it on court," Ekenasio said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've honestly never felt our team be so confident in the entire time I think I've played for the Silver Ferns and that's a really big shift for us."</p>
        
            <p>The skipper said harnessing a more ruthless mentality had been key for them.</p>
        
            <p>"For us to put on a different mentality is a really big shift for us and something that I think we need to be able to win to play like this. So I'm proud that the girls have been able to take it on but also I think it's a space that they feel really comfortable stepping into so for us to create that environment for them to step into is something I'm really proud of all us as a leadership team with management that we've had the courage to create."</p>
        
            <p>The captain was also thrilled with the margins they had won by, and a focus for the series had been on taking control and building momentum within games.</p>
        
            <p>Silver Ferns coach Dame Noeline Taurua said she was elated with the "beautiful netball" her side was playing and the fight they were bringing.</p>
        
            <p>"The manner that we're actually playing and the level of performance and toughness that I'm seeing out there and that want and desire to work for and with each other ... we've talked about this for many a years so to be able to see that and people demonstrate that out on court is next level," Dame Noeline said.</p>

            <p>It has been a remarkable turnaround from the Silver Ferns, who just three weeks ago were licking their wounds after losing the Taini Jamison trophy series 2-1 to England.</p>
        
            <p>In the wake of that, the Silver Ferns dropped to third in the world netball rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Ekenasio said everyone was frustrated because they were performing well in trainings but it wasn't translating into matches.</p>
        
            <p>"We just felt like we were not reaching our full potential at all, we were not even scratching that," Ekenasio said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it led to some tough conversations prior to the trans-Tasman series about what it would take for them to win.</p>
        
            <p>"It was about getting really honest with each other but really it was about how much we can have each other's backs and how much we can just back each other out there and it seems really simple but that honestly just flicked a switch for us.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been in this position where we've won three in a row against Australia …it's new spaces that we're moving into."</p>
        
            <p>With a 3-nil lead, the Silver Ferns go into the final Test in Melbourne on Wednesday in a very rare position.</p>
        
            <p>They have a chance to take a clean sweep of the series for the first time since its inception in 2010, but also test the depth of their bench.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline has used the same starting seven for the first three Tests, who have served her brilliantly but she's very aware that next year she will be without shooter Grace Nweke, who will compete in Australia's domestic competition.</p>
        
            <p>So could understudy Amelia Walmsley get some game time?</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to be very smart ... it's an opportunity to look at that depth but also four-zip is a beautiful potential thing that we've never been able to do before so getting that balance is really critical for us and something that I have to talk with the leadership group as to what we do in that respect," Dame Noeline said.</p>
        
            <p>The coach was also very complementary of Ekenasio, who has had a brilliant series at goal attack.</p>
        
            <p>"No one shoots like her and just the trajectory of that arc ... it's beautiful and not only that but her workload is beautiful."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Noeline recorded her 50th win for the Silver Ferns with last night's victory. Only Dame Lois Muir (91 wins) and Dame Ruth Aitken (87) have more wins as Silver Ferns coach.</p>
        
            <p>She now has a 10-9 winning record in head-to-head meetings with Diamonds coach Stacey Marinkovich since 2021.</p>
