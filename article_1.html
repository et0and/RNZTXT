        <p>
From the mist-covered peaks of Te Rerenga Wairua to the plumes of geothermal steam in Rotorua, here are the key moments to date.

            <p>From the mist-covered peaks of Te Rerenga Wairua to the plumes of geothermal steam in Rotorua, Hīkoi mō te Tiriti has swept through Aotearoa, growing from hundreds to thousands in just a few days.</p>
        
            <p>Echoing past protests, marchers are retracing the footsteps of rangatira like Dame Whina Cooper as they call for a future that honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>

            <p>Across the motu, tamariki have been seen in large numbers, wearing their tino rangatiratanga colours. Some sit proudly on the shoulders of their whānau, others chanting and singing as they walk.</p>
        
            <p>As said by many organisers and participants, the march is as much about the future as it is about the past - tamariki are not just participants, but the future carriers of the kaupapa.</p>

            <p>Since setting off on 11 November, tens of thousands have joined the convoy south, demonstrating their opposition to the coalition government's controversial Treaty Principles Bill and other policies impacting Māori.</p>
        
            <p>A variety of placards can be seen as the convoy marches its way along the main streets of each city.</p>
        
            <p>These signs reflect the broad range of concerns that have drawn so many to the hīkoi - from land rights and language preservation to sovereignty and self-determination.</p>

            <p>At each stage of the journey the emotional energy has been clear, with the karanga of kuia, powerful haka, waiata and chants reverberating across the whenua.</p>

            <p>As diverse crowds come together to hīkoi, participants are not only marching but celebrating kotahitanga, with kanikani and waiata at every stop.</p>
        
            <p>Free kai and water are gifted out to participants along the way to ensure they are well-hydrated for the long hīkoi ahead.</p>

            <p>As commuters pass by on their way, tino rangatiratanga flags wave proudly, and supportive car horns accompany the march.</p>
        
            <p>Tamariki can be seen throwing 'mana waves' and cheering as the convoy passes through.</p>

            <p>At every stop, the hīkoi has drawn parallels to past struggles.</p>
        
            <p>On day three of Hīkoi mō Te Tiriti, when the convoy crossed the Auckland Harbour Bridge, the sight of thousands walking in solidarity - young and old, prams and wheelchairs moving side by side - moved onlookers, many visibly emotional as they cheered and waved.</p>

            <p>A significant moment was the stop at Ihumātao, a site that has become a symbol of resistance and unity in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>The land at Ihumātao has been occupied by protesters opposed to the land being developed for years - with little progress being made.</p>

            <p>In Kirikiriroa, Hamilton, tino rangatiratanga flags could be seen stretching for miles and as the hīkoi continues south, the number of supporters swells, with crowds lining the streets and joining as it advances.</p>
        
            <p>Across the board, the wairua of those participating has been high, with cultural pride at the forefront.</p>

            <p>Despite the steady rain in Rotorua, thousands remained undeterred, marching on and gathering a hīkoi of over 10,000.</p>
        
            <p>A troupe of horses joined the hīkoi, with tamariki accompanying their whānau on horseback, gaining cheers from those watching from the streets.</p>

            <p>Māori rights activist Tāme Iti joined the march, marking another chapter in his long history of activism.</p>
        
            <p>Since the 1960s, Iti has been at the forefront of major protest movements, including opposing the Vietnam War, apartheid in South Africa, and advocating for Māori language and land rights through groups like Ngā Tamatoa.</p>
        
            <p>He played a key role in the Māori Language Movement, the Māori Renaissance and protests against the Springbok Tour in 1981.</p>

            <p>The journey for those marching is far from over with many kilometres yet to be covered.</p>
        
            <p>Hīkoi mō Te Tiriti will officially come to a close on 19 November at Waitangi Park, where thousands are expected to march to the steps of Parliament.</p>
