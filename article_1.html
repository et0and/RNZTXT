            <p>Bruce Hopkins has marked 68 years with 68 philanthrophic flips, leaping from a six-metre tower, reaching speeds of up to 40km/h at the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series in Auckland this weekend. He is raising funds for a cause that is close to his heart - Grandparents Raising Grandchildren.</p>

            <p>Border collie Molly's 'horrific injuries' have healed six weeks after her throat was 'ripped open' by two dogs that came onto her human Paul Gibbs' property in the Bay of Plenty. Molly required two surgeries and Gibbs estimates she needed at least 50 stitches. She also had daily vet visits to check the wounds.</p>

            <p>Waikaka's Royal Hotel first opened in 1872, but when it looked at risk of closing down, a group of six local farmers and contractors banded together to keep their watering hole open. The local community pub - aka the pub - now has almost 200 owners and is open again with roaring trade and a new lease on life.</p>

            <p>Dunedin dogs Jeffrey and Red are two of only three South Island LandSAR search dogs and they are often called out to scour the island's varied terrain for missing people. Their owner, Barry Dougherty, said riding a biscuit behind a boat, getting packed onto their owner's motorbike and even learning to skateboard were all part of the dogs' years of training.</p>
