            <p>The government has announced an independent review of forestry's role in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), with the Forestry Minister saying owners have complained of "excessive costs".</p>
        
            <p>Todd McClay announced the independent review on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It would begin work in March and report back by the end of April.</p>
        
            <p>It will look into whether the ETS and services relating to forestry were fit for purpose, scalable, and adaptable; whether it was on track to achieve the intended benefits; and whether it "represents cost effective delivery of a bespoke model".</p>
        
            <p>The overall ETS transformation programme, MPI's cost recovery process and fee settings, and inter-agency operations supporting the ETS were ruled out of scope.</p>
        
            <p>McClay said the review would be used to inform decisions on funding decisions, which would include the revenue model.</p>
        
            <p>"Up and down the country forestry owners have been raising concerns about the excessive costs that have been imposed upon them by the previous government," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have identified 22 fixed service fees including a $30 per hectare annual fee for participants into the forestry ETS register that forest owners are expected to pay.</p>
        
            <p>"There are more than 560,000 hectares of post-1989 forest land in the ETS and over 4,000 forestry participants. They deserve to have confidence in the system the government has set up to manage their ETS obligations."</p>
        
            <p>McClay said the review was part of a pre-election commitment to rebuild confidence in the forestry sector.</p>
        
            <p>"This review is the government's first step on halting Labour's attack on forestry through excessive costs and regulations," he said.</p>
