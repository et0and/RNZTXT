            <p>A 28-year-old man has been charged with the murder following the death of 60-year-old Maxwell Connor in Thames earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Kristine Clarke said the man was arrested in relation to an incident at a house on Rolleston St on Monday afternoon which police believe led to Connor's death.</p>
        
            <p>The man will appear in the Kaitaia District Court on Thursday facing a murder charge.</p>
        
            <p>Police said their thoughts were with Connor's family and they still wanted to hear from anyone with information on what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke said anyone who saw an "altercation" in Rolleston St about 3.40pm on Monday should call police on 105 and reference file number 250113/5723.</p>
