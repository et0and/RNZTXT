            <p>A man has been saved after spending 23.5 hours in the water at sea off Whangamatā, encountering a shark, and then using the reflection from his wristwatch to catch the attention of his rescuers.</p>
        
            <p>Whangamatā Police Sergeant Will Hamilton said the man set off on a solo fishing trip on January 2, aboard his 40-foot boat, intending to return the following day.</p>
        
            <p>Near the Alderman Islands he hooked what he suspected was a marlin, before falling overboard about 55 kilometres -- or 30 nautical miles -- off the coast of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Unable to catch the idling boat as it meandered further out of reach, the man attempted to swim to the Alderman Islands, but was dragged away by currents.</p>
        
            <p>He endured a cold night in the ocean, too exhausted to keep swimming -- but during his time in the water, a shark came to "have a sniff", before leaving him alone.</p>
        
            <p>At about 2pm on Wednesday, three fishermen on a boat near Mayor Island noticed an unusual reflection on the water.</p>
        
            <p>They discovered the fisherman in the sea, who had got their attention using the reflection of the sun on his watch.</p>
        
            <p>The trio plucked him from the water, immediately alerted Police and set course for Whangamatā Marina.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton said it was an "absolute miracle" the fisherman was alive.</p>
        
            <p>The man was hypothermic and exhausted, and received treatment from a St John ambulance crew on-shore.</p>
        
            <p>The man said he wanted to thank Mike, Tyler and James for rescuing him, along with all emergency services involved.</p>
        
            <p>The man's boat was still missing, and boaties are asked to report any sightings of empty powered vessels.</p>
