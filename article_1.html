        <h2>Govt announces funding boost for healthcare</h2>
        <p>
The Health Minister has announced an extra 100 placements for overseas-trained doctors to work in primary care, and incentives for recruitment of 400 graduate nurses a year.

            <p>The Health Minister has announced an extra 100 placements for overseas-trained doctors to work in primary care, and incentives for recruitment of 400 graduate nurses a year.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand will also be putting an extra $285 million towards general practice, but the extra funding will be linked to performance.</p>
        
            <p>A new 24-7 digital service will also be set up to allow all New Zealanders to access online medical appointments.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Simeon Brown revealed the decisions alongside Prime Minister Christopher Luxon this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Watch the media conference here:</p>
        
            <p>Brown said one of his key focuses as health minister was to ensure New Zealanders had better access to doctors and nurses at their local GP.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes no sense that overseas-trained doctors living in New Zealand are willing to work in primary care, but can't, because there aren't enough training opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"We are fixing this by building on a successful pilot in the Waikato and will support their transition into general practices that need them most.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the new digital service will give GPs and nurses the ability to also issue prescriptions or make referrals for lab tests.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a practical solution which expands access to primary care for Kiwis and will provide an additional service to ensure New Zealanders have more access to timely and quality care."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said today's announcement was the first of several designed to improve health outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>In the past week, much of the world's attention has been on the relationship between Ukraine, Europe and the US, with a number of countries looking at boosting defence spending and questioning whether the US could still be relied on for security in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon at the weekend reaffirmed New Zealand's support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Last week he was in Vietnam for political and business discussions, including the signing of a new Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement.</p>
        
            <p>At home, his coalition partners Winston Peters and David Seymour were making headlines. Seymour continued to defend the under-fire school lunch scheme, while the foreign minister had South Korea, the Cook Islands and China on his agenda.</p>
        
            <p>The four-year Parliamentary term idea has also made a comeback since Luxon's last post-Cab press conference, and Housing Minister Chris Bishop launched a new scheme to get more houses built.</p>
        
            <p>Also likely up for discussion will be calls for changes to NCEA from principals serving some of the country's poorest communities.</p>
