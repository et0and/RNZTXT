            <p>Nine homes have been red-stickered in Dunedin following the storm which battered the Otago region this week causing flooding and land slips.</p>
        
            <p>A red sticker means the house is not safe to occupy at present.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Civil Defence and Emergency Management confirmed the red-sticker notices have been issued but the location of the houses could not be confirmed at present.</p>
        
            <p>A precautionary boil water notice is also in effect for parts of the city's West Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin's residents are being warned of the risk of gastro due to floodwater and silt being contaminated with sewage.</p>
