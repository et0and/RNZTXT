            <p>The central North Island town of National Park will be renamed Waimarino - the original Māori name for the area.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Lower Hutt suburb of Petone will not have its name changed to Pito One.</p>
        
            <p>The Petone proposal was made to Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa/New Zealand Geographic Board by The Wellington Tenths Trust and the Palmerston North Māori Reserve Trust.</p>

            <p>Late last year, City Council voted to support the name change, with other iwi groups from around the region voicing support as well.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Land Information Chris Penk made the determinations on these proposals in his statutory role as final decision maker.</p>
        
            <p>It's part of a raft of place name decisions announced Wednesday by Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa New Zealand Geographic Board.</p>
        
            <p>Proposals to alter Takanini (suburb) and Takanini Railway Station to Takaanini and Takaanini Railway Station have been declined.</p>
        
            <p>But the proposal to make Te Tōangaroa the official name for an unnamed area in Auckland's CBD has been approved.</p>
        
            <p>The name refers to the dragging of waka a long way to the shoreline. The name will now be official for the area bordered by Britomart Place, Beach Road, Quay Street and State Highway 16, which contains Spark Arena, The Strand Railway Station, Te Taou Reserve, Māhuhu-ki-te-Rangi Park and several apartment buildings.</p>
        
            <p>A proposal to rename a peak on Pirongia Mountain known as The Cone has been approved, it will now be known as Pūāwhē.</p>
        
            <p>Pūāwhē is a traditional name on Pirongia Mountain and historically it referred to the mountain as a whole. The story of the name says the patupaiarehe (supernatural being or fairy-like creature) who bewitched Tāwhaitu had used a bundle "pū" of "ā" tree fern called a "whē" or caterpillars "whē".</p>
        
            <p>A new suburb of Feilding will be officially named Maewa.</p>
        
            <p>Manawatu District Council made the proposal to extend the existing locality of Maewa to include a future housing development currently referred to as Precinct 4, and to formalise it as an official suburb of Feilding.</p>
        
            <p>Maewa is an original Māori place name which Ngāti Kauwhata gifted to the council for the suburb name. It means "to meander" and describes the waterway that begins as a puna (spring) at the currently locality and flows east into Makino Stream.</p>
        
            <p>While National Park village will have its name changed the town's railway station will continue to be known as National Park Station, after its name change proposal was declined.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal to alter Manawatu District to Manawatū District has been declined.</p>
        
            <p>Same goes for Rangitikei District, where a proposal to rename to Rangitīkei District has been declined.</p>
        
            <p>A proposal to alter Abbots Creek to Abbotts Creek has been declined.</p>
        
            <p>A proposal to alter 5 Mile Creek to Herwin Creek has been declined.</p>
        
            <p>A decision on the proposal to rename Russell to Kororāreka is expected to be announced in 2025.</p>
