            <p>The government has taken the last steps to reverse Labour's blanket speed-limit reductions, by signing off a new speed limit rule.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Transport Simeon Brown said by 1 July next year, speed limits would be returned to the previous settings.</p>
        
            <p>Under the rule change, reduced variable speed limits would operate outside schools during pick-up and drop-off times, and motorists would be able to drive at up to 120km/h on Roads of National Significance.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the changes would improve traffic flows.</p>
        
            <p>"Throughout the world 50 kilometres per hour is a speed used as the right speed limit to keep urban roads flowing smoothly and safely, and our sensible approach will bring New Zealand into closer alignment with other countries that have strong, safe records on their roads such as Norway, Denmark and Japan."</p>
        
            <p>It was critical to have the right speed settings in place to boost economic growth, improve road safety and allow Kiwis to travel quickly and safely, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said reduced speed limits outside schools at pick-up and drop-off times would prioritise the safety of young Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>"By 1 July 2026, local streets outside a school will be required to have a 30km/h variable speed limit. Rural roads that are outside schools will be required to have variable speed limits of 60km/h or less."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said more than 65 percent of submitters support the plan.</p>
