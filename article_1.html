            <p>Air New Zealand is doing away with the option for passengers to buy food on its short-haul flights, instead offering everyone on board a snack or meal.</p>
        
            <p>The airline has announced changes to its short-haul flights from June.</p>
        
            <p>As part of changes to simplify the airline's different fares, everyone will have access to Air New Zealand's full entertainment suite, and be served a snack or a meal, as well as tea, coffee, water and juice.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand is also discontinuing its seat+bag fares, though will allow seat-only customers to add a checked bag for a $30 fee.</p>
        
            <p>Seat-only customers travelling to Australia and the Pacific previously received no food with their airfare, and had the option to purchase a range of snacks on board.</p>
        
            <p>That option will be discontinued under the change, but passengers will still be able to buy drinks.</p>
        
            <p>The fare types available from 11 June will be: theworks, worksflexi, premiumeconomy, premiumflexi, businesspremier and businessflexi.</p>
        
            <p>Works customers will still receive the same inclusions of a checked bag, a full meal and drinks, entertainment and free standard seat selection.</p>
        
            <p>The updates were based on customer feedback and changes passengers were looking for, the airline's statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand on Monday downgraded its full-year earnings guidance, as it faces softening domestic demand and a competitive North American travel market.</p>
        
            <p>Pre-tax earnings for the 2024 financial year were forecast to be in the range of $190 million to $230m, lower than previous guidance of $200m-$240m and a significant drop from 2023 pre-tax earnings of $585m.</p>
