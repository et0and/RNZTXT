            <p>A nine-month-old baby is among eight people who have been stabbed at a shopping centre in Sydney's east, NSW Ambulance says, with reports a number of people have been killed.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Westfield Bondi Junction, a large shopping centre in Sydney's east, about 4pm after reports of multiple people being stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>"A critical incident has commenced following the shooting of a male at Bondi Junction," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>An alleged offender has been shot and killed by police, an ambulance spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>An update from NSW Police is expected soon.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said that seven people had been stabbed and taken to a number of hospitals across Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>The baby has been taken to Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick, another victim was taken to St George Hospital and another to Royal North Shore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were taken to Darlinghurst's St Vincent's Hospital, while another two are at Royal Prince Alfred in Camperdown.</p>
        
            <p>The condition of the victims is not known but they were being treated for trauma wounds, an ambulance spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>The shopping centre said an operation was underway to evacuate shoppers.</p>
        
            <p>Aerial footage from outside the complex shows a large number of emergency vehicles and personnel.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police could also be seen conducting a search on the roof where the car park is located.</p>
        
            <p>ABC sound engineer Roi Huberman said he was inside a shop when he heard gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>"And suddenly we heard a shot or maybe two shots and we didn't know what to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then the very capable person in the store took us to the back where it can be locked.</p>
        
            <p>"She then locked the store and then she then let us through the back and now we are out."</p>
        
            <p>Shopper Adriana was with her two daughters at a beauty store when they heard gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>"All of a sudden the front doors were closed and in a matter of seconds we heard some gunshots and got sent to the storage room at the back of the shop. There were about 30 or 40 people there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone was screaming, crying, trying to call their relatives. It was an horrific experience.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of screaming and people just screaming 'Get out, get out, get out of the shopping centre'."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
