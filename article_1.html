        <h2>Farmers brace for worst conditions in 50 years</h2>
        <p>
"We're running into water issues, water tables are so low, people's wells and bores are drying up and losing water supply," Taranaki vet Stephen Hopkinson says.

            <p>Farmers around the North Island are being warned to prepare for drought conditions as the late summer dry period continues.</p>
        
            <p>In Taranaki, it's being described by some as a one-in-fifty-year event.</p>
        
            <p>Local vet Stephen Hopkinson sits on the Taranaki Rural Co-ordination Group which is working with the region's Rural Support Trust to help farmers.</p>
        
            <p>He said those in the south of the region near Hāwera and Manaia are facing "desperate conditions".</p>
        
            <p>"It's unusual for Taranaki, we get dry summers and we've had the odd minor drought declaration in the past but this would be one of the worst ones.</p>
        
            <p>"We're running into water issues, water tables are so low, people's wells and bores are drying up and losing water supply.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never had water issues before so that's compounding it this year and is another big complication."</p>
        
            <p>A series of events have been held right around Taranaki Maunga giving farmers advice on how to get through this tough time.</p>

            <p>Stephen Hopkinson said the events have been attended by more than 100 farmers as the majority of the region is now drying out.</p>
        
            <p>He said culling and drying off stock, and budgeting for feed are just some of the issues farmers are grappling with.</p>
        
            <p>The Rural Co-ordination Group expects to hear back in the next fortnight from MPI about whether a drought will be declared.</p>
        
            <p>And the Taranaki Rural Support Trust chair Amanda Jordan says farmers need to check in on each other and anyone who needs help can call the trust's 0800 number.</p>
        
            <p>In Whanganui hill country farmer Grant Adkins said the region hasn't had a dry spell for a couple of years so people are out of practice at dealing with the situation at hand.</p>
        
            <p>He's getting down to capital stock by sending store lambs away and killing cattle.</p>
        
            <p>He said some farmers won't have any supplementary feed left.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got enough feed cover to carry on for another month if I have to but there's farms out there that don't have that, and that's a worry.</p>
        
            <p>"People need to be proactive and if they're not sure, ring someone and get a second opinion but the worst thing you can do is carry on and let your livestock lose condition because then they're not saleable."</p>
        
            <p>Grant Adkins said he's keeping a close eye on the forecast because he will be extremely concerned if there is another month with no rain.</p>
        
            <p>And he's following market trends with prices so far holding up, which he says is remarkable for this time of year.</p>
        
            <p>"If there's a question should I sell or not, in my mind selling while the money's good is certainly worthwhile."</p>
        
            <p>Niwa maps of the area already show rain levels are well down on the long term average.</p>
        
            <p>Manawatū dairy farmer James Stewart says warm easterly winds have dried pastures out.</p>
        
            <p>He says feed supplies are getting short and irrigators are running.</p>
        
            <p>"Farmers will be starting to action their plans to reduce their cow numbers like cull cows as we go into the autumn.</p>
        
            <p>"I think with a higher payout we've got the ability to even purchase in supplement [feed] without too many concerns."</p>
