            <p>Auckland Transport admits its trains were under "huge demand" on Friday, when the city hosted the P!nk concert at Eden Park and the Warriors at Mt Smart.</p>

            <p>More than 40,000 P!nk fans attended the gig at the Kingsland stadium on Friday night, and some complained they were left stranded on platforms because there were not enough trains heading to Britomart in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport spokesperson Rachel Cara said it had put on additional train services to get fans to and from the concert, as well as direct buses into the CBD and North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a very high volume of people moving in a short space of time last night, putting huge demand on our train services. Auckland Transport accounted for this and had a plan to get people home as quickly and efficiently as possible."</p>
        
            <p>She said some trains did not stop because they had been boarded at an earlier station and were already full.</p>
        
            <p>There were gaps between services because track constraints meant trains could not run immediately one after the other.</p>
        
            <p>After the concert, some 16,000 passengers caught trains from Kingsland Station and 6000 from Morningside Station, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"People gradually left Eden Park after the concert and wait times at Kingsland Station were no longer than 45 minutes, which is what we had expected for an event of this scale."</p>
        
            <p>AT again has plans in place for the second concert on Saturday tonight to manage the high volume of people who will be travelling to and from Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Cara said they would be aiming to reduce wait times where possible, including putting on extra buses to the city centre.</p>
