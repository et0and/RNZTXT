            <p>Three young children have died overnight after a house fire at Lalor Park in Sydney's west in what is being treated as a domestic violence incident.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were called to the scene just before 1am.</p>
        
            <p>Police allege a 28-year-old man, who is now in custody, tried to stop police and other emergency services from rescuing the children from the burning home.</p>
        
            <p>"I can confirm during police attempts to get into the property, those efforts were frustrated by a male inside," NSW Police Acting Superintendent Jason Pietruszka said.</p>
        
            <p>The man arrested is the father of the children who died and remains under police guard being treated for smoke inhalation in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two boys, aged two and four, were treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to Westmead Hospital in a critical condition, but died a short time later.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Rescue crews extinguished the fire before the third child, believed to be a 10-month-old girl, was found dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the children have not been formally identified.</p>
        
            <p>Four other children, all aged six to 11, and a 29-year-old woman, have been taken to hospital.</p>

            <p>NSW Fire and Rescue superintendent Adam Dewberry said firefighters rushed into the burning home to search for the children.</p>
        
            <p>"When our crews arrived they were confronted by pretty chaotic scenes with a number of adults and children who had self-evacuated," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was heavy fire activity, the flames venting out through both front windows, getting up over the roof line.</p>
        
            <p>"They got in under those fire conditions, started to knock down the fire and conducted a search under very extreme conditions."</p>
        
            <p>The firefighters who found the two and four-year-olds went back into the home to search for the baby.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Dewberry said temperatures likely reached between 600 and 700 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>"They can't see … they're getting through under extreme, superheated conditions, while looking for those children," Superintendent Dewberry said.</p>
        
            <p>"The firefighters who found the two children actually went back in to conducted a search for the third child, but unfortunately they were unable to locate that child, who was located after the smoke had cleared."</p>
        
            <p>He described the scene as "confronting" for emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>"I watched a young child sitting on a young constable's lap while they were being treated by paramedics," Superintendent Dewberry said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is just a tragedy all round. Everyone deals with these things differently; we've got to make sure that we are there for our firefighters, there for each other."</p>
        
            <p>Shocked locals woke to the scene this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents Graham and Elizabeth Cocks said they are devastated by the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just terrible," Cocks said.</p>
        
            <p>"When it happens so close to home, it's happening in the suburb we have been for 20 years, just devastating to know that this sort of thing has gone on … just awful."</p>
