            <p>Former US President George W. Bush, 78, a Republican, does not plan to make an endorsement or voice how he or his wife Laura will vote in the presidential election in November, a spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"He retired from presidential politics many years ago," said the spokesman, who did not wish to be named.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement came a day after Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, announced he would cross party lines and vote for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris over Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Cheney, who served as vice president under Bush from 2001 to 2009, said on Friday that "in our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump."</p>
        
            <p>Harris said on Saturday endorsements of her by Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, a former US Representative, were "courageous" for putting country ahead of political party.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Pence, who served as Trump's vice president for four years, has said he will not endorse his former boss but has not backed Harris.</p>
