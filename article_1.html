        <h2>Watch live: Luxon hosts post-Cabinet conference</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister is facing questions after a meeting of the government's top ministers.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is set to face questions after the government's Cabinet met on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear at 4pm. We will be livestreaming the post-Cabinet press conference at the top of this page.</p>
        
            <p>In the past week, much of the world's attention has been on the relationship between Ukraine, Europe and the US, with a number of countries looking at boosting defence spending and questioning whether the US could still be relied on for security in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon at the weekend reaffirmed New Zealand's support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Last week he was in Vietnam for political and business discussions, including the signing of a new Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement.</p>
        
            <p>At home, his coalition partners Winston Peters and David Seymour were making headlines. Seymour continued to defend the under-fire school lunch scheme, while the foreign minister had South Korea, the Cook Islands and China on his agenda.</p>
        
            <p>The four-year Parliamentary term idea has also made a comeback since Luxon's last post-Cab press conference, and Housing Minister Chris Bishop launched a new scheme to get more houses built.</p>
        
            <p>Also likely up for discussion will be calls for changes to NCEA from principals serving some of the country's poorest communities.</p>
