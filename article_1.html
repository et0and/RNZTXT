            <p>The money withdrawn early from KiwiSaver funds due to financial hardship has doubled compared to a year ago, with significantly more people taking money out before retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of using KiwiSaver savings to buy a first home or after retirement, applicants who want to access their money must prove they are in "significant financial hardship".</p>
        
            <p>This could include not being able to pay their mortgage or afford minimum living expenses, to pay for a funeral for a family member or due to serious illness or disability.</p>
        
            <p>Latest figures [: https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/kiwisaver/withdrawals from Inland Revenue] show the number of KiwiSaver members making such withdrawals increased substantially from 1570 people in October 2022, to 2800 people in October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of money withdrawn from KiwiSaver due to financial hardship doubled, from $10.3 million in October 2022 to $21.5m in October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>IRD said the five regions with the most funds withdrawn for this reason were (respectively): Auckland, Canterbury, Waikato, Wellington and Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>In August, a Retirement Commission survey found 55 percent of New Zealanders reported being in financial difficulty, up 17 percent since 2021. Women, MƒÅori and Pacific peoples were affected the most.</p>
        
            <p>Those results showed people were having trouble putting away savings, which would result in long-term consequences for their future financial well-being, Retirement Commission personal finance lead Tom Hartmann said.</p>
        
            <p>Money taken from KiwiSaver accounts to purchase a first home also showed a significant increase in the latest IRD data, going from $77.7m in October 2022, to $104.7m in October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>In March, The Financial Markets Authority said total membership in KiwiSaver had increased 2.7 percent during the past year to 3.25m people, with $93.7 billion wrapped up in the scheme.</p>
