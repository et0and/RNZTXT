        <h2>Antarctic penguin found in Wellington tested for bird flu</h2>
        <p>
It's the second Adélie penguin to come ashore in New Zealand this year.

            <p>An Antarctic penguin found on a Wellington beach is undergoing disease testing, including for the deadly bird flu.</p>
        
            <p>The Adélie penguin - usually exclusive to Antarctica - appeared on Petone beach about 4000km from home on Saturday and was in quarantine at Wellington Zoo.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) confirmed it was tested Thursday for avian influenza with results expected early next week.</p>
        
            <p>The H5N1 avian flu virus was first detected in the wider Antarctic region last year, with scientists confirming in February that it had arrived on the mainland.</p>
        
            <p>In a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper from earlier this year, scientists tested 16 Adélie penguins in the Antarctic peninsula, with seven returning a positive result.</p>
        
            <p>Researchers said none of the penguins showed signs of the disease, but warned asymptomatic species could act as Trojan horses helping to spread the virus.</p>
        
            <p>In a interview with Morning Report in September, Massey University veterinary professor Brett Gartrell said new research showing the range of species affected by avian flu was "really scary" for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the biggest risk came from airborne birds - petrels, skua, and kelp gulls - rather than penguins, and said the likely path to New Zealand would be via the sub-Antarctic Islands.</p>

            <p>Despite its long journey, Wellington Zoo said the Adélie penguin was in relatively good condition and recovering well from a stressful day on the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Senior vet Kirsten Anderson said the bird's isolation was for its own protection as well as the zoo's other animals.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if it doesn't have avian influenza, we know that Antarctic penguins can carry specific viruses that are endemic to Antarctica.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we want to make sure that this bird doesn't mix with, or contaminate, any equipment that we're using with our other native birds in hospital ... and making sure she's not going to accidentally spread disease, and vice versa."</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the Adélie - a knee-height, black and white penguin - had evolved to live in Antarctica, so it was not surprising that it was suffering heat stress when it was found.</p>
        
            <p>"A sunny spring day in Petone was far too hot for this bird. She was very noisy, very stressed."</p>
        
            <p>Now in a cool, iced den, it was living up to its feisty reputation.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got the biggest attitude I think of any bird I've treated in the hospital here. Very sassy, very opinionated, and very noisy," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand - and the rest of Oceania - remained the last regions free of bird flu in the world.</p>
        
            <p>MPI said it was on high alert for the disease and it was not usual ministry practice to test seemingly healthy birds.</p>
        
            <p>Chief veterinary officer Dr Mary van Andel said across the globe, "highly pathogenic avian influenza has caused dramatic die off of wildlife" and it was known to affect different species, differently.</p>
        
            <p>She said given the Adélie penguin's Antarctic origin the ministry was proceeding with an abundance of caution.</p>
        
            <p>MPI was vigilant and alert to the spread of exotic diseases, she said, and had provided scientists based in Antarctica sampling kits to test for bird flu, should wildlife deaths raise concern.</p>
        
            <p>Van Andel said it was worth noting that the virus detected in the Antarctic mainland in February, was on the opposite side of the continent to New Zealand, and since then, there had been no further reports of spread.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, she said MPI received about three to four reports of bird deaths a week.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are triaged, investigated, and there's been no indication or finding, at all, of highly pathogenic avian influenza."</p>
        
            <p>She said anyone with concerns about sick or dead wild life - three or more at the same place and time - should call MPI's hotline - 0800 99 66.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Zoo senior vet Kirsten Anderson said the visiting Adélie penguin was "very lost and far from its home", about 4000km away.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a really unusual bird to find on our shores. We think this is the fourth or fifth recorded in Aotearoa New Zealand ever ... "</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation confirmed today that an Adélie found in Dunedin in January had been released a month later after receiving a transponder and full bill of health.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the fact that the Petone penguin was the second Adélie to come ashore this year, was concerning.</p>
        
            <p>"It should be a really rare anomaly and not a frequent thing.</p>
        
            <p>"There're a couple of theories, but I think the most credible one is the climate crisis [which] has caused warming waters and habitat disruption all around Antarctica."</p>
        
            <p>She said the changes had displaced penguins and other seabird species, forcing them into new waters to hunt for food.</p>
        
            <p>Exploitation of dwindling fish stocks was also a likely contributing factor, she said.</p>
