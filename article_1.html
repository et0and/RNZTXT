            <p>A fire has broken out on Māngere Mountain in Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>A number of users on social media have posted images of the blaze, which has sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>
        
            <p>A fire engine could be seen up the maunga by 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency had closed Mountain Road, which leads up to the maunga.</p>
        
            <p>A crew of about five firefighters were standing guard at the entrance to the road and turning away people who were trying to get a closer look at the blaze.</p>

            <p>There was the smell of thick smoke in the air, but the extent of any damage was unclear.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Fire and Emergency said it was alerted to the vegetation fire at 9:25pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire is currently around a hectare in size. Seven crews are working to extinguish the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"People are asked to stay away from the area to allow crews to work.</p>
        
            <p>"People on the western side of the mountain may experience smoke. If they are affected, they should stay inside and close all windows and doors."</p>
