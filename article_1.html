            <p>A former prisoner has likened being denied a daily hour outside to being treated like an animal.</p>
        
            <p>The Office of the Inspectorate said minimum entitlements were a right, not a privilege, after it was found that 190 prisoners were only allowed outside every second day.</p>
        
            <p>Lionel Rusia was released from prison in January after being sentenced to 19 months for drug supply. He spent his time in various Auckland prisons.</p>
        
            <p>Rusia said there were several times when he was also not allowed to leave his cell. The 44-year-old described them as his worst moments in prison.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that we are being punished for the crimes we committed, and I accept that. What I don't accept is that we get treated like animals when we are already inside, paying the price for our poor choices."</p>
        
            <p>At other times the one hour outside was reduced to 30 or 15 minutes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine being allowed out of your room only one hour per day. That would be the most important hour of your day, so the we were all waiting for it.</p>
        
            <p>"To wake up in the morning and hear that you won't be able to go outside at all, it creates frustration, some people just go crazy."</p>
        
            <p>Rusia said he would hear people shouting and banging on the walls and doors.</p>
        
            <p>At times the reduced time outside was because of fights between inmates, other times they were told it was because of staff shortages, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have a mix of people in there who have already been sentenced and a bunch still waiting for it. So, sometimes, for safety, officers will keep people inside their cells for 24 hours."</p>
        
            <p>The lack of time outside was worse for younger inmates, the first-time prisoner said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm 44 years old and I can handle my thoughts; I knew I was in prison and that there was nothing I could do about it, so on days I couldn't get out at all, I focused my energy on exercising.</p>
        
            <p>"But for some prisoners, mostly the young ones, you could see the anxiety building up, the frustration."</p>
        
            <p>Corrections deputy commissioner Neil Beales said yesterday that the units involved housed some of the most difficult and dangerous prisoners and the situation happened when they were significantly understaffed.</p>
        
            <p>He said attrition rates post Covid had taken them by surprise and staffing levels were better now.</p>
        
            <p>Beales said Corrections acknowledged the report and accepted the recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections has been approached for fresh comment.</p>
        
            <p>People Against Prisons Aotearoa (PAPA) spokesperson Emmy RƒÅkete said they had been advocating for the end of solitary confinement for years.</p>
        
            <p>"The Inspectorate was unusually frank here in acknowledging that prisoners in Paremoremo were subjected to solitary confinement, something that PAPA has criticised Corrections for doing for years."</p>
        
            <p>She said solitary confinement was degrading, soul-destroying torture.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen firsthand the harm it does to people and Corrections deliberately opted to inflict this torture on more than a hundred people for months.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not just an unfortunate situation, but a deliberate decision by prison bureaucrats to break the law for an extended period."</p>
