            <p>Microsoft says it is looking into reports some of its services are down in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Products such as Outlook and Teams have been affected.</p>
        
            <p>There have been more than 3000 reports of Microsoft failures across the country, according to DownDetector, a site which monitors internet outages.</p>
        
            <p>The reports began shortly before 8.30am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're investigating reports of access issues with Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, for users in New Zealand," it said on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"More information can be found under MO844647 in the admin center."</p>
        
            <p>It comes a day after Microsoft services including Outlook and Minecraft were subject to a cyber-attack, and nearly two weeks after a botched software rollout by a third party took down millions of computers running Microsoft Windows.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
