        <h2>Take a look inside Auckland's new Mormon temple</h2>
        <p>
The temple has taken five years to build, and sits on a multi-million dollar site in Goodwood Heights.
</p>
        
            <p>Many Aucklanders driving into the city will have noticed the imposing structure of the new temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as it casts a shadow across the Southern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>The opulent temple has taken five years to build, and sits on a multi-million-dollar sight in Goodwood Heights, looking over Manukau City.</p>
        
            <p>It is the Church's second temple in New Zealand, and only the 11th in the Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>"The temple is to us a centre place of worship and learning of god and his ways upon the Earth. To us it is the most holy and sacred place on Earth," said Elder Steven Bangerter, who is the assistant executive director of the Church's Temple Department, and has travelled from Salt Lake City in Utah for the Auckland temple opening.</p>

            <p>The temple will be used by worshippers of the church in Auckland and its surrounding regions - as many as 100,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>The only temple in New Zealand for decades has been in Hamilton, and a third is slated to be built in Wellington in the coming years.</p>
        
            <p>But it is one of many set to be built across the world in the coming year - Auckland's new temple makes it the 203rd in the world, and 165 more have been planned, nine of which are in the Pacific region.</p>

            <p>"To us the work of the temple is a work that we want to have all people of God, all of his children, to have the opportunity to participate in as they chose to," Bangerter said.</p>
        
            <p>"The closer we can bring these sacred buildings, but especially the ordinances that occur there, to the people, the better."</p>

            <p>Auckland woman Paula Midgley said having a temple in Auckland meant her family could schedule events at the temple together, without travelling to Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"It means a lot, one because it's so much easier to access. The temple is a really personal place for me to worship and to serve and to sometimes receive clarity when I need it. When I have to travel a long way that can have challenges."</p>
        
            <p>She has three daughters who have travelled to Hamilton to be married in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a blessing and it's been a wonderful occasion, but having one so much closer, I still have a son to get married and it's exciting to think we have a temple in Auckland now."</p>

            <p>RNZ was given a media tour of the new temple and surrounding 4.6 hectare grounds, before it opens to the public for the next four weeks. It will close to only committed members of the church, to be used for ordinances - sacred ceremonies like baptisms and marriages - after that.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was not able to take photographs or film inside the temple; photos and footage used have been provided by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
        
            <p>The temple foyer is entered into through green and blue stained glass doors. A thick carpet with pohotukawa designs adorns the floor and paintings depicting scenes from the bible cover the walls.</p>

Large stained glass windows feature throughout the temple.

            <p>Throughout the building, the ceilings are high and space is airy. Chandeliers hang from the ceilings and the floors are a creamy marble.</p>
        
            <p>The walls are white and light green, and boarded with a rich eucalyptus Tasmanian oak. Tall stained glass windows, designed in Utah, are coloured green and blue, some with depictions of kowhai flowers, and take up an impressive space in each room.</p>
        
            <p>The top spire of the temple reaches to a height of nearly 54 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Inside there are many rooms, all with a purpose. The entrance way leads into a room with a wide, gilded marble staircase, leading to a second floor, and a painting by New Zealand artist Dave Sotogi.</p>
        
            <p>The ground floor houses the baptist room, a large space where the floor curves around a sunken pool where baptisms take place.</p>

            <p>Around the pool are 12 golden oxen representing the 12 houses of Israel, and light filters in from the stained glass window taking up the far wall, with a white and gold chandelier hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        
            <p>Inside the instruction rooms, carved wood pew seats face a proscenium-like stage in the wall. After this, the celestial room, made of a high ceiling and crystal hanging chandelier, chairs and seats placed around the room as in a drawing room.</p>
        
            <p>Upstairs, the group are lead through a changing room and a brides room, specifically for women set to be married to get ready in, and then through to the intimate 'sealing' room, where marriages take place.</p>

            <p>Gren upholstered chairs surround a white carpeted altar at the centre of the room, in-between two cavernous mirrors at each wall, facing each other to create an endless reflection.</p>
        
            <p>The church has held the land at Goodwin Heights since 1995, where a meeting house and missionary training centre is also located, but wouldn't say how much it had cost to build.</p>
        
            <p>"We strive in the construction of the temple to put our best foot forward, and while it's not inexpensive, we do stick ourselves to strict budgets to try and be good watchmen over the Lords sacred funds," Bangerter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Temples are built entirely by the donations of the members of the Church," he added.</p>
