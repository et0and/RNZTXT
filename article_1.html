        <h2>The next All Blacks v Springboks chapter must take place at Eden Park</h2>
        <p>
Analysis: The famed record has to be put on the line to really build the momentum for a full 2026 tour.
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis: In the wash up of the All Blacks' visit to South Africa, one thing had been made very clear.</p>
        
            <p>No, not that the Springboks are truly the number one side in the world - because we already knew that. More that South African fans truly treasure this fixture and are looking forward eagerly to an all-but-confirmed return to an old-school tour in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The seal of approval is likely to come within the next month or so, as NZ Rugby and SA Rugby work through the finer points as well as what will happen to the Rugby Championship. Three tests are in the offing, likely split between Johannesburg and Cape Town, plus midweek games against the former Super Rugby teams in their home cities.</p>

            <p>It's a tantalising prospect, with a nice bit of symmetry coming 30 years after the most famous All Black visit to the republic. Fans old enough to remember the amateur era of touring will be swept up in the nostalgic value, while younger fans can have it presented to them as something entirely new.</p>
        
            <p>As much as it pains the All Blacks to hear it, losing both tests over the last two weeks does heat up the narrative for the tour. It'll now be an attempt at redemption on South African soil, and a chance for the All Blacks to prove something massive in the lead-up to the following year's World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>But that's for down the track. The sides next meet in New Zealand next year, so it's the perfect time to welcome the Springboks back to Eden Park and add to the hype of what's rightfully being called rugby's greatest rivalry.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks and Springboks haven't played at the country's largest stadium in over a decade, during a highly controversial 2013 test that saw Bismarck du Plessis sent off after a heavy tackle on Dan Carter.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks went on to win 29-15, thanks in part to the one-man advantage, although the spiteful encounter saw them reduced to 13 at full time after Kieran Read and Ma'a Nonu were yellow-carded.</p>
        
            <p>It's one of only five tests between the two sides at Eden Park in the professional era - a period that has seen the All Blacks go undefeated there for the last 50 tests. However, you need to go back a lot further for any South African test success there.</p>

            <p>This was in 1937: a breathtaking, 17-6, five tries to none victory that sealed a three-one series win for the Springboks. For context: the last All Black involved in that test, Tori Reid, passed away in 2003. Since then, Eden Park has been the scene of two of the most famous tests between the two sides, albeit for different reasons.</p>
        
            <p>In 1956, Peter Jones' try helped the All Blacks to an 11-5 win in the fourth test, winning them their first-ever series victory over the Springboks. The crowd that day, 61,240, remains a record for an attendance at a New Zealand sporting event.</p>
        
            <p>Some 25 years later, while protests raged outside on the surrounding streets and a plane flew over the pitch dropping flour bombs and flares, the All Blacks won a dramatic third test 25-22 thanks to an injury-time Alan Hewson penalty goal.</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward to now, and we find ourselves in an era of almost unrivalled dominance by the Springboks. They have won the last two World Cups and have now handed the All Blacks four defeats in a row - only the second team to do so since their 1949 counterparts whitewashed their series.</p>
        
            <p>So, the history is there. The record is there. Eden Park, the fortress, should stand against this challenge in 2025.</p>
