New Zealand First Minister Shane Jones says there will be 'no shortage of opportunity for New Zealanders to make their submissions' under the fast-track legislation which passed its first reading on Thursday.

            <p>One of the ministers who could have the power to bowl Wellington homes under a fast-track consenting regime says worried residents should submit to the select committee, even though they do not know if the project has been approved.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation, which passed its first reading on Thursday, would allow the government to bypass normal consent processes.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister said yesterday a second Mt Vic tunnel build may well be put through the new regime.</p>
        
            <p>Shane Jones told Morning Report the tunnel was promised during the election campaign and no one should be surprised if consenting was fast-tracked.</p>
        
            <p>"My colleagues from the National Party and a host of others in Wellington ... many of them have campaigned, they've submitted and they've made a lot of noise about the Vic tunnel."</p>
        
            <p>He said anyone could make a submission if they were worried.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether a second Mt Vic tunnel was one of the projects on the list, he said the list was "under compilation".</p>
        
            <p>"If your house is affected, you're really talking about the Public Works Act and if you have a look at the bill, there will be further work taking place in respect to the Public Works Act."</p>
        
            <p>There would be "no shortage of opportunity for New Zealanders to make their submissions" to a select committee, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Councillor Diane Calvert told RNZ the city had been waiting for at least a decade for another tunnel to ease the chronic congestion around the Basin Reserve and she was picking the public would back a fast-track approach.</p>
        
            <p>But fellow councillor Iona Pannett said the project would mean even more traffic, along with more pollution and greenhouse gases.</p>
        
            <p>Critics have cried foul over the 'one-stop-shop' Fast-track Approvals Bill, with Environmental Defence Society chief executive Gary Taylor saying its powers were 'radical beyond measure'.</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop told RNZ's Checkpoint on Thursday that he could not guarantee conservation land would not be used for mining projects under the legislation.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones, one of the three ministers given the power to make fast-track decisions said environmentalists needed to "overcome their preoccupation with mining not being permitted on DOC land".</p>
        
            <p>"We've already mined DOC land," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's hundreds of New Zealanders going to work today, digging up minerals on the DOC estate."</p>
        
            <p>He denied he would be willing to risk the extinction of a species if the potential economic gains from a development were warranted, but said some "hard trade-offs" would need to be made.</p>
        
            <p>"If we're not going to turn around our current account deficit through using dairy and other types of industries, we've got to open up new sources of revenue," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said he his party had "campaigned unstintingly" on turbo-charging development in regional New Zealand "and then we took that aspiration into the coalition agreement and we secured the support of the prime minister to create this bill".</p>
        
            <p>"Go down this morning to West Port, Greymouth, Hokitika, I'm telling you, people are out there are clapping loudly that at long last the natural resources of that area - whether it's the iron sands off Westport, whether it's the critical rare Earth minerals that are scattered throughout the West Coast - now people will have a clear sense of certainty, that is a genuine political debating point."</p>
        
            <p>While the list of projects earmarked for potential fast-tracking had not yet been made public, Jones said he had met with "the vast majority" of the project companies.</p>
        
            <p>"I've encouraged them to work with my officials and develop their proposals and eventually submit them once this independent process is up and going," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The list will be dropped into Parliament, the list also will also be publicly available, and the list will represent a pipeline of development in New Zealand which I'm hoping will go for at least 10, 20 years."</p>
        
            <p>Forest & Bird chief executive Nicola Toki told Morning Report the proposed legislation meant that even if an environment panel indicated it had major concerns about a project, it would have no power to say it could not go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>It was "bad for nature and terrifying for our democratic process", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a government that campaigned on local decision making for communities and getting the power out of Wellington so that communities could feel the strength of their ability to have a say about their place, and this legislation goes beyond anything this country has ever seen."</p>
        
            <p>Toki said the fact that the list of pre-approved projects had not yet been made public raised issues around transparency.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no doubt that processes can be better but the fundamental principles of a government and Parliamentary processes is ensuring that there is a level of independence and that when you tell the voters that you're going to make evidence-based decisions, you make that true."</p>
        
            <p>The fact the decisions the ministers made about which projects to fast-track were only open to challenges on points of law meant non-for-profit organisations would be left to "stump up to court to fight something that is actually anti-democratic", she said.</p>

Forest & Bird chief executive Nicola Toki says fast-track processes can work when they are done properly but her organisation has concerns about a lack of transparency regarding which projects may be fast-tracked.

            <p>"We have had decades and decades and decades of democratic processes - absolutely, they can be faster - we believe there is an opportunity for fast-tracks and they can work when they're done properly," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This government's throwing all of that in the bin."</p>
        
            <p>While environmental groups are crying foul over the bill, it has received a support across a range of industries, including mining, transport and aquaculture.</p>
        
            <p>Aquaculture New Zealand chief executive Gary Hooper said the bill could unlock a range of projects in the sector, but the industry also realised it needed to protect the environment.</p>
        
            <p>"Aquaculture offers New Zealand a massive opportunity in terms of increasing export earnings, creating jobs, creating positive economic and social stimulus in regional New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Those opportunities had, for many years, been thwarted by "expensive, lengthy, and uncertain consenting processes", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think New Zealanders should respect the expertise that will be involved in the panel that'll be considering these applications."</p>
        
            <p>Hooper said the aquaculture sector was "very proud" of its environmental record, noting that New Zealand was the only country in the world that had received a 'best choice' endorsement from the internationally-recognised Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch programme for its farmed salmon, mussels and oysters.</p>
        
            <p>"We take very seriously our kaitiaki responsibilities."</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed there was a proposal that MPI was engaging with different parties on, to extend existing consents within the sector.</p>
        
            <p>"We would greatly support that."</p>
        
            <p>Hooper said he believed minister Jones' assurances to Morning Report that the process of identifying which projects were being considered for fast-tracking would be transparent.</p>
        
            <p>"We will see what is released in terms of the detail of the bill as it progresses through the select committee processes and we'll take it from there."</p>
