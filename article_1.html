            <p>The Interislander ferry Kaiarahi is being towed back to Wellington due to a technical issue.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the ferry said the 1pm sailing from Wellington to Picton was still in the harbour, about halfway between the port and Matu Somes Island, when a call came over the loudspeaker that there was a technical issue.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement said it would not be a quick fix, and the ferry would have to return to Wellington.</p>
