            <p>One of the 10 teenagers in the government's military-style bootcamp trial has died in an accident while another is currently on the run after absconding.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki deputy chief executive Tusha Penny on Thursday confirmed a bootcamp participant had "passed away as a result of an accident".</p>
        
            <p>The Herald understands the young man was the fatality in a crash on State Highway 1 near Tīrau on Wednesday last week between three vehicles, including a tourist bus, which injured 14 others.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald is awaiting a response from police on the matter.</p>
        
            <p>Penny said Oranga Tamariki's thoughts were with the teen's family and the agency was offering "our condolences and support".</p>
        
            <p>"As the circumstances of this accident are under investigation by NZ Police, we cannot comment on specific details."</p>
        
            <p>Penny, leading the agency's work on youth justice services and residential care, also confirmed another participant had absconded and was being sought by police after being granted bail on "compassionate grounds".</p>
        
            <p>She said a "full review" into both incidents had commenced.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour said she could not discuss the boy's passing as it was under police investigation.</p>

            <p>She refused to answer queries concerning the participant who had absconded.</p>
        
            <p>"Any other queries about participants in the military-style academies pilot should be directed to Oranga Tamariki."</p>
        
            <p>On 21 November, Chhour issued a statement confirming one of the 10 participants had allegedly reoffended.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm saddened that this young person has not taken this opportunity at a second chance," she said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"We were hopeful this would not occur, but we understand the complexities in the lives of these young people. Ultimately, what they do with these opportunities is up to them."</p>
        
            <p>She said the pilot had learnt from previous military-style programmes, with a key differentiating factor being that support was given to the participants after they left the residence and returned to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident the residential stage of the Military-Style Academy pilot is having success.</p>
        
            <p>"Several of the boys left the programme with jobs already lined up. Each one has a mentor who is working with them and there is intensive, tailored support for each young person."</p>
        
            <p>The bootcamp pilot, also known as a military-style academy, began in July this year and was set to run for 12 months. In the first three months, the 10 recidivist offenders aged between 15-17 were placed in Palmerston North's youth justice facility before transitioning to the in-community phase for the remaining nine months in mid-October.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the government passed legislation through its first reading which would enable judges to send young offenders to bootcamps by creating the Young Serious Offender category. The legislation was expected to become law in March.</p>

            <p>Labour's children's spokeswoman Willow-Jean Prime said it was "very tragic" the young man had passed away but she remained concerned about the government's bootcamps.</p>
        
            <p>"The government needs to stop this harmful experiment and should not push ahead with their legislation to entrench them," she told the Herald.</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister should care."</p>
        
            <p>Prime said she understood a third participant of the bootcamps had also reoffended. Oranga Tamariki did not address that claim when asked by the Herald.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki officials, including Penny, were set to appear before the Social Services and Community select committee as part of Parliament's scrutiny week.</p>
        
            <p>While Chhour was not listed on Parliament's website as appearing, Prime understood Chhour would front the committee on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's absolutely something [Chhour] should front on and needs to be honest with our committee about this boot camp experiment," Prime said.</p>
