            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is back on his home turf in Auckland and is talking to journalists during a bleak week for media and public servants.</p>
        
            <p>Job losses in the public service have continued to climb this week with the total climbing to almost 1500.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the government has so far not come up with anything specific to help the media in the wake of confirmation of the closure of Newshub and the loss of more than 60 jobs at TVNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's media stand-up will be livestreamed at the top of this page from about 9am.</p>
