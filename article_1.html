            <p>The number of jobs going or gone at the ministry has more than doubled to 286, up from 111 reported in March, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Further cuts were possible, it said.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE employs 6650 staff.</p>
        
            <p>It has completed its first round of voluntary redundancies, with 111 staff already gone. The ministry soon extended the offer of voluntary redundancy to other departments.</p>
        
            <p>Public servants' jobs are on the chopping block as the sector scrambles to meet the Finance Minister's cost-cutting targets.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
