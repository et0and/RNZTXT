            <p>Two people have died and a number of others are seriously injured after a crashes across the motu on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The fatal incidents come in the lead-up to Christmas, as more Kiwis and visitors take to the roads over the summer holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, 21 people died on New Zealand roads over the Christmas-New Year holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Police director of road policing Superintendent Steve Greally said there was no excuse for any driver to be endangering their lives and those of others with unsafe behaviours.</p>
        
            <p>"Our people will be visible right throughout Aotearoa. Our stance on safety remains straightforward."</p>
        
            <p>Drivers needed to know that if they were detected speeding or driving impaired by alcohol or drugs, they would be ticketed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The best way to avoid being ticketed is not to speed, not to drive drunk or under the influence of drugs. It's that simple."</p>
        
            <p>Since 1 July, police had conducted more than two million breath tests nationally, so this should be a motivating factor for all motorists to drive safely, Greally said.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency urged drivers to use its Journey Planner on the day of travel, as it provided real-time updates on road works and other hazards on the roading network.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the scene of a serious two-vehicle crash on State Highway 1, Greta Valley, just south of the Hurunui River bridge.</p>
