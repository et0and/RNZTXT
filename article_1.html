            <p>Some properties south of a large fire in Amberley are being evacuated, Fire and Emergency Canterbury says.</p>
        
            <p>The properties are on Racecourse Road and they are threatened by a blaze in among vegetation which is being fuelled by tree stumps, tyres, grass and car wrecks.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has called in helicopters to help firefighters dealing with the fire which is affecting an area about 1km long and 500 metres wide.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurunui District Council has asked those being evacuated to make their way to Hurunui Library on carters Rd in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be further updates about an evacuation location as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation and patience," it said in a post on social media.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also appealed to residents in both Amberley and Loburn to limit their water use and not to turn on appliances such as washing machines.</p>
        
            <p>"We have diverted extra water supply to allow the emergency crews to fight the fire."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ has appealed to people to stay away from the scene of the fire so they do not hamper efforts to bring it under control.</p>
