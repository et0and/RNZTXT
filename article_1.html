            <p>The heaviest rain from a complex trough going over the top of the country is likely to affect the north of the North Island, and the north and west of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>A number of heavy rain watches and warnings are in place around the country from Thursday night until Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Affected residents are being advised to clear drains and gutters, avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously.</p>
        
            <p>Local Civil Defence and emergency management groups for Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty are reiterating MetService's information on the watches and warnings.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the weather systems from the Tasman Sea could affect the country into next week.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research said low pressure was forecast to stall in the Tasman Sea for the next week.</p>
        
            <p>"Areas of vorticity, or atmospheric spin, will 'pinwheel' around the low, bringing semi-regular rounds of rain & thunderstorms to many regions of the country, starting tonight."</p>

            <p>Auckland Council emergency management general manager Adam Maggs said residents should take precautionary measures before the rain was expected to set in from about 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Just check the drains around the property, if [residents have] got things that are loose and laying around, tuck them away, just do some of those checks that you'd do if you know some weather's coming in," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not expecting huge volumes of rain, but we are expecting lots of showers and messy weather coming from the north and the east."</p>
        
            <p>The northern and eastern parts of the region could see more rain than other areas, Maggs said.</p>
        
            <p>Heads up Auckland ⛈Our expert forecasters have decided to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for potential downpours with the rain tonight.Some areas could see larger accumulations of rain than others & impacts are possible with the high intensity rainfall.@AklCouncil… pic.twitter.com/RG6FjbDVhx</p>
        
            <p>The rain would likely exacerbate already damp conditions, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Soils are saturated, so we're going to see run-off off the land, and there will be localised flooding likely," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Water's got nowhere to go except basically run-off, so we're likely to see, even with reasonable numbers, some localised flooding on some of our roads, some of the areas that would typically see surface flooding, might see that surface flooding until it's got time to drain away.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not talking huge volumes of rainfall, just the fact that, at this time of year, we're already pretty wet anyway and we've just got more rain coming."</p>
        
            <p>Residents should report any blocked drains or fallen trees to the council.</p>
        
            <p>"If people see trees down, report a problem on the Auckland Council online website, it's important, and any blocked drains, feel free to call Auckland Council on 09 301 0101, and we'll get that resolved," Maggs said.</p>
        
            <p>He warned rain could still be pouring on Friday morning, and advised motorists to take care on the roads and drive to the conditions.</p>
