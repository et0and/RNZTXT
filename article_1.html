        <h2>Transport Minister raised alarm over ferry maintenance</h2>
        <p>
The government was "highly unimpressed" with KiwiRail's ferry maintenance standards, Simeon Brown said earlier this week.

            <p>The grounding of the 35-year-old Interislander ferry comes just days after Transport Minister Simeon Brown raised serious concerns about KiwiRail's maintenance of its fleet.</p>
        
            <p>It was just the latest problem in a series of issues for KiwiRail.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday night, the Aratere ran aground 3km north of Picton with 47 people - most of whom were crew - on board.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail are working on plans to refloat the vessel, and eight passengers and 12 crew disembarked on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It comes days after Brown criticised the state-owned company for its handling of ferry maintenance.</p>

            <p>At the transport and infrastructure committee on Thursday, Brown expressed government concerns about how KiwiRail had been looking after its fleet.</p>
        
            <p>"We also want KiwiRail to make sure they're maintaining their existing boats to the appropriate standards, which has been a significant issue that we've been highly unimpressed with coming into government."</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail had been improving their maintenance protocols significantly from the "poor" processes it had in the last few years, he said.</p>
        
            <p>This was partially due to KiwiRail having the importance of well-maintained Cook Strait ferries being highlighted to them.</p>
        
            <p>Brown's comments were not the first time KiwiRail's handling of the Interislander service had been called into question.</p>
        
            <p>Late last year, the government canned the Inter-Island Resilient Connection (iReX) project due to its budget blowing out from $1.45 billion in 2021 to $2.6 billion in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>It would have seen the construction of two large ferries and new port infrastructure in Wellington and Picton.</p>
        
            <p>In a release of documents related to the project last month, the Transport Ministry questioned whether KiwiRail was up to the task of running the Cook Strait ferry business.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's costs continued to grow while its competitor Bluebridge operated commercial services without a subsidy, the documents said.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said a more commercially viable option should be possible if a new approach was taken, "especially by someone other than KiwiRail".</p>
        
            <p>"Given the difficulties KiwiRail have had with Project iReX, and the fact they have a range of core rail issues to address, [it] raises the question of KiwiRail's suitability to run the Interislander business in the medium to long term.</p>
        
            <p>"The Interislander business could be separated into another State-Owned Enterprise or sold via a trade sale."</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail was also criticised by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) after the Kaitaki ferry lost power with 880 people in January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The transport watchdog found that the ship's engines failed after one of the ship's safety-critical rubber expansion joints ruptured and prevented the engines restarting.</p>
        
            <p>It said the accident happened because KiwiRail had failed to replace safety-critical parts, which were years past their use-by dates.</p>
        
            <p>After the incident, KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy apologised and said the company had taken "a number of steps to ensure it never happens again".</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, Maritime NZ filed one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act following a near year-long investigation into the incident.</p>
