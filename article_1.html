        <h2>Auckland dogs: 'People treating animals as disposable'</h2>
        <p>
With the rate of impounded dogs claimed by owners at a 10-year low, animal management officers in South Auckland say too many people are treating animals as disposable.

            <p>With the rate of impounded dogs claimed by owners at a 10-year low, animal management officers in South Auckland say too many people are treating animals as disposable.</p>
        
            <p>Animal management officers Ginny Mason and Kevin Gregor have become familiar faces in South Auckland - they say they visit so often residents have started waving as they pass by.</p>
        
            <p>After watching several roaming dogs sprint back home when they pull up, Mason said she thinks dogs also recognise their white van with cages in the boot.</p>
        
            <p>The pair patrol an area spanning from Māngere to Orere Point, covering some of the most problematic parts of the region for roaming dogs.</p>
        
            <p>They are part of a wider team under Auckland Council responding to a constant stream of calls about dogs roaming the streets, behaving aggressively, and being mistreated.</p>

            <p>Data from October showed animal management staff responded to 37,558 requests in the previous 12 months, the highest number to date.</p>
        
            <p>It found 8306 dogs were taken in by council shelters in that period, but the rate of impounded dogs claimed by owners reached a 10-year low at 43 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Mason said she loved working with dogs and their owners, but it was disheartening to see so many dogs in shelters.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard seeing people disowning and letting them down. There are some gorgeous dogs out there that deserve better."</p>
        
            <p>Gregor said too many people were treating animals as disposable.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of like: 'I'll just get a new one'.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing the conditions they're sometimes kept in is probably the hardest part of the job."</p>
        
            <p>He said the city's biggest shelter in Manukau had 126 kennels, the Silverdale shelter had roughly 80, and the Henderson shelter roughly 50, but there was not enough space for all the dogs they were picking up.</p>
        
            <p>To manage the high number of dogs being impounded, prospective dog owners would soon be able to meet and greet their furry friends at a new council-run adoption centre in Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>It would be the first council-operated adoption-only shelter in the country and offer educational visits to groups including schools.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 impounded dogs could be held at a time at the centre.</p>

            <p>Mason said the council's three shelters were full and another shelter could not come soon enough.</p>
        
            <p>"Because it's adoption-based, it's going to free up more space for us.</p>
        
            <p>"We always need more space, we're always running at capacity. And it's just going to be a good hub for people to find doggies."</p>
        
            <p>Gregor said another facility would give them much-needed breathing room, but they ultimately wanted to reduce, not expand, their shelters.</p>
        
            <p>He urged people to educate themselves to prevent harm to their dogs, the public and other animals.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of resources out there to show you how to be a more responsible dog owner.</p>
        
            <p>"A well-behaved dog is good for everybody."</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged people to report any roaming dogs they saw, and to think about their safety and confidence with animals before approaching.</p>
        
            <p>"In most cases, I wouldn't approach a roaming dog."</p>
        
            <p>Animal management manager Elly Waitoa said in the past few years, they had only allowed people to see a small number of dogs they pre-selected for potential adoption for safety reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of the violence and aggression experienced by my staff, the security at the shelters has had to be increased significantly and we can no longer have people come in and view these dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"That restricts the number of people coming to adopt a dog from us and the visibility of what we have available."</p>
        
            <p>Waitoa said shelters needed space for high risk dogs and to focus on rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped a dedicated place for suitable dogs ready to be taken home would lead to higher adoptions and fewer euthanisations.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have around 30 to 40 adoption dogs. It will be a walk-through shelter so you'll be able to rock up with your family on the weekend and go an see all the dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"It will mean people can gauge the dogs personality and energy levels so we can match the right dog to the right person."</p>
        
            <p>They also hoped to attract adopters from outside of Auckland with the adoption centre's close proximity to the Waikato region.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were in the final stages of upgrading the Pukekohe shelter, which was previously being leased out to the Waikato council, and they would start moving dogs into the facility next week.</p>
        
            <p>The council would continue to have dogs up for adoption before the adoption centre opened to the public in early March.</p>
