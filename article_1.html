            <p>Police said they do not believe that threatening emails received by several organisations today were a sign of any actual danger, and are working to identify the source.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement police said they were confident that emails received by a number of organisations are from the same source, and Cybercrime Unit staff are working to identify the origin.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to reassure the affected organisations that police are taking this matter seriously and we appreciate today has been nerve-wracking," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not believe there is any actual threat to those that received the email, and we thank those affected for working alongside police.</p>
        
            <p>"Enquiries into the matter remain ongoing and the complex task of identifying the origin of the email is under way."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands police attended Auckland City Hospital, Wellington Regional Hospital and Bowen Hospital in the capital, and Burwood Hospital in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Bowen Hospital said police did a thorough sweep of the site before confirming it was safe.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education is aware of one school, St Kentigern College in Auckland, that received the threatening email.</p>
        
            <p>The college was evacuated as a result of the threatening email. Some students were sitting NCEA exams at the time.</p>
