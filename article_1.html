            <p>It wouldn't be a test week against England without some off field drama, which was provided this time by Joe Marler questioning the validity of the haka. By Friday the English prop, who has been ruled out of the test for personal reasons, had contritely apologised and thanked people for helping him understand the haka - so good on you Joe, it certainly helped build a bit of a bridge back.</p>
        
            <p>But now our attention turns to the test itself. England are back on home turf to start their northern season, while the All Blacks start the first of three very tough fixtures on the way to the end of a very tough year.</p>

            <p>Of course, the other big news of the week was the dropping of prop Ethan de Groot for breaching team standards. In comes Tamaiti Williams at loosehead, the only change to the top forward pack test selection Scott Robertson can put out. Cortez Ratima has won the race for the starting halfback spot, with Cam Roigard on the bench forming an interesting duo to try and pick apart the English rush defence. Mark Tele'a gets the wing spot, with Will Jordan at fullback.</p>

            <p>Steve Borthwick has kept the majority of his preferred side that played the All Blacks in July. The only change to his starting XV is Tom Curry coming into openside in place of Sam Underhill, otherwise the only other new faces are on the bench. Much will be riding on the form of Marcus Smith and how he can spark an exciting backline, as well as how effective the impressive loose forward trio of Curry, Ben Earl and Chandler Cunningham-South are.</p>
        
            <p>"Twickenham is such an iconic place to play and the roar of the crowd there is like few others. The All Blacks have had some fierce battles there in recent years and that's a challenge that we will step forward to." - All Blacks coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll need to be accurate, keep our discipline, and maintain a level of intensity throughout the match, from the first whistle to the final moment." - England coach Steve Borthwick.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 24 - 17 England</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks 16 - 15 England</p>
        
            <p>Scott Robertson started his test coaching career with a highly competitive and absorbing series against England, which really could've gone the other way had it not been for a few crucial moments. Sevu Reece was man of the match in the first test, which seems like a long time ago now for him, while Beauden Barrett's shift off the bench in the second proved to be a match-winning performance. The English introduced a very talented back three of Tommy Freeman, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and George Furbank, who left NZ with seriously enhanced reputations.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks are certainly a better side than they were the last time they played, but it will take one of their better efforts to get over an England side that took it to them earlier in the year. The Twickenham cauldron will be boiling, especially during the haka, so the need to silence the crowd early will be on the All Blacks' minds. The last two trips to Twickenham weren't kind to the All Blacks - in 2022 they blew a 25-6 lead with 10 minutes to play and ended up drawing 25-all, then last year against the Springboks they suffered the largest loss in All Black history.</p>
