            <p>Temperatures have hit 30 degrees Celsius and above in northern parts of the country, with heat alerts in place for Auckland and Te Kuiti.</p>
        
            <p>Whangaparāoa, north of Auckland, rose above 30C for a time this afternoon and has settled slightly back down to 29C. MetService said it was the area's hottest temperature this summer.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said it could even rise further about 3-4pm - typically the hottest time of the day - but southwesterly winds are forecast to develop soon which would cool it down.</p>
        
            <p>A heat alert is in place for Auckland, with Auckland airport reaching 28C and is currently hovering about 27C with southwesterly winds.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, MetService's station at Marsden Point in Northland hit 32C. While Whakatāne was at 29.6C - the region's warmest temperature this summer - Tauranga at 28.8C and Hamilton at 28.8C.</p>
        
            <p>However, cooler weather was set to settle in over the next few days, MetService said.</p>
