        <h2>'Everyone's feeling a bit shaky': Plane swerves off runway during arrival</h2>
        <p>
Planes are circling near Christchurch Airport and flights have been cancelled after the Jetstar flight hit trouble while landing.
</p>
        
            <p>A Jetstar aircraft has slid off a runway at Christchurch Airport during landing.</p>
        
            <p>Freelance Journalist Diana Clement was a passenger on flight JQ225 and says it was a frightening landing.</p>
        
            <p>"We swerved off the runway onto the grass then swerved violently back onto the runway before coming to a halt across the main runway."</p>
        
            <p>Clement told Morning Report they were told there had been a hydrolic leak on the right hand side.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's feeling a bit shaky."</p>

            <p>She thought the flight itself did not feel out of the ordinary.</p>
        
            <p>But she said some other passengers heard a weird noise when they were flying over, roughly New Plymouth. And then a similar noise on landing.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened at 7:45am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>There are no reports of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar said after landing the aircraft experienced a steering issue, causing it to veer on the runway at a low speed.</p>

            <p>Christchurch airport said runways were currently closed to incoming aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>Several domestic arrivals and departures to Christchurch have been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The airport has advised people to check the website for a full list of delays.</p>
        
            <p>Karin Small, a passenger aboard the flight, told RNZ she had no idea anything was wrong until the landing.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been on a plane that that's happened to before," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It skidded out and then took off again and then landed on the grass and then the fire people came.</p>
        
            <p>"I was pretty calm about it and the staff were pretty good about people keeping it together."</p>
        
            <p>One passenger told the NZ Herald "something went horribly wrong".</p>

            <p>"We ended up on the grass," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The Jetstar aircraft was towed to the gate for passengers to disembark.</p>
        
            <p>Planes were circling along the East Coast, unable to land due to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>These are flights from Tauranga, Auckland, Wellington, Queenstown, Palmerston North and Singapore</p>
