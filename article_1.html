        <h2>Watch: National, NZF committed to spending less on cycle lanes - Brown</h2>
        <p>
Priorities in recent years have been wrongly on cycling infrastructure when roads are falling apart, Transport Minister Simeon Brown says.
</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown is speaking to media about the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport, which covers the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>The draft released for consultation in March proposed to increase fuel taxes by 12 cents a litre in 2027 increasing to 22 cents in 2029, alongside increases to vehicle registration fees by $50 over two years.</p>
        
            <p>This would help pay for new Roads of National Significance and the government's $500 million pothole prevention fund, with $70 billion in spending through to 2034.</p>
        
            <p>Questions remain over just how much those roads may cost. The government has repeatedly said it would aim to use alternative revenue options where possible, including public-private partnerships, and user-pays options like road tolling, equity finance schemes, and value capture.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation closed on 2 April, with the final plan expected to be in place by 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>Since the draft was released, the government has also announced two further Roads of National Significance, along with a plan for a replace the New Zealand Upgrade Programme with "Roads of Regional Significance".</p>
        
            <p>When announcing those moves last month, Brown and Finance Minister Nicola Willis said they had been advised of a "significant funding gap of up to $1.5b" and they had agreed to delegate decisions to the NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi to deliver "within the existing funding envelope, as there will be no additional Crown funding".</p>
