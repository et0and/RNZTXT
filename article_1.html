            <p>Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran has resigned.</p>
        
            <p>He will leave the airline in October, the company announced in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>He had been with the company five years.</p>
        
            <p>Foran said in a statement that leading Air New Zealand had been one of the "greatest privileges" of his career.</p>
        
            <p>"I am humbled by the work Air New Zealanders do every day and their extraordinary commitment to each other, our customers and our country."</p>
        
            <p>He said Air New Zealand has had to battle issues outside its control but had managed to continue and improve.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll leave later this year knowing Air New Zealand's foundations are immensely strong."</p>
        
            <p>Board chairperson Dame Therese Walsh said Foran has told members he believes it is a good time for him now to take up a new challenge.</p>
        
            <p>She said he has told the board the airline was set up well for growth.</p>
        
            <p>Foran has displayed "exceptional leadership", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Therese said Foran has had to guide Air New Zealand through "global aviation's most significant crisis" referring to Covid-19, which saw national boundaries closed and airlines having to stop fling routes.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps his most notable contribution has been managing significant global supply chain challenges. These begun with Covid-19, and continue today with the engine issues materially impacting both our Boeing and Airbus fleets."</p>
        
            <p>The Air New Zealand board will carry out a global search for a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>In the months to his departure on 20 October, Foran will work with a new chief executive to prepare for the role, Walsh said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand, which has more than 11,000 employees, is the country's flag-bearing carrier.</p>
        
            <p>The airline made the announcement to the NZX at 12pm today.</p>
        
            <p>Just before Christmas, Foran told RNZ's Checkpoint that Air New Zealand would face issues for two to three years over maintenance issues with the Rolls Royce trent 1000 engines on its 787 Dreamliners, following concerns of premature wear and weakness.</p>
        
            <p>Foran, who is a member of the China Business Council, has been a high profile chief executive within New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He started as chief executive of Air New Zealand on 3 February 2020, joining the airline from Walmart US where he was chief executive from 2014 to 2019.</p>
        
            <p>According to his bio on the Air New Zealand website, he was responsible for the strategic direction and performance of Walmart's 4600 stores and more than 1 million staff.</p>
        
            <p>He had also been president and chief executive of Walmart China.</p>
