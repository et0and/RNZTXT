            <p>Donald Trump's team is working to distance the Republican candidate from the vulgar and racist remarks made at his controversial rally at Madison Square Garden as pundits say he made the most extreme closing argument in modern presidential history.</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden has cast his vote for Democrat Kamala Harris and slammed Trump's rally as "embarrassing".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, two ballot boxes were set on fire and Elon Musk is under fire for his $1 million sweepstake for voters.</p>
