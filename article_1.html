        <h2>Rocket Lab 'ready to serve' Pentagon</h2>
        <p>
Rocket Lab is poised to launch a satellite from Mahia Peninsula for a US company which is looking to bolster military and spying operations.

            <p>Rocket Lab is poised to launch a satellite from Mahia Peninsula for a US company which is looking to bolster military and spying operations.</p>
        
            <p>BlackSky's plan is to add laser optic links later to its Gen-3 satellites to give "war-fighters real-time access to imagery during time-sensitive military operations worldwide".</p>
        
            <p>This comes shortly after Rocket Lab won a part in a mega-deal to help develop hypersonic weapons for the Pentagon, prompting the firm to state it was "ready to serve the US Department of Defense".</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The New York-listed, New Zealand-born company has also completed a design review for 18 military satellites in a contract worth more than $800 million, for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), which is putting up a web of low-orbit satellites for missile tracking and battlefield comms.</p>
        
            <p>That deal, which was signed last year, cemented Rocket Lab as a "prime" - or lead - defence contractor in the US.</p>
        
            <p>The Mahia launch is set down for some time from Tuesday, and will be the first of several Gen-3s for BlackSky, which has used the site near Gisborne since 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The government last year dismissed pro-Palestinian protesters complaints it breached rules on launches.</p>
        
            <p>The new satellites have more powerful cameras effective in haze and at night.</p>
        
            <p>The optical links, to be added after a study funded by the US Navy, aim to boost image volume by five times and the speed of sharing images to the ground by 10 times, the company said.</p>
        
            <p>The launch of four Gen-3 satellites was approved by the Minister for Space in 2023, to join BlackSky's operational constellation "for the purpose of Earth observation", the MBIE approval document said.</p>
        
            <p>Six months ago, BlackSky said it would make Gen-3s compatible with military networks. It won a $175m satellite contract with an unnamed international defence customer last month.</p>
        
            <p>Its constellation of small satellites also has civilian uses, such as in mapping natural disasters.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab's share price in the US has surged since it won big Pentagon contracts.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was committed "to delivering world-class satellite solutions for national defence... that will strengthen US defence capabilities in space".</p>
        
            <p>Defence contractor stocks are volatile. They have surged in Europe as NATO has come under the hammer to raise spending.</p>
        
            <p>But uncertainty surrounds the new US administration. It has let Elon Musk loose on Pentagon spending, and wants a cut in conventional spending, but at the same time signalled it wants rapid take-up of "emerging" military technologies, which could be good for space or intelligence operators like Peter Thiel's Palantir.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab's Electron rockets are the second most launched annually in the US, behind only SpaceX.</p>
        
            <p>It has signed on as a subcontractor to a five-year hypersonics contract worth up to $2.5 billion, won by San Diego firm Kratos. This aims to provide "rapid and affordable hypersonic flight testing".</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab has already done multiple hypersonic test launches from its Virginia launchpad.</p>
        
            <p>These were "testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation [US]", it said.</p>
        
            <p>Hypersonic missiles can reach Mach 5-plus and are highly manoeuvrable in flight. Russia used one against Ukraine last November.</p>
