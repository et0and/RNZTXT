            <p>A Ministry of Education Nutritionist has raised a litany of issues with the healthy school lunch programme including massive wastage, the concerning quality of meals and the safety of supposedly halal lunches.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint obtained an email that was sent to Ministry of Education officials by a Ka Ora, Ka Ako Nutritionist after they visited some Auckland schools and saw first hand the meals delivered.</p>
        
            <p>In the email, the Nutritionist said they were "hoping service was rolling better".</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately that was not the case," the email said.</p>
        
            <p>They then listed more than a dozen issues.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education declined to be interviewed about the school lunch programme.</p>
        
            <p>But professor of population nutrition and global health at University of Auckland Boyd Swinburn told Checkpoint they were trying to compare the new system to the old one.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking into, trying to analysis the quality of the lunches compared to an analysis done under the original system, but we need quite a bit more data from the providers to do that.</p>
        
            <p>"Just on a first look, it seems very clear that one of the things they have done is to chop back on the size and the calorie content of the lunches quite considerably - probably chopping them back by a third at least - so that's probably where some of their cost savings are."</p>
        
            <p>He said the kids were getting about 11 or 12 percent of their total energy needs for the day in the lunches that are served under the programme.</p>
        
            <p>Swinburn said the old lunch provided was "about twice that, about 20 percent."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were 88 complaints about the menu appeal and 200 about the quality over the three years the old school lunch system ran.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had that number of complaints in the first week just about, so there is definitely unhappiness across many of the schools."</p>
        
            <p>He also said all calories were not always equal and there were requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"There are different criteria for vegetable requirements and protein requirements in the meals, and we don't know if they are being met or not.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the recipes from the providers to be able to analyse that, we need to know what the requirements in the contract are - are they expected to stick to the original nutrition criteria, we don't know, there's a heck of a lot of questions on this."</p>
        
            <p>He said they had asked for the contracts and will soon be asking for the nutritional break-downs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear from what we do know that the lunch is a pale comparison compared to what has been available before."</p>
        
            <p>He said year nine's and over were receiving 378 grams in a lunch, but that had gone down to 300 grams, while years 4 - 8 were previously getting 300 grams but were now down to 240 grams.</p>
        
            <p>He also said there was a serious waste problem and the school staff were spending hours in the kitchen helping to distribute the lunches.</p>
        
            <p>"Apparently schools are not being well compensated for that, so there is a lot of extra time the schools are having to pick up to make this work."</p>
        
            <p>Swinburn said the costs - with the additional snacks - were unto $3.84 a pop.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education sent Checkpoint a response from Sean Teddy, the leader of operations and integration.</p>
        
            <p>It said the nutritional standards had not changed and were the same for all providers in the Ka Ora, Ka Ako School Lunches Programme.</p>
        
            <p>Teddy said the nutritional standards were the minimum weight of food for students and that these had been informed by the Ministry of Health's Healthy Food and Drink Guidance.</p>
        
            <p>He said the minimum size and weight of the school lunch meals had not changed with the introduction of the new programme, apart from Year 0-3 who were receiving a slightly larger meal.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint invited the School Lunch Collective, which was responsible for the revamped school lunches regime, to speak but - as has been the case since the start of the year - they declined.</p>
