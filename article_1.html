            <p>A New Zealander was on board a luxury super yacht when it capsized and sank off the coast of Sicily overnight.</p>
        
            <p>One man has died and six people are missing.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed a New Zealander was involved, but couldn't confirm if they were among the dead or missing.</p>
        
            <p>They say they're working with local authorities to get further details.</p>
        
            <p>The Italian coast guard says the 56-metre-long yacht sank after being hit by an unexpectedly violent storm just before sunrise.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Carsten Boerner rescued the 15 survivors from a life raft.</p>
        
            <p>The six missing people are understood to be British and American.</p>
        
            <p>British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, who is known as the British Bill Gates, is among the missing.</p>
        
            <p>Eight of the 15 people rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>Italian media are reporting there were water spouts spotted as the storm struck the north coast of Sicily, which may have caused the capsize.</p>
