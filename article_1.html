        <h2>Addicted students vaping in classrooms - principal</h2>
        <p>
There's been a surge in the number of pupils being stood down for vaping or smoking.

            <p>Vaping and smoking are bigger issues in primary schools than secondary schools in many parts of New Zealand, government figures have revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, more students in years 1 to 8 were stood down for vaping and smoking than those in years 9 to 13 in six out of 10 regions, according to Ministry of Education data.</p>
        
            <p>The total number of students stood down for vaping or smoking increased almost 19 percent from 2022 to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>While the statistics did not separate vaping and smoking, vaping was the biggest issue, Rotorua's Kaitao Intermediate principal Phil Palfrey said.</p>
        
            <p>Some students were so severely addicted they would brazenly puff away in the classroom, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has permeated through our schools significantly, and has caused, for some students, behavioural issues which some of them wouldn't have exhibited previously."</p>
        
            <p>He understood the use of vapes as a smoking cessation tool, but said the effect of making them available to the general public was not thought through.</p>
        
            <p>Many Rotorua primary and intermediate schools now shared a new vaping policy focusing on educating kids and their parents.</p>
        
            <p>It was penned by Palfrey, and seemed to be working.</p>
        
            <p>Principals were at their "wits' end" in the middle of last year, but the issue seemed to die down towards the end of the year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I could be wrong, but I think that a lot of schools have just become better at dealing with it."</p>
        
            <p>But they should not have to, he said.</p>

            <p>The stand-down data was a measure of schools' reaction to vaping and smoking behaviour - rather than the behaviour itself, the Ministry of Education said.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of these events should not be used as a proxy measure for total student behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>But it indicated principals were concerned, New Zealand Principals' Federation president Leanne Otene said.</p>
        
            <p>"After educating and working with young people, they really are left with no choice but to take a harder line on it."</p>
        
            <p>It was a societal problem that had become a burden for schools, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We should all be concerned about this.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a problem that primary schools, or secondary school principals and their staff can deal with alone."</p>
        
            <p>The government was not yet taking the issue seriously enough, advocacy group Vape-free Kids co-founder Tammy Downer said.</p>
        
            <p>"People think that this is all kids just playing around, and it's cool, and it's appealing, and they're just trying to look cool.</p>
        
            <p>"Actually a lot of these kids are seriously addicted to it, they can't concentrate in class, they can't learn."</p>
        
            <p>Palfrey, Otene and Downer all agreed wider systemic change was needed to keep vapes out of students' hands.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, new regulations came into force requiring vapes to have a removable battery - meaning they were no longer disposable.</p>
        
            <p>But that had not made an ounce of difference, Downer said, because alternatives were available and were just as cheap.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] doesn't change the behaviour, people are still buying them, emptying them, throwing them in the back of the car or wherever, and buying the next one."</p>
        
            <p>The new government had an opportunity to make a real difference, Downer said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've said that they're going to be looking at the legislation around vaping and how to have an impact on the youth vaping epidemic.</p>
        
            <p>"They really need to step up and take some significant steps to help that happen."</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford was unavailable for an interview, but said in a statement that she was concerned about vaping and smoking in schools - particularly in primary schools.</p>
        
            <p>"The NZ First / National coalition agreement includes policies to ban disposable vaping products and increase penalties for illegal sales to those under 18," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Health officials have been asked to provide advice on the practical steps that will help stop young people from starting smoking and vaping."</p>
