            <p>A pilot has been rescued from the wreckage of their plane after a crash landing at Tauranga Airport this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple fire and emergency services were called to a light aircraft crash shortly before 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) says the plane did not catch fire, but the pilot - who was the only person on board - was trapped, requiring rescue equipment to cut them free.</p>
        
            <p>Shift manager Paul Radden said FENZ responds to a worst case scenario, which is why three crews - including the airport firefighters - were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>He said the person was now in the hands of St John's Ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Herald has reported that the person has been taken to Tauranga Hospital as a precaution.</p>
