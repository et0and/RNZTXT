            <p>A man who has spent 25 years in prison for the murder of west Auckland tyre-fitter Dean Fuller-Sandys has been granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Stone was imprisoned in 1999 for the murder, as well as the rape and murder of Leah Stephens.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Stone's conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal, alongside those of Gail Maney, Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen.</p>
        
            <p>The court ordered a retrial for Stone.</p>
        
            <p>Stone's lawyer Paul Wicks said: "An application for bail was filed in the High Court, not opposed by the Crown, and he's been granted bail today with conditions."</p>
        
            <p>The story of the murders is told in the RNZ/Stuff podcast Gone Fishing.</p>
