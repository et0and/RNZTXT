            <p>Police have spoken with former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman at her home as they continue to investigate shoplifting allegations made against her.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned from Parliament on Tuesday amid the allegations, saying her mental health had been badly affected by work-related stresses, and she wants to focus on her recovery.</p>
        
            <p>She said she took full responsibility for her actions and had fallen short of the standards expected of elected representatives.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a behaviour I can explain because it's not rational in any way, and after medical evaluation, I understand I'm not well," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Despite her resignation, the police investigation continues.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon a police spokesperson confirmed officers had visited an Auckland address as part of the ongoing investigation - but provided no further comment.</p>
        
            <p>The allegations involved Auckland clothing retailer Scotties Boutique and Wellington clothing store Cre8iveworx.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed they were investigating reports of an incident on 23 December. Police repeatedly refused to comment on any second alleged incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party confirmed on 10 January Ghahraman had temporarily stood down from her portfolio roles.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders later confirmed they had been informed of an allegation on 27 December, as well as a second incident at the same store.</p>
        
            <p>They had not said anything at the time, they said, because the store involved did not want it to be made public and was happy to wait for Ghahraman to return from a long-planned overseas trip.</p>
        
            <p>The third alleged incident to be made public - at Cre8iveworx on Wellington's Cuba Street - was claimed to have occurred on 26 October last year, about a week and a half after the election.</p>
