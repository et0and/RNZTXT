            <p>A resident in the Wellington suburb of Miramar says a nearby home invasion has left the community anxious.</p>
        
            <p>Lisa Kerr said she was checking her home's doors and windows after a resident was hurt in a fight with an intruder in the early hours of Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A second person was found unconscious and critically injured on nearby Camperdown Rd shortly after, however, it is not yet known if these incidents are linked.</p>
        
            <p>Police were back at the property of the home invasion on Darlington Rd on Tuesday and the hunt was still on for the intruder.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said she chose to live in the area because it felt safe and was a great place to raise children.</p>
        
            <p>"Miramar typically feels like a very safe community. It's got great school's and a great community vibe.</p>
        
            <p>"Where an actual intruder has been in someone's house - very invasive - and I think it does up the ante for the community. It does for me anyway.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely brings a different feeling. The house is fully locked down. The community are not feeling that great at the moment. We're kind of all taking it a bit more seriously," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are searching for a tall man of thin, athletic build, wearing a white cap in relation to the home invasion.</p>
        
            <p>They were still working to determine whether the man was linked to the more serious assault nearby.</p>

            <p>Kerr said the fact that a home was entered while residents were inside felt like "a different level of criminality".</p>
        
            <p>"If you go into a residential building there is absolutely always a risk that human beings are going to be inside and that person knows that.</p>
        
            <p>"Even with the lights out at two AM in the morning that person knows that's a possibility but yet they go in anyway. So it's definitely a different level of crime and that's the thing that I worry about," Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>Local business owner and resident Vijay Patal said this was uncommon in the area and came as a shock.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been here for the last 28 years, it's really peaceful here, hardly anything happens," he said.</p>
        
            <p>While, another resident, Marie Ward, said she had altered her daily walking route and avoided hidden pathways.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked the public for any information that could help them identify if the two incidents are linked.</p>
        
            <p>They have also asked residents to check their sections and yards for any items that may have been stolen or discarded by the offender.</p>
