            <p>Two people have been arrested after a woman's body was found in a bag in Auckland's Gulf Harbour earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The body was pulled from the water by a fisherman on 12 March, sparking a homicide investigation, and her identity has not been revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Simon Harrison says a woman and a man, both aged 36, were arrested late on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The pair will appear in the North Shore District Court on Monday, charged with interfering with human remains.</p>
        
            <p>Police are not ruling out further arrests or charges.</p>

            <p>Harrison said police were made aware on Sunday of the two people attempting to leave the country.</p>
        
            <p>He said a search warrant was being carried out at a residential address in Ōrewa in relation to the wider investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation is ongoing and police are speaking to a number of people at the address as part of our inquiries.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene guard is in place and will likely remain for the next couple of days while the investigation continues."</p>
        
            <p>There would be an increased police presence in Ōrewa, Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>The body of the woman, who was in her pyjamas, has still not been identified, Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to appeal to the public for any information which could assist us with identifying her."</p>
        
            <p>The public can contact us on 0800 755 021 to speak directly to the investigation team.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
