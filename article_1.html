            <p>Z Energy is swapping out street names for 'correct' kupu on fuel stops around the country, with the help of local hapū.</p>
        
            <p>When Z took over 226 fuel sites from Shell in 2010, the easy solution was to name the respective stations after the streets they were on, or near.</p>
        
            <p>But when it named the Kahikatea Drive station in Kirikiriroa Z - K Drive, the company's Māori advisor questioned the abbreviation.</p>
        
            <p>"Kahikatea is the correct name. That led to a bigger conversation about where are we with our knowledge as we start to learn a bit more about te reo Māori and acknowledging interconnected-ness of all things, like, where else are there opportunities to do it," Z Energy customer general manager Andy Baird said.</p>
        
            <p>After 12 months of whakawhanaungatanga (relationship building), the company was guided by Te Hā o te Whenua o Kirikiriroa on changing the name of Z Dinsdale to Z Tuhikaramea.</p>
        
            <p>That led to two other stations being renamed - New Plymouth's Z Courtenay Street became Z Huatoki, while Hamilton's Five Cross Roads station became Z Te Papanui.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not about ticking a box per se, this is about a bigger sort of commitment that we have to te reo Māori and obviously to the communities that we operate in, so it's a much bigger broader long-term programme," Baird said.</p>

            <p>There had also been an internal drive to incorporate more use of te reo, kicking off each day with karakia, Baird said.</p>
        
            <p>It added more of a connection between the company and Māori traditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been adding bilingual language inside the sites but we have equally taken the time to make sure that we're getting the right dialects as the regions as we go through it.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of the project this year was to sort of understand the process that we go through in terms of engagement with mana whenua and how they want things to happen and occur, and how we can come together to make that really a great outcome for local communities we operate in."</p>
        
            <p>The company could have changed the station names off the bat, but Baird said consulting with local hapū and iwi was the right thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>"The opportunity to meet them, to start to engage with mana whenua and to build a relationship with them and to do something that they're just as proud of as we are, was just as important as the actual name."</p>
        
            <p>Each site's name was gifted by the hapū, with careful consideration of the history of the whenua.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Te Whiti hapū in Ngāmotu was thrilled to play a big part in renaming the Courtenay Street petrol station and included its Facebook community in making the decision.</p>
        
            <p>It had a kete of three names that went to a vote - the name Huatoki was favoured.</p>
        
            <p>Julie Healey of Ngāti Te Whiti said it was only fitting to have the name Huatoki, as the awa flowed just around the corner from the petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>"Huatoki is probably all the life essence of New Plymouth at the beginning. We have the pā Puke Ariki at the front and then we have the other pā around, I think there's about five or six different pā in that area."</p>
        
            <p>The hapū was in its rebuilding phase and was working towards a Huatoki restoration plan with the New Plymouth District Council, so when Z approached it at the start of the year, the timing could not have been better, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we were approached, I just thought straight away 'this is going to work brilliantly with our Huātoki', and I was hoping whānau would vote that way, and they did. It just made sense, it was consistent."</p>

            <p>She praised Z for taking the right steps to engage with locals.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our whānau, Damon Ritai, met the people outside Puke Ariki Museum, talked to them about the museum, the designs, the cultural expression on the museum, the meaning of the different things of whakapapa on the ceremonial doors, all the names that were in the foyer, and explained everything about those."</p>
        
            <p>The cultural induction hīkoi ended at Te Whare Honanga (Taranaki Cathedral) where they had refreshments.</p>
        
            <p>Then, the hapū worked on the dialect, something Healey triple-checked before giving the nod of approval.</p>
        
            <p>"This is about reclaiming our language and culture, not as a political act, but as a celebration.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always a good opportunity for hapū to try and get those names, you know, renaming before the colonial names, taking things back to language and culture."</p>
        
            <p>Z Energy aimed to rename more petrol stations but first, more whakawhanaungatanga, Baird said.</p>
