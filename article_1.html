            <p>Parts of the South Island are in for some snow and despite some reports that Auckland will see snow next week, it is unlikely.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury high country and inland Otago are bracing for heavy snowfall on Friday morning with orange warnings in place.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said up to 25 centimetres of snow is forecast to settle above 600 metres in Otago, and up to 20cm in Canterbury, south of the Rakaia river.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an orange heavy rain warning is in place for Westland until noon, and snow warnings in place until 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law told Morning Report there was a "fair bit of snow" already coming through on the webcams on Crown Range Road and at Queenstown Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Moisture resulting from the cold air and slow-moving front made for the "perfect conditions" for snow to continue piling up throughout the day.</p>
        
            <p>Law said the heaviest snowfall expected was up to 25cm in inland parts of Otago.</p>
        
            <p>"That's still high enough to run across the passes, say the Crown Range Road, places like the Lindis Pass as we head further north as well, that snow moves up into places like Arthur's and Porters Pass. so well worth keeping that in mind if you're planning your journey across those higher passes of the South Island today."</p>

            <p>Snowfall in some central Otago towns is causing power outages to about 3000 homes.</p>
        
            <p>About 1100 homes in Alexandra are without power, according to the Aurora Energy website.</p>
        
            <p>There are also 850 homes without power near Lauder, almost 800 homes without power around Cromwell, and 650 homes are without power near Clyde.</p>
        
            <p>Aurora said crews are investigating the outage.</p>
        
            <p>Lauder resident Darryl Jones said he lost power to his home around 5.15am and there had been a "decent dump" of snow.</p>
        
            <p>He was not quite snowed in but "you wouldn't want to be driving at the moment".</p>
        
            <p>Jones said there was not much that could be done given the weather and that he might go for a wander and snap some pictures.</p>

            <p>Toast was off the menu with the power out but a cup of tea was still possible with the log burner.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "golden rule" to always have plenty of firewood in central Otago, Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>He had lived in the area for about 30 years and it was not unheard of to get a decent dump - but it was heavier than it had been in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Canterbury could see snow up on the foothills and higher areas - but it was likely to be wetter than anything on the plains.</p>
        
            <p>And in response to reports that Auckland could see snow next week?</p>
        
            <p>Law said next week would see "good, strong southwesterlies" and cold air being pushed up the country.</p>
        
            <p>Snow may be seen on the Desert Road and central plateau but not Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I think next week is going to be a reminder that spring is a fairly volatile season with the weather changing pretty quickly."</p>
