        <p>
Clouds are rolling in and they could let loose on the day. But large parts of the country have reason to celebrate.

            <p>The clouds are rolling in over most of the country today, bringing a risk of showers over the weekend which could let loose on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice said it is keeping a close eye on this moisture spreading across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice meteorologist John Law said there are two systems moving over New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The main story for Friday will be one of cloud."</p>
        
            <p>"To the south, there is a band of cloud associated with a front which has been bringing a fair bit of heavy rain in towards parts of Fiordland over the last few days," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And to the north, an area of low pressure spilling high cloud across those northern parts of the country."</p>
        
            <p>The afternoon may bring showers to parts of Central Otago and up to the Mackenzie Country, with a small risk of thunder.</p>
        
            <p>There will be spots of drizzle for Wellington and the Wairarapa for the morning but the clouds should break up as the day continues.</p>
        
            <p>The top of the North Island may also see some light scattered rain, alongside the higher areas of the central plateau and Hawke's Bay,</p>
        
            <p>Despite the clouds, Law said there will be highs widely above 20 degrees Celsius, with 25C for Auckland and across to Whakatane.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead to Christmas Day, currently there will be showery activity around the west facing coasts of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>It will generally be drier and warmer on the east coast.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a decent story in fact for most of the South Island... including Nelson and Canterbury."</p>
        
            <p>He said, those with rain in their Christmas Day forecast "shouldn't give up all hope."</p>
        
            <p>There is "wriggle room" around the distribution and timing of wet weather and the temperature continues to remain on the warmer side of average.</p>
        
            <p>"Those hoping to have a day at the beach on the 25th will need to keep a close eye on the forecast over the weekend and it's recommended to have a wet weather plan in case those showers do happen to turn up at your place," Metservice meteorologist Lewis Ferris said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is set to have one of its top three hottest years on record, said NIWA.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA meteorologist Tristan Meyers said 2022 was the country's warmest year on record, surpassing the record set the year before in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the first half of December had mostly average temperatures, a sultry 33C temperature reading in North Canterbury yesterday marked a hot and humid finish to the year, helping to keep 2023 near the top of the rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Meyers said rankings would be confirmed in NIWA's annual climate summary released in January next month.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, the forecast for the week between Christmas and New Year looks to remain warm with a mix of rainy and more settled days.</p>
