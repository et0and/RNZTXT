            <p>The three men accused of murdering New Zealand woman Trish McKay in Newport, California have reportedly refused to leave their jail cells to attend a court appearance.</p>
        
            <p>There is also said to be growing anger because one of the accused was free on probation, despite earlier similar convictions, including one in 2023 for a similar robbery.</p>
        
            <p>Patricia McKay, 68, died outside a Newport Beach mall during an attempted robbery when she was hit by one of the alleged offenders' cars last week.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband was 69-year-old Doug McKay, a former chair of the BNZ board. They were both friends of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>The three accused made brief appearances via video links from their cells on Monday (local time) after refusing to appear in court as required, the Los Angeles Times is reporting.</p>
        
            <p>The judge re-scheduled them to appear on Wednesday at a plea hearing, and ordered that they appear then.</p>
        
            <p>Daily Mail reported the three accused, who were to have appeared before Judge Andre Manssourian in Orange County Superior Court, had "pulled the same stunt" for a scheduled hearing last Friday, refusing to move from their cells just 200 metres from the courtroom.</p>
        
            <p>In their brief video appearance on Monday - which happened after sheriff'' deputies got iPads to their jail cells - all three had been shirtless and none of them spoke, Daily Mail reported.</p>
        
            <p>The judge on Monday had seemed puzzled as to why the three were not to brought to court, saying he heard "something about a 24-hour psychiatric hold", and asking deputies to give him a report "in writing as to why they are not in court right now".</p>
        
            <p>The three accused could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted, but California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.</p>
        
            <p>The three murder accused are: Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, the alleged driver of the car that hit McKay, also charged with attempted second-degree robbery, and evading while driving recklessly.</p>
        
            <p>Jaden Cunningham, 18, also charged with attempted second-degree robbery.</p>
        
            <p>Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, who allegedly fired three shots at someone who chased after the fleeing car, is also charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm, as well as attempted second-degree robbery.</p>
        
            <p>LA Times described McCrary as a "third-striker" who had not served prison time for his most recent two convictions for felony crimes - more serious crimes in comparison to misdemeanours - in LA County.</p>
        
            <p>Among his other previous convictions, McCrary had been given two years' probation for an armed robbery, in which he and another suspect placed a gun to the head of a man while taking his Rolex watch, LA Times reported.</p>
        
            <p>Asked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement that the case against McCrary had significant problems with proof.</p>
