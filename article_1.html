        <h2>Crews battle fire on Auckland maunga overnight</h2>
        <p>
Large flames and billowing smoke could be seen in the area.
</p>
        
            <p>A grass fire that broke out on Māngere Mountain in Auckland on Saturday night has now been 99 percent contained.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were called to the scene, near Domain Road, just before 9:30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Seven crews fought the blaze, with firefighters also standing guard at the entrance to the road and turning away people who were trying to get a closer look at the flames.</p>
        
            <p>Two crews remained on site overnight.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said more would go back later on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A number of users on social media had posted images of the blaze, which sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

            <p>There was the smell of thick smoke in the air, but the extent of any damage was unclear.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Fire and Emergency asked people to stay away from the area to allow crews to work.</p>
        
            <p>"People on the western side of the mountain may experience smoke.</p>
        
            <p>"If they are affected, they should stay inside and close all windows and doors."</p>
