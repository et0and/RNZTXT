            <p>Christchurch police have been interviewing witnesses and family members as they try and piece together what led to a woman being found critically injured at a park.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was discovered at the Richmond Village Green on Stanmore Road last Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the woman remained in hospital, but her condition was now stable and they had spoken to her.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were continuing to work to establish the full picture of what happened, and who was responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"While police do not believe there is an ongoing risk to the wider public, additional patrols have been operating in the area to ensure the community feels safe," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are still appealing to anyone who may have information that would help us determine what happened."</p>
        
            <p>Information can be passed to Police via the 105 phone service, or by going online and using 'Update Report', referencing file number 250205/8067.</p>
        
            <p>People who live near the park previously told RNZ day-drinkers, drug users and homeless people spent time there.</p>
        
            <p>A woman, who did not wish to be named, said it was a "dodgy area" so she avoided the park.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always people loitering around, I don't see many families go and play there apart from... I'd say like, druggies. There's always older people just standing around the park, I wouldn't say it's safe for kids. I don't usually go around walking."</p>
