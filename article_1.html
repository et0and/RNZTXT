            <p>Dairy giant Fonterra has confirmed it will sell its consumer business, including major brands Anchor and Mainland.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Miles Hurrell said it has decided a sale was in the co-operative's best interests.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been working with our team of advisors to assess potential divestment options, the assets and businesses in scope, and the best pathway to maximise value for our Co-op."</p>
        
            <p>"This work, coupled with the confidence we have in our revised strategic direction, has confirmed a divestment of our global Consumer and associated businesses is in the best interests of the Co-op," Hurrell said. </p>
        
            <p>The sale would include consumer business brands Anchor, Mainland, Kāpiti, Anlene, Anmum, Fernleaf, Western Star, Perfect Italiano and others, which make a range of products, including butter, cheese, and infant formula.</p>
        
            <p>The divestment would also include integrated businesses, Fonterra Oceania and Fonterra Sri Lanka, 17 manufacturing sites around the world, including three in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have received meaningful buyer interest in the businesses in scope for divestment, which is testament to their strength and potential, " Hurrell said.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra has opted to make ingredients and high value dairy based products for other consumer food makers, which it has said will create a more focused and higher performing business.  </p>
        
            <p>Hurrell said it had yet to decide on how to sell the businesses, either through a direct sale to industry players, known as a trade sale, or through an initial public offering (IPO) which would put the assets into a separate company and sell shares in it.</p>
        
            <p>"A final decision on which divestment pathway to pursue will be based on several factors, including which option will result in optimal long-term value for the Co-op."</p>
        
            <p>Farmer shareholders would vote on the final option for divestment, which would deliver a "significant" capital return to them.</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth Barr investment analyst Matt Montgomerie said the consumer business had been a "problem child" for a long time and its sale made sense.</p>
        
            <p>"Focussing on the core business, where it has delivered more success - particularly China Foodservice - is the right strategy. Selling branded consumer products is not a core strength, as evidenced by its poor performance over a prolonged period."</p>
        
            <p>He estimated the sale could bring in between $2.5-$3.5 billion.</p>
