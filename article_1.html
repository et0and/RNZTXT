        <h2>Fire 'extensively damages' Auckland backpackers lodge</h2>
        <p>
Fire and Emergency crews have contained a fire at a backpackers lodge in Parnell, Auckland that saw smoke cover much of the central city.
</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand crews have now contained a fire at the City Garden Lodge in Parnell, Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commander Gary Lane said crews were first alerted to the incident just after 4.30pm by the building's fire alarm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency subsequently received multiple 111 calls.</p>
        
            <p>"At the peak of the fire there were 16 fire trucks in attendance. This evening 10 crews remain on site, alongside a number of support vehicles," Lane said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our crews have been using a ladder truck to pour water on the fire and this seems to have knocked it back well.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire is now contained but crews will remain on standby overnight."</p>
        
            <p>Approximately 10 people were evacuated, police said. No injuries were reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there are no concerns that anyone remains in the building.</p>
        
            <p>Local MP David Seymour was at the scene, and told RNZ the fire was a tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>The lodge had some long-term boarders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These are people who often don't have a lot."</p>
        
            <p>Some may have lost all their possessions, and were being helped to find alternative accommodation, said Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>"There's also a big flat of younger people who actually gave food and clothes to a lot of the people there."</p>

            <p>Police earlier said one person was arrested after they were called to a "disorder" at City Garden Lodge, in St George's Bay Road, just after 4.30pm, but the person has since been released without charge.</p>
        
            <p>Residents told RNZ they'd witnessed troubling behaviour from residents of the lodge.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour acknowledged there had been some "pretty unruly people" that had been a nuisance to neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly true that three hostels in a quite small area of Parnell have been causing a lot of unrest and disturbance."</p>
        
            <p>But that was only a relatively small number of residents, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's also good people there who just want to go to work tomorrow, and we should be worried about their safety."</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard will be in place overnight until a fire investigator can begin looking into the cause of the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ is asking the public to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>
The fire at City Garden Lodge could be seen across the city.
