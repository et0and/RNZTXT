            <p>Police have confirmed they are responding to emails of a concerning nature directed at organisations, including schools and hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>They are working to establish the origin of the emails and are yet to establish any actual threat.</p>
        
            <p>Staff are working with those impacted and will respond based on individual circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Police acknowledge how unsettling these emails are for all concerned.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
