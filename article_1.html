            <p>Dame Lisa was the fastest qualifier for the K1 500 semi-finals with a time of 1:48.51 in her heat, while Fisher qualified second-fastest in a time of 1:49.16.</p>
        
            <p>Golfer Lydia Ko is also chasing gold in the women's tournament, heading into the final round tied for first with Switzerland's Morgane MÃ©traux.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Hamish Kerr is hoping to become the first New Zealander to claim a high jump medal  in his final at 5.10am Sunday.</p>
