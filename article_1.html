            <p>Thousands of people are expected to protest against the Fast-track Approvals Bill and other government policies in Auckland on Saturday, with other demonstrations planned across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday afternoon's March For Nature in Tāmaki Makaurau will see protesters march from Aotea Square down Queen Street.</p>
        
            <p>The organisers said they were expecting thousands of people to turn out for the protest against the fast-track legislation and what they called the coalition's "general war on nature".</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport is warning city centre visitors of road closures and traffic between 12pm and 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be some detours to city centre bus routes," it said, asking people to plan ahead.</p>
        
            <p>AT said the city centre would still be accessible by public transport.</p>
        
            <p>But access to the Downtown Car Park may be restricted or closed for a short period of time, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Other March for Nature protests would be held around the motu, including Nelson, Whakatāne, Christchurch and Tākaka.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in Wellington, the People Over Profits march would protest government cuts to public services and job losses.</p>
        
            <p>As of this week, about 6000 jobs had been cut in the public sector as the government looked to make $1.5 billion in savings.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were aware of the protests and advised anyone travelling in the affected areas to allow time for their journey.</p>
