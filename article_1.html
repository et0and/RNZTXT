            <p>A New Zealander has died following a helicopter accident in Canada last week.</p>
        
            <p>Lewis Ainsworth was on board the Northern Escape Heli-Ski helicopter in his professional capacity as a heli-ski guide, when it crashed near the town of Terrace in British Columbia on 22 January.</p>
        
            <p>The 35-year-old was president of the New Zealand Mountain Guides Association and accredited by the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ainsworth's family - which included a 10-year-old daughter - said it was "heartbroken" by his death.</p>
        
            <p>"Lewis is a highly respected member of the New Zealand and international mountaineering and skiing community. He is loved by many and will be dearly missed by all those who have been fortunate enough to know Lewis and have shared in his passion for being in the mountains."</p>
        
            <p>The family thanked those who had been involved in the search and rescue operation and Ainsworth's medical care over the past week.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the helicopter crash is being investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the crash, but had not been approached to provide consular assistance.</p>
        
            <p>Ainsworth had previously worked as a mountain guide for Alpine Guides Aoraki Mt Cook, Aoraki/Mount Cook Search and Rescue, and as a ski patroller, avalanche forecaster and hard ice glacier guide.</p>
