            <p>More police are being allocated for public transport in Auckland, in the wake of the fatal stabbing on a bus in Onehunga this week.</p>
        
            <p>Bernice Maychurch was killed on the Number 74 bus on Wednesday afternoon, with 37-year-old Kael Leona has been charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in the Auckland District Court on Friday morning after handing himself into police on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said it was a senseless and horrific attack and people deserve to safe on buses, trains and ferries.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a greater police presence across public transport in Auckland as a result, Mitchell added.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Transport Minister Simeon Brown confirmed he and Mitchell would be sitting down with Auckland Transport on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Saturday, Mitchell said he and Brown were working together, alongside Police and Auckland Transport in response.</p>
        
            <p>"This attack has shaken Aucklanders, and particularly public transport users," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Government utterly condemns this senseless and horrific loss of life, and is taking action to make public transport safer for workers and passengers alike.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis deserve to be able to get on a bus, train or ferry and be safe doing so. That is why the Government is determined to create a safer environment for everyone on public transport."</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said he would be looking into whether the Sentencing Amendment Bill should expand aggravating factors to all public transport users.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>"An expansion could include making offences against all public transport users an aggravating factor, ensuring greater protection for those who rely on buses, trains, and ferries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Bill already provides for a new aggravating factor for offences against public transport workers.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>"This is about making sure that public transport remains safe for everyone, whether you are a worker or a passenger. It sends a clear message that violence and abuse in these spaces will not be tolerated."</p>
        
            <p>Brown added the government would ensure the $15 million in Budget 2024 funding for bus driver safety and work conditions is provided to Public Transport Authorities by the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>He said the funding will be used for safety improvements, including retrofitted safety screens and real-time CCTV monitoring.</p>
