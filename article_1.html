            <p>Google searches and documents found on a computer owned by Pauline Hanna, who was allegedly murdered by her husband, are being discussed in the High Court in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne is on trial for the 2021 murder of Hanna, and staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Police constable Madeleine Palmer took the stand on Friday morning to continue giving evidence, which began on Thursday about the contents of laptops owned by Hanna and Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2020, months before Hanna's death in April 2021, a Google search was made asking "why do people trample over me?", along with searches for the Alcoholics Anonymous website along with saving documents about dealing with extra-marital affairs.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC, quizzed Palmer on the "why do people trample over me?" search on Friday morning and quizzed her on whether she knew if it related to her marriage with Polkinghorne or relationships with co-workers or extended family.</p>
        
            <p>Palmer told the court she did not know, as the only record is the search itself.</p>
        
            <p>On the night before Hanna's death, she emailed a document to Polkinghorne which was a proposed resignation letter for Polkinghorne's job at Auckland Eye.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield asked Palmer if it looked as if Hanna had "tidied up" or edited the letter for Polkinghorne and then sent it back to him, which Palmer agreed with.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday afternoon, a document, entitled Philip.docx, which Hanna emailed to herself on 5 January 2020, was read by Palmer.</p>
        
            <p>In it, Hanna appeared to respond to an email from Polkinghorne that suggested she did not contribute financially.</p>
        
            <p>"I do buy you things, I do buy family gifts, I take and collect your drycleaning, or at least used to. You don't let me now as you put it under your own name. I don't wear body suits, I don't pick up the glasses by their upper rim, etc etc as you keep criticising me."</p>
        
            <p>She apologised to Polkinghorne and said she felt "devastation" she had "let him down so badly".</p>
        
            <p>"l am so sorry. You are everything to me and you have changed. I haven't, but clearly I have not read your signals.</p>
        
            <p>"I still have bucket loads of love. I think you do too."</p>
        
            <p>Hanna asked Polkinghorne if he wanted a divorce to do it before 31 January 2020 so she could make arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to Hanna, also read in court by Palmer, Polkinghorne told his wife of 20 years he felt "increasingly devoid in the last few months" from their relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know where the bucket load of love went but there you have it."</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne said he had enrolled in a three-day retreat in Auckland: Moving on, or Up, and intended to return to their Rings Beach bach on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>"I am leaving in a few minutes and I am sorry I haven't prepared everything at the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what the outcome of this retreat will be but to be frank without some sort of insight I am sure I will not be able to continue. If there is a pill to make it easier, don't worry I would take the bottle."</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
