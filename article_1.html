            <p>Police say there have been eight arrests related to a gang funeral in Napier today, for flouting patch ban rules and causing disorder.</p>
        
            <p>The Mongrel Mob is farewelling its Napier president Heil Dogg, also known as Angus Benson and Angus Ratima.</p>
        
            <p>Extra police have been brought in from around the country, and a number of road checkpoints set up.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Area Commander Inspector Lincoln Sycamore said the police operation continued this evening, as funeral attendees dispersed from the Wharerangi Lawn Cemetery.</p>
        
            <p>While there had been "relatively few issues" at the event itself, earlier today three people were arrested for displaying gang insignia at various locations around Napier.</p>
        
            <p>At the Napier Tech clubrooms there were four more arrests for disorder offences, with those arrested receiving dispersal notices in addition to disorder related charges.</p>
        
            <p>Another man was arrested on Douglas McLean Avenue for displaying gang insignia and breaching his bail conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Several other breaches had been noted and would be followed up, Sycamore said, including traffic offending during the funeral procession.</p>
        
            <p>He said police appreciated Napier residents' patience with travel delays caused by the procession.</p>
        
            <p>"Gang members had been generally compliant with the Gangs Act 2024 and where there have been breaches that have not been able to be dealt with safely, information has been gathered to help enable potential follow-up action."</p>
        
            <p>Sycamore said police would maintain a visible presence into the evening and overnight, and across the city tomorrow as mourners leave Hawke's Bay.</p>
