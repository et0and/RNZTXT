            <p>The father of a Christchurch man fatally shot by a US police officer says his family has been seeking closure for almost two years.</p>
        
            <p>Christian Glass, 22, died on 11 June 2022, after he was shot by police in Silver Plume, Clear Creek County in Colorado.</p>
        
            <p>He was born in Christchurch but his parents Simon and Sally relocated to Boulder, Colorado, when he was 10.</p>
        
            <p>Former Colorado police officer Andrew Buen was found guilty of reckless endangerment, but the jury could not reach a verdict on the murder charge, nor could they decide whether Buen was guilty of misconduct.</p>
        
            <p>Christian's father, Simon Glass, said the process kept dragging on.</p>
        
            <p>"We felt it was a pretty clear case. We're surprised and disappointed and looking forward to a re-trial or whatever they do next.</p>
        
            <p>"It's [the verdict] not enough, from our point of view, not at all.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been 22 months since Christian was [fatally shot] ... we were told initially it was Christian's fault. The officers [involved] ... were only fired when the district attorney filed charges ... so it's been a very slow process."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, former police officer Kyle Gould pleaded guilty to failing to intervene to stop the unlawful use of force against Glass.</p>

            <p>Glass said the Colorado state had made positive changes since his son's death, as part of a settlement deal, to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Clear Creek County has agreed to establish a dedicated crisis response team in the county by 1 January 2025, and to dedicate a public park to Christian.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement after the verdict on Saturday, his parents also spoke about more training for officers in the state.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Siddhartha Rathod, who is representing Glass' parents, said a second trial could happen later this year.</p>
