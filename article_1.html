            <p>Around this time every year, skyrocket blasts and exploding fireworks terrify many New Zealand pets.</p>
        
            <p>Guy Fawkes, in particular, can be a hellscape for fur parents, whose pooches, cats or ponies end up quaking in a corner or galloping about in a panicked state.</p>
        
            <p>There could, however, be some respite for animals and humans alike on 5 November.</p>
        
            <p>In a radio first, RNZ and the SPCA are hosting a special Guy Fawkes Concert for Animals, with music specially selected to calm your pets.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert content director Liisa McMillan said it recognised Guy Fawkes could be a stressful time for animals and their humans.</p>
        
            <p>"We're excited to offer some special radio programming that we hope will provide distraction and enjoyment for both," McMillan said.</p>
        
            <p>Concert for Animals is a free broadcast to 5 November that seeks to reduce the harm fireworks can cause by using music to calm, engage and enrich animals.</p>

            <p>SPCA scientific officer Dr Alison Vaughan helped come up with the idea.</p>
        
            <p>She told Checkpoint many of the pieces had already been used in animal research, and included classical works and "soft rock".</p>
        
            <p>Most of the Concert for Animals music will be "soothing, cheerful, slow and not too low" in pitch - the latter could be "alarming" for animals, she said.</p>

            <p>There were more than four million companion animals in Aotearoa, many of whom could be frightened by the unpredictable explosive sounds and flashes of light created by fireworks, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"SPCA has long called for the private sale and use of fireworks to be banned - in the meantime, we remain focused on controlling what we can.</p>
        
            <p>"Fireworks are not just one night - it causes distress and concerns to many animals for a much longer period."</p>
        
            <p>Vaughan encouraged New Zealanders to put the welfare and care of animals at the centre of their plans for the evening, telling Checkpoint that it can be a "very stressful night" for owners and pets.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people will have experienced animals with a fear of fireworks - you'll see them hiding, shivering."</p>
        
            <p>Anxiety over fireworks affected four out of five horses, and they were at risk of injuring themselves because - unlike smaller pets - they could not be kept safe inside.</p>
        
            <p>Vaughan said growing up, she had spent many Guy Fawkes nights up in the paddock, helping to keep her horses calm. "It was always a very anxious night."</p>
        
            <p>Apart from tuning in to the Concert for Animals, she advised pet parents to plan ahead, talk with vet about possible medications and make sure pets were inside after dusk, to prevent them running away.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most important things was to be there for them; cuddle them if they needed, or leave them alone if they preferred.</p>
        
            <p>Animals in the care of SPCA shelters around the country will also get to enjoy Concert for Animals, Vaughan said.</p>
