            <p>A King's College staff member has resigned after admitting to inappropriate online behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Auckland college said the staff member, who was involved in football and in boarding, was under the impression that he was engaging with a minor, and had resigned, effective immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"The staff member has told us that his inappropriate online activity has not involved any King's College student. We are not aware of any student involvement and this is the first time we have been notified of any concerns relating to his behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>King's College said the matter was very concerning and its priority was supporting students through this news.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
