        <h2>Hurricanes Poua again calls out government with haka</h2>
        <p>
The Hurricanes Poua have again called out the government in a haka, and Winston Peters has said the team may "lose support" by "going woke".

            <p>The Hurricanes Poua have defied orders not to take a political stance with their haka, and again called out the government, while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has said the team may "lose support" by "going woke".</p>
        
            <p>The side caused a massive controversy this week, after their pre-match haka against Manawa made reference to a "redneck government".</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes CEO Avan Lee earlier told RNZ the franchise would apologise for the haka, and that it would not happen again.</p>
        
            <p>But prior to kick off in this afternoon's clash with Matatū in Wellington, Poua performed another alternative haka with references to the government and to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Poua haka leader Leilani Perese doubled down on last week's performance, hitting back at opponents and saying the government should "whakangarongaro" or disappear.</p>
        
            <p>Perese smiled before rallying the team, calling out those who said women should not haka and presented the team as "āhuru te ārangi" - trouble-makers or disruptors.</p>
        
            <p>In a post tonight on X - formerly known as Twitter - Winston Peters blasted the Hurricanes saying they were "trying to insult the government".</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes may well lose support and viewers because the CEO has a bunch of naive players damaging the brand by attempting to wade into partisan political activism without any concept of reality. They are trying to insult the government but are instead now just slapping the… pic.twitter.com/7VcXkKA18Z</p>
        
            <p>"The Hurricanes may well lose support and viewers because the CEO has a bunch of naive players damaging the brand by attempting to wade into partisan political activism without any concept of reality," Peters wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"They are trying to insult the government but are instead now just slapping the Hurricane brand and CEO in the face. Go woke go broke.</p>

            <p>The rugby was just as dramatic, Poua needing a late try to seal a pulsating 36-29 win.</p>
        
            <p>With the score locked up with just minutes remaining, replacement Cilia-Marie Po'e-Tofaeono struck the decisive blow for Poua.</p>
        
            <p>Shakira Baker was sensational for the Poua, bagging two tries while Isabella Waterman was a constant threat from the back.</p>
        
            <p>Poua captain Jackie Patea-Fereti said tonight was about showing Aotearoa what they can do.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a hard week, so this means a lot, we done our words last week, now it's through our actions."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was especially proud of her bench for coming on and finishing the job.</p>
        
            <p>Matatu put first points on the board through the boot of Rosie Kelly.</p>
        
            <p>It was a charged downed Kelly clearance which lead to the first try for Poua, Monica Tagoai proving too powerful close to the line.</p>
        
            <p>Baker bagged her first shortly after, showing nifty footwork to dance past the Matatu defence.</p>
        
            <p>The visitors struck back as Kelly sliced through the line to score by the sticks and Matatu then took the lead as English import McGoverne charged into her opponent and did enough to stretch out and score.</p>
        
            <p>Just as the siren sounded, Poua stripped possession and fired it wide to Baker who found a gaping hole and stormed away for her second to give her side a 19-15 lead at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Just one minute into the second, Poua winger Harmony Kautai snatched an intercept on halfway and streaked away for her side's fourth.</p>

            <p>The Canes went back to back as some slick passing put Leilani Hakiwai over in the right corner.</p>
        
            <p>Number Kaipo Olsen-Baker stormed her way through some weak Poua defence to get herself over the chalk, only for the ball to slip through her fingers as she attempted to ground it.</p>
        
            <p>However, just sixty seconds later she would make no such mistake, dotting down to bring her team back within seven with 15 to play.</p>
        
            <p>The try swung the pendulum firmly on Matatu's side, a relentless onslaught eventually seeing Poua crack, Amy Rhule rumbling over with Kelly's conversion evening the honours at 29 apiece.</p>
        
            <p>Po'e-Tofaeono then sealed things for her side as he barged over in the 77th, Poua hanging on for a dramatic win.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Chiefs Manawa are two from two to start their Super Rugby Aupiki campaign after holding off the Blues women 17-10 this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The big names struck early for the visitors, Black Ferns stars Grace Steinmetz and Ruby Tui scoring to give Manawa a 12-0 lead at Bell Park.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues pulled them back early in the second with two tries of their own through Tafito Lafaele and Mel Puckett to reduce the margin to two.</p>
        
            <p>However, just five minutes in Grace Kukutai pounced on a Blues mistake, to stretch it back to 17-10, with the Blues unable to convert their late chances.</p>
        
            <p>Scorers</p>
        
            <p>Poua 36 (Baker 2, Tagoai, Kautai, Hakiwai, Po'e-Tofaeono. tries, Waterman 3 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Matatu 29 (Kelly, McGoverne, Olsen-Baker, Rhule, tries, Kelly 1 pen, 3 cons)</p>
        
            <p>Manawa 17 (Tui, Steinmetz, Kukutai tries, Holmes 1 con)</p>
        
            <p>Blues 10 (Lafaele, Puckett tries)</p>
