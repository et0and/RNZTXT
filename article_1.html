            <p>Police in Auckland say two children were sleeping in a bedroom when its windows were struck by gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Senior Sergeant Scott Armstrong said residents at a property in the Auckland suburb of Point England reported hearing gunshots at about about 1.10am this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Several windows in the house were shattered, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are speaking to those affected and providing support, including to two school-age children who were sleeping in a bedroom when its windows were struck," he said.</p>
        
            <p>No one was seriously hurt but the residents were understandably shaken, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"One person suffered a minor injury from a shard of broken glass, and it was only a matter of luck that someone wasn't seriously injured by this reckless act," Armstrong said.</p>
        
            <p>Police are seeking information from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or any suspicious activity in Holland Avenue in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
