            <p>Minutes after the news broke, distraught fans - most in their 20s and 30s - and onlookers gathered near the scene in the Argentine capital, where medical teams were still at work.</p>
        
            <p>"The news hit me hard," fan Pilar Bilik, 27, said on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like it's a part of adolescence lost," fan Lena Duek, 21, said outside the hotel, adding she had been hoping for the band, which accompanied her teen years, to reunite.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in shock, I can't believe it. I live five blocks away and thought I had to be here," One Direction fan Martina Di Lalla, 23, told AFP outside the hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Alberto Crescenti, the director of an emergency medical response group, known as SAME, told the site the man was dead when they arrived, having suffered fatal injuries in a fall.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no way to do anything."</p>
        
            <p>He they confirmed his death and later learnt the man was a singer.</p>
        
            <p>An autopsy was expected and police were investigating.</p>
        
            <p>A police statement announced that "Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel."</p>
        
            <p>The British singer had been due to perform in Argentina last month but his South American tour was cancelled due to health problems.</p>

            <p>Local media have been quick to point out his history of problems with alcohol use and mental health.</p>
        
            <p>La Nacion newspaper said half an hour before his death Payne posted a video with his girlfriend on Snapchat saying it was a "beautiful day in Argentina".</p>
        
            <p>The images do not appear to have been shot in the Buenos Aires hotel where he died.</p>
        
            <p>Boy band sensation One Direction emerged in 2010 when then-teenagers Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik appeared on British television contest "The X Factor."</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, the group announced it was going on an indefinite hiatus, but not splitting up.</p>
        
            <p>Payne announced he was working on a solo album that same year, following in the footsteps of other band members.</p>
