            <p>A network outage is causing queues and backlog at Auckland International Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The airport said an external network outage was creating delays.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic travel was not affected.</p>
        
            <p>However, there was congestion in the international check-in area and processing was slower, the airport said.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers were advised to get in touch with their airlines.</p>
        
            <p>Last month a security breach at the airport caused disruption for travellers as all passengers had to be rescreened.</p>
