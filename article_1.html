            <p>A member of a committee that ran Roxburgh's historic cinema says the community is "devastated" after a Waitangi Day fire gutted the building.</p>
        
            <p>A total of eight crews of firefighters responded to the blaze in the middle of the central Otago town, which destroyed the Roxburgh Town Hall, including its 128-year-old cinema.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which has now been extinguished, broke out shortly before midday forcing neighbouring properties to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>A crew remained at the scene overnight with a fire investigator to check for a possible cause on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The facility on Scotland Street included the town hall, supper room and 258-seat auditorium and boutique cinema.</p>
        
            <p>The movie theatre was first built in 1897 and had previously been part of a Guinness World Records claim of "longest continuously running movie theatre in the world".</p>
        
            <p>Roxburgh Entertainment Centre Committee member Norman Dalley said the Scotland Street building was a major cornerstone for the town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's huge...it's a hub," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Roxburgh Cinema, formerly the Roxburgh Atheneum, first opened on 11 December 1897, but was shifted and redeveloped as part of the town hall in 1930.</p>

            <p>"We're quite proud of the fact that it's the longest continuously operating movie theatre in the Southern Hemisphere, perhaps the world.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of claims around that.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people have been involved as volunteers (at the cinema) for the last 50 years."</p>
        
            <p>Dalley, who is also the chair of the Teviot Valley Community Board, joined a crowd of others who watched on in horror as flames engulfed the old building,</p>
        
            <p>"It was at the forefront of everybody's day [yesterday]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The total devastation on people's faces was quite evident.</p>
        
            <p>"The way the fire took hold and got bigger, it was hard to watch."</p>
        
            <p>Local media reported that many onlookers became emotional from what they saw.</p>
        
            <p>The town hall had received more than $100,000 of upgrades last year, including a new movie theatre sound system and screen.</p>
        
            <p>This was achieved through fund-raising and community support, Dalley said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The town hall] well used for funerals, big functions, all sorts of things," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We also screened movies every week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just so devastating, a lot of history has gone."</p>
        
            <p>As for a rebuild, the building was too important to the Roxburgh community for it not happen, Dalley said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a very resilient community and I'm sure that we'll be , in a time to come, showing movies on our spot again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll recover from it but it's going to take time."</p>
        
            <p>The destructive fire also comes a month after the council-owned building "narrowly" avoided serious damage during a fire on 3 January.</p>
        
            <p>During the aftermath, Fire and Emergency (FENZ) fire investigator Matt Jones said the building would have copped significantly worse damage if it was not for a recently installed fire alarm system.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, the council confirmed the building had been destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago residents were also asked to conserve water throughout Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this was a huge shock to everyone, thank you so much for your understanding and support throughout the day."</p>
        
            <p>Engineers were also carrying out a safety assessment of the facade in a hope that it could be retained.</p>
