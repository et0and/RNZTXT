        <h2>NZ Upgrade, Shovel-Ready programmes lacked transparency and rigour - Auditor-General</h2>
        <p>
John Ryan has heavily criticised the $15 billion infrastructure spend-up during the pandemic, saying it should have ensured better transparency and value for money.

            <p>Auditor-General John Ryan has heavily criticised the $15 billion infrastructure spend-up during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the previous government should have ensured better transparency and value for money.</p>
        
            <p>He says the public has a right to expect more, pointing to previous criticism of similar programmes, and has made three recommendations for Treasury.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour-led coalition government announced the $12b New Zealand Upgrade Programme (NZUP) and the $3b Shovel-Ready Programme (SRP) in 2020 to shore up the economy in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, and invest in long-term infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern at the time called it a "once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in New Zealand".</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said he had decided to look at the funding because of the scale of investment and the long-term and potentially intergenerational impacts, noting that ministers decided to act quickly in anticipation of worsening economic conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Finding funding and announcing the NZUP took only a few months, the SRP taking just weeks, he noted.</p>
        
            <p>"It concerns me that significant decisions on the spending of public money continue to occur without appropriate processes for ensuring value for money and transparency," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that Parliament and the public have a right to expect more for spending of this scale."</p>

            <p>Ryan said decisions were made in challenging circumstances and sometimes did need to be made quickly, but in the case of the NZUP "the scale and stated significance of these investments, the limited information available to Ministers, and the multi-generational impact of the investments warranted considerably more rigour".</p>
        
            <p>The fund invested in hospitals and schools as well as $8.7 billion into transport: Roads, rail, public transport, walking and cycling.</p>
        
            <p>He said officials worked hard to meet expectations and warned several times about risks including possible cost overruns and delays, but it was unclear how ministers assessed or managed those risks.</p>
        
            <p>This included a warning from the Infrastructure Commission that large-scale infrastructure projects were not effective for stimulating the economy.</p>
        
            <p>Costs for some programmes had since increased significantly, leading in some cases to delays or rescoping.</p>
        
            <p>Full business cases were not always available or up to date, even when the project's planning was more advanced, he found.</p>
        
            <p>"A lack of transparency and documentation about how and why decision-makers made significant decisions can also create the perception that processes lack integrity," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>His office was unable to find specific investment criteria to help agencies identify appropriate projects for funding, and agencies were asked to provide investment options in "extremely tight timeframes", so ministers had too little information to ensure value for money.</p>
        
            <p>The office's staff could find very little information about how other considerations like regional impacts or effects on MƒÅori, Pacific people or others had been assessed, and key stakeholders like Auckland Transport were sometimes not fully consulted over projects they had responsibility for.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said the smaller SRP had a "largely well-run process" but good reporting on its delivery was "let down by the absence of clear records and a rationale of how and why some decisions were made by ministers".</p>
        
            <p>Many changes were also made to the list of SRP projects during the process leading up to making final decisions, often with discussions between ministers' offices or officials, but it was unclear how or why those decisions were made.</p>
        
            <p>Some SRP projects were later cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The auditor-general said his concerns echoed "similar findings" from his work on similar schemCoes like the Strategic Tourism Assets Protection Programme, the Cost-of-Living Payment, the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) and the reprioritisation of the PGF.</p>
        
            <p>He recommended the Treasury:</p>
        
            <p>The Investment Management System requires agencies to provide updates at key points in the development of investment projects in a consistent and clear format.</p>
        
            <p>The Treasury's new guidance on expedited decision-making was not available when the two funds were set up. Ryan said he was pleased with the guidance, calling it a "positive initiative".</p>
        
            <p>He said his report had taken longer than expected because his office had prioritised other work, and both programmes had since shown good progress on delivering projects.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it has also shown that some of the risks that officials highlighted to ministers have been realised."</p>
        
            <p>The National-NZ First coalition agreement has set out plans for the new government to set up a Regional Infrastructure Fund with $1.2 billion in capital funding over the three-year term.</p>
