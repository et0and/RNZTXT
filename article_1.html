        <h2>Live: Australians stack sandbags as Cyclone Alfred slowly closes in</h2>
        <p>
The cyclone is now predicted to arrive late, with experts saying it could make the situation much worse.
</p>
        
            <p>Millions of people in Queensland and New South Wales are bracing for wild weather as Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaches.</p>
        
            <p>The tropical cyclone's western edge is already is already having an effect on Australia's east coast.</p>
        
            <p>Weather experts are predicting the category two cyclone will make landfall between the Gold Coast and southern parts of Wide Bay region either later on Friday or Saturday morning (local time)</p>
        
            <p>It is expected to bring damaging wind gusts, storms, and heavy rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the slowing down of the system allows for more time for "dangerous and damaging waves" to cause further coastal erosion and inundation of low-lying areas along the foreshore over the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>"Dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding remains possible, and we could see rivers begin to rise to major flood levels from Friday."</p>
        
            <p>Treasurer Jim Chalmers said it's the "calm before the storm" and authorities are "hoping for the best and preparing for the worst".</p>
        
            <p>"It's rare for a cyclone to be this far south and to threaten such a huge population area," he said.</p>
