            <p>An 11-year-old girl who was mistaken for an adult, handcuffed and admitted to a mental health facility was given at least two doses of anti-psychotic medication, Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey says.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations are under way by both Health New Zealand and police after the incident in Hamilton earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The girl, who is reportedly autistic and non-verbal, was mistaken for a 20-year-old mental health patient by police after she was seen climbing a bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey told Morning Report the situation is hugely distressing.</p>
        
            <p>"The 11-year-old was taken into Waikato Hospital and administered antipsychotic drugs twice throughout the day," Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked how this could happen, the minister says the issue sits with the misidentification of this child.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old who she was mistaken for was under compulsory care in the community which is why the antipsychotic drugs were able to be administered, Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>How the misidentification process failed was needing to be investigated, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I still don't understand how an 11-year-old can be confused for a lady in her 20s."</p>
        
            <p>Both Health New Zealand and Waikato police have launched internal reviews.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey first became aware of the incident on Friday, he said from the information he received the incident had gone to a review committee but "it doesn't look like that review had started".</p>
        
            <p>"It looks like the incident review wasn't done almost two weeks after the event."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey said not only will people need to be held accountable but the system needs to be.</p>
        
            <p>Asked on Tuesday whether heads should roll, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said: "By all means, there should be accountability in the system."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell has said officers were "doing the best that they could".</p>
        
            <p>"The police, unfortunately, throughout the process, have misidentified her, but make no mistake, they were doing the best that they could to look after her and to support her."</p>
        
            <p>The Health and Disability Commissioner and the Independent Police Conduct Authority have both received complaints about the incident.</p>
