            <p>The Gisborne District Council is having to discharge raw sewage, as heavy rain overloads the wastewater system.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the pumps cannot keep up, with more than 80 millimetres of rain falling in parts of the city and intense hourly falls.</p>
        
            <p>Opening the valves and releasing excess water and pressure would prevent sewage overflowing back into homes, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>Water users and sports groups have been warned about polluted water.</p>
        
            <p>The Council was also advising against swimming, fishing or gathering shellfish for at least five days after the valves are closed.</p>

            <p>MetService also issued heavy rain warnings for Gisborne, Wairoa and Hastings for Boxing Day and into Friday.</p>
        
            <p>In Gisborne/Tai Rāwhiti, heavy east to northeast rain was expected to set in from around 6am, becoming south to southeast late on Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>In the Wairoa District, 200 to 250 mm of rain was expected from 10am on Thursday until noon on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>80 to 100 mm of rain was also expected from 10am on Thursday in the Hastings District north of Napier.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned surface flooding, slips and difficult driving conditions were possible.</p>
        
            <p>However, it said there was only a minimal chance of upgrading to a red warning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService also issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the Coromandel Peninsula, Waikato, Waitomo, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>A broad area of low pressure was bringing unsettled weather to many parts of New Zealand on Boxing Day and Friday, while a low was deepening east of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Officials had been preparing for possible flooding, with Hawke's Bay Regional Council calling back staff from leave to monitor the situation, said its general manager of asset management Chris Dolley.</p>
        
            <p>"We've pre-deployed one of our staff members up to Wairoa and we also have some staff members who are on leave, up in Māhia, who have offered their assessments."</p>
        
            <p>A ranger in Heretaunga was keeping a close eye on the river mouth, and other staff were monitoring pump stations and logistics, Dolley said.</p>
        
            <p>Dolley said the worst of the rain had passed for Gisborne and Hastings, but Wairoa was in for a wet evening.</p>
        
            <p>He said his team was continuing to monitor the situation.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, there was flash flooding in Selwyn, Waimakariri and Christchurch City due to thunderstorms as well as torrential rain.</p>
        
            <p>The storm moved north-west near Oxford and Lees Valley around 1.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Scattered heavy showers about the Canterbury Plains and Foothills remain.</p>

            <p>A strong wind watch has also been issued for the coastal areas of Hawke's Bay, Gisborne/Tai Rāwhiti, Taranaki and western parts of Whanganui, and Kapiti Coast, Wellington and coastal Marlborough including the Sounds.</p>
        
            <p>In Taranaki and western parts of Whanganui, southerly winds may approach severe gale in exposed places, with a moderate chance of upgrading to a warning until 4pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>A similar watch is in place for coastal areas of Hawke's Bay and Gisborne/Tai Rāwhiti from around 8am on Friday, with a moderate chance of the strong wind watch being upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>Kapiti Coast, Wellington and coastal Marlborough including the Sounds will also see strong winds between 1am and 4pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander ferry passengers had been warned there may be delays to some services on Friday due to the stormy weather.</p>
        
            <p>In a message to passengers, the company said the weather in Cook Strait was forecast to deteriorate between 6am on Friday and the early hours of Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A strong southerly change is set to whip up swells of more than three metres in Cook Strait, rising to more than 4 metres in the afternoon before starting to ease on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, water quality experts warned people to avoid swimming in rain-affected areas, due to the risk of pollution.</p>
        
            <p>Land, Air, Water Aotearoa spokesperson Dr Elaine Moriarty said even waterways that were usually clean could be affected by stormwater runoff.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain washed contaminants such as bacteria from animal faeces, wastewater overflows, and other pollutants into waterways.</p>
        
            <p>It was best to avoid swimming for two to three days after heavy rain, she said.</p>
        
            <p>After that, if you can't see your toes while standing in calf-deep water, do not swim at that spot, she added.</p>
