            <p>RNZ understands TVNZ has confirmed consumer affairs programme Fair Go, along with the midday and late night news bulletins have been cut.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcaster began meeting with staff on Tuesday over its potential plans to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>At least 68 jobs were proposed to be cut when TVNZ announced the plans last month.</p>
        
            <p>Staff from the youth-oriented programme Re News are due to have a meeting starting at midday.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ is to meet staff of current affairs programme Sunday on Wednesday to confirm its future.</p>
        
            <p>An all-staff meeting is due to be held on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, staff at Newshub are expecting to be told at 11am on Wednesday if the service will close in June with the possible loss of up to 300 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Warner Brothers Discovery proposed the closure in February as a cost-cutting measure and it has been consulting with staff on alternatives to the closure.</p>
        
            <p>It has been reported other media companies are interested in acquiring Newshub and continuing a scaled-down news service but no details of any negotiations have been confirmed.</p>
