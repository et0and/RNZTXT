            <p>Olympic rower Mahé Drysdale is putting his hat in the ring to become Tauranga's next mayor.</p>
        
            <p>A commissioner has been running the city for three years, because of a dysfunctional council.</p>
        
            <p>But there will be a return to locally-elected city leaders when elections are held on 20 July.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said he would bring accounting and financial management to the job.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was determined to efficiently manage the challenging situation the council faces due to rising interest rates and costs.</p>
        
            <p>Other nominations for mayor so far are singer Ria Hall, former deputy mayor Tina Salisbury and resident Chudleigh Haggett.</p>
