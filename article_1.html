            <p>Why has New Zealand slipped from three on Quality of Death Indexes nine years ago to 12th? </p>
        
            <p>NZ Hospice chief executive Wayne Naylor has a list of reasons. </p>
        
            <p>"We don't have a current national strategy - the government hasn't renewed our 2001 strategy, so we don't have national direction. </p>
        
            <p>"We don't have stable, sustainable funding for community-based palliative care, particularly provided from hospices. It's widely variable. </p>
        
            <p>"There's no planned investment in it, so services are struggling.</p>
        
            <p>"Our workforce training used to be fantastic. It's dropped away a bit, we're not training enough specialist doctors; we don't have funded post-graduate training for nurses any more. </p>
        
            <p>"And it's just not as well organised as it could be, compared to some other countries. </p>
        
            <p>"It's not great, because New Zealand has always done well when it comes to the care of people who are dying," he says. </p>
        
            <p>And here's an astonishing statistic. </p>
        
            <p>While the government funds about 45 to 50 percent of Hospice's work at $92 million a year, (it does keep patients out of hospitals, after all), the rest, $94 million, is collected from donors, bequests - and op shops. In fact the vast majority of it comes from those shops, run by volunteers. </p>
        
            <p>During Covid lockdowns when those shops were closed, and many fundraising events were cancelled, income plummeted. </p>
        
            <p>"Hospices were exposed because of their reliance on community fundraising and second-hand retail," says Naylor. </p>
        
            <p>"That money just wasn't coming in. And of course the government funding doesn't cover the cost of all of the clinical services that hospices provide. I think it's really made the hospice sector realise that although community funding is very important.... it's not something you can rely on all the time." </p>
        
            <p>There are 32 hospices across the country that cared for 10,800 dying people last year, about a third of everyone who died.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that part of the issue we've got around funding end-of-life care, palliative care, really well is that it's been sidelined in our health system for so long," says Naylor. </p>
        
            <p>He says one of the problems is - we don't talk about dying enough. "It's not something we like to acknowledge happens in our medical system."</p>
        
            <p>Today on The Detail we take a tour of a revamped hospice in Takapuna, a $20 million project financed entirely by donations, investments from bequests and fundraising. </p>
        
            <p>Bev Platt, the director of nursing and family support at Harbour Hospice, says the funding model is a challenge for the future, but "it's like everybody".</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, the population's getting older and living longer so we're going to see a different illness trajectory - we know we're going to see an increase in dementia and frailty. We're also seeing an increase in complexity because treatments are better than they used to be." </p>
        
            <p>The demand for palliative care is estimated to increase 50 percent by 2040.</p>
        
            <p>But complicating the funding issue is the stretched charity dollar in a recession, other health services crumbling, and the increased safety risks of reaching the dying in their homes. </p>
        
            <p>The Detail also speaks to Belinda Watkins, chief executive for mid Northland and Far North hospice looking after a population of 74,000 from Cape Reinga to just north of Whangarei.</p>
        
            <p>There is no in-patient unit in the region which means that all the care is in people's homes. It has to raise two million dollars from the community. </p>
        
            <p>Hospice has a fundraising push coming up - its awareness week starts on 13 May. </p>
