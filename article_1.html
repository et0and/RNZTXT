        <h2>Watch live: Manurewa Marae election inquiry findings released</h2>
        <p>
The inquiry was launched last year after allegations Te Pāti Māori misused data during the 2023 election campaign.
</p>
        
            <p>A delayed report into the alleged mis-use of personal information by Manurewa Marae is set to be released.</p>
        
            <p>The review, being released by the Public Service Commission, was commissioned by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon after allegations Census and Covid-19 vaccination data collected at the marae was misused for Te Pāti Māori's election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ and Police were also looking into the claims, with their reports yet to be released.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori has denied the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori called the allegations "baseless" and invited the police to investigate and prove their "innocence".</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche is set to release the findings of the inquiry at 2pm. We will be livestreaming the announcement at the top of this page.</p>
