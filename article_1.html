            <p>More than 1100 homes in Porirua are without power and the cause is still unknown, according to Wellington Electricity.</p>
        
            <p>Affected areas included Papakowhai, Porirua City Centre, Paremata, Aotea, Porirua and Pukerua Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Electricity said the outage was not likely to be related to the large scrub fire at Porirua yesterday morning, because it is on a different power supply line.</p>
        
            <p>Power is estimated to be restored by 12.30pm, it said.</p>
