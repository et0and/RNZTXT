            <p>The Ministry of Education has put 100 school building projects on hold.</p>
        
            <p>It said deferring the builds and rescoping 110 others will save $2 billion.</p>
        
            <p>The plans will be reconsidered for the next government budget.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry reviewed 352 building projects across 305 schools, with an expected cost of $4.6b.</p>
        
            <p>It has approved 142 of them to go ahead with no changes.</p>
        
            <p>Some are only in the design and planning stage, and will need more funding before they can proceed to the next step.</p>
