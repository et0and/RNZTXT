            <p>The famous themed gardens in Hamilton are preparing to introduce an out-of- town visitor charge in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The charge will apply to visitors who live outside Hamilton City, and will come into place later this year once the new visitor centre is completed.</p>
        
            <p>Over half-a-million people visit the enclosed garden area each year, covering about five hectares of the nearly 50-hectare gardens.</p>
        
            <p>Garden director Lucy Ryan said the $20 visitor charge will help the gardens become more financially independent and invest in future developments.</p>
        
            <p>"The charge is really to help the gardens' operations, so we can get better and better and reinvest in it and become a bit more self-sustainable."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said the gardens were currently ratepayer-funded. Hamilton residents are facing a proposed 25.5 percent rate increase for 2024-2025 as the council grapples with rising interest rates, inflation, and looming water infrastructure costs.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton Gardens was ranked in the top 1 percent of world attractions for 2023 by online travel advice site Trip Advisor, and Ryan said many international visitors assumed there was already a charge.</p>
        
            <p>"The amount of times people come into the info centre asking how much it costs to get in is remarkable."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said there were some people who did not think they should charge, but a lot of other people told her they thought it was worth $20, which she said was nice to hear.</p>
