            <p>A blast has ripped through an explosives factory in northwest Turkey on Christmas Eve, killing 11 people and injuring seven, the country's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya says, adding that an investigation has been launched.</p>
        
            <p>Yerlikaya said that an initial death count of 12 people had been announced mistakenly and that in fact 11 people had been killed as a result of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Seven others were getting treatment at nearby hospitals for non-life threatening injuries, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The cause of the fire is being investigated thoroughly; no suspicion of sabotage in this incident," Yerlikaya said, speaking outside the manufacturing facility.</p>
        
            <p>Footage from the scene showed a fireball and smoke rising from the factory building at the time of the blast, as well as the mangled metal framework of the building in the aftermath.</p>
        
            <p>The explosion occurred at a factory in the village of Kavakli in Balikesir province.</p>
        
            <p>AFP reported that the plant makes munitions and explosives and flares for the domestic and international markets.</p>
        
            <p>Many fire crews were sent to deal with the blaze and health and security units were dispatched to the area while an investigation was launched, the government's communications directorate said.</p>
