            <p>The Cook Islands government has released the text of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement that it has signed with Beijing.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the government will now analyse the agreement with China.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he intended to engage with the Cook Islands government on this "in the days ahead".</p>
        
            <p>He has also pointed to public statements by both the Cook Islands and Chinese governments that "a number of agreements" were signed during Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown's week-long state visit last week.</p>
        
            <p>"We look forward to the release of all those agreements without delay, so that the Cook Islands people and New Zealand can get clarity on the substance and scope of the intended cooperation between China and the Cooks. Consultation and transparency must lie at the heart of the New Zealand-Cook Islands relationship."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer joined more than 400 people in Rarotonga to protest against Brown's government.</p>
