            <p>Remote parts of Fiordland's coast may experience strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges following a magnitude 6.8 earthquake off the South Island this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The earthquake struck 150 kilometres southwest off Southland's coast at 2.43pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>It was 12km deep and caused moderate shaking, according to GeoNet.</p>
        
            <p>Two hours after the quake more than 4700 people reported having felt it.</p>
        
            <p>The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is warning those in the remote area from Milford Sound to Puysegur Point to keep out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Strong currents and surges can injure and drown people. There is a danger to swimmers, surfers, people fishing, and anyone in or near the water close to shore," the agency warned.</p>

            <p>"People in or near the sea in the following areas should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and away from harbours, marinas, rivers and estuaries.</p>
        
            <p>"People on boats, live-aboards and at marinas should leave their boats/vessels and move onto shore. Do not return to boats unless instructed by officials."</p>
        
            <p>There was no need to evacuate unless directed by local civil defence authorities and coastal inundation was not expected, the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>The Milford Sound to Puysegur Point area was very isolated, NEMA director of Civil Defence Emergency Management John Price said</p>
        
            <p>"We have our emergency mobile alerts that have gone out to those people, we also ask that people continue to listen to their radio, but also to stay in touch through the Southland Emergency Management website as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever people feel an earthquake they have a responsibility to take care of themselves so we always say if you feel an earthquake, wherever you are, make sure you drop, cover and hold.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're near the sea or bodies of water it's the same message - drop, cover and hold and if it's long or strong get gone, get to some safe higher area where you would not be in harm's way."</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Southland civil defence controller Aly Curd said there was no threat of a tsunami to Southland's coast.</p>
        
            <p>"People who have left the coast as a precaution may now return but are advised to stay away from beaches and out of the water for the next 12 hours as currents and tidal patterns may have been affected. Boaties should also exercise extreme caution."</p>
        
            <p>Thousands reported feeling the earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>Tuatapere Four Square owner Mark Hewton said the earthquake hit suddenly and lasted for a minute or so.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a very soft rolling earthquake. It wasn't aggressive. It wasn't enough to cause any damage that I'm aware of," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All the staff felt it and it was definitely enough to make you stop what you were doing and make you think about getting under a door or something.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't felt one like that for quite a wee while."</p>
        
            <p>Fiona Cromb was at home in Tuatapere when the earthquake hit.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just heading outside and I noticed my glass cabinets in the dining room shaking. My TV and things on the wall were shaking.</p>
        
            <p>"I could hear birds squawking and going off.</p>
        
            <p>"I just stood there and felt the rolling going through."</p>
        
            <p>She had gone down to the Tui Base Camp bar, where some of the punters had reported feeling the shaking while others did not feel a thing.</p>
