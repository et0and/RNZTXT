            <p>Another round of the same threatening emails received by hospitals and a school on Thursday has been sent to more organisations this morning, police say.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands four hospitals and one school, Auckland's Saint Kentigern College, were searched by police or evacuated as a precaution yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson has confirmed the same email has been sent to another round of organisations today.</p>
        
            <p>This morning, Auckland's Ōrewa College sent a message to parents saying it was closing immediately due to health and safety.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands it may be a target one of the emails.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are confident the emails are being sent from the same source, and do not believe there is any actual threat to the places receiving them.</p>
        
            <p>Any organisations that receives an email are asked to report it to police to help with the ongoing investigation to find its origin.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
