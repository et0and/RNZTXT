            <p>The first day of the SailGP racing event in Lyttelton has been abandoned after dolphins were sighted on the course.</p>
        
            <p>The race was due to get under way about 3pm, but was delayed after the dolphins were spotted.</p>
        
            <p>After they had not moved on about two hours later, the race was called off entirely.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers had predicted a record-breaking crowd of 11,000 visitors for each day of the weekend's racing.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Uivel from Ata Ceramics earlier said SailGP had been a "wonderful" event for the town.</p>
        
            <p>Uivel said there had been a buzz around town. "It's a beautiful day and we've had a lot of really friendly visitors."</p>
        
            <p>SailGP returned to Lyttelton for the second time after Auckland pulled out of hosting the event.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
