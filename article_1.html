            <p>Police have confirmed this evening the man tasered after threatening them with a samurai sword and allegedly biting an officer has died.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Jill Rogers said after he became unresponsive he was given medical treatment, "however, tragically the man was unable to be revived".</p>
        
            <p>"Police are working to locate the man's next of kin, to inform them of the death and ensure appropriate support is in place for them."</p>
        
            <p>She said until the next of kin notifications had been carried out, further details regarding the dead man would not be provided.</p>
        
            <p>The incident began when a police officer was allegedly bitten on the hand by the man wielding the sword. He became unconscious after being tasered, after officers stopped a fleeing car this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still at the scene in Ōrere Point in the Auckland region following the incident.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said a driver failed to stop after an officer recognised the car - which was being sought as part of an ongoing investigation - in Great South Road in Papakura at 2.15pm today.</p>
        
            <p>The driver failed to stop for police and was followed by the Eagle helicopter as they drove to Ōrere Point, where the car stopped on the beach at about 3.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>While the driver of the car was taken into custody without incident, the male passenger threatened officers with a samurai sword and bit the hand of one officer.</p>
        
            <p>Officers used a Taser, OC spray and a police dog unit, which allowed them to take the man into custody without any further injury to officers.</p>
        
            <p>Orere Point resident Toby Jones saw the incident unfold.</p>
        
            <p>"Two dudes got out and were fighting with the cops and got tasered and pepper sprayed," he told RNZ. "Then it was 'oh he's not doing too good, get a defib out, we need some oxygen.'</p>
        
            <p>Jones said a short time later it became apparent the man had died.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a small town, when all the police cars come in everyone goes down to the beach. That never happens, it's usually quite a cool and collected area."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the officer who was bitten has been transported to a medical centre for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are in place around the area.</p>
        
            <p>Rogers said a post mortem will be carried out in coming days and police will make inquiries on behalf of the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>The matter will also be referred to the Independent Police Conduct Authority and WorkSafe.</p>
