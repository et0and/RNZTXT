            <p>Hundreds of people have made their way to the iconic Te Tii Marae for a dawn ceremony unveiling a refurbished wharenui on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The new renovations include a paved courtyard, strengthened shelters for manuhiri and a fresh coat of paint for the wharenui.</p>
        
            <p>A feast was also been prepared overnight to feed those in attendance, which includes iwi leaders, local leaders and MPs.</p>
        
            <p>The National Iwi Chairs Forum's first meeting will then be held shortly after the service, where politicians may face a tough crowd, Chairman of Waitangi National Trust Pita Tipene said</p>
        
            <p>The agenda will likely include discussions on government initiatives like the Treaty Principles and Regulatory Standards Bills.</p>
        
            <p>With Prime Minister Christopher Luxon absent, his coalition partners will front on their own.</p>
        
            <p>Tipene said he expects politicians in attendance to face a fiery crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's going to be a very hot reception," he told Morning Report. "There have already been comments made this morning about the government."</p>
        
            <p>He extended that belief to ACT leader David Seymour and NZ First Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour, who is the architect of the government's proposed Treaty Principles Bill, has confirmed he will attend Waitangi Day commemorations despite his hapū, Ngāti Rēhia, formally requesting he does not.</p>
        
            <p>"I think what's been building up since the coalition government has come in, (their) 100-day plan, and what we've seen draw out over the last 12 months is going to create a lot of heat when the government is welcomed on the 5th (of February)," Tipene said.</p>
        
            <p>But he encouraged discourse and debate over Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and said their main priority is keeping everybody safe.</p>
        
            <p>"We're ready to hear that, and security is a top concern for us," Tipene said.</p>
        
            <p>Tipene also said it was "fantastic" for Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka to turn up, and speakers expressed their empathy for the difficulties he faces working in between the National Party's "manifesto and representing his people".</p>
