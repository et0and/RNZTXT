            <p>New All Blacks coach Scott Robertson wants New Zealand rugby to keep an open mind over the eligibility rules surrounding overseas based players playing for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson has got together the All Blacks for a two-day camp in Auckland, the first time he and his new management team along with the players have met as a group.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-two players are there but missing are a number who headed off overseas to play following the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>In November All Blacks captain Sam Cane said New Zealand Rugby should reconsider not picking overseas-based players for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>However New Zealand Rugby responded by saying it would not be changing its policy, which requires players to be playing in New Zealand to be considered for the All Blacks, any time soon.</p>
        
            <p>Cane is among several of the sport's stars, including World Player of the Year Ardie Savea and South African flyer Cheslin Kolbe, who will play in Japan's League One this year, enticed by high salaries and a relatively compact rugby calendar.</p>
        
            <p>While Cane will not miss any internationals during his brief sabbatical, other All Blacks like Richie Mo'unga have signed multi-year deals in Japan that effectively rule them out of selection unless New Zealand's governing body changes its rules.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the situation today, Robertson remains open to the idea of selected players based overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"I presented to the board, the CEOs of Super Rugby, the PUs (provincial unions).. I explained about keeping an open mind in that space, that's what I've asked for.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep an open mind where the game is at the moment, it's moving quite quickly, as we know.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of on and off field, players and decisions and contracting, and I want to be a step ahead of that. Decipher that."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson also said he wouldn't name an All Blacks captain until they get together for their first camp following Super Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks open their season against England in July.</p>
