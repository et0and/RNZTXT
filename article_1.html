            <p>Officers executed a search warrant at a Dunedin property on Thursday afternoon as result of their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Constable Ashley Wilson said stolen items taken during the burglaries of "multiple commercial and residential properties" earlier this month were recovered.</p>
        
            <p>"A bag containing medical equipment was found in the large amount of stolen property, and it is believed all items in the bag have been recovered," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the stolen property identified belonged to stores including Torpedo Seven, Off the Chain Bike Shop, Chisholm Park Golf Shop, Cash Converters, and 2Degrees.</p>
        
            <p>"Many other stolen items are yet to be identified and returned to their respective stores," Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>As a result of the search warrant, further charges were "likely".</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to reappear on the Dunedin District Court on 4 February.</p>
