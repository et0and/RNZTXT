            <p>Waiuku College says it has gone into lockdown, as police investigate an email threat made to two Auckland schools.</p>
        
            <p>The school is urging people not to contact or visit the premises.</p>
        
            <p>The email was sent to a number of organisations, including RNZ.</p>

            <p>A police spokesperson says they made enquiries in the area concerned and are looking into the email.</p>
        
            <p>They acknowledged the threat was unsettling and said reassurance patrols would be conducted.</p>
        
            <p>The parent of two students at Waiuku College, Petrida Sutton, said tensions were high as parents speculated about the limited information they had received.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard there are Armed Offenders Squad out there, and police with guns patrolling around the school," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My son walked to school this morning, he would've got there around 8:30."</p>
        
            <p>Some parents complained on social media that the school had entered lockdown after many children had already arrived, despite the email being sent in the early hours of this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sutton said her son had been in contact, and her daughter was home sick.</p>
        
            <p>"I have [heard from him], they're not meant to have phones there but I have," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Her son had told her via a text the students had been out in a field and now they were back in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm reluctant to go to work until I know what's going on, I'm grateful that my daughter's unwell and not at school today."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Education said the school has activated its emergency management procedures.</p>
        
            <p>It said the school leadership team will continue to provide updates and the immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of students and staff.</p>
