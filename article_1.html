        <h2>Millions thrown at caulerpa control as pest seaweed spreads</h2>
        <p>
Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard said funding for caulerpa control in the Bay of Islands was based on earlier project success.

            <p>The government is throwing more than $6 million at developing world-first industrial-scale technology to fight caulerpa as the invasive seaweed is confirmed at major tourist hot spot Bay of Islands motu for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard said big strides were being taken with the $6.2 million development of the new technology at Omākiwi Cove and $3.8 million for other technology at two other New Zealand locations to control the invasive exotic seaweed.</p>

            <p>Northland Regional Council (NRC) confirmed this week that caulerpa had been found at six new locations in the eastern Bay of Islands Ipipiri island group, about six kilometres from Paihia.</p>
        
            <p>It has been found at Urupukapuka Island's major boating anchorages Paradise Bay and Otiao Bay (Entico Bay) and Moturua Island's Army Bay as well at two locations around adjacent Motukiekie Island.</p>
        
            <p>NRC chairperson Geoff Crawford said the new finds were disappointing, but there had always been the potential for them to happen.</p>
        
            <p>Caulerpa eradication was still possible - with the help of technology being developed in the Bay of Islands' Omākiwi Cove.</p>
        
            <p>Five of the new sites are outside the Bay of Islands 1000ha caulerpa anchoring ban area in June 2021.</p>
        
            <p>They are the first confirmed caulerpa spread since New Zealand's only mainland caulerpa infestation was confirmed at Omākiwi Cove, Te Rāwhiti in May 2023 about three kilometres away.</p>

            <p>A new infestation has also been identified on the northern edge of the anchoring ban area, close to the islands.</p>
        
            <p>Omākiwi Cove has been the site of groundbreaking eradication trials since May 2023.</p>

            <p>Crawford said the new government funding was essential in the race to develop robust tools to fight caulerpa, even as the invasive pest seaweed had spread to the Ipipiri Islands.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was important to stay focused in the face of this spread.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disheartening to hear. But unfortunately, until we develop these tools, eradication isn't likely.</p>
        
            <p>"Without technology like the underwater tractor unit we wouldn't have anything to fight invasive caulerpa," Crawford said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had always been the chance that caulerpa would spread outside the anchoring ban area.</p>

            <p>The government money will go towards upscaling successful Omākiwi Cove caulerpa removal trials to an industrial scale.</p>
        
            <p>"At present we're capable of harvesting 30 tonnes of caulerpa a day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hoping to be able to expand that to 600 tonnes a day. That quantity's about the same in volume as a typical three-bedroom house."</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest challenges would be working through how to deal with the increased quantity of caulerpa brought up onto the vessel in the new regime, Crawford said.</p>

            <p>NRC would continue linking with Ōpua-based marine contractor Johnson Bros, which had been working with the council and local mana whenua partners Ngāti Kuta and Patukeha hapū to remove exotic caulerpa in Omākiwi Cove.</p>
        
            <p>The new tool called a 'submersible dredge planer' would operate remotely on the seafloor and aimed to remove exotic caulerpa in a single pass.</p>
        
            <p>It would be part of a new larger system including the remotely operated planer, upsized dredge head, pumping arrangements, GPS position system, dredge spoil processing plant and disposal system.</p>

            <p>Crawford said the new technology was for getting rid of caulerpa on soft sandy seafloor.</p>
        
            <p>Other work to control it on surrounding rocky areas along shorelines also needed developing.</p>
        
            <p>NRC will also be supporting two other $3.2 million government-funded projects - developing ultra-violet light irradiation tool to kill the pest seaweed and a chlorine treatment chamber that will hover over the seabed.</p>
        
            <p>Exotic caulerpa has been found in nine different locations in the upper North Island since first being discovered on Aotea Great Barrier Island in July 2021.</p>
