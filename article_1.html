            <p>"There's a lot of smoke in the building so we're working to clear the building of smoke.</p>
        
            <p>"We've searched all floors and all the tenants have been evacuated."</p>
        
            <p>Franklin said that he did not believe anyone had been hurt in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the residents are now returning to their homes.</p>

            <p>"It's heartbreaking to face another fire just two years after the devastating tragedy at Loafers Lodge. As the current situation is still unfolding, our immediate priority is the safety and well-being of residents. We are working closely with emergency services and will provide all necessary support to those affected," she said.</p>
