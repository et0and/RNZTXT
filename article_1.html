            <p>From 1 April, a number of payments that New Zealand households receive will increase.</p>
        
            <p>Here is what that looks like.</p>
        
            <p>This is a core part of the Working for Families scheme. The amount you qualify for depends on your household income.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, this rate will increase from a maximum $136 to a maximum $144 a week for the oldest child in a family, and from $111 to $117 per week for subsequent children.</p>
        
            <p>The Best Start credit is paid to all families until their baby turns one, provided they are not receiving paid parental leave. Those whose household income is less than $97,726 can receive a payment until their child turns three.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, the rate for the first year will lift from $69 a week to $73.</p>
        
            <p>Changes will take effect for all benefits from April, based on either the increase in the consumer price index or net average wage.</p>
        
            <p>Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston said a couple on Jobseeker Support with children will get an extra $56.48 a fortnight while single parents would get $44.02 more.</p>
        
            <p>A single person on Jobseeker aged over 25 will now get $353.46 a week after tax. A single parent on Jobseeker will receive $494.80. A couple with children will qualify for $635.10 a week.</p>
        
            <p>On the supported living payment, a couple without children will receive $684.48.</p>
        
            <p>There is a full list of the new rates on the Work and Income website.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Super will also increase. A couple on NZ Super or the Veteran's Pension will get $71.08 more a fortnight, and a single person living alone will get $46.20 more a fortnight.</p>
        
            <p>That means a couple in which both people qualify will receive just under $800 a week after tax.</p>
        
            <p>Eligible students who are living away from home and aged under 24 will get an extra $27.94 in student allowance - to a maximum $314.15 a week after tax.</p>
