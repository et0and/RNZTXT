            <p>A person believed to have jumped from a crane in Wellington Harbour has failed to surface, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The vintage crane is on a boat which is permanently moored at the waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>Police dive squad have been deployed to begin a search.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was reported to police at 12.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, the death of a man who jumped off the crane prompted its owners, Maritime Heritage Trust, to look at ways to prevent copycat incidents.</p>
