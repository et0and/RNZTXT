            <p>Thousands of people on an Australian cruise ship have been turned away from New Zealand shores because the vessel did not meet biosecurity standards.</p>
        
            <p>P&O runs a 13-day "Kiwi Adventure" voyage, taking passengers from Sydney, sailing around New Zealand and stopping at different cities.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the company said the ship left Sydney on Monday for a hull cleaning in the waters near the Bay of Plenty as per biosecurity requirements.</p>
        
            <p>But it said poor weather made it too dangerous for divers to clean the hull underwater and the cruise ship did not gain clearance to enter Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Underwater cleaning opportunities in the Pacific were extremely limited and could only be completed offshore.</p>
        
            <p>P&O said the cruiseship was now on its way to Tasmania instead.</p>
        
            <p>It said guests were notified prior to departure that there could be changes to the itinerary, "due to New Zealand's strict biosecurity requirements".</p>
        
            <p>The almost 2800 guests had been offered additional compensation in light of the change of voyage.</p>
