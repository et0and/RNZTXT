            <p>Two people have died in a crash in Clarkville, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed two people died in the crash, while a third is in hospital with minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 North Canterbury households were also without power after the serious crash near Kaiapoi overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said a car hit a power pole on Butchers Road, Clarkville, just after midnight, demolishing the pole and bringing down power lines across the road.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters from the Kaiapoi and Swannanoa brigades responded.</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesperson said two ambulances and a rapid response unit were sent to the single-vehicle crash at 12.09am.</p>
        
            <p>One person was taken to Christchurch Hospital in a moderate condition, with the spokesperson referring enquiries about any other patients to the police.</p>
        
            <p>Police would say only that Butchers Road was expected to remain closed between Moodys Road and Christmas Road for much of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Lines company MainPower said power would remain off for 101 customers in the area, likely until this afternoon, while serious crash investigators remained on the scene.</p>
