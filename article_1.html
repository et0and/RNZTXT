            <p>US President Joe Biden is taking calls to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate seriously and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>
        
            <p>"His soul searching is actually happening, I know that for a fact," said one of the sources, who requested anonymity. "He's thinking about this very seriously."</p>
        
            <p>Biden, 81, has faced increasing pressure from heavyweights in his party to cede his position at the top of the ticket after a shoddy debate performance against former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, raised fears about his age and ability to win in November.</p>
