            <p>Former Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has been sentenced to one year in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Bainimarama, alongside suspended Fiji Police commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho appeared in the High Court in Suva for their sentencing hearing for a case involving their roles in blocking a police investigation at the University of the South Pacific in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Qiliho has been sentenced to two years jail.</p>
        
            <p>Bainimarama, the 69-year-old former military commander and 2006 coup leader, had been found guilty of perverting the course of justice.</p>
        
            <p>Qiliho had been found guilty of abuse of office by the High Court Acting Chief Justice Salesi Temo, who upheld the State's appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Bainimarama and Qiliho walked out of the High Court in Suva in handcuffs, and were escorted straight into a police vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"The former PM and the suspended COMPOL were found not guilty and acquitted accordingly by Resident Magistrate Seini Puamau at the Suva Magistrates Court on 12 October 2023," the Office of the Direcotr of Public Prosecutions said.</p>
        
            <p>"The State had filed an appeal against their acquittal where the Acting Chief Justice, Salesi Temo then overturned the Magistrate's decision and found the two guilty as charged. The matter was then sent back to the Magistrates' Court for sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>"In sentencing the duo, Magistrate Puamau announced that both their convictions would not be registered. The former PM was granted an absolute discharge while the suspended COMPOL received a conditional discharge with a fine of $1500 on 28 March 2024 by the Suva Magistrates Court following which the State had filed an appeal and challenged the discharge</p>
        
            <p>for a custodial sentence.</p>
        
            <p>"The Acting Chief Justice quashed the Magistrate Court's sentence and pronounced the custodial sentences respectively."</p>

            <p>State broadcaster FBC reported that police only allowed close relatives and Bainimarama and Qiliho's associates, along with the media, to sit in the courtroom.</p>
