        <h2>White House mocked as uninhabited island targeted by Trump's tariff</h2>
        <p>
Penguin memes are rife after the US president tariffed an island only inhabited by birds.

            <p>Donald Trump's tariffs have become a black and white issue on social media, where penguin memes have gone viral after he targeted an island inhabited by the flightless birds, but no people.</p>
        
            <p>One widely shared image on Thursday showed a penguin in place of Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office during his recent row with the US president and Vice President JD Vance.</p>
        
            <p>Another meme showed US First Lady Melania Trump gazing up at an emperor penguin - in place of former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - while Trump looks askance.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's announcement of worldwide tariffs on Wednesday certainly received an icy reception in many countries.</p>
        
            <p>But there has also been bafflement about why some of the most remote parts of the world have been targeted.</p>
        
            <p>A case in point: why would Trump slap 10 percent tariffs on all exports from the Heard and McDonald Islands, a barren sub-Antarctic Australian territory without a human population, but four different species of penguin?</p>
        
            <p>"The penguins have been ripping us off for years," Anthony Scaramucci, who was Trump's former communications chief for 11 days in his first term and is now a vocal critic, joked on X.</p>
        
            <p>"Donald Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin," posted US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, referring to the fact that Russia was not on the US tariff list.</p>
        
            <p>The White House said sanctions on Russia over President Vladimir Putin's war on meant that there was no "meaningful" trade on which to impose tariffs.</p>

            <p>Trump also caused puzzlement with his 29 percent tariff on Norfolk Island, a tiny Australian territory in the Pacific with a population of a little over 2,000 humans.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States," Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.</p>
        
            <p>Britain's remote Falkland Islands - home to one million penguins, and most famous for a 1982 war fought by Britain to repel Argentinian invaders - was hit by 41 percent exports even though the UK only faces 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's tariffs have however been no laughing matter for global markets, with US stocks suffering their worst day since the Covid pandemic in 2020.</p>
