            <p>An Auckland college was sent into lockdown as police probed a threat against schools in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Students arrived at Waiuku College on Wednesday to a heavy police presence, and the school posted on Facebook shortly before 9am advising there was a lockdown under way.</p>
        
            <p>After 11am the school posted on Facebook saying students and staff have returned to their classrooms.</p>
        
            <p>The lockdown was prompted by an email threat, directed at two schools in the region.</p>
        
            <p>The email was also sent to a number of organisations, including RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>It says the school will close for the rest of the day "to allow staff and students to settle their wairua [sense of wellbeing] and prepare to return tomorrow".</p>
        
            <p>The school's reception will remain shut.</p>
        
            <p>The post asked parents not to go on school grounds and not to approach staff, who ii said have managed "incredibly well" this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand what some students have witnessed [armed police on site] can create upset and trauma. Our guidance team are available through teams, email and on-site tomorrow. The MOE [Ministry of Education] response team will also be on site," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Some parents took to social media to complain about the lack of notice over the lockdown.</p>

            <p>A police spokesperson says they made enquiries in the area concerned and were looking into the email.</p>
        
            <p>They acknowledged the threat was unsettling and said reassurance patrols would be conducted.</p>
        
            <p>The parent of two students at Waiuku College, Petrida Sutton, said tensions were high as parents speculated about the limited information they had received.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard there are Armed Offenders Squad out there, and police with guns patrolling around the school," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My son walked to school this morning, he would've got there around 8:30."</p>
        
            <p>Some parents complained on social media that the school had entered lockdown after many children had already arrived, despite the email being sent in the early hours of this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sutton said her son had been in contact, and her daughter was home sick.</p>
        
            <p>"I have [heard from him], they're not meant to have phones there but I have," she said.</p>

            <p>Her son had told her via a text the students had been out in a field and now they were back in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm reluctant to go to work until I know what's going on, I'm grateful that my daughter's unwell and not at school today."</p>
        
            <p>An earlier update on the school's website about 10.30am said it was still in lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>"We are under the direction of the NZ police. Please do not contact the school or attempt to visit at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Education said the school had activated its emergency management procedures.</p>
        
            <p>It said the immediate priority was the safety and wellbeing of students and staff.</p>
