            <p>An entire Northland town is knuckling down for a spring clean, ahead of the reopening of its main highway, which has been closed for more than two years.</p>
        
            <p>Kaitāia has been cut off from the highway south since August 2022, when a series of massive slips destroyed State Highway 1 through Mangamuka Gorge.</p>
        
            <p>A massive, $100-million-plus project by the NZ Transport Authority to rebuild the 13km section of road is finally due to be completed in December.</p>
        
            <p>Kaitāia Business Association chair Josh Kirby described the reopening, scheduled for 20 December, as "a nice Christmas present".</p>
        
            <p>"Given it's been closed for quite a while - over 2½ years, we felt it was worthwhile doing a little bit of mahi around town, having a little bit of a clean up, putting our best foot forward," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an opportunity for our community to come together and take a bit of pride in our town."</p>

            <p>Work started on Monday, with businesses in the town centre encouraged to clean windows and building frontages, or to pick up rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>From 10am on Friday, volunteers planned to descend on the town square to collect up rubbish sacks, split into groups and fan out across town looking for litter.</p>
        
            <p>During the week contractors had been re-barking and refreshing the gardens, while through Friday, others would be waterblasting footpaths and alleys, and tidying up benches and rubbish bins.</p>
        
            <p>Kirby said local businesses were hugely supportive.</p>
        
            <p>A local waste firm donated gloves, rubbish sacks and a skip; another business would be sorting through the waste and picking out anything that could be recycled.</p>
        
            <p>Other companies had offered free labour, and equipment such as waterblasters and scissor-lifts.</p>
        
            <p>"So she's all go," Kirby said.</p>
        
            <p>The impact of the highway closure had been significant, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every small town needs a road in, right? We haven't had that access for a long time, but at the same time we are a very resilient, supportive community.</p>
        
            <p>"So it has been very difficult, but the community has rallied."</p>
        
            <p>
Anyone who hasn't been to Kaitāia since SH1 closed will be surprised to find the derelict Pak'nSave on the main street replaced by a town square.

            <p>Kirby said businesses were looking forward to seeing more visitors once Kaitāia was back on the main route north.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hoping that with a little bit of a spruce-up down the main street and surrounding areas, that we're well positioned to welcome our visitors to town, and hopefully they'll spend a few dollars here before they head out to the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long time coming."</p>
        
            <p>Some locals questioned how long the highway would last, given that the previous repairs lasted just a year before the road was again wiped out by heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>However, Kirby said he was optimistic the road would hold, given the amount of work that had gone into it this time.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors who had not been to Kaitāia for a few years would be in for a few pleasant surprises, he added.</p>
        
            <p>One was the new Te Hiku Sports Hub, including an indoor pool complex, on the right just as people arrived in town from the south; the other was the new town square with a large steel and tōtara waka sculpture as a centrepiece, on what used to be a derelict supermarket site.</p>
        
            <p>"That's going to be a beautiful spot to hang out through summer, that's for sure," he said.</p>
