            <p>Team New Zealand dramatically scraped into the semi-final of the Women's America's Cup in Barcelona earlier on Saturday morning, but failed to advance to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Italy's Luna Rossa and Britain's Athena Pathway qualified for the one-race final of the first America's Cup for women, which will take place on Sunday morning (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the eight-race qualification series for Group A teams was reduced by two races due to fading winds, which meant that in race six Team New Zealand had to beat Switzerland's Alinghi to have a chance of advancing.</p>
        
            <p>When Team New Zealand botched the start it looked like they were on the brink of elimination, then the race was stopped after one leg when winds faded and boats went off their foils.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand thought their campaign was over, before officials said the race would be re-sailed.</p>
        
            <p>In their second attempt, New Zealand came from last position into second place, which resulted in a points tie with Alinghi, and the Kiwis won on count-back to advance as one of the top six semi-finalists.</p>
        
            <p>The other teams to make the semi-final of the event were the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.</p>
        
            <p>The race committee powered through the four-race semi-final series with Team New Zealand eventually finishing in fifth place.</p>
        
            <p>In the second semi-final race, Team New Zealand was penalised for obstructing Team Barcelona at the first mark, and finished fifth.</p>
        
            <p>The challenge for the America's Cup itself also begins on Sunday, with Britain taking on holders New Zealand for the "Auld Mug", the oldest international sporting trophy, which began in 1851.</p>
