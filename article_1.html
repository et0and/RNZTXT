            <p>From next year, the government expects all public schools to teach students to read in a "proven structured literacy approach".</p>
        
            <p>The pre-Budget announcement was made by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Education Minister Erica Stanford on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the government this week announced its six education priorities.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the approach would change the way Kiwi children learnt to read, improve achievement and set students up for success.</p>
        
            <p>It taught children to read by using sounds and phonics to understand words, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to read and write is a fundamental life skill that too many young people are missing out on. Recent data shows that just 56 percent of Year 8 students are at the expected level for reading, and just 35 percent for writing.</p>
        
            <p>"Domestic and international evidence shows this method is the most effective way of equipping children with strong reading skills that are critical for their futures."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said a number of schools already teach reading in this way and there had been "significant improvements" in achievement.</p>
        
            <p>She said she wanted all children to experience that.</p>
        
            <p>"This government has set an ambitious target of getting 80 percent of Year 8 students to curriculum level by 2030, and teaching structured literacy is a critical part of how we plan to get there."</p>
        
            <p>The government was putting $67 million, as part of Budget 2024, into supporting:</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said structured literacy went hand-in-hand with the government's requirement for schools to teach an hour every day of reading, writing and maths.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's funding announcement ensures teachers will receive the training, support and resources they need to deliver this.</p>
        
            <p>"Our teachers are amazing and we are supporting them to deliver improved outcomes in reading and writing."</p>
        
            <p>The new approach would be in place from term one of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The government's budget will be unveiled in full on 30 May</p>
