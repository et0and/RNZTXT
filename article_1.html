            <p>Samoa Airways has revealed that several staff have tested positive for drugs, including a pilot on a prescription sleeping pill.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said recent drug testing, conducted by the Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa, showed 10 percent of the tested staff returned positive results for illegal and prescriptive substances, as well as alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a reflection of a broader societal issue that affects not just Samoa, but communities worldwide," it said in a statement on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"The pilot who was tested positive for a prescriptive drug (sleeping pill) was also stood down, has been retested and returned with a negative result and will be allowed to fly."</p>
        
            <p>The airline said three staff members who tested positive for illicit drugs were stood down pending a board decision.</p>
        
            <p>Six employees who tested positive for alcohol have been issued warning letters and have been retested.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said safety is a priority.</p>
        
            <p>"Recent flight cancellations, while inconvenient, are a testament to our commitment to maintaining the highest safety standards," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"As the ground handler for major international carriers like Air New Zealand, Qantas, and Fiji Airways, Samoa Airways is acutely aware of the necessity to uphold a safe, drug-free environment."</p>
        
            <p>Samoa Airways introduced its drug and alcohol testing policy for all staff in October 2024.</p>
