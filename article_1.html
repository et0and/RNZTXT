            <p>The government is looking at a freeze on residential care funding, and being stricter on who is eligible to reduce costs, a leaked policy document reveals.</p>
        
            <p>The document, which was leaked on Tuesday, states that in order to meet the government's financial objectives there is likely to be no net increase in costs for individuals and residential care services, and no net increase in the number of people in residential care.</p>
        
            <p>"To stay within the indicative and fixed budgets, Needs Assessment and Service Co-ordination (NASC) and Enabling Good Lives (EGL) sites will need to apply eligibility criteria strictly for new entrants," it states.</p>
        
            <p>Residential care refers to long-term care given to people who are elderly or have disabilities who stay in a residential setting rather than their own home or a family home.</p>
        
            <p>NASC and EGL sites provide support for people with disabilities and those who require aged care.</p>
        
            <p>The hold on growth to residential care, according to the document, would extend to group homes and live alone arrangements, high and complex forensic care, rest home care, hospital level care and residential rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>It said other expenditure lines that may be affected include facility-based respite.</p>
        
            <p>Parents of Vision Impaired NZ spokeswoman Rebekah Graham said the document makes it clear that disabled people and their families will have their allocations cut.</p>
        
            <p>"The restrictions are so severe there is significant risk of harm to disabled people and their families, particularly for ageing parents who are finding care work increasingly difficult," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is clear from this document that the government is looking to severely curtail disabled people's lives, reduce allocated supports."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party disability spokeswoman Kahurangi Carter said the document showed gaining access to residential support will become more difficult under the new government.</p>
        
            <p>"The approach outlined appears to be focused on cost-cutting rather than genuinely improving community support options," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, the policy reflects concerns about a return to the negative outcomes of past deinstitutionalisation efforts, with a strong focus on budget constraints rather than improving support systems."</p>
        
            <p>Disability Issues Minister Louise Upston did not wish to comment.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Whaikaha Ministry for Disabled People said the recent Independent Review of Disability Support Services included a recommendation relating to freezing funding for residential care.</p>
        
            <p>"The intent of Recommendation 2 is to maintain current levels of funding for residential facility-based care for 2024/25, pending commissioning and completion of a detailed and urgent review of the contract and pricing models," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"For clarity, there is a freeze on current levels of spending on residential care, not on the total number of people receiving residential care.</p>
        
            <p>"The requirement for residential facilities to remain within indicative budget may limit the number of people who can enter residential care, however we have taken measures to account for critical cases."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said overall there has been an increase in the level of funding for disability support for the 2024/25 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>"The government provided an investment of $1.1 billion in disability support services in Budget 2024 for the funded period (five years).</p>
        
            <p>"Ministry of Disabled People Whaikaha continue to work closely with providers in a collaborative and supportive way to ensure ongoing provision of care services.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate that change can be unsettling, and we encourage people with concerns to contact their current providers in the first instance."</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Review of Disability Support Services was announced in March after reporting by Stuff revealed Whaikaha was reducing wheelchair services in response to cost pressures.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the review, Whaikaha's functions were significantly reduced earlier this month with disability support services shifting to the Ministry of Social Development.</p>
