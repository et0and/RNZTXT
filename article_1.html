            <p>Emergency services were told they would not need life-saving measures they had bought to the home of Pauline Hanna after a 111 call, a jury has heard.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court trial of 71-year-old Philip John Polkinghorne, a retired eye surgeon, began on Monday in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He is accused of murdering his wife and staging her death as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna, 63, was found dead in the Remuera home she shared with her husband in April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, St John emergency medical technician Hannah Matheson told the court Hanna was deceased when paramedics arrived at the home.</p>
        
            <p>Matheson said when they were entering, a woman, which defence identified as Polkinghorne's sister, said they would not need the oxygen they were bringing in.</p>
        
            <p>She said they found Hanna on the ground covered by a duvet. There was a piece of rope hanging from the balustrade and another piece on the staircase.</p>
        
            <p>Matheson said Polkinghorne told her he had followed the instructions of the 111 operator to "cut her down".</p>

            <p>She said Polkinghorne appeared reasonably calm, did not seem distressed, and answered their questions about the patient appropriately.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what happened that morning, Matheson said Polkinghorne told her he and his wife woke up separately. He said he then found her dead when he went to make her breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>Matheson said Polkinghorne told her his wife had depression.</p>
        
            <p>He was unaware of any names of medications that she took when asked.</p>
        
            <p>He described his occupation as a doctor.</p>
        
            <p>When she pointed out a fresh graze on his forehead, Matheson said Polkinghorne looked surprised it was there and said he was not aware of it.</p>
        
            <p>She said she later observed him move into the kitchen and call someone on a cellphone.</p>
        
            <p>"His demeanour changed and he appeared more upset and distressed on the phone.</p>
        
            <p>"He said she couldn't come in today, I assumed he was calling her workplace."</p>
        
            <p>When probed by Polkinghorne's defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield, Matheson acknowledged people respond differently in situations where an 'accident or sudden death' happens.</p>
        
            <p>She agreed it was human reaction for Polkinghorne to cover Hanna with a duvet.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
