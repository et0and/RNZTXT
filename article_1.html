            <p>The final three placings were the same as they were at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which was "amazing", Dame Lisa said.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously I was on the podium with Emma in Rio as well, so it's amazing to be part of a special group of women who are just dominating around the world, so it's cool."</p>

            <p>Speaking to Sky Sport, Dame Lisa said she was "incredibly privileged" to paddle in another Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"I just turn up to do my best. I love the paddling, I love the journey.</p>
        
            <p>"Striving for excellence has given me a lot of growth over the last 12 years."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had been keeping an eye on Csipes, who had been paddling "incredibly well", and did not panic when she surged ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"I always knew she was going to be a massive competitor, I just had to stick to my own game plan and trust my fitness and that's what I did."</p>
        
            <p>She said no matter the medal count, she was just happy to be at the Olympics with her team.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you put goals out there to try and win. It's more than the medals for us - to have my team here, no matter the result, we as a team have done amazing things together.</p>
        
            <p>"Thanks for the support at home, the pressure, the expectation, but to remember why I paddle is because I love it, so that's all I was trying to do today."</p>

            <p>"There was a lot of fear this morning first thing, a lot of emotions that came out, the pressure and the tension. But when I lined up, I wasn't afraid, I didn't panic. I just tried to stick to my game plan one stroke at a time and it just wasn't enough today."</p>
