            <p>Firefighters in Christchurch are searching for the source of a smokey haze drifting over parts of the city.</p>
        
            <p>Residents had reported smoke in Cracroft, Cashmere, Lyttelton, Linwood and other areas, and the haze was also visible from downtown Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) said calls began coming in just before 9.30am on Tuesday, but staff had so far not found anything.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said the smoke might be coming from burn-offs and lingering because of the still conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Restrictions on outdoor fires were lifted last week, and the region was now in an open fire season.</p>
