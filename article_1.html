            <p>A state of emergency remains in place in the Hawke's Bay town of Wairoa, after heavy rain and strong winds hit the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Four hundred properties, including 100 homes, were flooded on Wednesday, with many of them never having flooded before.</p>
        
            <p>Seventy-five people stayed in the town's evacuation centre last night.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Craig Little said while the town worked hard to clear debris from roads yesterday so people could access their homes, there will be a lot of infrstructure repair rquired, including on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very, very sad. This has never happened, they have never flooded where they've been."</p>
        
            <p>The state of emergency will remain in place until at least high tide, which is due shortly after 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, an evacuation order is still in place for about 140 homes in the township of Haumoana, south-east of Hastings.</p>
