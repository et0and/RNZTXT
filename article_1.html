            <p>Police said they were called to the Fairfield address at 2.10am, following a report of an assault. There they found one person dead and two seriously injured, who were transported to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"A 34-year-old man was found a short distance from the address with serious injuries and was also transported to hospital, where he remains under police guard," police said.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour who helped several of the children at the home after the incident said they believed the mother of the children had been stabbed, along with a baby and another child.</p>
        
            <p>Kasey Ritchie said they helped the other children keep warm in a nearby car until police came.</p>
        
            <p>She said they helped as much they could.</p>

            <p>Five ambulances, two critical care paramedics and two managers also attended the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to reassure the community that this is an isolated incident and there is no ongoing risk to the wider public."</p>

            <p>Police said the 34-year-old will "face charges in due course".</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton East MP Ryan Hamilton said it was a tragedy and a reminder to reach out to family and friends at this time of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"This time of year often brings out the best and worst. Our deepest sympathies for all the family involved and friends. It sounds like it's also been a very stressful event for the neighbourhood, so I just trust and hope that they'll get the support they need to work through this this tragic event."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton paid tribute to the first responders "who had to tend to badly injured children while others were celebrating the New Year".</p>
        
            <p>It was an isolate event with a person in custody, meaning no one else was at risk, he said.</p>
