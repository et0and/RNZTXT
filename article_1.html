            <p>The women keep winning on the water with another medal for New Zealand's rowers.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand's third rowing final of the day, the women's coxless four of Jackie Gowler, Phoebe Spoors, Kerri Williams and Davina Waddy took bronze, with the Netherlands winning gold in thrilling fashion.</p>
        
            <p>The Dutch team surged ahead with the British and Romanian rowers right on their tail, but the Kiwi quartet inched closer as the halfway mark approached.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were still in fourth with 1000m to race, looking to time their run to the finish but it never came, as the Dutch and British fought it out for first.</p>
        
            <p>In a frantic finish, the Dutch bow crossed the line a split second ahead of the British, and the Kiwis held off Romania to settle for bronze.</p>
