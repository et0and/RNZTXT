            <p>School pupils have been warned to avoid a West Auckland bus and train station today over fears of a planned mass brawl between students.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā West Police Inspector Kelly Farrant confirmed police were "aware of a possible planned disorder in New Lynn" this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be an increased police and security presence in the area, including around the bus and train station, ahead of the end of the school day.</p>
        
            <p>"In recent weeks, our staff have been conducting increased patrolling in response to issues with groups of young people fighting or intimidating people.</p>
        
            <p>Farrant said police want to emphasise that this type of behaviour is "completely unacceptable" and that they will "utilise all tools available to us to identify and hold youth offenders to account".</p>
        
            <p>The community can expect to see increasing numbers of police patrolling this area over the coming weeks, Farrant said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to acknowledge the public who report these matters to us and our community and agency partners."</p>
        
            <p>At least one Auckland college has sent an email to parents alerting them of the violent gathering and to avoid the New Lynn station area on their way home from school.</p>
        
            <p>A community patrol has announced it will be stepping up patrols to ward off any violence.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings come after a spate of violent attacks between youths at the New Lynn station.</p>
        
            <p>Green Bay High School sent an email to parents today warning them of the rumours</p>
        
            <p>"For our Green Bay High School students and whānau we recommend you plan to avoid the New Lynn Train Station if possible, and if you do need to pass through, be alert and spend as little time there as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We will let students know this today."</p>
        
            <p>Western Springs College/Ngā Puna o Waiōrea last night sent an "urgent" message to parents asking them to make alternative travel plans for their children.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been asked to notify whānau to please avoid students from transferring or stopping at New Lynn bus and train station tomorrow afternoon," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"If possible, please organise students to take alternative routes or make other arrangements."</p>
        
            <p>Western Springs College has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport confirmed it was aware of the rumours and said police were managing the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ops team and transport staff are in contact with police and will support as needed."</p>
        
            <p>New Lynn/Kelston Community Patrol said it would be adding extra patrols at the location as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>In a previous post, the community patrol noted "there have been a spate of assaults and unwanted behaviour at New Lynn bus/train transit station".</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Whau ward councillor Kerrin Leoni said she was in New Lynn yesterday afternoon speaking with local security guards about the issues in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just really concerned about this recent behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"The bullying behaviour is absolutely out of hand, people should not be scared to catch a bus or train."</p>
        
            <p>Leoni said the bullying had become a "huge trend" for some young people, and she had spoken with Waitematā Area Commander Sunny Patel yesterday about the fights.</p>
        
            <p>Bystanders reported this morning that police had already greatly increased foot patrols in New Lynn, especially around the bus and train station.</p>
        
            <p>"We possibly need to look at getting our Māori and Pasifika wardens more active," Leoni said.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had been in touch with musicians and "local role models" to create events against bullying.</p>
        
            <p>A 13-year-old schoolgirl was recently attacked by a group of up to 20 children as she waited for her bus at the New Lynn station.</p>
        
            <p>The attack happened about 6pm on Saturday, 20 April.</p>
        
            <p>Her mother had read a Herald report of a separate incident at the New Lynn bus station where a 13-year-old boy was set upon on April 14. Considering the similarity, she felt compelled to share her daughter's story.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought she would have been safe in such a public place, but I guess not," the mother said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping that just by saying something, it might help change things."</p>
