        <h2>Treaty Principles Bill to be introduced to Parliament this week</h2>
        <p>
The government intends to introduce the Treaty Principles Bill this week, according to a memo sent to lawyers by the Waitangi Tribunal.

The bill brings to life ACT Party policy, to enshrine what the Treaty means into law.

            <p>The government intends to introduce the Treaty Principles Bill this week, according to a memo sent to lawyers by the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>The Bill was set to be introduced on 18 November, but will now be put to the House on Thursday, before a national hīkoi opposing it is held next week.</p>
        
            <p>Associate justice minister David Seymour, who is responsible for the bill, had no comment.</p>
        
            <p>In response, the Tribunal has released its second interim report into the bill.</p>
        
            <p>The report calls the bill the worst, most comprehensive breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi in modern times - and if enacted, the bill would end any formal relationship between the Crown and Māori.</p>
        
            <p>- more to come</p>
