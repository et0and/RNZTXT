        <p>
Protesters holding signs reading Honour Te Tiriti and 'SHAME' are marching through Newmarket, starting at ACT's Epsom electorate office.

            <p>The bill risks undermining Aotearoa's social fabric with erroneous interpretations of Te Tiriti, protesters told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill being introduced in Parliament on Wednesday bill brings to life ACT policy to enshrine what the Treaty means into law.</p>
        
            <p>The party has long argued the original articles have been interpreted by the courts, the Waitangi Tribunal and successive governments - over decades - in a way that has amplified their significance and influence beyond the original intent.</p>
        
            <p>Māori leaders are furious at the introduction of the bill more than a week earlier than expected, calling the government's move "dishonourable".</p>
