            <p>Police say they have still not identified a man who is reported to have fallen from a ferry into Wellington harbour early on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The East By West ferry was travelling towards Days Bay, Eastbourne from Queens Wharf and left just after 6am.</p>
        
            <p>The man was the only passenger onboard, and was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>The man is described as in his 40's, fair skinned, around 180cm tall with dark hair. He was wearing a dark jacket with a zip and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre NZ coordinated a on-water search effort on Friday using detailed modelling and analysis of the harbour. It involved up to 14 vessels at its peak.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter, the police maritime unit and the coastguard including volunteers, as well as other vessels, took part in today's search.</p>

            <p>The man had not been located and active searching had been temporarily suspended pending a review, Senior Sergeant Rachael Boyd said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who had a family member or friend who matched this description and who had not returned home as expected should contact the police, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information that may assist in identifying this person, should call the police on 105, referencing file number 240524/6000.</p>
