            <p>A prominent former political figure has been found guilty on eight charges of indecent assault dating back to the 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>The man has been on trial in the Auckland District Court for sexually abusing two teenage boys in West Auckland and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>The man has had name suppression for the duration of the trial, but it can be reported he is not an MP.</p>
