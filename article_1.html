            <p>Tributes are pouring in for an acclaimed American Samoan poet and teacher who was murdered last Saturday in Apia allegedly by a fellow poet.</p>
        
            <p>According to local police Dr Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, a retired professor from the University of Hawai'i Manoa, was found dead at the Galu Moana Theatre in Vaivase-Uta.</p>
        
            <p>The Samoa Observer reported on Sunday that police had charged playwright and poet, Papalii Sia Figiel, with manslaughter with the death but on Monday upgraded the charge to murder.</p>
        
            <p>The 78-year-old Dr Sinavaiana-Gabbard, who was also a historian and environmentalist, has been described as a peaceful and calm person.</p>
        
            <p>The Samoa Observer reports a friend of Dr Sinavaiana-Gabbard said she was completely shocked and saddened when she found out.</p>
        
            <p>She said Dr Sinavaiana-Gabbard was a kindred spirit, a brilliant writer, and a supporter of writers.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone who did not deserve to die like that. She was a very private person despite being a giant in the literary world," they told the Observer.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Sinavaiana-Gabbard's death has also shocked many of her literary friends, who have been posting messages of condolence, and resulted in an outpouring of grief on social media reacting to the news.</p>

            <p>Born in 1946, she was an American Samoan academic, writer, poet, and environmentalist and was the first Samoan to become a full professor in the United States. She is the sister of American politician Mike Gabbard and the aunt of politician Tulsi Gabbard.</p>
        
            <p>She was born in Utulei village in American Samoa and educated at Sonoma State University, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Hawai'i.</p>
        
            <p>Her PhD thesis called 'Traditional Comic Theatre in Samoa: A Holographic View'. She taught creative writing at the University of Hawai'i for nearly 20 years and was an Associate Professor of Pacific literature at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa.</p>
        
            <p>In 2002, she published her collection of poetry, Alchemies of Distance and in August 2020, she was named by USA Today on its list of influential women from US territories.</p>
