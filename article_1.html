        <h2>Waatea News cuts ties with NZ Herald after Hobson's Pledge ad</h2>
        <p>
Waatea's publisher says he will send the Herald to court if it takes any further content from the national Māori news service.

The ad, which urges readers to sign a petition returning the seabed and foreshore to "public ownership", has continued to stir controversy.

            <p>Waatea News, the national Māori news service provider has announced it will cut ties with the New Zealand Herald following its front page publication of a Hobson's Pledge advertisement opposing iwi applications for customary marine titles.</p>
        
            <p>Waatea currently have an informal agreement with the New Zealand Herald where they pick up their content as publishers of the National Māori News Service and were working on formalising an agreement with them.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Herald's 7 August newspaper edition featured a wraparound ad that urged readers to sign a petition to return the seabed and foreshore to "public ownership."</p>
        
            <p>Waatea's general interim publisher Matthew Tukaki issued a statement today which said it is ending "any or all informal or formal agreements with the New Zealand Herald because of it".</p>
        
            <p>"Having reviewed the material printed last week, I cannot, and will not, in all good conscience accept that the Herald decided to accept an advertorial filled with misinformation - accepting a payment for what was essentially an advertisement sowing division between Māori and non-Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) chief executive Hilary Souter issued a statement to RNZ and said they "continued to receive complaints regarding this advertisement, and these are being processed".</p>
        
            <p>Kawea te Rongo, the Māori Journalists' Association, previously issued a statement calling for NZME to formally apologise to their organisation's kaimahi Māori, contributors, advertisers, and audience, and said they should review their advertising standards policies.</p>
        
            <p>Kawea Te Rongo said the statement "perpetuated racist rhetoric and promoted the false narrative that the foreshore and seabed was owned by Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori also announced a boycott of the New Zealand Herald and demanded they apologise and review their advertising standards.</p>

            <p>Hobson's Pledge spokesperson Don Brash condemned Te Pāti Māori and criticised those opposing the advertisement.</p>
        
            <p>"Accusations of misinformation have been levelled without evidence or even specifics of what exactly we have got wrong."</p>
        
            <p>"The level of rage the ad generated speaks to the degree to which radicals have whipped their supporters into a frenzy,"</p>
        
            <p>"Te Pāti Māori are interfering in commercial relationships with their call to boycott the Herald," Brash said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ last Thursday, an NZME spokesperson said the advertisement was clearly labelled as an ad, and that advertising responsibilities sit with the companies' commercial team- which is separate to the Herald's editorial.</p>
        
            <p>"There are several thousand advertisements placed across NZME's platforms every week and publishing an advertisement is in no way NZME's endorsement of the advertised message, products, services or other. "</p>
        
            <p>"We are keenly aware of our obligations as a publisher and broadcaster, including in respect of legislation and Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) codes," the NZME spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Tukaki understands this, but said they have the responsibility of "publishing facts not disinformation."</p>
        
            <p>Tukaki told RNZ the Herald had not responded to his statement, and he did not expect it to do so.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said if it continued to take content from Waatea he would issue a cease and desist order.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very happy to send them to court if they continue."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Herald has been approached for comment by RNZ.</p>
