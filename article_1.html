            <p>A man has been charged with murder after a body was found in a burnt-out car in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old man was arrested mid-afternoon on Good Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in Hastings District Court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"While an arrest has been made, there are still a number of unanswered questions," detective inspector Martin James said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe there are people in the community who have information that's of value to us; some may not realise it.</p>
