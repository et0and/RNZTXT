            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has won the British Open at St Andrews.</p>
        
            <p>It is her third major title.</p>
        
            <p>Ko went into the final round tied for fourth, three shots from the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic champion fired a three under par 69 which got her into a share of the lead late in her round and a birdie on the 18th gave her a one-shot lead.</p>
        
            <p>Ko then had to wait for her rivals to finish their rounds.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old finished two shots ahead of Lilia Vu and Nelly Korda of the United States, Jiyai Shin of South Korea and Ruoning Yin of China.</p>
        
            <p>Ko's previous best result at the British Open was a tie for third in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Her win at the Paris Olympics has qualified her for World Golf's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
