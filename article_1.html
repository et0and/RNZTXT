            <p>At least four people have been killed and dozens more injured in a mass shooting in one of the most popular entertainment areas of Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
        
            <p>The shooting erupted just after 11pm Saturday local time (4pm Sunday NZT) in the Five Points South area.</p>
        
            <p>CNN reported that two men and a woman were pronounced dead at the scene, while a fourth victim died in hospital later.</p>
        
            <p>"Multiple shooters fired multiple shots on a group of people," Birmingham police officer Truman Fitzgerald told CNN.</p>
        
            <p>No suspects were yet in custody.</p>
        
            <p>The victims were all shot on the streets or footpaths, Fitzgerald told CNN.</p>
        
            <p>Detectives were trying to determine whether the shooters were on foot or in a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Latest from Birmingham mass shooting in Five Points South. Shots were fired just after 11 p.m. and around 2:30 a.m. there was still a crowd gathered outside. @abc3340 https://t.co/V6LwHjWOoB pic.twitter.com/THXLXlZsdr</p>
        
            <p>Further gunshot victims were found in the area, while other victims arrived at local hospitals, Fitzgerald told CNN.</p>
        
            <p>"We have dozens of gunshot victims from this area. I'm told at least four of those gunshot victims are life-threatening, the others have various injuries."</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear exactly how many people opened fire or the motivation behind the attack, Fitzgerald said.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent reported that police were looking into whether a 'switch' - a device allowing a gun to act as an automatic weapon - had been used in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>They had asked the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to help with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police were calling for any witnesses to come forward, the Independent reported.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no greater resource than the public," the media outlet reported Fitzgerald as saying.</p>
        
            <p>"We will do everything we possibly can to make sure we uncover, identify and hunt down whoever is responsible for preying on our people."</p>
        
            <p>According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 403 mass shootings across the United States this year.</p>
        
            <p>A mass shooting is defined as a shooting that kills or wounds at least four victims.</p>
