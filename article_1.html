            <p>Police are hunting a prisoner who has escaped from a transport van in Taupō, and are warning people not to approach him.</p>
        
            <p>Samir Derek Belhajjam, 30, escaped custody in Taupō on Monday about 6pm, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who sees him or has information on his whereabouts is asked not to approach him, but instead to call 111 immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Belhajjam had been in a police transport van that was at a court building on Story Place when he escaped, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing green prison-issue shorts and T-shirt and an orange hi-vis vest at the time.</p>
        
            <p>There would be an increased police presence in the area, as officers hunt for Blhajjam, they said.</p>
