        <h2>Luxon backs minister's handling of police pay talks</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister says the expectation is the government will continue to negotiate in good faith, but he won't say where the negotiations are at.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is in south Auckland to launch a mobile breast screening unit at Manukau SuperClinic.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Health Minister Shane Reti and Minister for Women Louise Upston were also at Manukau SuperClinic to announce the expansion of breast cancer screening. It would mean 120,000 more women would be eligible every two years, Reti had said.</p>
        
            <p>The government's plan would also mean an average of two to three extra mammograms for women, once the programme is fully implemented.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the government's first 100-day plan was to take steps to extend free breast cancer screening to those aged up to 74.</p>
