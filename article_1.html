            <p>New Plymouth dog owners play it safe when it comes to naming their pooches, with Bella proving the top dog in the naming stakes.</p>
        
            <p>It is the most common dog name registered with the district council, with 155 pooches answering to Bella followed by Poppy (138), Charlie (122), Max (120) and Luna (118).</p>
        
            <p>Animal Control Supervisor Scott Goldfinch said there were also more unusual choices.</p>
        
            <p>"Then there are the unique names, like Autobot and Winnifred Wolf Allen. And personally, I really like Ronnie Barker."</p>
        
            <p>Goldfinch said as the weather heats up, NPDC's Animal Control Team had some tips for keeping your dog happy and healthy during the hot summer months:</p>
        
            <p>If your dog opes missing over the summer season, owners are urged to check if it is in NPDC's dog pound by calling 06-759 6060.</p>
