        <h2>Corroding sewerage pipe could collapse part of SH2</h2>
        <p>
The pipe has been given the highest possible risk rating due to the likelihood of "significant structural failures".

            <p>A corroding sewerage pipe could collapse a section of State Highway 2 in Lower Hutt if it fails, new documents reveal.</p>
        
            <p>In April, RNZ reported the 60-year-old pipe - which carries all of Upper Hutt's sewage - could be at risk in two places.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities are now trying to work out how to fix a section under the major throughfare.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released under the Official Information Act reveal the scale of the damage the pipe could cause and the estimated $4.5 million fix.</p>
        
            <p>The Western Hills main sewer runs from Silverstream, through Upper Hutt, along State Highway 2 near the Hutt River through to Petone and then to the Seaview Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>
        
            <p>The pipe is at risk in two places near Taita Rock and under State Highway 2 near Melling Station.</p>
        
            <p>An urgent briefing on the pipe said its risk rating near Melling Station was 25 out of 25 due to sections of it being in poor condition.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a risk that "significant structural failures will increase".</p>
        
            <p>The document said that there was a high risk of failure and collapse due to ongoing corrosion from hydrogen sulphide gas.</p>
        
            <p>If the pipe failed, it could cause large volumes of sewage to flow into the Hutt River for "extended periods "and trigger the collapse of a section of State Highway 2 that sits above the pipeline.</p>
        
            <p>The document also stated a failure could result in significant disruption on the road because of emergency works and disrupt wastewater services to both Lower and Upper Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>It also noted that if the pipe continued to degrade, it may have to be replaced rather than just re-lined, which Wellington Water estimated would cost about three times as much.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water told RNZ it had created a contingency plan for if the pipe did fail.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of relining the pipe, its funding risks and other associated works such as traffic management for State Highway 2 would total $4,572,523, the documents showed.</p>
        
            <p>Future design concept works should consider renewing the pipe versus relining it, the briefing said.</p>
        
            <p>The work for the pipe was unfunded and would need to be added to Wellington Water's wastewater renewals budget.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions, Wellington Water told RNZ the $4.5 million price tag was subject to change depending on the options assessment and an ongoing design process.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt South MP Chris Bishop told RNZ that he expected Wellington Water, the New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi, and the relevant local councils to be treating the problem "seriously".</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Mayor Campbell Barry said the information provided to RNZ would come through to the council in due course.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be options as we consider it alongside our capital investment programme, which we signed off in our long term plan last month."</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council chair Daran Ponter said the group's concern was ensuring that no sewage discharge entered Te Awa Kairangi or its tributaries if a failure was to occur.</p>
        
            <p>"This could become problematic in a high rainfall event."</p>
        
            <p>He said NZTA may need to be prepared to limit traffic under State Highway 2 while remedial works took place.</p>
