            <p>A couple more rats have been found at South Dunedin Woolworths, formerly Countdown, a month after it was cleared.</p>
        
            <p>The supermarket reopened on 28 February after being closed for almost three weeks to eliminate the pests.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said two rats had been captured since the store reopened, but it was satisfied that Woolworths had continued to focus on its pest management.</p>
        
            <p>A food compliance officer continued to monitor the pest control efforts during visits to the supermarket, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to note that given the size and nature of supermarkets, rodents can enter and leave them from time to time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Stores generally do not need to close each time, as long as the issue is dealt with promptly and in a way that minimises food safety risk."</p>
        
            <p>He referred questions about any sightings to Woolworths, saying the supermarket managed pest control.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety is investigating the rodent problem.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was first discovered in October 2023 and dozens of rats have been captured since.</p>
        
            <p>The store initially thought they were crawling into the building. But in February, Woolworths said it had found evidence of rats nesting in the supermarket's walls.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths has been approached for comment.</p>
