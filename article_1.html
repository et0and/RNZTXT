            <p>NZ Herald owner NZME plans to cut 38 jobs as it reorganises its news operations.</p>
        
            <p>It called staff into a meeting this morning and told them its plans to "reorganise and resize" its news operations across the national newsroom, including the NZ Herald, BusinessDesk, and Newstalk ZB.</p>
        
            <p>It said it planned to publish and produce fewer stories, to focus on those that engage audience.</p>
        
            <p>It said it would also further invest in video.</p>
        
            <p>Journalists would be grouped into a team-based structure across live news, business, sport, lifestyle and politics.</p>
        
            <p>The cuts are understood to be across 14 reporting and 24 production roles. Two Newstalk ZB vacancies would not be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>This comes a month after NZME confirmed it would close 14 community newspapers impacting about 30 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>The company employs about 300 editorial staff across the NZ Herald, BusinessDesk and Newstalk ZB.</p>
