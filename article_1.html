            <p>The police minister says he is confident enough measures are in place to maintain order during the tangi of a senior Mongrel Mob member in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>A large number of gang members are expected in the district this weekend to mourn former chapter president Sonny Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Mitchell said the police had assigned 70 local staff and 30 from out of town, to send a clear message that unlawful behaviour would not be tolerated.</p>
        
            <p>"The police will take action if they're there, but the reality is they can't be everywhere at any given time. So their message to the public is if you do observe something and someone is breaking the law, then please report it and the police will follow up.</p>
        
            <p>"But if there is any offending that's happening in front of police, then obviously the expectation is that they will take action on that."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said police in the area had dealt with major gang activity in recent months, and proved effective in reducing the disruption to the public.</p>

            <p>Central Hawke's Bay Mayor Alex Walker urged motorists to be patient.</p>
        
            <p>"Our towns are really busy already, traffic that is going through with people that are heading away on holiday for the weekend. I just ask everybody out and about across Hawke's Bay on the weekend that they do take care and are patient with those around them and on the roads."</p>
        
            <p>Walker said the police had been communicating with the council to ensure public safety over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been really pleased with the communicationâ€¦ so far they have certainly been visible and around, and their presence is vital."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said gang members had a "right to be able to mourn and go to a tangi", but no right to take over the roads and intimidate people.</p>
        
            <p>"As a government we've been very clear that we're not tolerating that behaviour anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were also monitoring a second expected tangi and hikoi through Napier for another gang member, and motorists should expect to see large numbers of gang members around on Saturday morning.</p>
