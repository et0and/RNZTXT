            <p>Odours from the city's Seaview Wastewater Treatment Plant are worse than ever before despite recent upgrades to improve the smells, a Lower Hutt resident claims.</p>
        
            <p>Just before Christmas, biofilter work was finished ahead of schedule. It followed 111 complaints about the facility's smell between 31 October and 12 December.</p>
        
            <p>The complaints triggered the Greater Wellington Regional Council to investigate, resulting in more than $40,000 worth of fines to be dished out to the facility's owners.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council said it had received a further 50 complaints since the biofilter was finished.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby resident and Stop the Stench group member Dr Kylie Hood said lately the smell was the worst it had ever been.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just  very strong sewage smell and that combined with the heat at the moment has made it really unbearable for some local residents.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so hot but you can't open your doors and windows."</p>
        
            <p>The group had been continuing to file complaints to the regional council over the issue following the biofilter being installed, Hood said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though it takes quite a while to lodge the complaint, we keep doing that so that there's a record of the impact the smell is having on the community."</p>
        
            <p>But, fellow Stop the Stench member and homeowner, Robert Wills said he had noticed a difference recently.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been days where there has been no smell at all and subsequent days where unexpectedly we get a strong whiff of ... well odours that aren't pleasant."</p>
        
            <p>He is keeping a close eye on how the plant changes improve the area.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll give the Wellington Water and Hutt City Council their four to six weeks for the biofilter to bed in and see how it performs after that."</p>
        
            <p>Hutt South MP and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop lives near the plant and said the biofilter had made some difference.</p>
        
            <p>"On some days it's really bad on other days you can't really smell it at all, it's bedding in now and so hopefully over the next few weeks we'll see a real improvement."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would be urging the Upper Hutt and Hutt City councils to continue upgrading the plant.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents of Lower Hutt should not have to live surrounded by the smell of poo basically, on a near daily basis and I think that's just got to be the bottom line."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said it reflects the wider state of infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"This all speaks to a legacy that we are inheriting as a new government of underinvestment in water infrastructure over many years."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said the biofilter was the first step to improving odour at the Seaview Treatment Plant.</p>
        
            <p>To address the long-term issue, it said Hutt City Council had included proposed upgrades and improvements in the draft Long-Term Plan worth $13 million.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider said since the biofilter replacement works were completed, there had been a noticeable difference in the smell.</p>
