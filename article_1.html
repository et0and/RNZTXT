            <p>During a remarkably combative Oval Office meeting on Friday (local time), both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he was insufficiently thankful.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to be thankful. You don't have the cards," Trump said, adding a bit later, "You gotta be more thankful."</p>
        
            <p>"Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?" Vance asked.</p>
        
            <p>Trump might have been referring to Zelensky's posture toward Trump in particular, as Vance appeared to be.</p>
        
            <p>But as their heated exchange with Zelensky reverberates around the world, it's worth noting that Zelensky has thanked the United States on numerous occasions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - expressing gratitude to Trump and President Joe Biden, to members of Congress from both parties to US defence companies and their employees, and the American people.</p>
        
            <p>After Zelensky left the White House on Friday, he wrote on X: "Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that."</p>
        
            <p>Here are 33 previous examples of Zelensky thanking or expressing gratitude toward the United States, its officials or its people for their support. This is not a comprehensive list. Notably, we did not review Zelensky's many domestic remarks in Ukrainian.</p>
        
            <p>January 21, 2022, on X: "Thank you @POTUS for the unprecedented (American) diplomatic and military assistance for (Ukraine)."</p>
        
            <p>July 1, 2022, on X: "I commend US historic decision to provide UA with new security assistance package, including modern air defense systems. Thank you @POTUS for your continued leadership and support of UA in its fight against the aggressor. Together towards the victory!"</p>
        
            <p>August 19, 2022, on X: "I highly appreciate another (American) military aid package in the amount of $775 million. Thank you @POTUS for this decision! We have taken another important step to defeat the aggressor. (Ukraine) will be free!"</p>
        
            <p>December 21, 2022, meeting with Biden: "Thank you so much, Mr. President. Of course thanks bipartisan support. Thanks Congress. And thanks from our, just, ordinary people to your ordinary people, Americans. I really appreciate."</p>

Thank you all, from everyone who is now at the front line, from everyone who is awaiting victory."
