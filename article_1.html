            <p>The Kāpehu Whetu or cultural star compass on the summit of Mt Maunganui has been damaged in a serious act of vandalism overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The taonga, named Atea-ā-Rangi, was installed in 2022 by Ngā Poutiriao o Mauao Trust and Te Puna I Rangiriri Trust, to celebrate the Māori New Year.</p>
        
            <p>The greenstone compass, sourced from the Arahura River in the South Island, sits at the peak of Mauao in Tauranga. In 2023, it had bronze rings added to it, which builders had previously told RNZ, they hoped would last at least 200 years.</p>
        
            <p>Listen to an RNZ interview about the addition of the bronze rings. </p>
        
            <p>However, in an attack overnight, photos posted online show that the pounamu has been chipped and hacked at, with dirt thrown on top.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Mauao Trust said the damage to the taonga has been assessed and temporary restoration work was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask that the community please do not climb or lean over the fencing to view or take photos of the compass to prevent further damage. We also ask the public to respect the maunga and the forthcoming closure."</p>

            <p>Tauranga mayor Mahé Drysdale condemned the incident, calling it a "despicable and disrespectful act which should not and will not be tolerated".</p>
        
            <p>"This has been reported to the police, and we encourage anyone with information that might assist to come forward, so that those who have committed this wanton vandalism can be held accountable."</p>
        
            <p>The original artists of Ātea-ā-Rangi will travel to Tauranga to assess the damage, Tauranga City Council said, with the dates for this visit yet to be confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the assessment is complete, a timeline for repairs will be established, and during these repairs there will be a full closure of Mauao. The dates for this closure will be communicated to the public in advance."</p>
        
            <p>All other areas of Mauao, including all tracks remain open.</p>

Mount Maunganui is the ancestral maunga known as Mauao to local tangata whenua, and stands at around 232 metres high.

            <p>It was believed to have occurred between 7pm on Thursday and 3.30am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are following lines of enquiry to locate those responsible and would like to speak to anyone who may have information that could assist, including CCTV or dashcam footage."</p>
        
            <p>Police have sought help from the public. Anyone with information can call 105, using the reference number 241213/4295.</p>
