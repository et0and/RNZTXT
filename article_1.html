        <h2>Lotto tickets sales to be banned for under 18s</h2>
        <p>
Lotto is supportive of the change, saying it would remove a grey area for retailers and customers.

            <p>Lotto is welcoming a proposal that will ban the sale of all Lotto products - in-store and online - to people aged under 18.</p>
        
            <p>Instant Kiwi tickets were the only Lotto product which was age restricted prior to the change.</p>
        
            <p>Head of corporate communications Will Hine said it would help to remove a grey area.</p>
        
            <p>He said while Lotto did not have firm data about the number of under-18s purchasing products, he understood the numbers were very low.</p>
        
            <p>Hine said Lotto already had strict processes in place to ensure it did not target children or young people in the advertising or promotion of any products, whether they were age restricted or not.</p>
        
            <p>The legislation will be introduced to parliament later this year.</p>
