            <p>Firefighters responding to the blaze were confronted with thick billowing smoke when they arrived at the property this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed one person had died: "We can confirm now that sadly, a person was located deceased inside the house," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Four occupants were assessed by ambulance staff at the scene of the blaze in Tidal Rd.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews received multiple calls alerting them to the blaze at 1.23pm today, a Fire and Emergency NZ spokeswoman said.</p>
        
            <p>Video footage posted on social media from a neighbouring property shows thick white smoke billowing from the front of a house.</p>

            <p>Hato Hone St John ambulance said four patients in minor conditions were assessed at the scene and did not require treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The FENZ spokeswoman said: "The house was approximately 15m by 10m and was well-involved in fire on our arrival."</p>
        
            <p>Four fire trucks are at the scene and have been able to put the blaze out, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have fire investigators responding to ascertain the cause of the fire and police and ambulance are in attendance."</p>
        
            <p>Authorities are yet to release information about whether anyone has been injured in the fire.</p>
