        <h2>Pedal to the metal for Dunedin electrician</h2>
        <p>
Mastodon, Slayer and Whitechapel are not among the usual clientele for the average New Zealand tradie.

            <p>Mastodon, Slayer and Whitechapel are not among the usual clientele for the average New Zealand tradie. Tim Scott chats to a Dunedin sparkie who supplies equipment to some of the biggest names in the metal scene.</p>
        
            <p>According to Tony Pepers, "you're either a really good engineer or a really good musician, not both".</p>
        
            <p>While running a custom music pedal manufacturing business for over a decade had pushed him to improve his guitar playing, the Dunedin electrician admits he is "still a better engineer than I am a musician".</p>
        
            <p>Pepers' pedals, a lot of them built at his own kitchen table, have made their way into the hands of Mastodon, Slayer and soon the Violent Femmes.</p>
        
            <p>"I never really envisioned it becoming what it has become now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My pedals have now been used on records and in studios all around the world, it's a bit of a shock, to be honest."</p>

            <p>Pepers said he used to play bass in a punk band and had always been into electronics since he was "a wee nipper".</p>
        
            <p>He built pedals under the moniker of Pepers' Pedals since 2012, but it passed the threshold of being a "proper business" about three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The "hobby turned business" started to kick off in 2019, but it was during the Covid-19 pandemic when everyone was at home learning new instruments that it got "massive".</p>
        
            <p>He produced a lot of distortion and fuzz pedals for guitar, mainly for the punk and metal scenes, but had even made a custom pedal for an electric violin.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the parts he bought in bulk, ordering direct through manufacturers in Thailand and China, before assembling them himself and exporting abroad, a good 95 percent of his business coming from outside of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>His customers found the fact they were made in New Zealand to be "kind of cool and niche", he said.</p>
        
            <p>His most popular product, the Dirty Tree Boost pedal, added "something magical to your tone" and had sold more than 3200 units.</p>

            <p>He also built an infinite repeat delay pedal which generated big swells that "turned everything into garbage, which can be quite musical for some people. Other people not".</p>
        
            <p>He had built pedals for Beastwars, the guitar technician for Neil Finn, and shipped pedals to Slayer and Mastodon.</p>
        
            <p>The band manager for the Violent Femmes had also recently ordered a pedal.</p>
        
            <p>The Whitechapel album Kin, and a yet-to-be-released album had both been recorded using some of his pedals, and he spoke regularly to one of their guitarists, Zach Householder, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite hard to remember all the artists. I really should write a list.</p>
        
            <p>"I've made a lot of pedals for bands that I never thought I'd ever even talk to."</p>

            <p>Pepers hoped he would one day make a pedal for Dave Grohl, and planned to showcase his products at the National Association of Music Merchants (Namm), in Anaheim, next year.</p>
        
            <p>He recently built his 6000th pedal.</p>
        
            <p>And his pedals were "kind of like my children", he said.</p>
        
            <p>He still had the very first pedal he made, a Big Muff fuzz pedal turned "bag of spaghetti", which he had vowed never to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"It sits up on top of my shelf in the workshop and I look at it every now and then.</p>
        
            <p>"This is where I was, this is where I am."</p>
