        <h2>Ellesse Andrews nabs Olympic gold in her 'work-on' event</h2>
        <p>
She's stronger in other disciplines, and expectations had been tempered. Then she powered home to a win.

            <p>Ellesse Andrews has bagged her third medal of the Paris Olympics - a gold in the women's sprint cycling, her 'bonus' event.</p>
        
            <p>It is Andrews' second gold medal of the Games and New Zealand's 10th.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews faced off against German rider Lea Friedrich in the medal races late Saturday night NZT after twice beating Great Britain's Emma Finucane - the reigning world champion - in the semifinals.</p>
        
            <p>Friedrich and Andrews were closely matched. The German set a new world record of 10.029 seconds for the 200m flying lap during sprint qualifiers on Friday, while Andrews was not far behind, with 10.108 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The gold medal race was a best-of-three format. Andrews took the lead in the first race and never relinquished it, slicing home to beat Friedrich by 0.095 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>She then started her second medal race sitting behind Friedrich, but raised the pace with two laps to go and blasted past the German for the win.</p>
        
            <p>Going into the sprints, Andrews already held two medals from the Paris Games - a silver in the women's team sprint relay and a gold in the women's keirin.</p>
        
            <p>Getting through to the gold medal race was a huge result for Andrews. Speaking earlier in the week, her coach and father Jon said the sprint was considered her "work-on" event for the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"Ellesse is a really determined athlete, so she'll want to do well in the sprints. She's not quite as strong in the sprints," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"She's still learning a lot in that space, and she loves the kierin. Like she actually loves the chaos of the kierin, which is kind of crazy because if you got two riders on the track, it's a lot simpler in terms of execution, but Ellesse finds that harder."</p>
        
            <p>Andrews continued New Zealand's gold medal blitz over the final weekend of the Paris Games, adding a fourth gold in the space of 24 hours following the triumphs of kayak queen Lisa Carrington, Lydia Ko on the golf course and high jumper Hamish Kerr.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to these Games, New Zealand had not won cycling gold for 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>The last Kiwi rider to achieve the feat was Sarah Ulmer, in the individual pursuit at the 2004 Athens Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Then Andrews went and won two gold medals in three days.</p>
        
            <p>Finucane took the bronze medal in the sprints after winning two straight races against Hetty van de Wouw of the Netherlands.</p>
