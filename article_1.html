            <p>A Nelson woman whose bowel and ovaries were fused together with scar tissue from endometriosis says she was forced to go private after waiting 19 months for a phone call from Nelson hospital about a specialist appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Aleisha Hosie, who was suffering severe pain and bleeding, said her family pitched in $500 for her to see a gynaecologist and she also paid to have a hysterectomy privately last year.</p>
        
            <p>She said she only received a call from Nelson Hospital two weeks ago about a specialist appointment - 19 months after first seeking help from her GP.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand sent a crisis team to Nelson this week after several senior hospital doctors went public with their concerns about excessively long wait times, under staffing, and lives being put at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Provisional data from Health NZ showed almost 500 patients on the Obstetrics and Gynaecology wait list have been waiting longer than the recommended four months for their first specialist appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Hosie told Checkpoint she was initially told she would have an appointment within two months, but when she hadn't heard anything after five months, she phoned the Nelson gynaecology department,</p>
        
            <p>"I was suffering quite severe pain all of the time, and it was getting to the point where it was unbearable, and I was told they were only seeing emergency cases or people who had been waiting longer than 365 days and basically I wouldn't be seen within a year."</p>
        
            <p>She said she could not wait that long.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I can't wait another month, I need to see someone, and that's when I approached family and we decided we would fund it ourselves to see a private gynaecologist."</p>
        
            <p>Hosie had private surgery a year after her diagnosis, and had still not heard from Nelson Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Once I had my surgery, I found out I had quite severe endometriosis, which was never picked up through the public health system.</p>
        
            <p>"My ovaries and uterus, my bowel, were all fused together by scar tissue which was causing the severe pain every month.</p>
        
            <p>"So, I was quite shocked, I didn't know that. It had never been indicated to me that this could be a problem. Never indicated through a scan or a follow up."</p>
        
            <p>Hosie said she finally received a phone call from Nelson Hospital two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>"So that was 19 months after being told I would get the specialist appointment. And that's just for the first appointment, just for them to get the ball rolling.</p>
        
            <p>"But when is the follow-up appointment, is it another year away? I just thought this was not on."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ spokesperson Martin Keogh said it acknowledged the impact delays had on patients like Hosie and their families, and apologised to those affected.</p>
        
            <p>He said Health NZ was doing its best to improve wait times.</p>
