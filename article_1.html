            <p>Public servants' jobs are on the chopping block as the sector scrambles to meet the Finance Minister's cost-cutting targets. Find out how many jobs are going and where.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has directed ministries and agencies to slash expenditure by either 6.5 percent or 7.5 percent to help reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>So far, 795 jobs* are set to go.</p>
        
            <p>And with many ministries yet to release their plans for the cuts, that number will only continue to grow. Minister for Regulation David Seymour previously indicated it could hit 7500.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what we know so far about job losses.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE has completed its first round of voluntary redundancies, with 111 staff already gone. The ministry soon extended the offer of voluntary redundancy to other departments.</p>
        
            <p>On 4 March, it told RNZ it was consulting with staff about further redundancies. Its Digital, Data and Insights group was facing a proposal to disestablish a number of jobs, or force workers to reapply for a reduced number of roles, it said.</p>
        
            <p>It is proposing to cut 134 jobs in total - some of which are already vacant.</p>
        
            <p>A quarter of all positions will be disestablished (271), while 137 new positions are proposed.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation will close on 26 April and a final decision will be made in June.</p>
        
            <p>With a proposal that amounts to mass voluntary redundancies, the PSA says hundreds of workers could be affected, ranging from the service delivery, MƒÅori communities and partnerships teams, as well as those in human resources, policy, strategy and communications.</p>
        
            <p>It is proposing to cut around 231 staff.</p>
        
            <p>Employees were informed by email that it wished to reduce staff numbers by an estimated 9 percent, including vacancies but also disestablishing roles.</p>
        
            <p>In total, 384 roles would go, of which 40 percent were vacant.</p>
        
            <p>It is set to lose 40 percent of its staff. The PSA said the ministry informed staff it was considering shedding 63 of 156 positions. That included 32 people currently employed, and 31 vacant roles.</p>
        
            <p>There has already been a net reduction of 24 roles across the organisation, most of which were vacant, said chief executive Audrey Sonerson.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry made a number of staff redundant and got rid of vacancies it had been struggling to fill, and did not intend to make further staffing changes at this stage, she said.</p>
        
            <p>33 Customs staff have accepted voluntary redundancy or early retirement. The service is still considering further options to help meet the required savings, including reviewing existing vacancies, it said.</p>
        
            <p>At Crown Law, 17 roles will be disestablished. Of those, nine were currently vacant - meaning eight people would lose their jobs, which was about 3.5 percent of its staff.</p>
        
            <p>Crown Law said the new structure would be in place from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has begun consultations about reducing the number of permanent staff by 14 percent and its work out of regional government offices in Hamilton, New Plymouth, Napier and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association told RNZ it was not clear how many jobs would be lost, but it understood it could be around nine - with 32 roles to be disestablished, and replaced with 23 new roles.</p>
        
            <p>The government science agency is proposing to cut staff and focus on science projects that make money.</p>
        
            <p>A document recently issued to staff at a meeting, which RNZ has seen, said the organisation needed to "reduce in size" and focus "exclusively on revenue-generating, commercial science services".</p>
        
            <p>The document contained no details of how many jobs would go or how much money needed to be saved. But it blamed significant cost pressures for the "reset".</p>
        
            <p>The commission was axed completely to make way for the new Ministry for Regulation, with more than 20 staff losing their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Next week, the Department of Conservation and the Department of Internal Affairs will announce their plans for cuts, and the following week Oranga Tamariki will do the same, the Public Service Association confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>*Job loss numbers are based on ministries' proposals, and could change after consultation with staff. Total staff numbers are based on Public Service Commission figures from 30 June 2023.</p>
