        <h2>How our spy agency 'engages' with Chinese NZers to protect national security</h2>
        <p>
The SIS tries to dissuade certain people from their activities. The Chinese Embassy says it's "deeply troubling".

            <p>The country's intelligence service has confirmed it engages with individuals related to certain front organisations to dissuade them from activities that are not in line with national security interests.</p>
        
            <p>On 18 September, the Chinese Embassy lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade over the "harassment and intimidation of local Chinese community members by individuals claiming to be 'New Zealand intelligence personnel'."</p>
        
            <p>The embassy said several members of the Chinese community had been subjected to harassment following the release earlier this month of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service's annual threat assessment.</p>
        
            <p>"The Chinese side views these actions deeply troubling, as they are egregious and grossly unfair, thus utterly unacceptable," a statement from the Chinese Embassy said.</p>
        
            <p>"The embassy urged these activities to cease immediately."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from NZSIS said the report had detected foreign interference in New Zealand, including activities from China, that could result in "severe infringement on the rights and freedoms of New Zealand communities".</p>
        
            <p>"The report further outlined how complex and deceptive front organisations are used by the People's Republic of China against New Zealand's diverse Chinese communities," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>NZSIS confirmed it had engaged with individuals connected with certain front organisations to "dissuade them from engaging in activities that were not in accordance with New Zealand's national security".</p>
        
            <p>"This is an example of NZSIS doing its job to protect all communities in New Zealand. Such engagements are conducted professionally and in accordance with our role," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The activities of the NZSIS are subject to the independent oversight of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS), and anyone has a right to complain to the IGIS about the actions of the NZSIS if they wish."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that it had received a formal representation from the Chinese Embassy on the matter.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a pro-democracy group of Chinese New Zealanders on Sunday launched a petition that called on the government hold an open inquiry into China's foreign interference activities in New Zealand and the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"It is now imperative that a full and public inquiry is held into this situation," a statement from the New Zealand Values Alliance said. "New Zealand needs to face up to the domestic and external security risk, to better protect its own people as well as its national security."</p>
