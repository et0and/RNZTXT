            <p>A Jetstar aircraft has been forced to re-route mid-flight due to rough conditions - the carrier's second flight to encounter flight troubles this week.</p>
        
            <p>A flight from Auckland to Dunedin was turned around on Saturday afternoon after facing significant turbulence.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said no one was injured and that the move was precautionary.</p>
        
            <p>It came after a Jetstar flight landing at Christchurch Airport slid off the runway on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>There were no injuries during that incident, but the airport was closed until mid-morning and a number of flights were cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation into the landing on Friday had been launched by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC). The agency said initial indications are that the Airbus A320 aircraft may have experienced a steering problem linked to failure of one of three hydraulic systems as it was landing.</p>
        
            <p>Just over a week ago, three New Zealanders were injured - one seriously - after a Singapore Airlines flight hit severe turbulence between London and Singapore.</p>
        
            <p>One man was killed and more than 100 people needed medical treatment after the flight.</p>
