            <p>The government's public transport subsidies are coming to an end - but how much fares will rise depends on where you are in the country.</p>
        
            <p>The Community Connect fare subsidy meant children aged 5 to 12 travelled free and those aged 13-24 got half-price fares.</p>
        
            <p>It was introduced in mid-2023, off the back of a previous subsidy put in place to counteract soaring petrol prices due to the war in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday is the final day that the subsidy is in place and fares will rise in many places from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>However, some councils will continue to fund cheaper fares for select groups.</p>
        
            <p>Here is a look at how much more people will pay for the bus or train in the main centres once the subsidy ends.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 May, young people aged 13-15, and secondary students aged 16-19, will all see their fares double on buses and trains.</p>
        
            <p>Weekday zone 1 travel will rise from 70 cents to $1.35, zone 2 travel will rise from $1.30 to $2.60, and zone 3 travel will rise from $1.75 to $3.55. Zone 9 travel, at the top end of the scale, will go from $3.35 to $6.60</p>
        
            <p>Children aged 5-12 will no longer travel for free and must also pay those same fares.</p>
        
            <p>Young people aged 16 to 24 who are not eligible for another concession must pay adult fares. That includes under-18s who are no longer attending high school.</p>
        
            <p>Their fares will rise from $1.25 to $2.60 for zone 1, $2.20 to $4.45 for zone 2, $3 to $6 for zone 3, and $3.70 to $7.40 for zone 4.</p>
        
            <p>Ferry fares will also rise. Children aged 13-15 and secondary students aged 16-19 will now pay $3.55, up from $1.75, for travel in the inner harbour (between the Viaduct and Bayswater, Birkenhead, Northcote Point, and Devonport). Children 5-12 must pay the same fares.</p>
        
            <p>For those aged 16-24 who are not in school, the fare will increase from $3 to $6.</p>
        
            <p>For travel in the mid harbour (between the city and Half Moon Bay, West Harbour, Hobsonville or Beach Haven), fares will rise from $2.42 to $5.10 for those aged 13-19 and in secondary school. Children aged 5-12 must also pay $5.10.</p>
        
            <p>Youth aged 16-24 who are not in school will see their fare rise from $4.12 to $8.50.</p>
        
            <p>Those with Community Services cards can get 50 percent off adult fares, while Total Mobility or Blind Low Vision NZ card-holders can get up to 40 percent off adult fares on buses, trains and ferries.</p>
        
            <p>Tertiary students receive about 20 percent off adult fares.</p>
        
            <p>Children aged 5-13 will continue to travel for free on buses and trains during the weekends if they tag on and off with an AT HOP card.</p>
        
            <p>Children under 5 do not need an AT HOP card and can continue to travel for free at all times.</p>
        
            <p>Here is the full breakdown of the changes Auckland public transport fares.</p>
        
            <p>The Waikato Regional Council says it has decided to continue the current public transport fare structure and extend the concessions until 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>However, from 1 July, public transport fares in Waikato will increase by 20 percent on BUSIT and Te Huia.</p>
        
            <p>From the same day, fares will revert back to the previous structure in the region of one standard Bee Card fare and one cash fare regardless of passenger age.</p>
        
            <p>The full breakdown of fare changes can be found here.</p>
        
            <p>Fares for those aged 5-24 will rise from 1 May throughout Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>However, Metlink bus and train fares vary depending on the time of day, and those travelling off-peak can receive a hefty discount.</p>
        
            <p>During peak times (weekdays from 7am-9am and 3pm-6.30pm), those aged 19-24 with a Snapper card will be charged $1.84 for travel in zone 1 (up from 92 cents), $3.02 for travel in zone 2 (up from $1.51) and $4.03 (up from $2.01) for travel in zone 3.</p>
        
            <p>At the most expensive end at the scale, 19-24-year-olds travelling at peak times in zone 14 will pay $15.95, up from $7.97.</p>
        
            <p>However, if the traveller is studying at a tertiary institution, the fares are $1.38, $2.27 and $3.02 for zones 1, 2, and 3, and $11.96 for zone 14.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 13-16 - or older if still in high school - will also see their fares double. They now have to pay 92 cents for zone 1 travel (up from 46 cents), $1.51 for zone 2 travel (up from 76 cents) and $2.01 for zone 3 travel (up from $1).</p>
        
            <p>Those aged over 16 and not attending high school must pay full adult fares.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, free travel for those aged 5-12 is ending and travellers will now have to pay the same fares as those aged 13-16.</p>
        
            <p>At off-peak times, all fares are half-price for those using Snapper. This remains unchanged, as does the ability for children aged under 5 to travel for free.</p>
        
            <p>Here is the full breakdown of the changes to Wellington public transport fares.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 5-12 will no longer be eligible for free travel across Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri. From 1 May, they must pay $1 per trip on Metro buses and $2 per trip on the Metro Diamond Harbour ferry.</p>
        
            <p>However, youth aged 13-24 years will not see their fares increase. They will continue to pay $1 for bus trips and $2 for ferry trips.</p>
        
            <p>To qualify for the concession, they must pay with a registered Metrocard.</p>
        
            <p>The full adult fare, for those 25 and over, is $2 for the bus and $4 for the ferry using a Metrocard.</p>
        
            <p>Children under 5 will continue to travel free.</p>
        
            <p>Here is the full breakdown of the changes to Christchurch public transport fares.</p>
        
            <p>Children aged 5-12 will continue to travel free on buses in Dunedin and Queenstown from 1 May after the Otago Regional Council voted to continue funding the fares.</p>
        
            <p>The half-price concession also remains for those with a Community Services card or on total mobility services. They will continue to pay $1 per one-way trip.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 13-18 will pay $1.20 for a one-way trip in Dunedin and $1.50 for a one-way trip in Queenstown, up from 60 cents and 75 cents respectively.</p>
        
            <p>For those aged 19-24, the fare rises to $2 per one-way trip in both cities, up from $1.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers must have a correctly registered Bee Card to benefit from the above fares. One-way cash fares for those aged 13-plus are steeper: $3 in Dunedin and $4 in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>As in all the main centres, children under 5 will continue to travel free.</p>
        
            <p>Here is the full breakdown of the changes to Otago public transport fares.</p>
