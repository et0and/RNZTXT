        <h2>One of world's oldest theatres in flames</h2>
        <p>
Flames 10 metres high loomed above the Roxburgh town hall as firefighters spray water into it. The building is home to what is thought to be the world's oldest operating cinema.

            <p>Firefighters appear to have dealt with the worst of a blaze that has devastated the Roxburgh Town Hall.</p>
        
            <p>Flames were seen shooting up to 10 metres high from the building's roof about 12.30pm on Waitangi Day, and firefighters battled the blaze from the ground outside the front and side of the building.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke from the fire drifted across the town.</p>
        
            <p>There were about eight fire appliances at the scene, and there remained a large presence on site at 2pm as they continued to fight the fire. A command unit and aerial fire appliance were sent from Dunedin, while a command unit from Alexandra was also at the scene.</p>

            <p>Seasonal workers were evacuated from a building beside the hall that was being used as accommodation, and other properties nearby were also evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>A crowd of about 200 gathered to watch the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Daily Times Central Otago reporter Julie Asher was at the scene, which she described as "unbelievable".</p>
        
            <p>"It's just heartbreaking."</p>
        
            <p>The building would be seriously damaged, she said.</p>

            <p>Another witness at the scene said the windows of the building had all blown out and flames could be seen inside it.</p>
        
            <p>Holding his toddler son, Alfie, in his arms, Roxburgh local Daniel Dance was emotional as he watched the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"It's my whole life. My father (Doug) was on the committee that set up the theatre. I spent my whole life in that building, since I was little."</p>
        
            <p>Another person watching said the fire was devastating and there were decades of memories going up in flames.</p>
        
            <p>Tourists gathered on top of the hill above King George V Park to watch the fire, including people from Wanaka and Dunedin, who had planned to take their children to the park below.</p>
        
            <p>Teviot Valley councillor Sally Feinerman said there was still a lot of smoke and flames coming from the building.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared the fire was spreading from the entertainment centre at the front of the building to the town hall at the rear, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"People are feeling really sad.</p>
        
            <p>"Just the age of the building and it being the longest running movie theatre in the southern hemisphere.</p>
        
            <p>"They've just done so much work upgrading the facility, which is really devastating for the group that run the Roxburgh Entertainment Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the biggest meeting place we have in Roxburgh."</p>

            <p>Traffic was being diverted from the town's main street (SH8), she said.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA Waka Kotahi have advised motorists to allow for extra time and follow the instructions of emergency services on site.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, a fire in the cinema caused minor damage, but early detection by a recently installed fire alarm meant fire crews were there within five minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The Central Otago District Council owns the building, but the cinema is operated by a volunteer-run charitable trust whose profits return to the theatre.</p>
        
            <p>The Town Hall is home to what is believed to be the world's oldest operating cinema.</p>
        
            <p>Its website says it has been showing movies since 1897 and it has submitted a claim to Guinness World Records.</p>
        
            <p>Police are on the scene and a crowd is gathering to watch.</p>
