        <h2>Ferry breakdowns heading towards deaths, union fears</h2>
        <p>
Carl Findlay says it is pure luck the Connemara did not run aground and there's real concern about the safety of workers and passengers. Audio

            <p>The Maritime Union says after a run of serious events with Cook Strait ferries it is "really concerned" about the safety of workers and passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The Bluebridge ferry Connemara arrived back in Wellington this morning, about five-and-a-half hours after it lost power and started drifting in Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>This was the latest in a string of disruptions, delays and issues with Cook Strait ferries, including the Aratere running aground in the Marlborough Sounds in June with 47 people on board.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime Union national secretary Carl Findlay told Nine to Noon it was lucky the Connemara was not grounded overnight on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"It was only by luck that the wind was blowing in the direction that didn't push it into land."</p>
        
            <p>The recent woes afflicting Cook Strait ferries pointed to escalating issues on the health and safety pyramid, at the top of which was death, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really concerned that this is where this is heading."</p>
        
            <p>The union had been raising health and safety concerns about the ageing ferry fleet for some time, but these had been ignored, and anxiety levels among workers were "going through the roof", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what it's going to take for the government to get it, but the anxiety levels amongst all of our members with these vessels and the issues they're having is ... going through the roof.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some real issues there that need to be dealt with and they just seem to be ignoring everything we're asking and not coming up with any answers."</p>
        
            <p>Although all the passengers had disembarked, and no one was injured, they were having problems getting the rank down, so "all the trucks, vans and cars were still on board", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nine to Noon host Kathryn Ryan pointed to recent changes to ferry routes across the Cook Strait, which would buy time if they lost power and drifted.</p>
        
            <p>This had merely added an hour to the sailing time, and did not solve the problem of the ageing vessels, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still not getting any answers and for the life of me I can't see why they can't understand why they don't see it as a priority, given all the history of what they know is happening with these vessels.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, honest to God - what are they waiting for?"</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a marine consultant said it was unlikely the Connemara ferry was in grave danger when it broke down last night.</p>
        
            <p>Marico Marine senior partner John Riding said the ship was well within range of Wellington's ship monitoring system and drifting slowly towards the centre of Cook Strait in calm weather.</p>
        
            <p>He said tugs would only have been called when it became obvious the fault could not be addressed at sea.</p>
        
            <p>The Inter-Island Resilient Connection (iRex) project was cancelled late last year after the government denied KiwiRail's request for further funding.</p>
        
            <p>The project had been set to deliver two rail-enabled Cook Strait ferries by 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Finance Nicola Willis warned at the time of a cost blowout, saying the cost had gone "many times" beyond what was originally scoped by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>There has been no decision since then on alternative options.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Simeon Brown told Morning Report that in this year's Budget, Maritime New Zealand had been asked to undertake a business case for an open-water tug service to assist in such circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>This was a "nice to have", not a priority, and tugs could not have completed a full salvage operation anyway, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to fix the problem [of ageing ferries] first and foremost, and then worry about the contingencies a bit later, but they can't even do that.</p>
