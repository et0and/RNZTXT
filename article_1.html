            <p>Five Oranga Tamariki staff and three young people were injured during a fight at a youth justice facility on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>The new Minister for Children, Karen Chhour, said five young people - all over the age of 17 - instigated the fight at the Christchurch Residence.</p>
        
            <p>Bad and unlawful behaviour at the facilities would not be tolerated, Chhour said.</p>
        
            <p>The minister has asked for advice on imposing tougher penalties on young people who assault others in youth justice facilities.</p>
