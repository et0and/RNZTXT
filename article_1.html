            <p>Associate justice minister and architect of the Treaty Principles Bill David Seymour came out of the Beehive on Tuesday to acknowledge the hīkoi and wave at the protesters - but retreated inside after just a few minutes without speaking to the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour told Checkpoint it was difficult to hear what was being said from where he stood.</p>
        
            <p>Listen live:</p>
        
            <p>"But I think they were saying something about me not ... shouldn't be there."</p>
        
            <p>Asked why he promoting the bill, he said: "We've got a New Zealand where people conceive themselves as being part of groups, rather than as part of a country, and therefore put up these barriers."</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint host Lisa Owen said he had been wanting to promote a conversation, and asked if today was the conversation he had imagined?</p>
        
            <p>Submissions were now open to the public as the bill was before the justice committee - and anybody could have their say on the bill "and the way we intention... sorry... see the Treaty in modern times".</p>
        
            <p>"There will always be people who are out there making a lot of noise.</p>
        
            <p>"I think at the end of the day the overwhelming majority of New Zealanders are at work, going to school, and they'll be able to engage in this debate in their own way.</p>
        
            <p>"So you wouldn't want to take this hikoi as being representative of NZ."</p>
        
            <p>Owen circled back to the comment about how he "intentioned" the Treaty to be in modern times, and Seymour said he misspoke. "I don't know where that word came from."</p>
