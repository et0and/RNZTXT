            <p>Aotearoa has reclaimed the Guinness World Record for the largest haka from France after thousands performed Ka Mate at Auckland's Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The previous official record was 4028, held by France since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>While the official number of participants was yet to land on Sunday night, Guinness World Records adjudicator Brian Sobel confirmed New Zealand had smashed that record.</p>
        
            <p>Preliminary numbers were 6531, but that was expected to fluctuate.</p>
        
            <p>People travelled from far and wide to support the kaupapa, with American TV host Conan O'Brien, director Taika Waititi and boxer David Tua spotted in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Gates opened at 4.30pm before the haka attempt itself just after 8pm. Local entertainment included Six60, Alien Weaponry, Che Fu, Rob Ruha and the Topp Twins.</p>
        
            <p>The haka had to be performed for one minute, so those present performed Ka Mate four times in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Hinewehi Mohi championed the world record attempt as part of the 20th anniversary of the Raukatauri Music Therapy Trust, named after her daughter Hineraukatauri, who has severe cerebral palsy.</p>
        
            <p>"What started as an audacious idea a year ago to reclaim the record has now become reality. There was a lot on the line," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Haka is an important part of our culture and returning the mana of this world record away from the French and back to the land of its origins and ensuring it was performed correctly and with integrity was vital.</p>
        
            <p>"This momentous event has enabled us to showcase our rich cultural heritage to the world and reinforce the deep connection we all share. I am so proud to be a New Zealander tonight and hope that everyone can celebrate what we've achieved together."</p>
