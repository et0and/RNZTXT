            <p>A police helicopter has been searching the Marokopa area for a man missing and his three children as officers work through the tip-offs they're received since offering a reward on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police yesterday announced an $80,000 reward for information on missing Marokopa man Tom Phillips and his three children that leads to their location and safe return.</p>
        
            <p>Ember, eight, Maverick, nine, and Jayda, 10, have been missing since December 2021, when they were taken by Phillips to an unknown location - though police believe it was in Western Waikato within Marokopa or the surrounding areas.</p>

            <p>In a statement, police said the Eagle helicopter was out in the Marokopa area last night "in support of the operation".</p>
        
            <p>"Results of their work in the area are being assessed alongside other information."</p>
        
            <p>Marokopa residents should expect to see an increased police presences in the area over the next few days, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Andy Saunders told Morning Report this appeal was aimed at the people they believed had been helping Phillips to hide.</p>
        
            <p>"This is targeted at those people with direct information as to the whereabouts of the children."</p>
        
            <p>Police were also offering the possibility of immunity from prosecution to anyone with information.</p>
        
            <p>"The important aspect of this is the safe return of the children, that's our main focus," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>He said police had received emails, calls, and had community members engage with them since yesterday's announcement.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were now sifting through all the information and prioritising it "to see what value it is".</p>
        
            <p>It was too soon to say whether any of the information was credible, Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>He said police believed the family were in a dwelling, rather than living rough, but hadn't been able to find them over the past 2.5 years despite several sightings and a number of locations of interest being identified.</p>

            <p>Ōtorohanga's Mayor Max Baxter told Morning Report he was hopeful this would be enough for someone helping the family to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"$80,000 is a lot of money for anybody who's living out at Marokopa, in fact $80,000 is a lot of money for anybody. I'm hoping the reward is enough to change the attitude of those people that may be withholding information."</p>
        
            <p>The general consensus in the community was that some body must be assisting Phillips, Baxter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Marakopa itself doesn't need to be identified for this reason alone, so lets just hope people put their hand up and come forward now," he said.</p>
