            <p>Police have named the man that died in the Wellington suburb of Miramar this week as 63-year-old Abdul Nabizadah.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found critically injured on a footpath at the intersection of Camperdown Road and Totora Road at about 2.20am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>He died in Wellington Hospital on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second serious incident, following the burglary of a Darlington Road address 20 minutes earlier, where two adults found a stranger in their home.</p>
        
            <p>After being confronted and fighting with one of the residents, the intruder fled.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem investigation has found the cause of Nabizadah's death was a result of blunt force head injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Detective inspector Nick Pritchard said he was not involved in the burglary, and that they were still trying to establish how he was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard said he was originally from Afghanistan and was released to his family on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Nabizadah was laid to rest on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard said police were seeking dashcam footage across the suburb on the morning he sustained the injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to hear from any motorist who was driving in the Miramar suburb between midnight and 3am on Monday 17 March and has dashcam footage of their trip.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to hear from anyone in the Nevay Road, Camperdown Road and Darlington Road area between 12.20am and 3am that same morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Nabizadah was wearing a brown jacket with a blue t-shirt underneath, black trousers and light brown coloured shoes. He was located near his vehicle, a silver-coloured Toyota Aqua, with the registration NQE681."</p>

            <p>He said if a member of the public saw a person fitting that description at the time they should contact police.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard said the police were reviewing CCTV and were continuing enquiries into the movements of the victim, including to establish if his death and the burglary were linked.</p>
        
            <p>Burglary enquiries are ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"We also want to hear from anyone who locates any discarded items of property on their sections, and anyone who has seen but not reported suspicious activity or prowling in the area over the last couple of weeks, including any previously unreported thefts from properties or vehicles since early March."</p>
