            <p>5kg of class A drugs, 11 firearms, ammunition, about $250,000 cash, 11 vehicles, and an Auckland property were also seized, police said.</p>
        
            <p>It was the culmination of an eight-month investigation, called Operation Avon, by the National Organised Crime Group and Canterbury Police.</p>

            <p>Police alleged the gang organised for drugs and cash to be relayed between Auckland and Christchurch every few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Thomson said police believed $15 million worth of drugs were moved between the North and South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Operation Avon is holding those responsible to account following a meticulous investigation and coordinated response.</p>
        
            <p>"Pivotally, arresting every member of the chapter will put an end to their unwanted presence in our Christchurch community."</p>

            <p>70 warrants were executed in Christchurch and Auckland on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>18 men, aged between 18 and 55, were arrested and have appeared in court in Christchurch and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Charges included participating in an organised criminal group, conspiracy to supply methamphetamine, and conspiracy to supply cocaine. Further charges of money laundering and drug dealing were being considered.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Darrin Thomson said the drug offending involved methamphetamine and cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>"These groups have no hesitation in peddling drugs and accumulating vehicles and property, with no regard for the destruction they cause in everyday New Zealanders' lives.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no doubt that this disruption of the Comanchero gang will have a positive impact on the drug supply chain across the country."</p>
