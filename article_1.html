        <p>
The Nascar Xfinity Series victory in Portland, Oregon was a popular win for the three-time Australian Supercar champion - but the 35-year-old had to work for it.

            <p>New Zealander Shane van Gisbergen has claimed his first Nascar Xfinity Series stock car victory in Portland, Oregon.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi celebrated the hard-earned win with a burnout all the way around the 1.967-mile (3.16km) road course on Sunday (NZ time) and then climbing out of his Chevy and topping it off by kicking a soccer ball into the thrilled crowd.</p>
        
            <p>It was a popular win all-around for the three-time Australian Supercar champion, but the 35-year-old had to work for it.</p>
        
            <p>The series rookie - who won the inaugural Chicago Street Race in his first Nascar Cup Series start last summer - led laps early in the No. 97 Kaulig Racing Chevrolet but struggled with race re-starts for much of the day.</p>
        
            <p>He lost positions on the early restarts and even had to overcome a couple of miscues - dropping his tyres off track into the dirt - before steadily and masterfully working his way forward in the closing laps to challenge for the win.</p>
        
            <p>He passed the day's most dominant driver, JR Motorsports' Justin Allgaier, on the final restart with four laps to go and pulled away to a .941-second victory over the series veteran, who led a race-best 46 of the race's 75 laps.</p>
        
            <p>JR Motorsports' Sammy Smith, van Gisbergen's Kaulig teammate AJ Allmendinger (who started last in the field) and Sam Hunt Racing's Ed Jones - an IMSA sportscar and IndyCar veteran - rounded out the top five.</p>
        
            <p>"What a day, really cool, had some great racing," said van Gisbergen, who immediately apologised to pole-winner Sam Mayer, whom he collided with and spun on the opening turn of the race.</p>
        
            <p>"I need to get better on my restarts and learn how to position, but that was so much fun. Really cool racing. I love these cars, they're great."</p>
        
            <p>It was a particularly crushing runner-up showing for Allgaier, who finished second in this race last year as well.</p>
        
            <p>At various points, his No. 7 Chevrolet held a nearly three-second advantage on the field, but two cautions in the final 12 laps essentially equalised the competition and van Gisbergen steadily made his way forward on the restarts before taking the lead in Turn 5 with four laps to go.</p>
        
            <p>Allgaier not only led the most laps but swept both stage wins for the third consecutive race - the six consecutive stage wins are a series record. His series-leading 10 stage victories on the season are the most ever through the opening 13 races.</p>
        
            <p>But it just wasn't enough for the trophy on Saturday. Allgaier said he didn't know what he could have done differently.</p>
        
            <p>"On those restarts, we were so free taking off and the car was just struggling to get grip," Allgaier said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's the hardest part, once (van Gisbergen) got by me there, I probably overdrove it trying to get back to him and probably didn't help my cause any," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Really proud of this team. All the effort this team puts forward is incredible. To come in second, two years in a row, stings a little bit, but at the same time, really proud of everybody."</p>
        
            <p>Last year's Portland winner Cole Custer finished sixth in the Stewart-Haas Racing Ford with Kaulig's Josh Williams, Big Machine Racing's Parker Kligerman, Jordan Anderson Racing's Parker Retzlaff and Stewart-Haas Racing's Riley Herbst rounding out the top 10.</p>
        
            <p>With his sixth-place finish on Saturday, Custer takes the championship lead by 18 points over Richard Childress Racing's Austin Hill and Joe Gibbs Racing's Chandler Smith.</p>
        
            <p>Hill - who was fined 25 points and US$25,000 (NZ$40,000) for purposefully wrecking Custer last week at Charlotte - finished 11th and Smith, whose No. 81 JGR Toyota suffered a late race engine problem, finished 35th.</p>
        
            <p>The next race in the series is at Sonoma, California, next Sunday (NZT).</p>
