            <p>A resident living in the small rural settlement of Birdlings Flat Canterbury, has won the title of The World's Ugliest Lawn in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The World's Ugliest Lawn competition was launched by Swedish company Gotland in 2023 to celebrate people who save water by not watering their lawns.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 winner, Leisa Elliott, lives in the settlement which is known for its fierce winds and rainfall and says she doesn't do anything to her lawn, other than letting mother nature take the reins.</p>
        
            <p>Her lawn serves as a powerful statement to letting "mother nature take the reins", according to the competition judges, in a region known for its fierce coastal winds and low rainfall.</p>

            <p>Her lawn has muted colours and is dotted with natural weather-carved indentations.</p>
        
            <p>"Her property is a testament to resilience. The ground, parched and textured by the elements, is dotted with natural, weather-carved indentations and adorned with the muted colours of a landscape that thrives without human interference," the judges said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Not a drop of irrigation graces her lawn-it's all up to the skies, and Leisa wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
        
            <p>"This commitment to water conservation is an inspiring example of living in harmony with one's environment. By choosing to forego the unnatural pursuit of a green lawn, Leisa demonstrates a deep respect for our planet's most precious resource.</p>
        
            <p>"Her lawn may not win beauty contests, but it wins hearts for its message of sustainability and adaptability."</p>
        
            <p>Leisa received a preowned first-prize T-shirt, sent to her by the last year's winner.</p>
