        <h2>Government policies 'taking people backwards' - Labour</h2>
        <p>
Increases in the minimum wage and benefits must be tied to inflation, says Social Development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni.

            <p>The government's new tax policies will be taking working people backwards, the Labour Party says.</p>
        
            <p>From today, landlords can write off 80 percent of their mortgage interest, increasing to 100 percent in April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, the minimum wage is increasing 2 percent, from $22.70 per hour to $23.15.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, the wages of lower-paid workers would still lag behind inflation, said Labour's social development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni.</p>
        
            <p>"This government's measly 2 percent increase to the minimum wage means lower-paid workers will again fall behind inflation and go backwards in real terms.</p>
        
            <p>"Wages are not keeping up with the cost of living. The recommendation was that the minimum wage should be increased by 4 percent, and sadly, we had a minister who wanted to go below even 3, even 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"That means the money that people have in their hand is not supporting them to be able to keep up with the cost of living."</p>
        
            <p>The changes meant benefit rates would also increase, with a couple on Jobseeker support with children receiving an additional $56 every fortnight, while single parents would see their support rise by $44.</p>
        
            <p>Couples receiving superannuation would receive an extra $71.</p>
        
            <p>However, because the rise was tied to wage increases rather than inflation, Sepuloni said the changes would worsen the situation for those receiving benefits.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone on Jobseeker support would be $50 a week worse-off, while someone on a disability benefit will be $60 a week worse off by 2030, which is between $2600 to $3120 less a year.</p>
        
            <p>"The Children's Commissioner a few years back, said ensuring benefits rose when wages did was one of the most important things that we could do to address child poverty in this country."</p>
        
            <p>She said with the new tax policies, even the support that was available for those struggling would become more difficult to access.</p>
        
            <p>"Those on Jobseeker benefits are having to re-apply for support much more often.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes - alongside reducing carers' access to disability support and not committing to funding school lunches for kids - will see many people getting or saving less."</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni said the policies were all about choice.</p>
        
            <p>"Landlords or disability funding; tax cuts or the school lunch programme; proper minimum wage increases and a policy that would lift children out of poverty.</p>
        
            <p>"This April 1 we wish we could say the choices this [government] is making are a joke. But taking working people backwards and making support harder to get certainly isn't funny to us."</p>
