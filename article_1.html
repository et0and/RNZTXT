        <h2>'Asleep at the wheel': Science group calls on Minister to step up</h2>
        <p>
The Save Science Coalition says political parties agree there are "big issues" within the science sector but Judith Collins is yet to do anything about it.

            <p>Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins is "asleep at the wheel" and further delaying reforms of the science sector, an advocacy group says.</p>
        
            <p>In a media release, Save Science Coalition spokesperson Dr Lucy Stewart said there had been ongoing issues in the industry that political parties had accepted, but nothing was being done about them.</p>
        
            <p>The $680 million National Science Challenges, which has been funded for the past 10 years, officially ended on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists had been ringing the warning bell about what allowing this funding to end, without having a replacement ready, would mean in terms of loss of expertise.</p>
        
            <p>"The minister is asleep at the wheel," Stewart said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parties from across the political spectrum agree that there are big issues in the science sector that need to be addressed, but we are seeing ongoing delays and non-response from the minister."</p>
        
            <p>Stewart said Science System Advisory Group reports about the industry were meant to be released by Collins in July and October but they were still waiting.</p>
        
            <p>It came at a time where more than 500 roles within the sector have been cut, or proposed to be cut, she said.</p>

            <p>"This is leading to an irreplaceable loss of skilled scientists from New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The government appears more focused on cuts and chaos than developing comprehensive solutions in an area which is vital to our society and economy."</p>
        
            <p>Letters to Collins by the group had also gone unanswered.</p>
        
            <p>"This is extremely disappointing, given that we are approaching the minister as representatives of a large proportion of the science community in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned that the problems identified with the science system, are only being exacerbated by the ongoing cuts we are seeing in the sector while the minister continually deprioritises, delays, defers, and ignores."</p>
        
            <p>Stewart said New Zealand was missing out on investment in the science sector and Collins "appears to be unwilling to listen or to act".</p>
        
            <p>"The Save Science Coalition call on Minister Collins to engage with the science community, stop the cuts, support mātauranga Māori, and improve funding for New Zealand's science system to create a more prosperous country for all. But first of all - we call on the minister to front up and release the report."</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland academic and Rutherford Discovery researcher Dr Sereana Naepi told RNZ the sector had been grappling with "significant cuts" for many years.</p>

            <p>"These challenges, once largely confined to universities, are now impacting the wider research sector, underscoring the urgent need for decisive action to ensure the sustainability and contribution of our science and research workforce to the nation's future.</p>
        
            <p>"The rapid loss of skilled scientists and researchers poses a critical threat, while the next generation of researchers are increasingly questioning the viability of pursuing a science career in New Zealand. Without immediate intervention, the country risks undermining its capacity for innovation and progress in an increasingly knowledge-driven world."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Naepi said it was "increasingly frustrating" for the sector to continue to wait to find out its future as redundancies continued.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Collins said the Science System Advisory Group had carried out a "thorough review" to help the government strengthen the science, innovation and technology system.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to supporting science and innovation, a sector that goes to the heart of New Zealand's productivity challenge, and the review is part of that commitment.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a wide review and the decisions that come out of it will be made public in due course."</p>
