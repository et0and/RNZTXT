        <h2>MP gets big promotion in Labour reshuffle</h2>
        <p>
Tangi Utikere has moved up seven spots and picked up the Local Government portfolio as Chris Hipkins announces a new 'economic team'.

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has announced a reshuffle, setting up a new "economic team".</p>
        
            <p>Barbara Edmonds has leapfrogged Megan Woods one place to third and will handle Finance, the Economy, and the new Savings and Investment role - leading the party's economic strategy.</p>
        
            <p>Tangi Utikere, the Transport spokesperson, has also shot up seven spots from 19th to 12th, picking up the Local Government portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>"Economic growth for the sake of it isn't an economic strategy. I've tasked Barbara with making sure we're ready to balance the books, increase our savings, expand our investment opportunities, and create the economic conditions for all Kiwis to thrive," Hipkins said.</p>

            <p>He said she would lead a new team focused on the economy:</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins made the announcement at a State of the Nation speech hosted by the Auckland Business Chamber this morning, saying the next Labour government will focus on jobs, health and housing.</p>
        
            <p>He said the new economic team was a "signal to New Zealanders that we are serious about tackling the big issues and making change for the better".</p>
        
            <p>"The cost-of-living crunch is still hitting New Zealanders hard. Prices are going up, wage growth is stagnant and more people are unemployed or about to lose their jobs.</p>

            <p>"The Luxon government does not have a vision or a plan for New Zealand. Buzz words and corporate waffle will not lift incomes, fix our health system or build more homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour will not sell our pristine landscapes for a quick buck. We won't lay off thousands of people, and cripple sectors for the sake of politics. We won't sit idly by watching unemployment grow and families to suffer as a result."</p>
        
            <p>He said the new team would "get cracking immediately on new policy".</p>
        
            <p>Coming less than halfway through the coalition's term, his speech also promised a Labour Party that would focus on real solutions that would provide "hope and action" at the next election.</p>
        
            <p>"Politics at its best changes lives. It's why I got into it in the first place," he said. "It lifts people up. It unites hope and action to build the future we all want that works for all of us. It doesn't ignore the challenges we face, or blame someone else, and then at the last possible moment come up with half-baked solutions.</p>
        
            <p>"It focuses on real solutions; solutions that work, not empty slogans. It reflects people's hopes, not the mess and division currently resident in the Beehive. If we're going to make progress on the things we care about, the things that really affect people's lives, then we need to be the antidote to that division."</p>
        
            <p>For all the talk of hope, however, he painted a gloomy picture of the country - saying the government was "selling off our schools and hospitals to the highest bidder", saying they were run down and in desperate need of investment, homes and groceries were unaffordable.</p>
