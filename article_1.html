        <h2>8000 health workers kept working despite not being fully vaccinated</h2>
        <p>
The staff, including hundreds of doctors, were allowed to work through the pandemic because services could not function without them.

            <p>More than 8000 unvaccinated or partly vaccinated health workers were allowed to keep working during the Covid-19 pandemic because critical services could not function without them.</p>
        
            <p>Data released to RNZ under the Official Information Act, shows health providers - including district health boards, GP clinics and home-help agencies - made 516 applications for exemptions to avoid Significant Service Disruptions of which 102 were granted.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 8051 healthworkers were covered by these exemptions between October 2021 and September 2022, more than 5000 were employed by district health boards.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly half, 3935, were care and support workers - but the total also included 352 doctors (out of nearly 19,000 registered), 992 administration workers, 788 allied health professionals and 1984 nurses and midwives.</p>
        
            <p>The Nurses Organisation, which represents 60,000 plus nurses and midwives, noted those exempted were a tiny minority of the total health workforce.</p>
        
            <p>Kaiwhakahaere Kerri Nuku said the union was not given a lot of information about the reasons for exemptions at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's why these figures are quite alarming to us, because we just don't know what sits behind that."</p>
        
            <p>Given it was a public health emergency, it was essential to get as many people vaccinated as possible, Nuku said.</p>
        
            <p>However, she readily admitted it would have been preferable to allow a more nuanced approach for some individuals, if there had been more time to prepare.</p>

            <p>"This was a really difficult time for all in the workforce. Every nurse goes to work to do the best they possibly can, and these vaccine mandates certainly posed</p>
        
            <p>many good people against one another, and we have to do things better."</p>
        
            <p>Recent research by Auckland University of Technology published in February concluded mandates had limited effect on increasing vaccine uptake among the country's 171,486 healthcare workers.</p>
        
            <p>Economics professor Gail Pacheco, who co-authored the study, said almost 90 percent of healthcare workers had already received two doses of the vaccine when the mandates were announced in October 2021.</p>
        
            <p>There was no sudden jump: vaccination coverage among healthcare workers increased at the same steady rate until it hit more than 95 percent, she said.</p>
        
            <p>But what mandates definitely did was damage pay and career prospects for unvaccinated workers.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition to not improving vaccine uptake, the employment rate fell by 15 percent and earnings fell by 19 percent compared to vaccinated workers not subjected to the mandate."</p>
        
            <p>Pacheco, director of the New Zealand Policy Research Institute at AUT, said the mandates may have eroded trust in the government.</p>
        
            <p>"And it could also have strengthened the anti-vax sentiment more generally, which will not only affect uptake of the Covid vaccine, but more routine immunisations as well."</p>
        
            <p>Partly that was because people did not like being "told what to do", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a German survey that found just over 3 percent of people said they would not want the Covid-19 vaccination if it was voluntary. But that increased to more than than 16% if it was mandatory."</p>
        
            <p>Another 6410 people received a temporary medical exemption between November 2021 and September 2022 - of whom nearly 90 percent 89 percent had had a recent Covid-19 infection.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Or says some of these people could have been included in the Significant Service Disruption Exemptions, but it did not track the potential overlap.</p>
        
            <p>Pacheco said none of the health workers interviewed for the study saw themselves as "anti-vaccine".</p>
        
            <p>Many received exemptions after suffering an adverse reaction to the first dose, or due to an underlying medical condition.</p>
        
            <p>But they struggled with the hostile reaction from other people, including workmates.</p>
        
            <p>One nurse told researchers:</p>
        
            <p>"We're supposed to be a caring profession. Nothing about this is caring  Due to no fault of my own, I have now been labelled an anti-vaxxer and anti-science, and in some people's opinion, not worthy of calling myself a nurse. This hurts me immensely. This is what mandates have done. There is no room for individual circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>Even after the mandates were lifted, the employment and earnings of unvaccinated workers never fully recovered, Pacheco said.</p>
        
            <p>"It then created a greater impact in the health sector because there were also fewer workers moving into that sector [due to closed borders and international shortages], so it exacerbated worker shortages."</p>
        
            <p>Otago University public health professor Michael Baker said the mandates were probably not the biggest factor driving distrust and vaccine hesitancy.</p>
        
            <p>"The anti-vax group has grown a lot in New Zealand, and I think it's been driven by really appalling misinformation."</p>
        
            <p>The problem with a successful public health strategy was "nothing happens", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"No-one sees those lives saved, those 20-thousand New Zealanders who didn't die because of vaccination."</p>
        
            <p>The mandates were a curb on people's freedoms - but it was always "a trade-off", he continued.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have compulsory vaccination as some countries had. Certainly there was a lot of pressure to get vaccinated if you stood to lose your job if you didn't, so that was coercive.</p>
        
            <p>"But you have to balance it against lives saved, reduced hospitalisations and fewer people getting long Covid."</p>
        
            <p>It would be for the Royal Commission to determine what worked and what did not, so that New Zealand would be better prepared for future pandemics, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry into Covid-19 Lessons Learned, which is looking at the whole pandemic response, including vaccine mandates, will deliver its final report by the end of September.</p>
        
            <p>As of 7 January 2024, over 774 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and more than seven million deaths have been reported globally.</p>
