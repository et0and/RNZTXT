            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is in Peru to attend the 2024 APEC Summit.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders of APEC's 21 economies from the Asia-Pacific region are meeting just a week after Donald Trump was declared the US president-elect.</p>
        
            <p>While it is Joe Biden representing the US, Trump's proposed tariffs will feature heavily in leader to leader conversations this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, Luxon met with China's President Xi Jinping he told travelling New Zealand media there's plenty to cooperate on with China when it comes to trade, but neither leader shied away from raising differences either.</p>
        
            <p>"We discussed tensions within the region, particularly around the South China Sea, we realised human rights, we talked about the Pacific Island nations as well, and wanting to work through the Pacific Islands' Forum."</p>
        
            <p>He said Donald Trump's re-election wasn't discussed, nor were trade tariffs more broadly.</p>
