            <p>Former Act leader and Labour minister Richard Prebble has resigned from the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>He was appointed to the role in October, 2024, by MƒÅori Development Minister Tama Potaka.</p>
        
            <p>In a NZ Herald column on Wednesday, Prebble said the Waitangi Tribunal has turned the Treaty upside down.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had no interest in participating in the Tribunal while it turned the Treaty into a "socialist manifesto".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Potaka said his focus was now on "moving swiftly to complete the appointment of a new member".</p>
        
            <p>"The Waitangi Tribunal achieves its mahi thanks to the commitment of a diverse range of members providing extensive experience and knowledge. Mr Prebble has made the decision to resign of his own accord - I respect his choice and wish him well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>More to come....</p>
