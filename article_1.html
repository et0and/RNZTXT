            <p>The death of a man who went overboard from a Wellington ferry has been referred to the Independent Police Conduct Authority.</p>
        
            <p>The man was the only passenger on the early morning East by West ferry from Wellington to Days Bay on 24 May.</p>
        
            <p>A large-scale search, involving up to 14 vessels and a rescue helicopter at its peak, was carried out after he went overboard. His body was found several days later.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff understands the man was the subject of police scrutiny around the time of his death.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff approached the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) last week, to see if they had been notified of the man's death. A spokesperson said at that stage police had not contacted them.</p>
        
            <p>However, on Tuesday, a spokesperson said the man's death had been referred to them, but was "not yet categorised".</p>
        
            <p>The IPCA would not be releasing any details about the information police had given them, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>A police spokesperson told Stuff they were unable to make any further comment as the matter had been referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>East by West Ferries general manager Mat Jonsson earlier released a statement acknowledging the "tragic" incident.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] will continue to be with the passenger and his family and friends, as they come to terms with their loss," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jonsson also paid tribute to the "professionalism" of the crew, who spent hours participating in an active search "after the shock of finding a passenger missing".</p>
        
            <p>He thanked all commercial operators and private vessels who helped with the search.</p>
        
            <p>"This quickly became an 'all hands; response, and we thank our counterparts for stepping forward to assist."</p>
        
            <p>East By West would co-operate with police's investigation, as well as conducting their own review into the incident, he said.</p>
