            <p>The man charged in relation to a kidnapping on Auckland's North Shore earlier this week can now be named.</p>
        
            <p>Jamie Maihi Perfect, 32, of Dairy Flat faces four separate charges, including kidnapping and using a shotgun to commit a burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police say a gun was fired at a property on Sunhaven Avenue in Beach Haven on Tuesday and a woman was forcibly put in a car.</p>
        
            <p>She was badly injured during the incident and would need some time in hospital to recover, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Perfect appeared in North Shore District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>
Jamie Perfect was arrested at an Auckland waterfront bar this week, alongside a 28-year-old woman.

            <p>Judge Kirsten Lummis gave him 72 hours to contact his mother before his name was allowed to be published.</p>
        
            <p>Perfect will reappear in two weeks to enter a plea.</p>
        
            <p>A woman arrested in relation to the case also appeared in court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-year-old faces three charges relating to methamphetamine and failing to carry out police obligations.</p>
        
            <p>She appeared in the Auckland District Court in front of Judge Belinda Sellars.</p>
        
            <p>She has been granted interim name suppression, and will appear again to enter a plea on 19 April.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, police in Auckland are still searching for a "dangerous" suspect in relation to the kidnapping.</p>
        
            <p>Ralph Park, 25, is wanted over the 2 April incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police believed he may be trying to seek medical attention for an injury he sustained the night of the kidnapping, detective inspector Callum McNeill of WaitematƒÅ CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe Park was shot - either by his own achievements or accidentally by his accomplice," McNeill said.</p>
