            <p>The Finance Minister will not say why the Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr has resigned after seven years of service.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Nicola Willis said Deputy Governor Christian Hawkesby would be Acting Governor until 31 March.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said she was not going to "characterise the reasons" for Orr's resignation.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said she had been "aware for the past few days that discussions have been occurring" between the Reserve Bank Board and the Reserve Bank Governor, about a "possible resignation."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if the board had confidence in Orr, Willis said "that's a question for the board." Willis confirmed the board would front on the matter.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said she was confident the Reserve Bank was a "strong financial institution" and that Christian Hawkesby was "experienced".</p>
        
            <p>"We have continuity and stability in the membership of the Reserve Bank Board, and the membership of the Monetary Policy Committee - so there will be continuity."</p>
        
            <p>Willis would not answer whether she would still have confidence in Orr if he remained as Governor of the Reserve Bank.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions."</p>
        
            <p>When asked why Adrian Orr resigned, Willis said it was a matter for him to "characterise".</p>
        
            <p>Her own characterisation was that "he decided to resign" because he viewed it as "an appropriate juncture at which to do so".</p>
        
            <p>"Questions about the nature of the resignation are for the Reserve Bank Board."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he was leaving on good terms, Willis said: "Look - yes, the resignation has occurred, the Reserve Bank board has accepted it."</p>
        
            <p>"I have acknowledged the governor's seven years in the service in the role, and I wish him well for the future."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he had only found out about the decision today - something he was comfortable with - and he would not be commenting further.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's be clear, the Reserve Bank Governor and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is an independent role and an independent organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"The Reserve Bank Governor has resigned, I appreciate there'll be lots of commentary about it, I'm not going to climb in on that. As prime minister I've respected the independence of the governor and the Reserve Bank and I'll continue to do so."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had worked "as constructively as I can with the Reserve Bank Governor" by focusing on fiscal policy to get the economy working.</p>
        
            <p>"Typically I've met with him before different announcements that he might have made, and in my meetings been very constructive."</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour, a frequent critic of Orr in the past, took a parting shot at the governor.</p>
        
            <p>"I've heard people say 'farewell and thanks for the inflation,' but ultimately this is a guy who had a really important job to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's now moved on, and I think what's really important that we get a really good person in the position, because if the last five years have shown anything it's how important the Reserve Bank Governor role is. The pain people have felt through the cost of living crisis over the last five years shows we need to get a great Reserve Bank Governor and that's up the board."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he could not remember who had told him "farewell and thanks for the inflation" in the short window between the announcement of Orr's resignation and Seymour's arrival on Parliament's tiles.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing how many people you can meet in that short space of time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Orr has been a pivotal figure, dealing with rising inflation and disruptions to the economy caused by Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Interest rates rose in response but have fallen from more than 5 percent last year to 3.75 percent this month.</p>
        
            <p>Reserve Bank Governors typically serve five-year terms.</p>
        
            <p>Orr was first appointed in 2018, and reappointed March 2023. His second term was due to end in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Orr said the Bank had built its capability and credibility to face what he called an "increasingly complex and challenging global environment".</p>
        
            <p>He said he was leaving with inflation on target and the economy in a recovery after Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Orr said he leaves "with consumer price inflation at target, and an economy in a cyclical recovery following the long period of Covid-related disruption.</p>
        
            <p>"The financial system remains sound. However, there is much work left to do on the major multi-year strategies RBNZ is following. Ongoing focus and funding will be critical to these projects' success."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was proud of the people at Reserve Bank who had modernised and strengthened the institution and the financial system.</p>
        
            <p>He singled out strategies for the future of cash, climate change policies, MƒÅori access to capital and future of payments for special mention.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, Willis - taking advice from the RBNZ Board, will appoint a temporary Governor for up to six months.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish him well for the future," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>RBNZ board chair Professor Neil Quigley thanked Orr for his leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"Adrian has been critical to leading the institutional reforms needed to implement the new Reserve Bank Act, Deposit Takers Act, and Depositor Compensation Scheme," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He has also driven a significant uplift in leadership and capability across the Bank, and modernised its culture to reflect contemporary New Zealand society."</p>
