        <h2>Family 'devastated' after human error ruled out in mum's death</h2>
        <p>
Carmen Walker's sons, along with a surgeon who observed the procedure, say the blood loss that led to her death was preventable.

            <p>Content note: This story contains discussion of medical procedures.</p>
        
            <p>The family of Carmen Walker, who died following complications during a cancer procedure, are shocked and disappointed with a coroner's finding that her death was not the result of blood being drained out of her body by mistake.</p>
        
            <p>Walker's sons Craig and Lance told RNZ they were bewildered by the finding, which they had hoped would provide answers for which they had waited for 14 years.</p>
        
            <p>Together with plastic surgeon Dr Adam Greenbaum, who was observing the procedure in August 2010, the brothers believed the blood loss was human error and preventable.</p>
        
            <p>Lance Walker said all he wanted was the truth of what happened to his mother during the isolated limb infusion (ILI) at Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>That was a promise he had made to his father Bob on his death bed in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>"As a family we're quite devastated and at a loss to read the final finding."</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Alexander Ho found that Walker died due to complications in her melanoma treatment, including an adverse reaction to the anti-blood clotting drug protamine, and blood loss.</p>
        
            <p>He found that Walker's circulating blood volume was not accidentally drained out of her leg as part of the procedure, and the blood loss was likely from a combination of other internal and external bleeding.</p>
        
            <p>The ILI procedure involves cutting off the circulation to the diseased leg with tourniquets, injecting a chemotherapy drug into the leg to "bathe" the cancerous cells, washing out the limb to remove the drug and tainted blood, then releasing the tourniquets.</p>
        
            <p>The family preferred Greenbaum's evidence that he noticed an "awful lot of blood in the bucket" during the washout.</p>
        
            <p>Lance Walker said chunks of evidence were left out of the finding and he felt no-one had been held accountable.</p>
        
            <p>Craig and his wife Linda Walker, of Whanganui, said the finding had done more damage to their family.</p>
        
            <p>"[The coroner] seems to have taken 13 months sifting through the evidence to cherry-pick the least damaging narrative for those involved in Mum's procedure and avoid making any adverse comments about them."</p>
        
            <p>While the coroner found the surgeon and anaesthetist had done nothing wrong, he criticised a pathologist who prompted the inquest by changing his conclusion on Walker's cause of death, for not conducting a thorough autopsy.</p>
        
            <p>But Dr Ian Beer rejected that and said despite searching for one, he could find no evidence of a gastrointestional bleed, which the coroner included as being one of the other sources of blood loss.</p>
        
            <p>Beer said blood loss that left Walker with a severely low haemoglobin of 28 would have been so massive he would have found it.</p>
        
            <p>On the finding that Walker had an adverse reaction to protamine, Beer said a test for anaphylaxis was returned the next day and found that she was within normal range.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Greenbaum pointed to evidence from the lead surgeon, the anaesthetist, himself, and the coroner's expert witness - Australian surgeon Professor John Thompson, who invented the ILI procedure - as all pointing to Walker losing blood.</p>
        
            <p>"None of that evidence is weighed, discussed, or quoted in the coroner's report."</p>
        
            <p>Walker needed transfusions of twice her usual circulating blood volume during the 90-minute resuscitation shortly after fluid was drained from her leg into a bucket that did not have a measuring system.</p>
        
            <p>Greenbaum said he could not comprehend the coroner's finding that the massive blood loss was not linked to that.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Ho made no recommendations, saying ILIs were no longer performed in New Zealand, although Te Whatu Ora confirmed a national service was still provided in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, he suggested that procedures that involve draining fluids should use a measuring cylinder, which Greenbaum said was already a worldwide standard.</p>
        
            <p>"It just wasn't happening in the Waikato on that day ... If blood loss into a bucket without any measurement didn't contribute to Carmen Walker's death, and [the coroner has] gone to great lengths to specifically say that, then why [is he] bothering to suggest that measuring body fluids would make a difference?"</p>
        
            <p>Greenbaum said it was already clear before the inquest that Walker died from complications.</p>
        
            <p>"The coroner could and should have commented on whether those complications were unacceptable and avoidable. He failed to do that.</p>
        
            <p>"The Waikato could have been a much safer place to have medical care after this inquest, and that would have been a legacy from which Carmen's family could take comfort.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, they wasted a few weeks last August reliving the horror of Carmen's death and received a desultory: 'May she rest in peace'."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ put the criticisms to the coroner and was referred back to the finding.</p>
        
            <p>In it, Coroner Ho said witness memories of the precise amount of blood drained during the washout could not be relied on because of the passage of time.</p>
        
            <p>He said people were notoriously poor estimators, even without accounting for the other cytotoxic waste discarded into the bucket.</p>
        
            <p>"I therefore consider it unsafe to accept any individual's estimate of there being 'too much' or 'perhaps too much' blood in the container. This was Dr Greenbaum's first ILI procedure. [The lead surgeon] was making his observation in the context of a query about blood loss, raising the possibility that he saw what he thought he should be looking for.</p>
        
            <p>"The impact of these combined factors means that it is impossible, through no one's fault, to conduct a Goldilocks exercise of whether there was too much, too little or just the right amount of fluid in the receptacle."</p>
        
            <p>He also said that there was no evidence Walker was suffering blood loss over and above what was anticipated.</p>
        
            <p>The family said that they would not seek a judicial review.</p>
