            <p>Westland is likely to be escalated to a red heavy rain warning Wednesday following a night of intense rain, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>Red weather warnings are only used for the most severe storms, such as Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023. The forecaster said it only issued red warnings when it expected widespread significant impacts, disruptions or safety issues.</p>
        
            <p>Westland District south of Hokitika is forecast to receive heavy rain through to 9pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>There had been a significant amount of rain in south Westland overnight, West Coast Emergency Management group controller Te Aroha Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>In Franz Josef, there close to 300mm of rain had fallen since yesterday, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Franz Josef community had been proactive in shifting stock or people in low-lying areas evacuating, so civil defence did not need to respond at night. Today its focus would be continuing to monitor impacts on rivers throughout Westland.</p>
        
            <p>SH6 from Fox Glacier to Haast remains closed due to a slip.</p>
        
            <p>Orange heavy rain warnings are in place for Fiordland, the Canterbury High Country and Southern Lakes.</p>

            <p>Emergency officials have been making preparations for a deluge predicted over a large stretch of the coast over the next two days.</p>
        
            <p>Tour bus driver Campbell Jackson drove from Christchurch in the rain Tuesday, and was aiming for Queenstown on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>He stopped in Franz Josef overnight but was hoping river levels in Westland would not stop him leaving the region.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty bad. It's been pretty wet coming down, but I just go carefully, I've got no choice. If I get stuck, I'll turn around and go the other way ... I know what the West Coast weather is like," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency is advising motorists to plan ahead and check conditions before heading out on the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>It said heavy rainfall could impact parts of the state highway with possible closures, and it also warned of surface flooding and debris on road surfaces.</p>
