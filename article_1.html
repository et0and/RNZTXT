            <p>New Zealand's rowers have made a winning start on the water in Paris, with double sculls pair Lucy Spoors and Brooke Francis claiming a gold medal in the first of four finals for the Kiwis this evening.</p>
        
            <p>It was an intensely tight finish as New Zealand held off the two-time world champion Romanians and Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>An emotional Spoors spoke to Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly it went by in just a flash, from the start we were so brave, we wanted to be brave and just put it all out there I felt so brave with Brooke through the middle and I just wanted to see what we could do and if it was enough. It was going to be enough."</p>
        
            <p>Francis said it was close to the perfect race.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we were literally taking it stroke by stroke, and I had this feeling in the last ten that we needed to go and they caught us up and we managed to hold off that final push from them."</p>
        
            <p>Both women won silver in Tokyo, but went one better in 2024 crossing the finish in five minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The pair sat in third in the early stages, but powered in front at the halfway mark, to bag the country's second gold medal of the games.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Aotearoa's second shot at a rowing gold came in the men's double sculls.</p>
        
            <p>However, Robbie Manson and Jordan Parry would cross in sixth spot to end their Olympic medal hopes.</p>
        
            <p>Spain took the early lead with the Kiwis back in sixth, a spot they were unable to progress from throughout.</p>
        
            <p>Romania soon took over, with Ireland and the Dutch making up the front four.</p>
        
            <p>With 1000m to go, New Zealand couldn't get out of sixth place, Romania and Ireland in a close battle for the gold.</p>
        
            <p>It would be Romania to romp home in first, with the Netherlands taking Silver and Ireland bagging bronze.</p>
