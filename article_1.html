            <p>The bomb squad is assisting police after two suspicious packages were left outside Wellington buildings, where schools have gone into lockdown and streets have been cordoned off.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the packages were found just before 2pm on Monday in Brandon Street in Wellington Central and Fitzherbert Terrace in Thorndon, but "wide cordons have been put in place as a precaution".</p>
        
            <p>The US and Israeli embassies are based on two of the cordoned streets, and officers have put up a cordon near the Israeli Embassy, on the corner of Lambton Quay and Brandon Street.</p>

            <p>And the New Zealand Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams is working at both locations, police said.</p>
        
            <p>They asked both pedestrians and motorists to avoid the areas, including the Fitzherbert Terrace ends of Murphy Street and Hobson Street.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Girls', Queen Margaret and Saint Mary's Colleges, as well as Sacred Heart Cathedral and Thorndon Schools are all under a precautionary lockdown due to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>A Thorndon School staff member messaged parents to say the school had gone into lockdown.</p>

            <p>"We have been advised that a suspicious package has been dropped off at the American Embassy. This has meant that we went into lockdown along with Queen Margaret College and Wellington Girls' College," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Queen Margaret College also said police had asked it to go into lockdown, but student pick ups could be done as usual via Hobson Street.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, pick ups from Thorndon School could be done via Hobson Crescent, the safest exit from the school grounds.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said they were requiring all children to be picked up by a parent or other authorised adult. No children would be allowed to leave the school unaccompanied.</p>
