            <p>The father of missing fugitive Tom Phillips and his three grandchildren has spoken out for the first time, issuing a plea for his son and his kids to be left alone.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips and his three children, Ember (8), Maverick (9), and Jayda (10) disappeared almost three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Their location is unknown, but police believe they are hiding out in Western Waikato within Marokopa, or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>Tom's father, Neville Phillips, has spoken for the first time since his son and grandchildren went missing in December 2021, and believes there is only one way for the manhunt to end.</p>
        
            <p>"There's one conclusion," Neville Phillips told Stuff from his King Country home.</p>
        
            <p>"Just leave [Tom] alone, walk away."</p>
        
            <p>Neville explained his discontent with how the disappearance of his son and grandchildren has been reported, and said there is more to what has been revealed.</p>
        
            <p>"Do you have any idea what it's like being a parent with what's coming out in the media and very little of it is the truth?", he said to Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"And if we were to tell you the truth, it's putting somebody else down.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't afford to be the people saying something about somebody.</p>
        
            <p>"There's two sides to the story, and only one is coming out."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Stuff, Neville's wife, Julia, also dispelled rumours her and her husband were helping Tom evade authorities.</p>
        
            <p>"Do people think we'd put up with the police, the media, the lawyers and Oranga Tamariki, if we knew where he was?</p>
        
            <p>"You think we'd put up with all this hassle if we knew? So, we don't. And we're not helping."</p>
        
            <p>Neville blamed the police for allowing "it" to carry on, and labelled them as "liars", as well as the media, for reporting on matters that are before the Family Court, Stuff reported.</p>
        
            <p>While Neville has taken aim at police and the media, the mother of the missing children, and their other siblings have previously squared the blame firmly at the fugitive father.</p>

            <p>In an interview with Mata Reports' Mihingarangi Forbes in October, the mother of the children, Cat, spoke out about their disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"My babies deserve better. It's beyond time that they come home, and supporting Thomas is essentially supporting child abuse because that's what it is. There's no beating around the bush. None of this is okay."</p>
        
            <p>Cat also hit out at the running commentary about the case and criticism of her parenting by strangers.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just dumbfounded. These people - they don't know Thomas at all, half of them have never met him.... None of them have met the kids. They're all just saying things. It's like they're all jumping on the most popular bandwagon."</p>
        
            <p>A post to the Missing Marokopa Children Facebook page - run by the children's two older siblings - expressed support for their mother.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very proud of you, Mum, for speaking out. It takes courage to do so, especially amongst all of the individuals who still support Tom and his ongoing abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"No one can begin to imagine the daily torment you are going through, but we hope they take the time to watch this video/documentary so they are able to get an understanding of the situation our family is in."</p>
        
            <p>They wrote the search had gone on "far too long", and hoped the latest efforts meant "we are getting closer to seeing our babies again."</p>
        
            <p>"We love you so much Jayda, Maverick and Ember and we hope you will return home soon."</p>
