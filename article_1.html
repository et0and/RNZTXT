            <p>Five boys aged between 11 and 13 have been arrested after a burglary in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant David Mayes said a Ohinerau Street homeowner returned home to find five people had broken into their home about 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>"When confronted, the suspects have attempted to flee.</p>
        
            <p>"The property owner tried to stop the suspects and was assaulted by one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Police said officers, with the help of an Eagle helicopter and the dog unit, were able to find all five suspects and took them into custody.</p>
        
            <p>The boys have been referred to Youth Aid in relation to the burglary and assault.</p>
        
            <p>Mayes said the homeowner was taken to hospital as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>"They have since received medical treatment for minor injuries and are now recovering at home.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the impact property crime can have, however, would caution people against taking matters into their own hands.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, the best thing to do is to avoid a confrontation, maintain observations, and call police."</p>
