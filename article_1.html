            <p>One of the KiwiRail shareholding ministers says there are good reasons for the InterIslander ferry service to stay in government hands.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government last year canned a replacement project for the ageing fleet, but it has also lambasted the way KiwiRail, which owns InterIslander, has maintained the vessels.</p>
        
            <p>After the Aratere grounding on Friday, Picton locals have been asking whether it's time for another operator to take over.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis told First Up the government must ensure the privately run Bluebridge service has a competitor.</p>
        
            <p>The government also must ensure there is enough capacity to ship freight and passengers between the North and South Islands, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The minister has committed to buying replacement ferries, but would not give a date.</p>
