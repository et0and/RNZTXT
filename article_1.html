            <p>The Maori King, Tūheitia Paki, crowned Te Arikinui Kiingi Tūheitia, has died at the age of 69.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tūheitia succeeded his mother, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, following her death in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>He was the seventh of the line of Pōtatau Te Wherowhero to head the Kingitanga, which was founded in 1858.</p>
        
            <p>He grew up around Waahi near Huntly. He started his schooling at Rakaumanga but at the age of eight, like his mother before him, was sent to a pakeha school in Hamilton before going on to boarding school at St Stephens College.</p>
        
            <p>Tūheitia enjoyed his time there, meeting boys from around the country. He spent his final year at Huntly College and then embarked on a series of jobs, including working as a meatworker and as a farmhand. He joined the army and served three years in the artillery, and then joined the construction crew building the Huntly Power Station.</p>
        
            <p>Although he was the eldest son of Dame Te Ata, he expected his older sister Heeni would succeed her and did not discover he was to head the Kingitanga movement until just before the Queen's death.</p>
        
            <p>He had five brothers and one sister. His father was Whatumoana Paki.</p>
        
            <p>The position of Maori monarch is not hereditary by right and a new leader is appointed by leaders of the tribes associated with the Kiingitanga on the day of the previous monarch's funeral and before burial.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tūheitia was an unpretentious man and his home remained the house he and his wife built at Huntly at Waahi Marae.</p>
        
            <p>He had suffered from poor health for a number of years, with cancer and diabetes-related ailments.</p>
        
            <p>He underwent surgery in what his office called a minor operation in September 2013.</p>
        
            <p>There was serious concern over his wellbeing in August 2014 when he spent some weeks in Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>At the time his spokesperson, Tukoroirangi Morgan assured people that the King had been overwhelmed by an outpouring of aroha and support from the public and that he wished to allay any fears over the latest setback in his ongoing recovery.</p>
        
            <p>During that period of ill health, a King's Council, Te Kaunihera a Te Kingi was created to help guide the King's eldest son, Whatumoana Paki while he acted for his father and took over his duties.</p>
        
            <p>Whatumoana was given the title Te Whirinaki a te Kiingi.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tūheitia slowly returned to work and did attend the annual Ratana celebrations at Ratana Pa in January 2015.</p>
        
            <p>His younger son, Korotangi caused him some problems during 2014 when at the age of 19 he appeared in court charged with being five times over the youth alcohol driving limit and stealing surfboards in Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>Korotangi Paki was discharged with out conviction after it was argued that a conviction could end any chance he might have to be the next Maori King.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown appealed and Korotangi was convicted of drinking and driving and was disqualified from driving for eight months.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court allowed the discharge on the burglary charges.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tūheitia is survived by his wife Te Atawhai and their two sons Whatumoana and Korotangi and daughter, Ngawaihono.</p>
        
            <p>Whatumoana Paki is expected to officially succeed Kiingi Tuheitia as the next Maori monarch.</p>
