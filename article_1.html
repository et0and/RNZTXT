            <p>A man who scammed people out of nearly $300,000 by pretending to be a police officer has been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the 25-year-old man, a UK national, was chased by police through Auckland central on foot.</p>
        
            <p>The scam involved a call to a landline by someone pretending to be a police officer and providing a fake badge number.</p>
        
            <p>There were 18 Aucklanders, aged between 56 and 90, with the majority over 80, allegedly duped out of money.</p>
        
            <p>"The scam will always involve this so-called officer asking for financial information or asking you to withdraw cash to be collected as part of an investigation into banks," Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>The man faces 22 charges of obtains by deception, attempting to obtain by deception and escaping custody.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in the Auckland District Court on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>His bail will be opposed by police.</p>
        
            <p>"We will allege in court that this man, who only arrived in New Zealand in early June, was on his way at the time to collect more cash from a previous victim," Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, real detectives turned up at the victim's doorstep to advise him he was about to be scammed out of $20,000 in cash.</p>
        
            <p>"Financial Crime investigators from all three policing districts' fraud teams in TƒÅmaki Makaurau have been working together to piece together this offending, and this is a great outcome."</p>
        
            <p>A total of $297,700 in cash was lost by victims.</p>
