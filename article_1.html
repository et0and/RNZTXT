            <p>A woman who had her paid parental leave application turned down because she worked 296 hours - but not 10 hours a week over at least 26 weeks - in the year before applying for paid parental leave has lost a bid to have the decision overturned.</p>
        
            <p>Amy de Vries asked the Employment Relations Authority to review the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Her baby was due on 9 August last year and she applied for paid parental leave in April.</p>
        
            <p>She was told her application was approved provided she worked at least 10 hours a week in any of the 26 weeks of the 52 before her due date.</p>
        
            <p>It was noted at this time she had not worked 26 weeks yet and was told to advise Inland Revenue if she did not.</p>
        
            <p>She was declined in July on the basis she had not worked enough.</p>
        
            <p>She argued that while she had not worked the minimum 10 hours over 26 weeks, that would have taken her to a total of 260 hours, and she had worked 296 over the time period.</p>
        
            <p>Employment Relations Authority member Eleanor Robinson noted that de Vries said medical circumstances reduced her ability to work.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment told the authority that it could not exercise its discretion with paid parental leave when the eligibility criteria had not been met.</p>
        
            <p>"I fully understand the basis for consideration Ms de Vries has submitted, and I appreciate that the purpose of s 7A of the PLEPA is to entitle the primary carer of a child who stops working or takes a period of leave to receive parental leave payments out of public funds.</p>
        
            <p>"However Parliament has set a statutory requirement for eligibility for parental leave payments. Ms de Vries has not met the statutory requirement which is not only for a minimum hours, but for a period of weeks over which they must be worked.</p>
        
            <p>"The authority cannot set aside statute. In those circumstances, I find that there is no legal basis which would permit the authority to set aside the statutory eligibility criteria."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party MP Ricardo Menendez-March said people should have financial security to spend time with their newborns.</p>
        
            <p>"The current paid parental leave eligibility criteria is too strict. It particularly penalises people who are doing a mixture of self-employed work and being an employee, which includes low-wage workers like cleaners as well as middle-income workers."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Greens would overhaul the paid parental leave system to guarantee good incomes to parents so children could be given the best start in life.</p>
