            <p>The coalition government's first Budget shows expectations of a lower tax take because of the weak economy, while expenses remain elevated, with the budget deficit peaking this year and staying higher for longer.</p>
        
            <p>Business Canterbury chief executive Leeann Watson previously said businesses had asked for infrastructure, health, education, and law and order to be prioritised.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to see some of the additional $1 billion announced in Budget 2024 used to leverage the opportunities that brings to better connect us to the rest of New Zealand and the world.</p>
        
            <p>"The real proof in the pudding will be on the delivery of outcomes from this Budget, and all eyes will be on how quickly the Government can complete its so called 'turnaround job' for the economy."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
