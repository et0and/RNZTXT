            <p>A Defence Force plane carrying 50 New Zealanders evacuated from New Caledonia has landed at Auckland Airport this evening.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it will be working with France and Australia to ensure the safe departure of several evacuation flights amidst civil unrest in the island state.</p>
        
            <p>The first flight took off from the capital of Noumea after a short turnaround at Magenta aerodrome at 7pm, and landed in Auckland at about 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>Chloe is waiting at Auckland Aiport for her parents, who she says have been stuck in New Caledonia for two weeks on a business trip.</p>
        
            <p>She said she will give them a big hug after what she expected to have been a long and exhausting journey.</p>
        
            <p>Noumea's international airport remains closed.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the New Zealanders on the flight would have had a security escort to the airport.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Island nations were among those who had sought New Zealand's help to evacuate citizens, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Peters said there would be more flights over the next few days to get all 250 Kiwis out of the French territory, which has been in the grip of riots and political unrest.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped another flight would leave for New Caledonia in the morning.</p>
