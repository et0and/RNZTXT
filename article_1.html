            <p>An Invercargill motorist may have saved lives, Police say, by reporting a speeding driver swerving through traffic on a busy State Highway.</p>
        
            <p>The motorist called 111 to report a car going at least 50kmh over the open road limit, overtaking multiple vehicles and weaving in the lane as it drove north towards Gore on State Highway 1 around 11:10am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Constable Mel Isaacs was one of the Gore units dispatched, and she said she didn't have to wait long to spot the red Audi coming toward her.</p>
        
            <p>And when the police car's radar locked on to the 18-year-old's car, it showed the speed was more than twice the open road limit.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't quite believe it when I saw the speed on the radar - I thought 'is that right?'."</p>
        
            <p>But it was right.</p>
        
            <p>It also turned out the 18-year-old behind the wheel is faster at driving than he is at learning; just last week, Constable Isaacs had pulled him over for going 30km/h above the 100km/h limit.</p>
        
            <p>"When he pulled over for me this time, he was more concerned with the speed I had to do to catch up to him than anything he had done wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never seen a car doing the speeds he was, and if it went wrong, it would have been catastrophic.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, there are some drivers who shrug at the road safety message, and that puts everyone around them at risk."</p>
        
            <p>The teen now faces two charges of dangerous driving, relating to the speed and the manner of driving, and will be summonsed to appear in court.</p>
        
            <p>His licence has been suspended for 28 days and the car was towed away.</p>
        
            <p>"We're unapologetic about targeting speeding drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"High-velocity crashes are horrific events to attend and we will do everything we can to prevent them.</p>
        
            <p>"The motorist who called 111 today potentially saved lives by picking up the phone and giving us the chance to act.</p>
        
            <p>"If you see dangerous driving on the road, please call 111 as soon as you can - don't assume someone else will make that call."</p>
