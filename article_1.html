            <p>Wellington city councillors have voted to push pause on a sale of the council's airport shares.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the city council's long-term plan the council agreed to sell its 34 percent stake in the Wellington International Airport to establish a new perpetual investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>It would be designed to help the city's recovery following a future natural disaster, address the council's insurance risk and reduce reliance on future borrowing.</p>
        
            <p>But, in August the fund faced an uncertain future when a notice of motion was signed by nine councillors to shoot down the sale.</p>
        
            <p>A meeting was held on Thursday on that notice of motion but councillors have voted nine to seven to support it.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors did axe clause 3 of the notice of motion which would have stopped any delegations to contribute to the development of the council's draft and final Long Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>That was due to councillors believing that this clause was not inclusive of mana whenua and their Tākai Here partnership.</p>
        
            <p>The Tākai Here partnership was signed in 2022 to establish a shared commitment between council and mana whenua.</p>
        
            <p>Following the vote Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau told the councillors there would have to be cuts to the council's capital programme.</p>
        
            <p>However, she respected the vote that she did not back.</p>
        
            <p>"Democracy has spoken."</p>
        
            <p>Council officers now have to stop all work on the airport's shares sale and staff have to develop a long-term plan amendment process, which they would provide advice on to council next month.</p>
        
            <p>By December, the council would need to develop options for consultation - which would include detail regarding capital programme changes.</p>
        
            <p>The options would have to include a full sale, partial sale, and no sale choices.</p>
        
            <p>A full programme of community consultation would be required, and the amended long-term plan would have to be audited prior to final adoption by June next year.</p>
