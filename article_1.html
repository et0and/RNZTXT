            <p>Drivers who park in areas reserved for disabled people will soon face a 400 percent hike in penalty fees in what the government calls a crackdown on "selfish behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>The fee hasn't been updated since 2004, prompting the government to announce from 1 October, the fee will increase from $150 to $750.</p>

            <p>Disability Issues Minister Louise Upston said parking in areas reserved for the disabled is the "epitome of arrogance".</p>
        
            <p>"We need to get tough on this selfish behaviour, and that is why we are taking action."</p>
        
            <p>"Increasing penalties for people who misuse mobility parking will level the playing field for disabled people by helping prevent unnecessary disruptions in their day-to-day lives.</p>
        
            <p>"The penalty for abusing mobility parking in New Zealand is far too low compared to other countries, like Australia. Increasing this will send a very clear message that this behaviour is not okay, and our government is serious about addressing accessibility issues," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>The government is also applying an inflation-adjusted increase to all parking infringements - raising fees across the board by roughly 70 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The increases are designed to ensure towage fees don't leave tow-truck operators out of pocket, as is currently the case.</p>
        
            <p>"Towage fees have been too low for too long. This has meant that tow-truck operators are often left out of pocket for the service they provide. That's not acceptable and is why we're updating fees," Transport Minister Simeon Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parking infringement fees have not been updated in two decades, making councils' role in managing public parking increasingly difficult. For example, in Auckland, this has meant that paying a parking ticket is sometimes cheaper than paying for parking."</p>
        
            <p>Where fees were set after 2004, the government has aligned the increase with similar offences for consistency.</p>
