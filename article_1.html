            <p>Two people have been spotted alive in the water off Gisborne - but they have since been lost to sight and the search for them postponed until Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A search was launched yesterday afternoon after a fishing boat with three people on board was reported overdue.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ) said this afternoon, a container vessel, the African Tiger spotted two people in the water off the Māhia Peninsula while on its way to Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>They could no longer be seen but searchers were urgently trying to find them again and rescue them. RCCNZ operation manager Michael Clulow said vessels had been sent to the location.</p>
        
            <p>However, just after 7pm Tuesday RCCNZ said the search had been postponed until first light Wednesday, with plans for the day being made overnight.</p>
        
            <p>It was hoped the fishermen spotted had reached a life raft dropped near their location by an NZDF P8 Poseidon.</p>
