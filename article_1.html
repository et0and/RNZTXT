            <p>Disruptive industrial action by Wellington public transport workers will stop on Monday night, their union says.</p>
        
            <p>After several bargaining meetings and interruptions for hundreds of travellers in the capital, union workers will go back to work as normal from tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Since Tuesday 17 September, union members have been working to rule - taking all breaks and refusing overtime or shift changes.</p>
        
            <p>But the Rail and Maritime Transport Union (RMTU) told RNZ they now had a deal that they could recommend to their members.</p>
        
            <p>The offer included a pay increase above inflation, keeping compensation for all types of medical termination and changes to their master roster.</p>
        
            <p>The industrial action was now scheduled to stop at 11:59pm Monday 23 September.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington managing director of public transport operator Transdev, Ian Ladd, told RNZ the company had signed terms of settlement with the RMTU regarding the new Multi-Employer Collective Agreement (MECA).</p>
        
            <p>Ladd said the union would hold a stop-work meeting on Thursday outside of peak hours, so members could vote on the terms.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that many commuters have faced frustrating travel experiences during this period of industrial action, and we apologise for the disruption to their journeys and thank them for their patience," Ladd said.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council Transport Committee chairperson Thomas Nash said he was glad the industrial action would end.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'm] really pleased for all the passengers that the normal services can resume on our Metlink trains in the morning."</p>
        
            <p>Nash said he was grateful the parties had negotiated a settlement.</p>
