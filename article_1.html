            <p>A Naenae resident says they have heard someone has been shot and killed nearby, while emergency services respond to reports of a shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 3.20pm to the scene on Seddon Street in Lower Hutt. A cordon is at place in the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who RNZ has agreed not to name, said it was sad to hear someone had died, but they were not worried for their safety.</p>
        
            <p>Another local told RNZ a sheet had been lain over something in the middle of the road.</p>
        
            <p>However, police told RNZ a person was found critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services earlier said they were still trying to establish what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services are asking Seddon Street residents to follow the directions of officers at the cordons.</p>
        
            <p>Three police cars and armed officers have blocked Seddon street at the corner of Wheatley Street.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are out on the street talking amongst each other and looking on down the road, but the scene cannot be viewed from the cordons.</p>
