            <p>New government Minster and ACT MP Brooke van Velden has got a public ticking off from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment for making wrong and misleading comments about the ban on new oil and gas exploration.</p>
        
            <p>The ban was brought in by the Labour led government in 2018 but the new coalition is going to repeal it.</p>
        
            <p>The letter from Simon Upton to van Velden is published on the commissioner's website.</p>
        
            <p>In in it Upton tells her she has wrongly quoted him as saying the ban was likely to increase global greenhouse emissions and that a similar comment was made in ACT's Energy policy.</p>
        
            <p>The statements were incorrect and misleading and he has never said the ban would increase emissions, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was no firm basis for claiming that it will, he said.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
