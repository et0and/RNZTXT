        <h2>Watch: 'Sometimes things don't just click': Robertson's assistant coach suddenly quits</h2>
        <p>
"As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working," All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson says after Leon MacDonald's resignation.
</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks assistant coach Leon MacDonald has quit after a falling out over tactics with head coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>In statement New Zealand Rugby said discussions between Robertson and MacDonald on their working approach had been taking place for several weeks, with the pair agreeing to mutually part ways.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon and I have been having some honest conversations with each other for a little while now. As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working. Leon and I both care deeply about the All Blacks and we believe we've made a decision that's best for this team," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand Rugby statement announced the shock change, just five tests and less than two months into the start of the new coaching regime.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said it "wasn't working" between the two and that discussions between them had been taking place for several weeks, ending with pair mutually agreeing to part ways.</p>

            <p>He told media in Christchurch both men believed it was better to make the decision now for the sake of the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"We went through a process," he said. "It was a mutually agreed decision."</p>
        
            <p>He went on to say: "He's a helluva coach ...we didn't expect it to get to this point," adding that he wished his departing assistant all the best.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said the priority now was ensuring the team was at its best to face the Springboks. They had been told about MacDonald's departure.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have the conversations now with the players and get round them if we need to."</p>
        
            <p>The departure of former fullback MacDonald comes on the eve of the team's departure for two Rugby Championship tests against the Springboks in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>His absence will be absorbed into the existing coaching team for the remainer of the season, with assistant coach Scott Hansen and contact skills coach Tamati Ellison to take on additional responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he and MacDonald had "differing views" which they couldn't overcome.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon and I have been having some honest conversations with each other for a little while now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working. Leon and I both care deeply about the All Blacks and we believe we've made a decision that's best for this team.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a huge amount of respect and appreciation for Leon in the group and the work he's put in to get us to this point in our journey. As a team we have acknowledged that contribution and our focus now needs to be on South Africa, it's going to be two tough test matches over there."</p>

            <p>NZ Rugby head of professional rugby and performance Chris Lendrum said: "You've got two great coaches who have been having some robust but constructive discussions on the approach to drive the All Blacks over a period of time now. Ultimately, they have made a brave decision that they believe is best for the team," Lendrum said.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon is a highly regarded coach and has made a huge contribution to rugby across a number of teams in New Zealand, and we'd love to have him back in our system in the future. For now, I'd like to thank him on behalf of NZR and wish him all the very best."</p>
        
            <p>At a media briefing in Auckland, Lendrum said: "It's a really brave and decisive call from Leon in particular because he's aspired to be an All Blacks coach his whole career."</p>
        
            <p>He endorsed the decision saying it was down to differing views on the direction of the team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a personality thing, Razor and Leon have worked together for a long time, not so much recently.</p>
        
            <p>"They've both been head coaches at different Super Rugby clubs over the past six or seven years and I think in that time their approach has changed somewhat."</p>
        
            <p>There was an element of sadness that things hadn't worked out between the two men, however, it was not a performance-related situation.</p>
        
            <p>As head coaches of Super Rugby teams, both men were used to being "masters of their domain".</p>
        
            <p>Robertson, 49, and MacDonald, 46, are former All Blacks team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald was an assistant for the Crusaders in 2017 when Robertson first began his successful reign as head coach of the Super Rugby side, but left the team soon afterwards and become head coach of the Blues in 2019.</p>
