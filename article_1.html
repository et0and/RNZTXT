            <p>Without a Fight has won this year's Melbourne Cup race at Flemington Racecourse.</p>
        
            <p>Second was Soulcombe and third Sheraz.To complete the top four, Ashrun - who was in his fourth run back after missing 1000 days through injury - produced an amazing run to finish just out of the placings.</p>
        
            <p>Right You Are came slowly over the line in last place, and has being checked by vets and is believed to be heat-stressed.</p>
        
            <p>It is jockey Mark Zahra's second Melbourne Cup. It was a back-to-back win for Zahra, who rode Gold Trip to win last year's Melbourne Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I was on a horse you can sit on. He's got an electric turn of foot and he pulled me all the way to the line," Zahra said after the win.</p>
        
            <p>"The stars aligned for Gold Trip last year and aligned for this horse this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a few things and the way he won the Caulfield Cup, I was confident he would run it."</p>
        
            <p>Zahra is the first jockey in decades to ride back-to-back Cup winners.</p>
        
            <p>Without A Fight firmed as a Cup contender after winning the Caulfield Cup last month.</p>
        
            <p>No horse since 2001 had completed Melbourne-Caulfield Cup double, when Ethereal won both.</p>
        
            <p>Zahra told Network 10 Without a Fight was a "gentleman for me today".</p>
        
            <p>"Went to the rail and switched off and probably got to the front earlier than last year. In front of him was Gold Trip and Vauban. I thought I'd stay here. They all made their moves and it opened up for me."</p>
        
            <p>The win gives Anthony and Sam Freedman their first Cup win.</p>
        
            <p>The race is held at Flemington Racecourse each year as part of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival, and known popularly in Australia as "the race that stops the nation".</p>
        
            <p>The Melbourne Cup has a history of not being won by favourites, and this year six-year-old gelding Vauban was the top contender, after winning the Copper Horse Handicap at Royal Ascot in June, over 2800 metres, then taking the top spot in the Ballyroan Stakes at Naas in August.</p>
