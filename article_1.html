            <p>The All Blacks aren't dwelling on a referee's blunder in their defeat to the Springboks last weekend at Ellis Park as they prepare for a must win clash with the World Champions in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks had asked for an explanation from World Rugby after the referees failed to pick up a knock on in the lead up to a Springboks' try in last weekend's test at Ellis Park, which South Africa won 31-27.</p>

            <p>Assistant coach Scott Hansen said the All Blacks were yet to hear back from the governing body and said the team had not discussed the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"No we haven't mate. Nor have we discussed that here in our environment. I know there's been a conversation. I know Razor (head coach Scott Robertson) has been spoken to about it and it's with the boss at the moment," Hansen said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a team, we've just moved on. The ruling is what it is. We're best to go forward and face what's in front of us and that's getting back into test footy this week and we can't really look back. That's for others to be concerned with and we haven't spoken about it as a team."</p>
        
            <p>Hansen said the team could not afford to be distracted ahead of what has shaped up as a must win game in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were intent on improving their performance and making sure they didn't give away as many penalties as they did last week in Johannesburg, where the All Blacks were on the wrong side of a 14-5 penalty count.</p>
        
            <p>"You have better accuracy in your decisions and you have better accuracy around what that looks like and you adapt to the ref. We need to react quicker and better to what the ref's ruling and we've had that conversation today," Hansen said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's exactly where our focus is around what does it look like in our preparation and where we need to be better this weekend."</p>
        
            <p>The Springboks lead the Rugby Championship standings on 14 points with the All Blacks second on six points and Argentina third on five points.</p>
        
            <p>With three rounds remaining, the defending champion All Blacks realistically need to win this weekend to keep their title chances alive.</p>
        
            <p>Hansen is confident the team can cause an upset in Cape Town.</p>
        
            <p>"When you feel a bit of hurt and pain you've still got to look at the things you did well and there was 60 so odd minutes of us doing really well and influencing a test exactly how we needed to.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking at that and saying 'well done, this is where it worked well for us', but being really honest around we need to get better here. But there was a lot of positives. If you look at our ability to find space, to get around the South Africans. Our defence was very strong in certain areas of the field. We influenced them around our lineout at times also. We encouraged around that but always looking at opportunities to get better."</p>

            <p>The All Blacks selectors could have a tough choice on their hands this week with Hansen confirming flanker Dalton Papali'i was recovering well from injury and could be available.</p>
        
            <p>Papali'i was replaced in the starting side by former captain Sam Cane for last week's defeat at Ellis Park.</p>
