            <p>The Toyota Aqua is once again holding the unwanted title of New Zealand's most stolen car.</p>
        
            <p>Insurer AMI received nearly 17,000 claims for stolen cars last year, with the Toyota Aqua topping the list for the second year in a row, followed by Nissan Tiida and Toyota Corolla.</p>
        
            <p>AMI recorded a 43 percent spike in car theft claims in 2022 while the number of theft claims in 2023 made it the second biggest year for vehicle theft in the past five years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's concerning to see another year of elevated vehicle theft claims and, unfortunately, the data highlights that we all need to adopt a security-minded approach when leaving our cars unattended," AMI executive general manager Wayne Tippet said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing a consistent similarity in the price of commonly stolen vehicles too, usually no more than $5000 in value. These seemingly cost-friendly cars are typically 10 years or older."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland accounted for more than a third of all vehicle theft, followed by Canterbury (17 percent) and Waikato (12 percent).</p>
        
            <p>"Cars without advanced security features such as keyless ignitions, immobilisers, or alarms, or parked where a swift getaway is possible, have a higher risk of being stolen," Tippet said.</p>
        
            <p>Peak time for vehicle thefts was between 10pm and 5am.</p>
        
            <p>"With theft increasing after dark, those who can, should always park their cars in the driveway, lock the gate if they have one, or opt for a well-lit area if on-street parking is the only option," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Steering locks still remain a cost-friendly security measure and effective deterrent for thieves."</p>
        
            <p>*All data is based on AMI Insurance motor claims data from 2023. Cars are ranked from highest frequency of theft to lowest. Symbols indicate rank movement compared to 2022.</p>
