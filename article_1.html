        <h2>Wellington Zoo glamping plans may face the chop</h2>
        <p>
Big plans for tourism at the zoo may be a victim of Wellington City Council's budget woes.

            <p>The chance for visitors to go glamping at Wellington Zoo may be scrapped as part of Wellington City Council's amendments to its Long Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau has requested officers review and provide advice on the future of projects, including the Civic Square redevelopment and the zoo's master plan.</p>
        
            <p>There are five projects included in the 20-year master plan, such as a revamp or completely new habitats for its lions and a savannah area which includes glamping for visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The other parts include a climate action hub, a new kiwi house, and a redesign to the front entrance area.</p>
        
            <p>Acting chief executive Chris Jerram said the addition of glamping would help draw in revenue for the zoo.</p>
        
            <p>"There's lots of zoos in Australia and overseas that have got glamping and they always get booked out," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a slightly different opportunity in terms of accommodation options in Wellington, rather than staying at the waterfront you come and stay at the zoo and get surrounded by the animals and wake up to the lions roaring and gibbons calling out."</p>
        
            <p>He said the habitats or buildings in the projects that would be upgraded were more than 40 years old.</p>
        
            <p>If the zoo's master plan was removed from the Long Term Plan, it would limit the zoo's ability to improve animal welfare, staff safety and visitors' experience, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Animal welfare science is ever evolving ... It means that more often than not we're having to spend money on habitats every five to 10 years to make sure that it stays up to date, that we're providing best practice animal welfare in line with the current knowledge."</p>
        
            <p>The zoo - the oldest in New Zealand - had some assets that were 118 years old, and was still dealing with "legacy issues" of underfunding in the past, he said.</p>

            <p>Another major project under review is the redevelopment of Civic Square, where more than $320 million is set aside for building remediation work.</p>
        
            <p>The council has a statutory obligation to strengthen its earthquake-prone buildings in Civic Square.</p>
        
            <p>These include the Town Hall and Wellington Central Library, which are both category 1 heritage buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Heritage NZ director central region Jamie Jacobs said Wellington would be really proud to have both buildings re-opened at some point in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to see these heritage buildings, whether it's the more modern heritage of the library or the older more traditional heritage of the Town Hall, to be opened and enjoyed by the community again.</p>
        
            <p>"I went on a tour of the Town Hall site last week and it was a really impressive project. Perhaps larger scoped than everybody thought but it's looking really good."</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs said the Civic Square itself was already in the process of changing.</p>
        
            <p>When it was created, it was supposed to be the "beating heart" of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Also in the area, the Civic Administration Building has irreparable earthquake damage and is expected to be demolished by February.</p>
        
            <p>The Municipal Office Building's demolition is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 which will see Wakefield Street reopen to all traffic again.</p>
        
            <p>The City to Sea Bridge that connects the CBD to the waterfront will also be demolished.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobs said at this stage it was hard for Heritage NZ to say what it did or did not support, as it was not clear what Wellington council's goal was.</p>
