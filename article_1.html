            <p>An out of control fire in Canterbury has doubled in size to nearly 980 hectares as crews battle to contain it.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze was not contained about 11am, Incident Commander Brian Keown says.</p>
        
            <p>SH73 was closed overnight, but reopened at midday with stop-go signs in place and motorists requiring an escort to pass through.</p>
        
            <p>"We have nine helicopters alongside three fixed-wing aircraft attacking the fire from the air, while 15 trucks, tankers and support vehicles are fighting the fire on the ground."</p>
