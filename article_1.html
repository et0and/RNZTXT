            <p>Multiple squads of police officers armed with rifles and tactical gear went into the Goodview Apartment Hotel after a reported gun sighting.</p>
        
            <p>The standoff lasted more than two hours.</p>
        
            <p>A cordon on Hobson Street between Cook Street and Union Street was lifted after three hours.</p>
        
            <p>A man was taken out of the hotel in handcuffs and put into a police car just before 10.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Police also escorted a woman away from the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told RNZ he saw two people arguing on the street. Soon after one of the pair "got up, put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a gun and loaded it and pointed it at him and said he's going to shoot him".</p>
