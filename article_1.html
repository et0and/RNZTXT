            <p>Government changes to limit what disabled people can spend their funding on shows they will be the ones paying the price for its fiscal incompetence, Chris Hipkins says.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikaha / the Ministry of Disabled People on Monday unveiled changes to purchasing rules for how people can use their disability support funding.</p>
        
            <p>This meant things that "would be considered something that every citizen has to pay for" would not be eligible, among a range of other restrictions, Hipkins said.</p>
