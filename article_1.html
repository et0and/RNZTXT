            <p>Teammates of a teenager killed in Dunedin this week have cancelled a rugby game out of respect for the family.</p>
        
            <p>Trinity Catholic Catholic student Enere McLaren-Taana, 16, died after an attack at Dunedin's bus hub on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>On a Facebook post, Otago Community Rugby manager Warren Kearney said Saturday's fixture between the Sassenachs - the Otago combined co-ed schools team - and Dunstan High School had been cancelled in a show of respect to McLaren-Taana's family.</p>
        
            <p>"Otago Rugby's thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and team-mates of Enere Taana-McLaren.</p>
        
            <p>"In respect of Trinity Catholic College, the Intermediate Otago Combined Sassenachs team will not be playing tomorrow's game against Dunstan High School.</p>
        
            <p>"At times like these, we need to stick together and support each other. Kia kaha."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a clinical psychologist said the stabbing attack by a teenager was extremely troubling.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest in a spate of assaults at bus and train stations in the past few months.</p>
        
            <p>Police found a knife at the scene and were investigating the circumstances leading up to the stabbing.</p>
        
            <p>A 13-year-old boy who is accused of his murder appeared at the Youth Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Umbrella Wellbeing chief executive Dougal Sutherland said the apparent involvement of a weapon was shocking and concerning.</p>
        
            <p>Historically, teenagers had fought with their fists and while this was not to be condoned, the use of a weapon was "really, really troubling", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Violent incidents at bus and train stations involving young people did seem to be on the increase, he said, but there was no obvious reason for this trend.</p>
        
            <p>However, those types of incidents rarely happened in isolation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of contextual implications that need to be taken into account, as well as the developmental level of a [young person].</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of factors will have combined to produce this really terrible and tragic outcome."</p>
        
            <p>Overall, offending by adolescents has decreased in the past decade, but a certain group of teenagers were offending more, Dr Sutherland said.</p>
        
            <p>"For a specific subset of adolescents - those with more pervasive antisocial behaviour present since childhood - rates have increased as they are engaging in more offending behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"These are likely to be the group who show up in the spikes of offending [such as] ram raids, violent behaviour at bus stops and so on."</p>
