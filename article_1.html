            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been in Wairoa this morning to gauge progress of the town's recovery from Cyclone Gabrielle and is meeting with several Hawke's Bay mayors.</p>
        
            <p>Watch a media conference with the PM here:</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has already met with Wairoa Mayor Craig Little and toured damaged sites in the town, including Takitimu Marae where the floodwaters swept through leaving a thick layer of silt.</p>

            <p>Luxon is also expected to meet with other Hawke's Bay mayors today.</p>
