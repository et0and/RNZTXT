            <p>Black Caps sensation Rachin Ravindra will be monitored by the team's medical staff after the batsman took a sickening blow to the head while fielding in the side's Tri-Nation series opener in Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>During New Zealand's dominant 78-run victory over Pakistan in Lahore, Ravindra misjudged a catch while fielding in the deep. He appeared to lose sight of the ball in the floodlights while setting up to dismiss Khushdil Shah in the 38th over.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra was seen on the coverage diving to the ground in the immediate aftermath, before getting up to his knees and falling back into a sitting position on the grass.</p>
        
            <p>The dazed batsmen was treated by two medical staff on the ground before being helped off the field with blood on his hands, as he held a bandage to his head to stem the flow.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw him just now in the changing room, you know he's been conscious all the time so that's fantastic," teammate Glenn Phillips said. "Obviously it was a terrifying moment."</p>
        
            <p>A NZ Cricket spokesperson told media Ravindra had come through a head injury assessment (HIA) after being helped from the pitch.</p>
        
            <p>"He sustained a laceration to the forehead which has been addressed and treated at the ground, but is otherwise well. He came through his first HIA well and will continue to be monitored under HIA processes."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps will play South Africa on Tuesday, less than 36 hours after the match against Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>If Ravindra does not play, Devon Conway could potentially come in as a top order replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Phillips blasted his first ODI century at a rapid pace, picking up 98 runs from the last six overs of the New Zealand innings and scoring his last 77 runs in 32 balls.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand posted 330-6 and dismissed Pakistan for 252.</p>
        
            <p>Complimenting batter Phillips' unbeaten 106, Daryl Mitchell scored 81, with Kane Williamson hitting a half-century.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Bracewell hit three sixes in his heavy-hitting 31 off 23 balls.</p>
