            <p>A Westland Mineral Sands barge has run aground near Westport overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The Manahau came ashore at Carters Beach during a thunderstorm about midnight on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Buller District Mayor Jamie Cleine said the motorised barge was carting mineral sands and had been awaiting suitable weather to come into port.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been anchored off Westport for the best part of a week ... and obviously last night's pretty severe thunderstorms and weather - something's happened and changed for them, and it's ended up coming ashore."</p>
        
            <p>Cleine said Westland Mineral Sands would want to pull the boat back out into the water as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>The job would require tugs, but there were none anywhere close to Westport, so they would need to be brought down to Westport.</p>

            <p>The Maritime Union national secretary Carl Findlay said concerns had been raised previously by New Zealand seafarers about the foreign crew and flag of the barge.</p>
        
            <p>There had been no reports of injuries, which Findlay said was fortunate, as the West Coast was a notoriously treacherous maritime environment.</p>
        
            <p>The 97.53-metre and 3706-GT self-powered barge Manahau had only just come into service in August, carrying mineral sands out of shallow draught port Westport to Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>The Manahau did not have a New Zealand crew and the flag state was Niue, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"Vessels such as the Manahau operating in New Zealand's unique and challenging maritime environment should be crewed by experienced New Zealand seafarers."</p>
        
            <p>It had been extremely disappointing to see substantial government funding go towards a vessel operating in our waters that was neither New Zealand flagged nor crewed, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the last several years, we saw an upsurge in New Zealand-crewed coastal shipping, but this is now going backwards with the loss of coastal shipping services, or in this case, failing to provide jobs for skilled local crews.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand needs to build its coastal shipping capacity, and that means New Zealand-owned, operated and crewed ships."</p>
