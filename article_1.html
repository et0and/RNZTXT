            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has brushed off concerns about a threat of legal action by a former senior Australian politician saying: "I've got a right to say what I said".</p>
        
            <p>Peters gave a speech on the NZ-China relationship on Friday, against a backdrop of former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr saying he's taking legal action against Peters for comments Peters made on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Peters' speech emphasised the importance of New Zealand's relationship with China, and China's significance on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>It also highlighted points of tension between the countries, such as human rights, cyber attacks, recent activity in the South China Sea, and "hardening rhetoric across the Taiwan Strait".</p>
        
            <p>Peters also brushed off concerns about the legal situation with Carr, saying it wasn't his first "rodeo" and he's doubtful the legal action will go any further.</p>
