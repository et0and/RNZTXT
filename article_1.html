            <p>New Zealanders will have a chance to spot a comet with the naked eye that hasn't been seen in our skies for 80,000 years.</p>
        
            <p>Comet C/2023 A3 is expected to be visible to the naked eye in the western skies of the country from Tuesday until later in the week.</p>
        
            <p>Stardome astrologist Josh Aoraki told the Herald that the best place to see the comet would be anywhere that has a clear unobstructed view of the western horizon.</p>
        
            <p>"You're going to see a really bright star which is Venus, and if you look below that to the right, you might see this little fuzzy patch in the sky. That's the comet."</p>
        
            <p>The Stardome astronomer said the comet was likely to have a tail extending from the back.</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki said the best chance of seeing the comet would be to leave the city due to light pollution.</p>
        
            <p>"In Auckland, if you go out to places like Muriwai and Piha, that will give you the best shot."</p>
        
            <p>He said the prime time to view the comet would be during a 45-minute to hour window just after sunset.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a fairly bright comet. We don't often get bright naked-eye visibility comets.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very rare and unpredictable. But this has been the most promising one in several years."</p>
        
            <p>He estimated Comet C/2023 A3 was 85 million kilometres away and only came along once in a human lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not like Halley's Comet that goes around the sun in 80 years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has a very long orbit so it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing to see this comet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite rare to see a naked-eye comet so I implore people to go and see it."</p>

            <p>This potential sighting comes a week after Aurora Australis lit up the skies in blazing purple, blue and pink for Southland and Otago residents.</p>
        
            <p>People were given a rare glimpse into the mechanics of the sun and its effects on our planet after the solar flares caused the colourful display last week.</p>
        
            <p>Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation and energy blasted from the sun's surface when built-up magnetic energy is suddenly released.</p>
        
            <p>They often happen near sunspots, where the sun's magnetic fields are particularly strong.</p>
        
            <p>Particularly when such flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, they can release massive clouds of charged particles, or plasma, that travel through space and interact with Earth's magnetic field.</p>
        
            <p>This activity can lead to geomagnetic storms, which, in turn, can trigger dazzling auroras visible in our night skies.</p>
