        <h2>Government's focus on roads 'costly to society', 88 academics warn</h2>
        <p>
The academics from eight countries - with expertise in transport, urban planning, health and more - raise five "major concerns" about the draft policy statement on land transport.

            <p>The government's transport plan is at odds with economic growth and a step backwards for the climate, a group of 88 academics says.</p>
        
            <p>The draft Government Policy Statement (GPS) on Land Transport unveiled in early March outlined $7 billion of investments over 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>It included 15 new Roads of National Significance, and refocused public transport projects.</p>
        
            <p>This would be paid for in part by more toll roads, increased vehicle registration fees and traffic offence fines, and fuel tax hikes of 22 cents per litre ramping up from 2027. Consultation on the plan closed on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 88 academics - from New Zealand and seven other countries, and with expertise in transport, urban planning, health and more - raised five "major concerns" about the draft GPS in their submission.</p>
        
            <p>They said the government's focus on driving and road freight was "at odds with aims of economic growth and value-for-money".</p>
        
            <p>"Road transport dependency is costly to the society as a whole, in terms of environmental degradation; illnesses and injuries associated with traffic, air pollution, and noise; low efficiency of transport of people and goods; infrastructure building and maintenance; direct user costs; and land use."</p>
        
            <p>Second, the plan was a step backwards on climate change, with 39 percent of emissions coming from transport. They referred to the climate action tracker run by independent scientists, which was already rating New Zealand's response as "highly insufficient".</p>
        
            <p>It would also reduce public transport funding, saying this could mean whole neighbourhoods without access and making it harder for those with lower incomes or disabilities to get around.</p>
        
            <p>The submission highlighted a lack of walking and cycling infrastructure, despite evidence about the benefits of these.</p>
        
            <p>"The GPS' intention to reverse speed limit reductions and reduce traffic calming funding can be expected to increase road traffic injuries and deaths," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, aiming to fast-track infrastructure would allow decisions to be made despite evidence suggesting risks to human health and natural environments, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the academics urged the government to set targets for shifting to healthier and more efficient urban and inter-city transport, prioritising public transport, walking, cycling, while rail and coastal shipping should be prioritised for long-distance freight.</p>
        
            <p>The plan should also reduce space dedicated to roads and curb subsidies for driving, while focusing on health and liveability, they said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ sought comment from Transport Minister Simeon Brown, but he did not respond in time.</p>
