            <p>Social Development Minister Louise Upston has directed her officials to stop publishing weekly updates on benefit numbers as the number of people on welfare reaches record levels.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party is calling it a "cover-up" but Upston said such regular updates were "unnecessary" and monthly and quarterly data is a "better decision-making tool".</p>
        
            <p>A short statement was recently added to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) website without fanfare, noting: "The Income Support Weekly Updates will no longer be published following the 25 October release."</p>
        
            <p>Asked by RNZ for an explanation, an MSD spokesperson said Upston would provide answers in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, and directed further questions to her office: "We'll leave them to answer."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking during Parliament's Question Time, Upston told MPs the weekly data was "very volatile" and not accompanied by the "detailed analysis" delivered every month and quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"We want our department's resources to be focused on the analysis that we need to get more people into work, not on unnecessary reporting."</p>
        
            <p>MSD's website confirmed benefit numbers would continue to be updated on a monthly basis. Weekly reports have been published since April 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Upston told Parliament weekly reporting was introduced due to a demand for more timely information during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"That period of course has now passed. Like many things, we are simply returning to the pre-Covid reporting," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>Leaping to her feet, Labour's social development spokesperson Carmel Sepuloni pointed out unemployment figures were as high or higher than during the pandemic: "Why does she think now is the time to stop regular weekly reporting?"</p>
        
            <p>Upston reiterated her view that monthly and quarterly reporting provided "more meaningful" data.</p>

            <p>The latest update, for the week ending 25 October, reported a record 392,211 people on a main benefit, of which 204,360 were receiving Jobseeker Support.</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni asked the minister whether she stopped weekly reporting because it showed a steep increase in Jobseeker numbers. Upston rejected that: "We are dealing with the circumstances we got from the last government."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ, Sepuloni said now was not the time to cover up the reality faced by many New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"With unemployment and beneficiaries soaring under her watch, the minister must continue to be transparent with this data, not hide from what she might see as an inconvenient truth."</p>
        
            <p>The move comes as the government pursues a shake-up of the welfare system, with tougher requirements and repercussions for beneficiaries.</p>
