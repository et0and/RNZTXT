            <p>A Labour Party MP who accused the Health Commissioner Lester Levy of "cooking the books" during a Select Committee says she makes "no apology" for holding the government to account.</p>
        
            <p>During a tense scrutiny hearing yesterday, Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall and Professor Levy clashed over Health New Zealand's financial reporting, which had been criticised by the Auditor-General.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released this week show that after the Auditor-General's intervention, HNZ moved the moved millions of dollars of redundancy payments from 2023-24 to the current financial year, pushing the forecast deficit 2024-25 to more than $1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>It also changed how much it was allowing for Holidays Act paybacks in this financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Verrall, who was health minister in the previous government, went on to ask Levy about his track-record of producing surpluses at district health boards, which "became deficits" after he left.</p>
        
            <p>She put it to him that he had a "reputation for cooking the books", before being drowned out by calls for a point of order.</p>
        
            <p>Levy angrily rejected the allegations, promising to provide evidence to refute them - and said he expected an apology.</p>
        
            <p>In response to RNZ's query today, Ayesha Verrall says Dr Levy had not yet provided that evidence.</p>
        
            <p>"My job as a parliamentarian is to hold the government and their decisions to account and I make no apology for that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Levy said he intended to provide that information when he had the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Professor Levy has a number of prior commitments this week but he is committed to providing the commentary and numbers and will do so next week."</p>
        
            <p>In a written statement, Levy said comments that Health New Zealand was using its annual report to artificially increase its deficit were "totally incorrect".</p>
        
            <p>As Health NZ told the hearing yesterday, there were two items in Health NZ's draft, unaudited accounts that it "adjusted" based on the Auditor-General's advice.</p>
        
            <p>"This is normal practice when finalising the audited annual accounts where differences in perspective are discussed and resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"This was in the context of a large complex service now under extreme financial pressure as a result of very significant month-on-month operating deficits being recorded in the last four months of the 2023/24 financial year ending in June.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether the costs of redundancies are included in last year's accounts or this year's, is a technical accounting matter in the end. This liability will be booked either way."</p>
        
            <p>The accuracy of the Holiday Pay remediations would only be known once all those payments were made, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am focused on ensuring these remediation payments are made as fast as possible as there has been little progress on this in prior years.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time we are looking to minimise the very significant consultancy costs that have been incurred."</p>
        
            <p>If Audit NZ was correct and there was money left over, that would be returned to the government.</p>
        
            <p>"But if we are correct and there is insufficient provision to meet the payments this will be a financial problem for Health NZ as operating budget will be required to meet those payments.</p>
        
            <p>"We are moving at pace to get Health NZ back to Budget, and while we do that work we are focused on strengthening front-line clinical services, and taking action to reduce wait times."</p>
        
            <p>The accounts had now been audited and signed off by the Auditor-General.</p>
