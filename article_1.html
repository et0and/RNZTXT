            <p>Thunderstorms are rolling up the country's east coast after causing flooding and flight cancellations in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch has now been lifted for Canterbury, but remains in place for Marlborough, Wellington, Wairarapa, Kapiti-Horowhenua, Tararua, Manawatu, Hawke's Bay and Gisborne until 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>In Christchurch, Fire and Emergency New Zealand said heavy rain had flooded houses in the suburbs of Belfast and Middleton.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris said the storm was moving north.</p>
        
            <p>"The concentration of the lightning has moved northwards of Christchurch... it looks like that band of heavy rain will continue trucking up the east coast making it to around Wellington around the 2-3pm time this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency urged motorists in Marlborough, Wellington, Wairarapa and Tararua to drive to the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Ferris said the risk was mainly for the heavy rain, large hail and strong wind gusts, making driving conditions hazardous.</p>
        
            <p>"That hail [in Canterbury] did really decrease visibility, so if you happen to be out driving out in a severe thunderstorm or a thunderstorm with hail in your path maybe slow down, maybe even pull off the road, it will pass," he said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned that large hail, which could come with thunderstorms, could cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vehicles and glasshouses.</p>
        
            <p>Several flights were cancelled and delayed at Christchurch Airport, where MetService said sensors detected 2mm of rain falling in just one minute.</p>
        
            <p>Airways New Zealand said lightning strikes affected some of the "critical infrastructure".</p>
        
            <p>An airport spokesperson said lightning had affected airfield lighting and navigation systems, although the airport stayed open.</p>
        
            <p>The lightning has moved beyond the airport and airport operations are resuming.</p>
        
            <p>Three fire crews were responding to a hedge fire in Yaldhurst sparked by lightning about 10.15am.</p>
