        <h2>Failure to flag foreign intelligence system 'extremely serious'</h2>
        <p>
Ministers should have been told the system was being run out of Wellington, but "all checks and balances seem to have broken down", Helen Clark says. Audio

            <p>GCSB staff who signed off on hosting a foreign agency's intelligence system should face disciplinary action, former prime minister Helen Clark says.</p>
        
            <p>The existence of the system was revealed in a report released on Thursday by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation found the GCSB knew when it agreed to host the signals intelligence system - which intercepts and decodes messages from other nations' militaries - that it could be used to support "military operations by foreign partners".</p>
        
            <p>However, the agency did not tell government ministers about the agreement, despite knowing how sensitive it was.</p>
        
            <p>The system operated from 2013 until 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Clark, who was the minister in charge of the GCSB from June 2003 until November 2008, told Checkpoint the revelation was "extremely serious".</p>
        
            <p>"One would have thought that following on from the Inspector-General's report there should be some disciplinary action, if indeed people are still in the system."</p>
        
            <p>It was likely to be an American agency that owned the signals intelligence system, she said.</p>
        
            <p>While the United States was a Five Eyes ally, that did not mean the agreement should be kept secret, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The GCSB, operating at this more junior level, obviously couldn't be sure that what it was doing was in accordance with the government's intelligence requirements and with New Zealand law.</p>
        
            <p>"You can be led along to think that something's OK, whereas actually, it needs a New Zealand lens put across it - and obviously, that didn't happen in this case."</p>
        
            <p>The memorandum of understanding on hosting the system was signed at "a point of flux" for the GCSB, which, in effect, had acting leaders from late 2010 until early 2012.</p>
        
            <p>"All checks and balances seem to have broken down at the GCSB," Clark told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"Things fell through the cracks on this and who knows what else."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told media he could not and would not comment on intelligence matters.</p>
        
            <p>However, the hosting of the signals intelligence system was a "historical issue" and the GCSB had learnt a valuable lesson from the debacle, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The agreement was legal at the time it was signed, but would not be possible today under strengthened legislation, he said.</p>
