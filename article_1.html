            <p>New Zealand have narrowly missed a place in the final of the SailGP regatta on Auckland Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Foils finished fifth overall after seven fleet races but only the top three boats advanced to this afternoon's decider.</p>
        
            <p>In today's three races, New Zealand placed fourth, sixth and second but their overall score was headed off by Australia, Great Britain and Spain.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Denmark won their second straight after their close shave in the warm-ups.</p>
        
            <p>Follow all the action from day 2 here:</p>
