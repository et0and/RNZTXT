        <h2>Concerns motorists may ignore 50km/h speed limit, despite multiple crashes</h2>
        <p>
The temporary speed limit was introduced on Tuesday along a section of State Highway 8's Tekapo-Twizel highway for the remainder of the winter period.

            <p>There are worries motorists may disregard a new 50 km/h speed limit on a major highway in the Mackenzie Basin that has been the site of several serious crashes, NZTA Waka Kotahi says.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary speed limit was introduced on Tuesday along a section of State Highway 8's Tekapo-Twizel highway for the remainder of the winter period.</p>
        
            <p>The move follows a string of serious crashes along the same stretch of road in a matter of days, leaving a total of 24 people injured.</p>
        
            <p>Nine people were hurt in a multi-vehicle crash on the shores of Lake Pukaki on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The accident came only three days after two buses - carrying dozens of visitors from China - crashed and rolled within 100 metres of each other.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen people were taken to hospital following the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists who drove the road that morning said fog and black ice made conditions difficult to negotiate, with some believing conditions were too dangerous for the road to remain open.</p>
        
            <p>Signs advising motorists of new temporary speed limits were put in place this week, along a 28km stretch of State Highway 8 between Simons Pass and Lake Ruataniwha, south of Twizel.</p>
        
            <p>The speed limits will initially apply to east of Lake Pukaki to Lake Ruataniwha, past the State Highway 80-Mount Cook Road turnoff.</p>
        
            <p>An additional highway maintenance crew will also be put in place to grit the road.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA Central South Island system manager Mark Piner said it had spoken with police about frustrated motorists disregarding the rules.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very aware of that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spoken to police about making sure they have a presence and that we can enforce it as reasonably as we can.</p>
        
            <p>"It's on us to make sure that the speed limits are appropriate to where the most risks are, in terms of bridges, shaded areas, etc.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to make these as less restrictive as we can."</p>
        
            <p>Piner said the speed limits would be reviewed and adjusted in the coming weeks, dependent on weather and road conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Balancing public safety with ensuring the main lifeline route for local motorists and freight operators had been a consideration for the agency.</p>
        
            <p>Piner said they could "manage the situation" with de-icing and gritting the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Although conditions in the Mackenzie Basin had been extraordinary with increased levels of moisture, the agency was not ruling out similar measures along other alpine routes throughout the mainland.</p>
        
            <p>"[Reducing speed limits] was another tool in the tool box which we may consider if we need to elsewhere," Piner said.</p>
        
            <p>He implored motorists to familiarise themselves with road conditions they may encounter.</p>
        
            <p>"With the number of tourists increasing, they may not have been in a snowy, icy road environment before.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people in the North Island may not have encountered it either."</p>
