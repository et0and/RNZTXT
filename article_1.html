        <p>
Learner drivers are booking their tests before they're even ready because wait times have stretched out to over a month, a driving instructor says.

            <p>Learner drivers are booking their tests before they are even ready because wait times have stretched out to over a month, a driving instructor says.</p>
        
            <p>The average wait time to sit a full licence test is 45 days.</p>
        
            <p>To sit a test for a restricted licence the average wait is 53 days, but for some regions that number is higher - in Canterbury it is 61 days.</p>
        
            <p>In October, the government brought in an all-in-one fee for each stage of a driver licence which removed re-sit fees, prompting a hike in people sitting their learner's test.</p>
        
            <p>This lead to some people re-sitting their theory test more than once in a single day. Some had not even read or learnt the road rules, the transport authority said.</p>
        
            <p>A stand down period after two failed attempts on the same day was subsequently brought in.</p>
        
            <p>But North shore driving instructor Matthew Campbell says now they are having to book practical tests for students who aren't ready to sit them because of the long wait times.</p>
        
            <p>Some learners were also forgoing lessons altogether and "learning by test-fails", Campbell told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"We predicted this would happen, you know what's the point of getting lessons when you can get free re-sits instead," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tests are failing quite often for silly reasons. I sometimes sit in the testing carpark and I just see tests go out and ten minutes later they come back...some don't leave the carpark because they've got an unroadworthy car".</p>
        
            <p>Not checking blindspots or failing to signal properly on a roundabout were common mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of lessons with an instructor and a couple of mock tests was what people often needed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said learner drivers should have 120 hours of driving experience before going for a test.</p>
        
            <p>He also thought the free re-sits should be canned and the government should fund a few free lessons instead.</p>
        
            <p>"But even if it's gone tomorrow, the waitlists are still blown out so it's going to be a problem for months."</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi concedes the free re-sits have resulted in demand significantly exceeding testing capacity.</p>
