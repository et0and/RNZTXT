            <p>A Northland woman attacked by roaming dogs earlier this month says it pains her to know a child has been mauled on the same beach.</p>
        
            <p>Kate Taylor-Reid said she went public after she was attacked on Taipā Beach in Doubtless Bay because she wanted the council to take action and to stop it happening to anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, however, an eight-year-old girl was hospitalised after being attacked by a dog, also on Taipā Beach. The girl's mother posted on social media that she had since been discharged from Kaitāia Hospital and was recovering.</p>
        
            <p>The dog behind the second attack was believed to be unrelated to the pack of five involved in the earlier attack.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor-Reid said hearing about the attack on the child, so soon after her own (4 December), was distressing.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole reason why I've been so vocal about this, was my feeling that nothing was going to be done through the council. So I was making as much noise as possible to make sure that no one else was hurt.</p>
        
            <p>"If my situation had happened to a child or an elderly person that couldn't defend themselves or didn't know what to do, it would have been much, much worse. It's horrific. That poor little girl. It really pained me to see that someone else has been hurt because of owners that can't control their dogs."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor-Reid said she was, however, relieved to learn the dog that mauled the young girl was not part of the pack that attacked her.</p>
        
            <p>The Far North District Council did not respond to a request for information about any action it had taken following the first incident, but in an update posted on its website said a dog had been impounded following the attack on the eight-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>The council said an investigation into the incident was underway to determine whether any enforcement action would be taken against the owner.</p>
        
            <p>The council said patrols of the area had been increased since the previous incident, and an animal control officer was in the area when the girl was attacked.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also requested an update on the earlier attack.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of the dog involved in the attack on the girl was reportedly assaulted by members of the public afterwards, but police said they had received no reports of such an incident.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor-Reid said the attack on her occurred at the western, less-developed end of Taipā Beach, where she had been swimming every day after work.</p>
        
            <p>As she was walking on a track through the dunes she was rushed by a pack of five dogs - one white bulldog with a red collar and four Staffordshire crosses, at least two of which were black and brown brindles.</p>
        
            <p>She said two of the dogs lunged at her and latched onto her leg and ankle.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know what to do, there was nobody around. I was punching the one attached to the top of my leg, trying to make it let go. That didn't have any effect so I took a massive breath, screamed at the top of my lungs, and they let go."</p>
        
            <p>As she was returning to her car she saw two people on the beach who, strangely, appeared not to have heard her screams. She was going to ask if they owned the dogs, but with the animals still running loose she called a friend instead, who took her to Kaitāia Hospital. There she was treated for bruising and puncture wounds on her legs, ankles, hands and arms, and given a tetanus shot.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor-Reid said owners should be required to keep their dogs on a leash at Taipā Beach during the busiest times of day in summer, as was on the case on other beaches in the area such as Hihi, Coopers Beach and Cable Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Currently the only rule at Taipā was that dogs had to be "under control".</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's not the dog's fault, it's just being a dog. But people are not controlling their dogs or taking care of their dogs. That's the owners' responsibility."</p>
        
            <p>* The Far North District Council says stray or aggressive dogs can be reported day or night by calling 0800 920 029 with as many details as possible, including the type of dog, time and location. </p>
