            <p>The family of a young New Zealand pilot who died in a light plane crash in the Australian Outback is bringing his ashes home to Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Snell, aged 22, lost his life when his plane crashed into a paddock near Mulgathing Merino sheep station, which covers 530,00 hectares, about 830km northwest of Adelaide, on 27 June.</p>
        
            <p>He was the sole occupant of the Cessna 172.</p>
        
            <p>Snell's mother, Alison Snell, told the NZ Herald she would return from Adelaide on Sunday with his ashes.</p>
        
            <p>"We got up to see the sunrise at Mulgathing Station on Adam's birthday," she wrote on Facebook yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a tough few days."</p>
        
            <p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Adam Snell attended Saint Kentigern College in the Auckland suburb of Pakuranga before gaining a Bachelor's degree in Aviation at Massey University.</p>
        
            <p>The Massey University School of Aviation, which congratulated him for flying solo in July 2020, said on Facebook it was deeply saddened to hear of the unfortunate accident.</p>
        
            <p>"Adam was a bright and dedicated pilot, and his absence will be felt by all who knew him. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and friends during this difficult time. May he rest in peace," the aviation school said.</p>
        
            <p>After graduating, Snell worked for Jumbuck Pastoral at the Mulgathing station for six months before the tragic accident.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a genuine passion for the industry and seek to challenge myself through chasing new opportunities to broaden my knowledge of the aviation sector, therefore ensuring my skills as a professional aviator always remain well-rounded and beneficial to all my endeavours," he said on his LinkedIn profile.</p>
        
            <p>According to Australian media reports, police said Major Crash Investigators and Forensic Crime Scene officers attended the scene, along with officers from the Far North Local Service Area.</p>
        
            <p>"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be investigating the incident," the police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Safework SA has been notified of the death and police will be preparing a report for the Coroner."</p>
        
            <p>A death notice for the young pilot said he was the much-loved son of John and Alison Snell, loved brother of Lauren and Chelsea, and a cherished grandson and adored cousin.</p>
        
            <p>A remembrance service will be held at the Kohimarama Presbyterian Church at 2pm on Saturday 27 July.</p>
