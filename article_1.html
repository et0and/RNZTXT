            <p>Health agencies have confirmed New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said a nationally coordinated response was now in place following a meeting of health officials on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>In the past four weeks, there have been 263 cases - the highest number over a four-week period to date for all of this year.</p>
        
            <p>Director of Public Health Nick Jones said the main worry was the risk of severe illness among babies either too young to be immunised or whose immunisations are delayed.</p>
        
            <p>The key aim was get on time vaccination and immunisation during pregnancy, he said.</p>
