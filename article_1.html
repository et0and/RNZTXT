            <p>Minimum teacher-to-child ratios are not good enough for two-year-olds, groups representing early childhood teachers and services say.</p>
        
            <p>They have told the Ministry for Regulation to improve the rules.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, early learning services must have at least one teacher for every five children under the age of two, and one for every 10 children over two.</p>
        
            <p>In submissions to the ministry Kindergartens New Zealand, the Educational Institute, and Te Rito Maioha Early Childhood New Zealand called for different ratios.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rito Maioha, which represents several hundred ECE services and also provides teacher education, said current ratios and funding rates were not fair for two-year-olds.</p>
        
            <p>"Children/tamariki under three years old are infants, yet our current model creates an arbitrary cut off age of two which leaves tamariki in the two- to three-year-old bracket as the lowest funded group," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"These children/tamariki have all the needs of under two-year-old children/tamariki (nappy changing, developing language and social skills), yet not the same level of support in terms of funding or teaching ratios."</p>
        
            <p>Kindergartens New Zealand said the rules should change to require one teacher for every four children under the age of three.</p>
        
            <p>"Many ECE services operate above the minimum ratios particularly for children under three years old because of the known benefits. Good ratios facilitate good relationships and meaningful interactions - both factors being critical to optimise children's learning and development, and to support their safety and wellbeing," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Kindergartens New Zealand also recommended the review increase the requirement that at least 50 percent of staff working with children must be qualified teachers to 80 percent "immediately, with a view to increasing to 100 percent by 2027".</p>
        
            <p>The Educational Institute, which represents mostly kindergarten teachers, also called for the percentage of qualified teachers to be raised to 80 percent and to 100 percent by 2027.</p>
        
            <p>It said ratios should be changed to 1:3 for under-twos and 1:5 for over-twos.</p>
        
            <p>Independent advisory group the Office of Early Childhood said the review should increase the minimum requirement for indoor space in centre-based services from 2.5 square metres per child to 5sqm per child.</p>
        
            <p>It also said that people who were not teaching, such as cleaners, should not be counted when services were calculating the ratio of teachers to children.</p>
        
            <p>All of the organisations recommended the ministry reverse a recent change that allowed people without teaching qualifications to be the "person responsible" at each service.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Regulation was analysing submissions and was expected to report back to the government in November or December.</p>
        
            <p>The Early Childhood Council, which represents ECE service owners, recently criticised ratio regulations as being unworkable.</p>
