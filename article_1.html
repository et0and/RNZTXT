        <h2>‘Radical idea’: Mayor’s managed retreat idea divides council</h2>
        <p>
The proposal suggests converting freehold properties in areas that may become unliveable in the future into long-term leasehold properties.

            <p>A "radical" idea about handling managed retreat has come under fire from Western Bay of Plenty councillors.</p>
        
            <p>A late addition to a government submission about managed retreat was presented at a Western Bay of Plenty District Council Strategy and Policy Committee meeting on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The submission letter, that had already been sent, provided the council's thoughts on community-led retreat and adaptation funding.</p>
        
            <p>The controversy arose about a suggestion to help fund managed retreat. It proposed converting freehold properties in areas designated to become unliveable in the future into long-term leasehold properties.</p>
        
            <p>The submission letter gave the example of a 99-year lease.</p>

            <p>"The Crown would become the owner of the freehold land for a peppercorn rent and the owners would own the leasehold and continue to occupy the property," the submission said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Rodney Joyce labelled it a "radical idea" and questioned how it had been put into the submission without being presented to a workshop or councillors first.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor James Denyer said he had raised it with councillors after a different workshop.</p>
        
            <p>The majority of councillors were there and it was "favourably received", Denyer said.</p>
        
            <p>"Doing submissions like this is always a tricky one with timing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's much better, I agree, to have it in the workshop [but] sometimes that's just not possible."</p>
        
            <p>Joyce asked why the mayor hadn't emailed the idea to the councillors.</p>

            <p>Denyer responded: "we don't debate stuff by email".</p>
        
            <p>Joyce said he understood the time pressure, but this one needed to be "properly considered" before it went into the submission.</p>
        
            <p>"What's here is basically nationalisation of people's land without compensation. Now that's trampling on property rights.</p>
        
            <p>"Who's going to tell the people of Waihī Beach, Maketu, Te Puna and Pukehina that we support a government actually taking their … freehold title off them and replacing it with a leasehold?</p>
        
            <p>"That's actually quite a radical idea and it's one that should not be tossed off lightly."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Tracey Coxhead said she had experience in freehold versus leasehold land.</p>

            <p>Using "compulsory acquisition" to change the land to leasehold reduced the land value to "pretty much zero", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Comparing the same freehold and leasehold property, the leasehold would have half the land value of a freehold under normal circumstances, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Margaret Murray-Benge asked that any future submissions to government were emailed to councillors two days before the final sign off.</p>
        
            <p>This ensured everyone could have their say and finalise the submission with the "confidence of all your councillors", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Denyer said once submissions were written, there was no facility to incorporate everyone's comments and there wouldn't be the time to have it go before a committee.</p>
        
            <p>"That is my role as, as mayor, as leader of this council to make that call. These processes are not always ideal."</p>

            <p>He defended the idea: "Climate change is tough. You can't win all round in this one. Managed retreat is confiscation of land, and it won't be without full compensation.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a way of making it a more equitable outcome with long term certainty. It's also … just an idea, a suggestion to government."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Joyce, Coxhead, Murray-Benge, Wichers and Allan Sole voted against it.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Denyer, councillors Grainger, Don Thwaites, Richard Crawford, Grant Dally voted to accept the submission.</p>
        
            <p>Being an equal vote, Denyer used his casting vote to accept it.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor John Scrimgeour and councillor Anne Henry were absent.</p>
        
            <p>Grainger asked what would have happen if they didn't accept the submission. Joyce said he would write and request their submission be retracted.</p>
