            <p>The All Blacks have claimed their second Six Nations scalp in a week, with a 23-13 victory over Ireland in Dublin.</p>
        
            <p>Following on from the squeaky 24-22 win over England last Sunday, this was a win that did not come easy, but after their final quarter woes early this season, they finished strongly in the second half, landing a decisive blow against the Six Nations champions and world number one side.</p>
        
            <p>The win also gives New Zealand a chance of regaining world number one status, though they need Scotland to beat South Africa at Murrayfield on Monday morning (NZT) to achieve that.</p>
        
            <p>It took 68 minutes for the All Blacks to score their first try, but it was a match-defining one as Will Jordan crossed over, after some sustained attacking.</p>
        
            <p>That gave them a 10-point lead and though Ireland surged in the closing minutes, they could not breach the defence the All Blacks' line.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie was the key figure in the match, kicking six goals from eight attempts and orchestrating the attacks in the second half, figuring a couple of times in the lead-up to Jordan's try.</p>
        
            <p>The win was all the more sweet with key players Beauden Barrett and Codie Taylor out injured, with McKenzie and Asafo Aumua having a big impact in their places.</p>

            <p>The All Blacks also survived a yellow card against Jordie Barrett for a high tackle on the knock of halftime, even though the Irish scored a try in his absence two minutes into the second half.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks led 9-6 at halftime after a scrappy first 40, with messy breakdowns as the Irish continually slowed down the All Blacks ball.</p>
        
            <p>It was a constant of the game, with Nic Berry letting many of the Irish breakdown infringements go, even though the final penalty count was 13-5 in favour of the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Light rain falling on Aviva Stadium at the start of the game made handling difficult while the marking was intense.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie's three penalties gave the All Blacks a 9-3 advantage late in the half but Tupou Vaa'i was pinged for not rolling away at a breakdown, and Jack Crowley narrowed the gap to three with the penalty shot.</p>
        
            <p>Worse for the All Blacks was that in the same phase of play, Jordie Barrett was adjudged to have gone too high in a tackle on Garry Ringrose. The yellow card left the New Zealanders starting the second half with 14 men.</p>
        
            <p>The Irish took only two minutes to take advantage, attacking hard at the All Blacks line, with flanker Josh van der Flier crashing over for the try which Crowley converted.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie missed a penalty in the 57th minute, but the side was taking the game to the Irish, who were looking less disciplined than usual with sloppy handling.</p>
        
            <p>Then came Jordan's try, his 37th for the All Blacks.</p>

            <p>He was on the end of an attack which moved from side to side and featuring some skilful passing, particularly from McKenzie. He missed the conversion but the All Blacks were 10 points ahead.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie was delighted with the result, telling Sky Sport: "We are over the moon.</p>
        
            <p>"The Irish are a great side. We knew coming here that it was going to be a tough match down to the wire.</p>
        
            <p>"Just really proud of the boys' efforts, particularly our forward pack who really muscled up and our backs were able to build pressure through our kicking game."</p>
        
            <p>As to his own 18-point effort, McKenzie said his mindset was to make the forwards' job as easy as possible, but putting the ball in front of them.</p>
