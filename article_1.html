            <p>Eleven fire engines were at the scene, the spokesperson said. A police car and ambulance were also at the site, an RNZ reporter said.</p>

            <p>It issued an emergency alert warning people in to stay indoors if possible, keep doors and windows closed and be mindful about using air condititioning units.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have any health concerns please call Healthline or 111 in an emergency".</p>
        
            <p>At this stage it was too early to say what had caused the fire, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>It was believed it would take some time to extinguish the fire due to the size of the building.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have been reported.</p>
