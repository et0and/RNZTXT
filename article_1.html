            <p>A new poll shows growing public frustration as talks to form the government continue.</p>
        
            <p>It is nearly six weeks since the election, and three weeks tomorrow since the final vote total was announced.</p>
        
            <p>The Talbot Mills Research poll taken from 17 to 22 November found 66 percent of respondents think the negotiations are taking too long.</p>
        
            <p>That was six percent more than a previous poll taken a few days earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Nineteen percent disagreed that the talks were dragging on, and 16 percent were not sure.</p>
        
            <p>When asked who was to blame, 33 percent said Winston Peters, nearly a quarter blamed Christopher Luxon and just 4 percent pointed the finger at David Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders of both National and ACT have returned Wellington, where it was hoped a coalition deal would soon be announced.</p>
        
            <p>As of Wednesday afternoon, there were only a few outstanding issues for the two parties and New Zealand First to resolve.</p>
        
            <p>National leader Christopher Luxon has previously indicated he would head to Wellington once a deal has been agreed.</p>
        
            <p>But the incoming prime minister was downplaying its significance Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters at Auckland Airport, Luxon said further progress towards an agreement had been made over the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He said while a deal was close, there were further conversations to have and they would continue into the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Winston Peters remains in Auckland for now but many of his MPs have arrived in Wellington.</p>
