            <p>A major earthquake has struck the Himalayas near Mt Everest and the border of Tibet and Nepal, killing people, damaging buildings and sending people running to the streets in Tibet, Nepal and India.</p>
        
            <p>"Fifty-three people have been confirmed dead and 62 injured as of Tuesday noon, after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake jolted Dingri County... at 9:05 am Tuesday," the Chinese Xinhua news agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Over 1000 houses had sustained varying degrees of damage, on the Tibet side of the border, it added.</p>
        
            <p>The quake, centred in Dingri county in Tibet, close to the city of Shigatse, one of the area's holiest cities, struck at 9:05 am (01:05 GMT) on Tuesday, at a depth of 10km, according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. While the US Geological Survey reported the quake as magnitude 7.1.</p>
        
            <p>Videos published by China's state broadcaster CCTV showed houses destroyed with walls torn apart.</p>
        
            <p>Rescue workers waded through rubble strewn across the ruins in the aftermath of the earthquake, footage showed, while some gave locals thick blankets to keep warm.</p>
        
            <p>Surveillance images published by CCTV showed people running through a store's aisles as shelves shook violently, sending objects like toys tumbling to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>In the town of Lhatse, videos geolocated by AFP showed debris scattered in front of streetside eateries.</p>
        
            <p>"Dingri county and its surrounding areas experienced very strong tremors, and many buildings near the epicentre have collapsed," CCTV said, and "multiple aftershocks" had been recorded.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday emphasised "the full-scale search and rescue efforts, minimizing casualties to the greatest extent possible, properly resettling affected residents, and ensuring their safety and warmth through the winter", CCTV added.</p>
        
            <p>Xinhua news agency said "local authorities are reaching out to various townships in the county to assess the impact of the quake".</p>
        
            <p>Shigatse (also known as XigazÃª, or Rikaz), is the seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism, whose spiritual authority is second only to the Dalai Lama. Dingri county is on the side of Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures in Dingri are around -8 degrees Celsius and will drop to -18 this evening, according to the China Meteorological Administration.</p>
        
            <p>Disaster relief aid, including cotton tents, quilts and items for high-altitude and frigid areas, had been dispatched by central authorities to areas impacted by the quake, Xinhua said.</p>
        
            <p>The high-altitude county in the Tibet region is home to around 62,000 people and situated on the Chinese side of Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>While earthquakes are common in the region, Tuesday's quake was the most powerful recorded within a 200-kilometre radius in the last five years, the CENC added.</p>
        
            <p>Tremors were felt as far away as Nepal's capital Kathmandu some 400 km away, where residents ran from their houses.</p>
        
            <p>An AFP reporter said in Nepal, powerful tremors shook buildings in the capital Kathmandu just before dawn on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The US Geological Survey's earthquakes map showed one large earthquake (at UTC 1.05) for the Himalayas region, affecting both Nepal and Tibet. It measured it at 7.1, with the epicentre 93 km from Lobuche in Nepal, along the mountainous border with Tibet in China.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's map also showed a series of strong aftershocks in the same area since the 7.1 quake, in magnitudes of low 5's or high 4's.</p>
        
            <p>Officials in Kathmandu said they were checking for damage.</p>

            <p>Areas around Lobuche in Nepal, in the high mountains near Mount Everest, were also rattled by the tremors and aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>"It shook quite strongly here, everyone is awake, but we don't know about any damages yet," said government official Jagat Prasad Bhusal in Nepal's Namche region, which lies nearer to Everest than Kathmandu.</p>
        
            <p>Shaking was also felt in Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and in the northern Indian state of Bihar (bordering Nepal), where people also rushed from their homes as their walls shook.</p>
        
            <p>So far, no reports of any damage or loss to property had been received, officials in India said.</p>
        
            <p>"We felt a very strong earthquake. So far we have not received any report of injuries or physical loss," said Anoj Raj Ghimire, chief district officer of Solukhumbu district in Nepal, at the foot of Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>"We have mobilised police and other security forces, as well as locals to collect information about the damage," he added.</p>
        
            <p>Nepal lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, nearly 9000 people died and more than 22,000 were injured when a 7.8-magnitude quake struck Nepal, destroying more than half a million homes.</p>
        
            <p>Southwestern parts of China are also frequently hit by earthquakes. A huge quake in Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, there have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 km of the Shigatse quake in the past five years, all of which were smaller than the one that struck on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in neighbouring Nepal, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in that country's worst earthquake.</p>
