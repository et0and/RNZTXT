            <p>While her ability did not match her enthusiasm for the game, Helen Simpson still managed to carve out an extraordinary cricketing legacy.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson has just completed a staggering 54 seasons as a scorer at club, domestic and international level, the longest tenure of any scorer in the country.</p>
        
            <p>She has penned the scores to a number of historic New Zealand cricket moments, including Neil Wagner's five wickets in an over in 2011.</p>
        
            <p>It was an appropriate introduction to her storied scoring career, as none other than Black Caps skipper Glenn Turner picked Simpson up in his Ford to take her to Albion Cricket Club in Dunedin in 1970.</p>
        
            <p>From there, her dedication to the game did not wane nor did the superstars she bore witness to from Mark Richardson, Brendon and John Bracewell, Ken and Hamish Rutherford, Martin Snedden and three generations of McCullums; Stu, Brendon, Nathan, and most recently Riley at a National U19 Tournament.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a cricket enthusiast, but I probably didn't play it very well so I got the opportunity to go and score at one of the local cricket clubs to see if I liked the idea, and that's where I stayed."</p>
        
            <p>Her unmatched contributions will be celebrated as the inaugural recipient of New Zealand Cricket's newly minted long service badges.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson will be presented with her badge by fellow Dunedin local Suzie Bates at Sir John Davies Oval following the second warm-up match between the White Ferns and England A on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>While she continues to score at all levels, club cricket holds a special place in her heart.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy going along each week to spend the day with a group of nice young men, and the very occasional grumpy one that just go out there and enjoy their cricket on a Saturday and that hasn't changed to this day."</p>
        
            <p>Simpson said her work was always appreciated, even though it has become slightly easier with the introduction of online scoring.</p>
        
            <p>"Some sides didn't have scores at times and it's not the players favourite thing to have to do. It's a bit easier now though because they can just sit with an iPad, pushing the button rather than writing in score books."</p>
        
            <p>She said among her career highlights include being asked to score in test matches, and of course, Wagner's five in six.</p>
        
            <p>"It was actually in here in Queenstown, fortunately, one of the wickets he took, he broke the stumps, so the umpire had to run off and get a new one, so that gave us time to catch up, but they have all been good, a day at cricket is always good."</p>
        
            <p>Simpson hoped that others with a love for the game but perhaps not the skill-set would see they can be involved.</p>
        
            <p>"Cricket is a great game, and I hope people see there's a pathway to contribute at the highest level, even if you're not the best player."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a proud moment to be recognised for her service.</p>
        
            <p>"If we don't do our job the only there's not much point of the players doing theirs, because they'll never know who's won!"</p>
