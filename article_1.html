            <p>Elevated levels of arsenic have been found in the Waikato River, affecting water supplies in Auckland and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The Water Services Authority, Taumata Arowai, has confirmed slightly elevated - but safe - levels of arsenic.</p>
        
            <p>The authority says it is not yet known what has caused the issue, but reassures people it is safe to drink from the taps.</p>
        
            <p>Local Goverment Minister Simeon Brown says he was briefed on the matter this evening.</p>
        
            <p>He says the water suppliers have been asked to take appropriate steps and communicate concerns with their customers.</p>
        
            <p>Taumata Arowai will be providing regular updates, Brown says.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
