            <p>Wellington councillor Nicola Young is discussing government criticism of the council with Checkpoint's Lisa Owens. Listen live here.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Nicola Young agrees with the government description of her council as a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has floated the possibility of intervening at Wellington City Council after councillors last week halted the sale of airport shares.</p>
        
            <p>The decision leaves the council's Long Term Plan with a major budget shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Christopher Luxon said he was concerned while Finance Minister Nicola Willis - who's Wellington-based - separately described the state of the council as a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he was seeking advice on the options available to him but will not give a timeline for potential developments.</p>
        
            <p>Young told Checkpoint on Tuesday her concerns included council paying tens of millions a year in interest payments, liveability of the city and the leadership at council.</p>
        
            <p>She also took issue with mayor Tory Whanau, saying they had never had a "functional chat".</p>
        
            <p>"I find this really distressing because I want Wellington to be a flourishing city."</p>
        
            <p>A Crown observor would be a step in the right direction, she said</p>
        
            <p>Whanau earlier on Tuesday did not directly address the statements made by the government but said work was underway with councillors on the council's Long Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Young is due to discuss tensions at the council with Checkpoint's Lisa Owens. Listen live here.</p>
