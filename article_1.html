            <p>New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has finished second at the latest LPGA tournament in Florida after a sudden death play-off.</p>
        
            <p>Ko was beaten by American Nelly Korda on the second extra hole of the play-off at the Drive On Championship in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old won the season opening Tournament of Champions last weekend, the 20th title of her LPGA career. She needs one more win to be eligible for the Tour's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>The pair finished the fourth round at 11 under par.</p>
        
            <p>Ko bogeyed the second extra hole, while Korda parred it.</p>
        
            <p>Ko started the final round four shots behind Korda and recorded a double bogey at the third hole to slip further back.</p>
        
            <p>However, she got back into contention with three birdies before dropping shots at the 13th and 15th holes.</p>
        
            <p>With Korda, who was in the group behind her, also struggling, Ko took the lead with an eagle at the par five 17th.</p>
        
            <p>Korda also eagled the 17th and then birdied the 18th to force a play-off.</p>
        
            <p>Korda pockets $430,000 for the win, while Ko takes home $270,000.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time Ko has lost to Korda in a play-off.</p>
