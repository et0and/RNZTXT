        <h2>Live: Swarbrick asks PM if he will resign if policies result in homeless kids</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon failed to answer if he would resign, instead saying there were 24,000 people on the state housing waitlist who would "love a shot" at living in one.
</p>
        
            <p>The new Green's co-leader has asked Prime Minister Christopher Luxon if he will resign if any children are made homeless as a result of the government's Kāinga Ora policies.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday it was announced the government is demanding Kāinga Ora take a tougher stance on unruly social housing tenants, saying the agency needs to make "timely usage" of formal warning notices and relocations under the Residential Tenancies Act, and to "accelerate the process of tenancy termination" in severe and persistent cases.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick asked Luxon if he could guarantee that no children would be made homeless as a result of these policies.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Luxon said he did not want to see any Kāinga Ora tenants evicted but the parents of children in state housing were adults and had a choice to make about if they wanted to meet their obligations and responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick then asked Luxon if he would resign if any children were made homeless because of the policies.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon did not answer the question, saying there were children "growing up in motels, living on floors" and their families would "love a shot" at living in state housing.</p>
