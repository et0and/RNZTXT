            <p>Festival-goers in Gisborne and Wanaka can look forward to a fine day weather-wise, but people on the West Coast could be in for more heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands are ringing in the new year at Rhythm and Vines on Saturday and Sunday. At the same time, Rhythm and Alps is being held in Cadrona Valley near Wanaka.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice meteorologist Oscar Shiviti said it looked like the weather would play ball for people in Gisborne and Wanaka.</p>
        
            <p>While there was some rain overnight, it should clear up to fine conditions throughout the day, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, the Westland ranges south of Otira were under a heavy rain warning.</p>
        
            <p>The warning has ended but MetService is still expecting heavy rain on the West Coast, with the possibility of thunderstorms and hail later on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Shiviti said people on the West Coast should check the forecast before doing outdoor activities.</p>
        
            <p>Areas from Westland down to Fiordland should be on the lookout, he said.</p>

            <p>After the recent poor weather and downpours this week, the Mountain Safety Council is asking people to consider the forecast before going on tracks.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Mike Daisley said if people still wanted to trek outdoors, then taking a rain coat and a change of clothes is essential.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're trip or track is going to be crossing rivers, or close to them, and this sort of rain is around, [you can] assume the rivers arise and intercede with the track."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the Love Your Ways Music Festival in Auckland was cancelled, with organisers saying they were "devastated" on social media, but "the event has been deemed unsafe to proceed."</p>
        
            <p>The second T20 cricket international between New Zealand and Pakistan in Mount Maunganui also had to be abandoned due to the weather.</p>
