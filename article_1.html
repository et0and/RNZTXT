            <p>Speedway New Zealand says it was "blindsided" by a decision to move the speedway away from Auckland's Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Auckland councillors voted 11-8 to spend $11 million upgrading Waikaraka Park in Onehunga which will now host the event from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Speedway New Zealand president Lani Thompson told Morning Report they supported the upgrade of Waikaraka Park but never agreed to close Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>"We were left in the dark... We have been left out of the loop completely so we're still trying to catch up."</p>
        
            <p>While there were rumours the speedway would leave Western Springs, key stakeholders weren't consulted, Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Until you have it from officialdom, it's just rumour really and speculation."</p>
        
            <p>She said they felt blind-sided about being shut out of "one of our oldest and dearest tracks".</p>
        
            <p>Speedway New Zealand representatives met with Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown on Tuesday when it caught wind of the vote.</p>
        
            <p>"It would appear that it is final, however we're still playing catchup to find out how this has all come about," Thompson said.</p>
