            <p>New Zealand's golfers face a tough day on the links as they battle to improve their standings on the final day of their Olympics competition.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Fox is in the middle of the pack and Daniel Hillier is at the bottom in the competition at Le Golf National.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's first chance for a medal is at midnight, when cyclists Niamh Fisher-Black and Kim Cadzow take part in the women's road race.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, it was a day of despair in the athletics, with sprinter Zoe Hobbs failing to make the women's 100m final and shot putters Tom Walsh and Jacko Gill missing out on medals, Walsh with an injury.</p>
