            <p>A criminal syndicate that planned to illegally export hundreds of native lizards from Australia to Hong Kong has been "dismantled", authorities say.</p>
        
            <p>The reptiles had an estimated market value of $A1.2 million, according to New South Wales Police.</p>
        
            <p>Three men and a woman were arrested in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Some 257 lizards and three snakes were seized by police after allegedly being kept in poor conditions. They were treated and returned to the wild.</p>
        
            <p>Police set up a taskforce to investigate the alleged smugglers in September after 59 live lizards were intercepted in nine small containers on their way to Hong Kong.</p>
        
            <p>Officers conducted a series of raids in New South Wales in the past few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>At one home in Sydney they seized 118 lizards, three snakes, eight eggs and 25 dead lizards. A search of a property in rural Grenfell turned up four lizards hidden in bags.</p>
        
            <p>The four suspects - all aged between 31 and 59 - have been charged with offences including exporting native reptiles, dealing with the proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group.</p>
        
            <p>If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the men were refused bail after appearing in court over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In recent decades, Hong Kong has grown to dominate the international trade in a range of exotic animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, a study published by the ADM Capital Foundation found that over a five-year period, four million live animals from at least 84 countries were imported into the city.</p>
