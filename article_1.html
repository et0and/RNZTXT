            <p>MetService issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It said between 3pm and 10pm it could hit southern Waikato, eastern Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō and the far southwest of Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Downpours of 25-40mm an hour could also hit, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain."</p>
