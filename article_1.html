            <p>The justice minister has told the United Nations the government is committed to making sure there are 20,000 fewer victims of violent crime by 2029.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith is currently in Geneva and attended the Universal Periodic Review, outlining the coalition government's law and order plans.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Goldsmith said speaking to the United Nations Human Rights Council presented an opportunity to share New Zealand's human rights progress, priorities and challenges - and respond to issues and topics raised by others.</p>
        
            <p>The government's treatment of Māori was one of the issues raised by other countries.</p>
        
            <p>Most countries that commented during the session recommended New Zealand do more to reduce health, education and justice inequities for Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Germany suggested incorporating human rights and the Treaty of Waitangi into a written constitution; Australia recommended that businesses be made to report on gender pay gaps; and the United Kingdom recommended adopting modern slavery legislation for businesses with international supply chains.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Goldsmith said New Zealand was not as safe as it was six years ago and "it isn't the country many of us grew up in".</p>
        
            <p>"One of those challenges is law and order and keeping communities safe so they can go about their lives in peace.</p>
        
            <p>"I outlined our commitment to making sure there are 20,000 fewer victims of violent crime by 2029, as well as reducing serious youth offending by 15 percent."</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said this would happen by "backing police to go after criminal gangs", getting more officers on the ground, speeding up court processes, and restoring the Three Strikes legislation.</p>
        
            <p>The government would also create youth military academies, a youth serious offender category, cap sentence reductions and review the firearms registry.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll shortly receive the full list of recommendations made by member states, which we'll formally respond to in August.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important we demonstrate our commitment to human rights, and accept scrutiny of our progress."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand last took part in the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2019. This was the fourth time New Zealand has appeared.</p>
