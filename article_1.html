        <h2>Watch: Luxon plays down poll which puts him behind Hipkins</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister said he was focused on Kiwis - not the polls.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was focused on Kiwis - not the polls - as Labour leader Chris Hipkins has overtaken Luxon as preferred prime minister, and the centre-left bloc would be able to form a government based on results in the latest Taxpayers' Union-Curia poll.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a week which saw the government make moves towards speeding up infrastructure projects, sack the country's diplomatic representative in the UK and apologise for the ongoing school lunch omnishambles.</p>
        
            <p>Coalition partner New Zealand First introduced a bill to get rid of "woke" language it put into law when it was in coalition with Labour, and its leader Winston Peters was now heading to the United States to meet with his counterpart Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also addressed sacked minister Andrew Bayly's two-weeks off to go mountain climbing, the debate over the length of the Parliamentary term and another potential overhaul of the health system.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was entirely appropriate for the former Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister to be taking a couple of weeks off - and said it was important that Bayly took some time to clear his head.</p>
