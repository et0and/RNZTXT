            <p>Te Whatu Ora last week issued a warning about toxic blue-green algae in Lake Hood near Ashburton.</p>
        
            <p>National Public Health Service specialist Dr Claire Salter said the person was exposed to the bacteria before the warning was issued.</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms might not appear for quite some time until after contact with the water, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Toxins released by cyanobacteria can trigger asthma and hayfever symptoms, skin rashes, stomach upsets, and neurological effects such as tingling around the mouth, headaches, breathing difficulties and visual problems."</p>
        
            <p>The lake was tested weekly by Canterbury Regional Council but concentrations could change due to wind or warm weather.</p>
        
            <p>The council's water and land science manager Dr Elaine Moriarty said the bacteria was commonly found in Canterbury's lakes, especially during summer and autumn.</p>
