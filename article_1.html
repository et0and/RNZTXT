            <p>A former Health New Zealand employee accused of leaking Covid-19 vaccine data has appeared in court today ahead of his jury trial.</p>
        
            <p>At least 12,000 people had personal information released as part of the 2023 leak.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Young pleaded not guilty in December to a charge of accessing computer systems for a dishonest purpose.</p>

            <p>This morning about 20 supporters waited for him outside Wellington District Court holding signs thanking the 56-year-old IT worker for his alleged actions, which they described as "whistleblowing".</p>
        
            <p>Young stopped and spoke with them ahead of his procedural hearing.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer, Kevin Preston, told the court the police had not provided the defence with the information required in time for today's hearing, although he noted a USB was delivered to his office on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"It's encrypted and I can't access it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Young was bailed until his next hearing in April. A trial date is yet to be set.</p>
        
            <p>In a separate case involving Ministry of Health information, the ministry said on Thursday a staff member it claims leaked information to the media was no longer employed by the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ last month reported on a ministry document which showed the Associate Health Minister Casey Costello had requested advice on freezing the annual increase in tobacco tax.</p>
        
            <p>That was despite Costello saying she had not sought advice on that.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Director-General of Health Diana Sarfati - who heads the ministry - said the individual responsible for the leak had been identified after an investigation - and was no longer working at the ministry.</p>
