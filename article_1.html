        <h2>'That doesn't sound right' - Passengers describe plane swerving off runway</h2>
        <p>
Flights have been cancelled after the Jetstar flight hit trouble while landing.
</p>
        
            <p>Passengers aboard a flight Jetstar aircraft that slid off a runway at Christchurch Airport during landing say they heard noises mid-flight.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar said after landing the aircraft experienced a steering issue, causing it to veer on the runway at a low speed.</p>
        
            <p>Freelance Journalist Diana Clement was a passenger on flight JQ225 and says it was a frightening landing.</p>
        
            <p>"We swerved off the runway onto the grass then swerved violently back onto the runway before coming to a halt across the main runway."</p>
        
            <p>Clement told Morning Report they were told there had been a hydrolic leak on the right hand side.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's feeling a bit shaky."</p>

            <p>She thought the flight itself did not feel out of the ordinary.</p>
        
            <p>But she said some other passengers heard a weird noise when they were flying over, roughly New Plymouth. And then a similar noise on landing.</p>
        
            <p>Andi Burrell said he heard something that "didn't sound right" during the flight.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably half an hour in there was some mechanical noise coming from the right hand side of the plane," he said.</p>

            <p>"I said to my partner at the time 'that doesn't sound right' but didn't think anything of it until we came into land."</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said he felt the plane was "coming in too fast" upon landing.</p>
        
            <p>"When they applied the hydraulic brakes, it failed, a bit of brake lock and it went in a jerky motion," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the same time it was under control but there was a bit of forward momentum.</p>
        
            <p>"There was some uneasiness (on board) but the pilot was pretty good."</p>

            <p>Another passenger, Karin Small, told RNZ she had no idea anything was wrong until the landing.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been on a plane that that's happened to before," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It skidded out and then took off again and then landed on the grass and then the fire people came.</p>
        
            <p>"I was pretty calm about it and the staff were pretty good about people keeping it together."</p>

            <p>A mother aboard the flight, Joamn Matrona, said she wasn't focusing on what was happening in the cabin, rather her daughter who was upset.</p>
        
            <p>"My baby was crying the whole time so I was playing with her. She was really frightened, the moment the aircraft was shaking.</p>
        
            <p>"So hard - That was when I realised something was wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy that we're safe."</p>
        
            <p>Matrona said there was nothing during the flight which made her feel something was wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"Waiting (to be disembarked) was hard.</p>
        
            <p>"We were so hungry, especially my baby she was complaining about her tummy."</p>
        
            <p>The Jetstar aircraft was towed to the gate for passengers to disembark.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Civil Aviation Authority said it was looking into the event.</p>
        
            <p>"JetStar operates under the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which has also been notified," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened at 7:45am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>There were no reports of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Several domestic arrivals and departures to Christchurch had to be cancelled.</p>
