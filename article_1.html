            <p>One man is dead and another rescued after a birthday fishing trip went wrong in South Otago when their boat overturned.</p>
        
            <p>The men were brothers-in-law on a 60th birthday fishing trip in the Catlins.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel, a fibreglass runabout, turned over as the men approached Jack's Bay bar, about 2km from Pounawea, this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers, rescue vessels from Coastguard Bluff and Coastguard Dunedin and a rescue helicopter were alerted about 10.40am and joined the short search for the men.</p>
        
            <p>One man was found alive on rocks nearby and has been flown to Dunedin Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>Surat Bay Lodge co-owner Ester Johnson told an Otago Daily Times reporter and photographer at the scene the pair were brothers-in-law who were celebrating a 60th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>She said she watched the boat go slowly for a time in an area known to be rough.</p>
        
            <p>"And I thought to myself, 'What the hell are they doing?'"</p>
        
            <p>She said about half an hour after seeing the boat she heard the fire brigade, and hoped it wasn't for the fishermen, but then realised that someone was drowning.</p>
        
            <p>The boat tipped over before the men crossed the river bar.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions were rough this morning, though it was not too windy.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third time a boat had rolled crossing the bar in recent memory, Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for Hato Hone St John said the ambulance service was notified of a water incident at 10.38am and sent a first response unit, one manager, one ambulance and one helicopter to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Our crews assessed and treated one patient who was airlifted to Dunedin Hospital in a moderate condition."</p>
