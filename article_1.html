            <p>A man who racked up $17,000 in parking tickets and other vehicle-related infringements has finally paid it off after eight years.</p>
        
            <p>Todd Fisher, formerly of the inner-city Auckland suburb Parnell, would drive to work in Ponsonby every day and park in a 90-minute spot - then forget to move his car.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was playing "carpark roulette" and losing.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically I was parking in Ponsonby, just off St Mary's Bay Road, and there was a carpark there that was a 90-minute limit, and if you went over that you got a $65 ticket," he told Checkpoint on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"And if you didn't pay that within five days, it became $85 and I was stuck in meetings and I was just a bit busy and, and I kind of got a ticket every day and then it just escalated from there… It was, I thought, a future Todd problem actually."</p>
        
            <p>Past Todd also did not have a warrant of fitness or registration, so would also frequently get $400 tickets for that.</p>
        
            <p>"It was not good."</p>
        
            <p>Once the footwell of his backseat began to overflow with tickets, Fisher decided to find out what kind of pickle he was in.</p>
        
            <p>"I called up expecting to have just under $5000 worth of fines, and even then I wasn't proud, wasn't happy about it. But the lady on the other end of the phone said to me, look, it's 15,000 and counting. They're coming in every single day.</p>
        
            <p>"I pretty much said, 'Cool, I'll call you back when I know how to deal with this,' hung up and just burst into tears because I was on a low wage, didn't know what I was doing with my money and that really threw me off.</p>
        
            <p>"But then we got to the final ticket coming through and it was around $17,000 and then I set up a payment plan and we went from there."</p>
        
            <p>His mother confiscated his car for a month, forcing him to use the bus or Uber.</p>
        
            <p>"That wasn't a fun time, but I guess it stopped me getting into more trouble." </p>
        
            <p>Eight years later, he has just paid off the debt. </p>
        
            <p>"It's been a glorious week… it's amazing to get that extra bit of cash back in my paycheck. I got to the point where I was paying about 100 bucks back a fortnight, so really good to just get that little extra back, you know?"</p>
        
            <p>He now lives in Christchurch, where parking is "way cheaper", and any fines he does get are paid straight away.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always a silver lining and I've learned something. 'Eat the frog' is what I live by. If something is causing you an issue, deal with it as soon as it arises then it doesn't and become a bigger issue - deal with it as it's happening."</p>
