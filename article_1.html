            <p>Two Nelson schools locked down for hours due to an ongoing police incident, say the lockdown has been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the city remains cordoned off and the city's hospital is still partially locked down as police respond to a family harm incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Armed Offenders Squad is assisting as a precaution, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Motueka Street at the intersection of Tipahi Street, is closed.</p>
        
            <p>St John has been placed on standby and an ambulance, rapid response vehicle and a manager have been sent.</p>

            <p>Victory Primary School told RNZ went into lockdown about 10:30am.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Intermediate School, Nelson College and Hampden Street School were also in lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Both Hampden Street School and Nelson College said the lockdown was lifted about 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Health NZ says Nelson Hospital has been placed in partial lockdown restricted to card access only.</p>
        
            <p>"Visitors and patients are able to access the hospital via the main entrances which are staffed with security personnel to allow that access."</p>

            <p>Near the scene Artistic Beauty Salon owner Karen told RNZ what she could see.</p>
        
            <p>"Well I have been able to hear an alarm go off for about 10-15 minutes, and I have come out onto the roadside and up by the hospital between Franklin Street and Motueka Street.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got two cop cars blocking the road and down the end of the street heading towards Vanguard. Up Vanguard Street we've got another police car blocking the road there and we have another undercover cop car with some police holding a gun," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson City Council said the incident was causing traffic delays on Waimea Road and surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>The eBus route 3 was being diverted away from Motueka Street and Franklyn Street, it said, and this would likely cause delays on the route for the rest of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Intermediate School says at the request of police, students who usually walk home or do not catch a bus need to be picked up from now from the cul de sac at the end of Tukuka Street.</p>
        
            <p>Tipahi Street in front of the school is closed and whƒÅnau can only access Tukuka Street via Waimea Road, or Tipahi Street via Boundary Road, it says.</p>
        
            <p>Victory Primary School says children from 2.30pm must be picked up by a parent or caregiver and signed out by the teacher.</p>
        
            <p>All children are to be picked up from the school hall and access is only from St Vincent Street.</p>
        
            <p>Kids who usually go to after school care will remain at the hall and be supervised.</p>
        
            <p>Hampton School was waiting for an update from police and asked people not to go to the school to pick up children in the meantime.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson College was doing a staggered release of students and students needed permission to leave school grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Hampden students could be picked up as usual, the school said.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
