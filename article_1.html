            <p>A south Auckland councillor says she will not seek re-election at next year's local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>Angela Dalton said she plans to retire from local politics after five years and serving two terms as Manurewa-Papakura councillor.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton, one of eight women councillors in TƒÅmaki Makaurau, was first elected in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to know when to step aside and let new blood come through with new ideas, perspectives, vision for the next generation," Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have met amazing people throughout my political career."</p>
        
            <p>No stranger to local politics, Dalton served as a community board member with Manukau City Council in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>She was then elected into the Manurewa Local Board in 2010 as deputy chair and took over as the chair from 2012, serving in that role for seven years.</p>
        
            <p>"My proudest wins have been through empowering community to deliver the outcomes they want for their communities by removing the bureaucratic barriers and walking alongside them to create the community they want to live in," she said.</p>
        
            <p>As a councillor, Dalton served in several committees, including currently: as the chair of the community committee and deputy chair for the policy and planning committee, as well as sitting on the southern rural strategy working group.</p>
        
            <p>She said the biggest loss in politics was when politicians cared more about the populist vote for themselves, "more than doing the right thing for their community".</p>
        
            <p>"I have seen policy fail that would have supported my residents to achieve more simply due to others toeing an ideology or political party line."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said she would love to see more women put their name forward for local elections.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe it is important to have a women's voice at the decision-making table.</p>
        
            <p>"I encourage any woman who is interested in serving her community through being an elected member to put her name forward."</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland local body elections will be held on 9 September 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Candidate nominations open on 4 July, and closes on 1 August.</p>
