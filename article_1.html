            <p>The prime minister says he is not interested in "political sideshows," after ACT Party leader David Seymour earned himself a rebuke from Parliament security for attempting to drive a Land Rover up Parliament's steps.</p>
        
            <p>The Land Rover - which also drove up the steps in 1948 - was at Parliament as part of a fund-raising drive for Manaaki Manawa, the Centre for Heart Research, to fund new heart valve devices for children.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour was behind the wheel of the vehicle, and started to drive it up the steps.</p>
        
            <p>A security officer then intervened, telling him the speaker had said he could not drive onto the steps.</p>
        
            <p>The MP said he was not aware the speaker had not given permission, and later defended his actions.</p>
        
            <p>"Do you really believe that there's any danger in somebody driving a Range Rover or a Land Rover a couple of metres up a step? I don't think so."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he was re-enacting the 1948 event for a good cause.</p>
        
            <p>"The only danger that was created was actually from the security guard who put himself in danger, and I had to stop when he put himself in the way of the wheels," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister said it was a matter for Seymour and the Speaker.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just not interested in those political sideshows. I want to get things done. I'm very, very focused on making sure we drive economic growth in this country."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Seymour should have known better, given driving up the steps of Parliament had already been determined to be something MPs were not allowed to do.</p>
        
            <p>"David Seymour has far more important things to be focusing his attention on at the moment than ram-raiding the steps of Parliament," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the speaker said he would be making a statement on the matter "in due course".</p>
