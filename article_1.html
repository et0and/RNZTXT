            <p>This one has the potential to be an absolute shootout, because the Hurricanes have got to where they are on the table by simply trying to score as many points as they possibly can at all times.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Clark Laidlaw's approach seems to be putting as much trust in his young players as possible and it's working, but this week they welcome back some serious firepower in Cam Roigard, Kini Naholo and Du'Plessis Kirifi.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Highlanders were their own worst enemies last weekend in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Tanielu Tele'a, who was a standout so far, is suspended and Jermaine Ainsley is injured. But Ethan de Groot comes back to offset that.</p>
        
            <p>The Canes will need to be on high alert whenever the ball gets near Timoci Tavatavanawai and Jacob Ratumaitavuki-Kneepkens. Kickoff is at 7:05pm.</p>
