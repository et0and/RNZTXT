        <h2>The NZ attitude Luxon says is changing</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon thinks "very deeply" about foreign affairs - here's how he says Kiwis' views are changing.

            <p>Rubbing shoulders with some of the world's most powerful leaders at the White House would leave many politicians awestruck - but not Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ at the end of a whirlwind four days in Washington DC and San Francisco, the prime minister explained the experiences he'd had in his former corporate life have prepared him well for his new one.</p>
        
            <p>After just eight months in the job Christopher Luxon has already visited a handful of countries where he's been welcomed by his counterparts with motorcades and unrivalled pomp and ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>While he says being invited to the White House for dinner was "special" he admitted not being "over-awed by it", because of the similar situations he's found himself in previously.</p>

            <p>Given the rapid pace in which he moved into politics and became prime minister it wouldn't be unusual to be overwhelmed by some parts of the job, but Luxon told RNZ that hadn't been the case.</p>
        
            <p>"I was overseas for 16 years doing a lot of cool things, and having a lot of different experiences as well, and a lot of that has prepared me for this.</p>
        
            <p>Before politics Luxon was chief executive of Air New Zealand and held senior leadership roles at Unilever in Canada and the US.</p>
        
            <p>"I've lived and worked in Five Eyes' countries - it's where my career was built," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if the foreign affairs aspect of the job had been one of the more challenging transitions, Luxon commented his former life meant he was "used to speaking to senior political leaders".</p>
        
            <p>"When you are part of a big global multinational you think very deeply about foreign affairs and national affairs, it's very necessary, so no, that part hasn't been difficult."</p>
        
            <p>It's always been an interest area and he's widely read on it.</p>
        
            <p>While the White House wasn't the 'pinch me' moment it might have been for some, Luxon said the "great American pageantry" of it was "pretty cool to be a part of and witness".</p>
        
            <p>Attending international summits to discuss issues a world away from New Zealand has often fuelled public scepticism about the merit in the prime minister travelling to be there.</p>
        
            <p>But while war and hostility in other parts of the world have often felt foreign to those living in New Zealand, Luxon told RNZ he thinks that's changing.</p>

            <p>"I think people are realising it does matter, because there's no doubt about it, that you're seeing conflicts.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether it's Israel, whether it's Iran, whether it's Ukraine, South China Sea, or North Korea - I think people are registering there's some challenging environments and flashpoints, and I think their literacy of foreign affairs and the intentions within the region, people are understanding."</p>
        
            <p>For Luxon it was useful spending time with leaders of countries who are seeing conflict first-hand, for example Finland, which shares a border with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very real for them, that why they've obviously joined NATO after being neutral for a very long time."</p>
        
            <p>"Japan's Prime Minister Kishida was the same, because his neighbourhood is very tough," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very blessed where we live but we still have some responsibility in the region, as well, to make sure we're standing up for what we should."</p>
        
            <p>"I've been very conscious there are real tensions and Ukraine could happen in East Asia very simply and easily through a miscalculation, a lack of dialogue, or a lack of engagement," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, I've been very attuned to that and getting ahead of it and that reality."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon says having strong work and personal relationships at a bilateral and multilateral level are more crucial than ever in a world where the international rules-based system is under threat.</p>
