            <p>Beekeeping, skink protections, the Aotearoa Afghanistan marathon, unanimous support for a new law, and one woman's journey to London to learn saddlery, are among the latest feel-good stories from RNZ.</p>

            <p>Noel O'Malley travelled from Balclutha to join the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti, because of his belief in its message.</p>
        
            <p>He may look like your average Joe from South Otago - but his name isn't Joe. It's Noel O'Malley, and he's proud to be tangata Tiriti. This week, O'Malley travelled from Balclutha to Christchurch, and then on to Picton to attend the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti. He told RNZ a lot of people would be questioning why he drove the length of the South Island for the kaupapa.</p>
        
            <p>"It's necessary. It's very important," he said. In Balclutha - a town with 4000 people - the presence of Māori was very minimal, he said. He said he was proud of those who did the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very proud to support them."</p>

"When we moved to Bluff Station and they needed a hand with the bees, I was keen to give it a go," Tessa says. "Because I already knew Jono from Taranaki, we worked really well together from the get-go."

            <p>"When we moved to Bluff Station and they needed a hand with the bees, I was keen to give it a go," Tessa says.</p>
        
            <p>Tessa Bryant never thought she'd find herself in the heavy, white folds of a bee suit. But she's been learning all about beekeeping and, in the process, realising she can give anything a go. Trained as a veterinary technician, she found herself working with head beekeeper and family friend Jonathan 'Jono' Clough at Bluff Station. There are 800 hives with a couple of thousand bees in each one.</p>
        
            <p>"Being part of a team environment is so fulfilling. You're in a bee suit, it's hot and sweaty, music blasting. The work is great, but it's the people that make it," Bryant said.</p>

Sophia Stratford's quest to build a better saddle for the horse she loves has led her to the UK, where she is training to become a saddler at Capel Manor College in England.

            <p>Riding a "funny shaped" horse as a teen has led 22-year-old Waikato woman Sophia Stratford to London to learn the ancient craft of saddlery.</p>
        
            <p>"I found it really difficult to get a saddle for him and get it fitted, and one that fitted both of us and I just thought it would be so much easier if I could do it myself," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stratford is now into her second year on a course steeped in history after raising funds, including selling her beloved horse. Stratford said she now spends hours surrounded by leather, cutting and hand-stitching and learning how to make bridle bits.</p>

            <p>Sarah Hillary, Sir Edmund Hillary's daughter, was among more than 200 runners taking part in the Aotearoa Afghanistan Marathon this month. The hilly gravel path was chosen in a bid to recreate the conditions of Afghanistan's Bamyan region - where this marathon originated from - and medals awarded were made from natural gemstones from the country.</p>
        
            <p>Women first joined that marathon in 2015, a standout moment for female participation in public sports within the country. "It was so lovely to have this particular reason for the race, getting the women more freedom," Hillary said.</p>

            <p>A two-and-a-half hectare paddock on a North Canterbury dairy farm was just that - a paddock - until the farmers made an important discovery. The site, part of Pāmu's Eyrewell dairy unit, is now a restoration project which aims to protect the endangered Canterbury Grass Skink.</p>
        
            <p>The Eyrewell skink habitat restoration school day has been running for several years. Local students have planted thousands of natives to support the skinks and a growing number of other native species. This year, they planted 700 trees in one day.</p>

            <p>Members of New Zealand's Samoan Community, including those now eligible for citizenship, came to Parliament to watch the bill pass its third reading.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Teanau Tuiono's Citizenship (Western Samoa) (Restoration) Amendment Bill received unanimous support in Parliament, with 123 votes in favour.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the fix applying only to the elderly, Parliament's public galleries held both infants and elderly great-grandmothers.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the advocacy and activism supporting the Bill's legislative journey was led by young Samoans, including the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who had their citizenship removed back in 1982.</p>
