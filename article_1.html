            <p>The full scale of public sector job cuts is set to be revealed when Finance Minister Nicola Willis lifts the lid on the government's budget.</p>
        
            <p>Willis directed ministries and agencies to slash expenditure by either 6.5 percent or 7.5 percent to help reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Many got to work quickly - already more than 5000 public sector jobs have already gone or are proposed to be cut.</p>
        
            <p>But there is still some way to go, with Willis on Monday unwilling to rule out further job losses beyond the government's "baseline savings exercise".</p>
        
            <p>Of the 37 ministries and departments directed to make savings, 23 have made their plans public - including three which confirmed they were not looking at reducing headcount. Numerous other government organisations have also been cutting back, despite not receiving explicit direction from the minister.</p>
        
            <p>That left 14 organisations, some with thousands of staff, still to reveal how they'll find the money - with many saying that information was "budget sensitive". Soon after Thursday, their plans should become clear.</p>
        
            <p>They may not involve job losses, as savings can be made elsewhere. But so far, most have had to slash jobs to meet their targets.</p>
        
            <p>*Staff numbers are based on Public Service Commission data as at December 2023, and organisations' own websites.</p>
