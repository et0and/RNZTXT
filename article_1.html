        <h2>Wellington suburbs lose water after burst main floods central street</h2>
        <p>
The fix could take until well into the afternoon, Wellington Water is warning, as an outage spreads.
</p>
        
            <p>A burst water main on major traffic route in central Wellington looks set to cause water outages in parts of the city centre and surrounding suburbs for most of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it was a major repair and was expected to take until 5pm to fix.</p>
        
            <p>Some lanes on Kent and Cambridge Terrace are closed, and drivers going to the airport are being warned to go the coastal route through Oriental Bay.</p>
        
            <p>There will likely be water outages today on Courtenay Place, Kent Terrace, Cambridge Terrace and properties around the suburbs of Mount Victoria, Roseneath and Hataitai.</p>

            <p>And all of Hay Street and Telford Terrace off Oriental Parade, about 60 properties, will also likely be without water until after midday on Wednesday, due to a seperate outage.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors were at the scene before 5am on Wednesday, and commuters were warned to take care in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Water was earlier covering nearly three lanes of Kent Terrace and parts of Cambridge Terrace.</p>

            <p>One cyclist told RNZ she became stuck in silt from the flooding on her way to work.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't see the sign, there was no sign to see it and I just thought I was going left instead of straight ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately there was someone there to help me get out of it and they were very helpful."</p>
