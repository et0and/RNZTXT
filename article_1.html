            <p>Broadcaster Peata Melbourne is among this year's recipients of the Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship.</p>
        
            <p>The awards ceremony at Parliament on Thursday included a special tribute to the late Sir Robert 'Bom' Gillies, the last surviving member of the 28th (Māori) Battalion who passed away in November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Scholarship fund board member Dr Reuben Collier described Sir Robert as a lone sentinel, carrying the battallion's mantle and legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"Only last year, he passed away at the ripe age of 99 years young, just short of his hundredth birthday, closing a chapter in New Zealand's war history, but ensuring the battallion's memory lived on."</p>
        
            <p>This year, the 13th intake of scholarship recipients included one doctoral candidate, three masters students, three undergraduate students, and two vocational education and training students. The ceremony also celebrated the winners of the 2024 Ngarimu Video Competition and the inaugural Ngarimu Waiata Composition Competition.</p>
