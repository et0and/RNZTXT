            <p>There will be job losses in Wellington and Picton as work on an axed mega ferry project winds down, KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy says.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail had requested an additional $1.47 billion for the project, a component of which had been agreed to in-principle by the previous government, to address cost escalations related to associated harbourside infrastructure in Wellington and Picton, including to accommodate new larger ferries.</p>
        
            <p>To date, $435.1 million of Crown funding has been assigned for the Inter-Island Resilient Connection (iReX) project of which about $63 million remains.</p>
        
            <p>The project was set to deliver two rail-enabled ferries by 2026, but construction had not yet started on those.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis declined the request for funding and said ministers would engage with the board and officials about alternative options.</p>
        
            <p>She likened the current option to a Ferrari and said "we're going to go off and see whether there are any good reliable Toyota Corollas available".</p>
        
            <p>Reidy told RNZ's Nine to Noon that while there is still some work to be done, they KiwiRail be looking to "demobilise" contractors in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>There was a design team of 50-60 people and 200-300 contractors, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've spoken to the contractors, we've obviously got work to do to close work out, then obviously the contractors are looking to where they can demobilise staff - but there's still work to do.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be work for them for a number of months but of course, that's demobilising the current project. As we look for the new options, we have to do something."</p>
        
            <p>Reidy said KiwiRail respected the government's decision but it was looking for the next option.</p>
        
            <p>They had spent the last 48 hours going through options and there would be a board meeting on Monday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There had been $400 million spent to date on ship design as well as works like upgrading culverts, rental car areas and a passenger walkway in Picton. This money was not lost, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was the infrastructure costs that had blown out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The infrastructure costs have been designed for a 100 year design life, that's three ship cycles, not 10 and not 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, that's a question for New Zealand to be solved. If we don't want the resilience, reliability for 100 years, let's go back to cheapen up the wharf structures - which we're prepared to do but that hasn't been the base assumption because it's been about resilience and reliability across the Cook Strait."</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, the original estimated cost for the two new, larger ferries and the portside infrastructure was $775 million.</p>
        
            <p>Within months of the project being announced, KiwiRail was already asking the government for more money, and the requests have kept coming.</p>
        
            <p>The latest overall cost estimate has quadrupled to almost $3 billion dollars which Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she will not agree to.</p>
