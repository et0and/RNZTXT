        <h2>No beaches should be driven on, councillor says after death</h2>
        <p>
A Porirua councillor says one of their beaches has become a lot safer after banning when residents raised safety concerns.

            <p>Nobody is policing drivers on the beach - and the only way to ensure safety is to close it entirely to vehicles, a Muriwai resident says.</p>
        
            <p>Over the weekend, a young person died and two were injured when a vehicle rolled on Muriwai Beach, at Auckland's west coast. In another incident at Manawat큰's Himatangi Beach, a person was injured after a quad bike incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police had said they were continuing to investigate the Muriwai incident. A witness claims to have seen the vehicle involved "hooning up a storm".</p>
        
            <p>The law states driving on the beach is only allowed for specific activities, such as launching or retrieving a boat or for emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>However, local bylaws mean permits can be issued to allow people to drive on beaches if they stick to safety regulations.</p>
        
            <p>A three-day r훮hui has been placed at Muriwai Beach after Sunday's fatality.</p>
        
            <p>But the community was divided on whether beach access should ever return.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai Community Association co-chair Clare Bradley said cars on the beach was a recipe for disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very much a shared zone. There are still a lot of people who are walking there, picnicking there, fishing there, Bradley said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way vehicles come down onto the beach is at speed and the way they go up the dunes to get back out onto the road has to be at speed in order to get up the sand ramp."</p>
        
            <p>With or without vehicle permits to access the beach, there was not enough resourcing for reinforcement, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"[In Muriwai], people wanting to use vehicles on the beach can apply for a free permit to do that, but nobody polices that.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not monitored, so you can still access the beach whether you've got a permit or not."</p>

            <p>Auckland Council closed Muriwai Beach to vehicles during the summer peak season from 29 December 2023 to 15 January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was working towards making sure beach driving permits were meaningful.</p>
        
            <p>Bradley said council alternatives to monitor those driving along the beach would require a fund which was already short.</p>
        
            <p>"Council is working towards putting in a gate and then there'll be a process by which people who are permitted can access [the beach] through the gate.</p>
        
            <p>"But this is not something that council currently has a budget for. We all know that Auckland Council is under pressure financially."</p>
        
            <p>Councils were just not resourced to monitor drivers, Bradley said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no budget to provide the resource to do that. Working towards that as an answer to providing access to the beach is not really realistic."</p>
        
            <p>Although some groups disagree with banning cars from beaches, she believed the majority of locals were in favour.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a growing view in the community that the best way to address the concerns of pedestrian safety is to close [the beach for vehicles] entirely.</p>
        
            <p>"There will always be people that will be unhappy about that, but in my view, the beach should be closed until there is sufficient budget resource and a procedure that allows limited use for people who have a reason to take their vehicles on the beach."</p>

            <p>On Saturday, six people were involved in a quad bike incident on Himatangi Beach, in Manawat큰, with one of them transferred to the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A resident told RNZ the quad bike was doing doughnuts on the sand when it tipped.</p>
        
            <p>The area allowed four-wheel-drive vehicles without a permit.</p>
        
            <p>Himatangi Beach Community Committee chair Judy Howatson said the incident was not common.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't get a lot of incidents on the beach. The beach access is really good; it's wide enough that people can go well away from the people that are using the recreational areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, you get groups of people that sometimes decide to be a bit silly, and then accidents can happen."</p>
        
            <p>The community supported having a vehicle entrance on the beach, Howatson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like the vehicle access; there's a lot of locals that use vehicle access, whether they're fishing, taking their dogs for a walk, or just spending time with family in a more remote place.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a matter of finding that balance where recreational users can safely use the beach without people being idiots, breaking the rules in their vehicles."</p>

            <p>Since 2021, vehicles have been prohibited from Titahi Bay Beach in Porirua due to safety concerns raised by residents.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua councillor Mike Duncan said the ban had brought peace of mind to those trying to enjoy the space.</p>
        
            <p>"The young families come here and can have a damn good time without the parents having to be worried about where their children are standing and things.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a whole lot safer."</p>
        
            <p>Duncan said more councils should ban vehicles from beach areas.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a hard ask for councillors actually to bring these sorts of bylaws in, because you're on a hiding to nothing. There will be groups in the community who will want it, and there'll be groups who don't.</p>
        
            <p>"But the paramount thing has to be safety. People just need to bite the bullet, do the right thing. And I'd say that there are no beaches around that should be driven on."</p>
        
            <p>Driving on a beach where it was not permitted could result in hefty fines and potential criminal charges.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they worked together with local councils to help ensure safe driving on beaches, particularly during the summer months.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said while they could and did carry out patrols, they could not be everywhere and relied on the community to report any breaches.</p>
        
            <p>"We would advise those considering engaging in this activity to check local bylaws and directions, and remember to obey the road rules when driving on beaches.</p>
        
            <p>"Where possible, take down registration numbers and a description of the driver, which will help police to follow up after the fact if officers are not able to immediately attend."</p>
