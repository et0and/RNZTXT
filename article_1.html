Santa might have good weather to deliver presents on Christmas Eve, but it will be a soggy day for much of NZ afterwards.

            <p>It has been a rainy start to Christmas week so far, and holidaymakers planning outdoor activities are advised to make most of the sunny weather today.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said today's weather is the best pick of the Christmas week, with sunny spells across much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty will mostly be fine today.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne and Hawke's Bay will also mostly be fine today, with isolated showers inland.</p>
        
            <p>The area from Waikato to Wellington will be clearing up today, after yesterday's rain.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, rain is expected on Christmas day, with a cold front bringing rain in the morning along the western half of the South Island, and extending eastwards in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, rain is forecast during the afternoon on Christmas Day for the Western parts, and will reach the rest of the island later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has forecasted that rain is expected to continue over parts of New Zealand on Boxing Day as the low-pressure system moves over the northern areas.</p>
