            <p>The driver of a car that fatally hit a long-serving Nelson police officer early on New Year's Day is expected to face multiple serious charges when he appears in court tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming was one of two officers struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square. She later died from her injuries, while her colleague Adam Ramsey remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Two members of the public were also injured in this incident - one woman received a broken arm and a man who came to assist police was injured in his shoulder. A third police officer was assessed for a concussion and discharged from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming and Ramsey were patrolling the square on foot about 2am, when a vehicle sped towards them and collided with them. The vehicle then turned and drove at a police car, ramming it.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old driver of the vehicle was tasered and arrested at the scene, and is due to appear in Nelson District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said this was a "unprovoked and senseless" attack, and the driver would be charged with "serious criminal offences".</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said other officers and members of the public gave first aid to the injured victims.</p>
        
            <p>He said Fleming was a widely respected police officer with 38 years front-line service.</p>
        
            <p>"My absolute priority is to ensure our people and their families are supported as best they can be, during this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Police Minister Mark Mitchell both paid tribute to Fleming, and Nelson MP Rachel Boyack called the death "devastating news".</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was long involved in local sport and coached netball at Nelson College for Girls. The team paid tribute to "the bedrock of our netball programme for over a decade".</p>
        
            <p>Flowers were laid outside the police station in Albion Square.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Nick Smith said, "I invite Nelsonians to show their support for our police by laying flowers at the flagpole."</p>
