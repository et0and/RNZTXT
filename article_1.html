            <p>Government ministers have pushed back after the Wellington mayor accused them of "punching down" in their recent criticisms of her council.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government yesterday announced plans to appoint a Crown observer at the Wellington City Council, after a string of ministers described it as a "shambles", "shemozzle", and a hot bed of "meddling bureaucracy".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at a media conference yesterday, Wellington mayor Tory Whanau took aim at the coalition partners' use of emotive language, saying "we need assistance, not punching down"].</p>
        
            <p>ACT Party leader David Seymour disputed the mayor's characterisation of his criticisms.</p>
        
            <p>"Frankly, our interest is Wellington ratepayers and Wellington citizens who have been subject to a series of bad decisions," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about a series of poor decisions. That's not a criticism of the people. It's a statement of fact."</p>
        
            <p>Responding to the mayor's comments, NZ First leader and deputy prime minister Winston Peters doubled down.</p>
        
            <p>"If you don't understand how this city used to be, and what a mess it is now, then you're going round with your eyes closed."</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis - one of the first to call the council a "shambles" - offered up a new description on Wednesday afternoon: "Temporarily challenged."</p>
        
            <p>She also offered the suggestion: "Fundamentally good, but having a wobble."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said she simply disagreed that ministers had been punching down.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see it that way. I see it as Wellingtonians crying out for an intervention. I think a large number of Wellingtonians have been frustrated and upset with what's been happening on their council, and as a government, we have an obligation to listen."</p>
        
            <p>Critics of the government's move - including law professor Dean Knight - have described the government's intervention as an "overreach" and pointed out that many councils have problems similar to those in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown told reporters that Wellington was unique due to its "unusual decision" to reverse "such a significant part" of its Long Term Plan, requiring it to be completely rewritten.</p>
        
            <p>"That is very different from what you see with many other councils."</p>
        
            <p>Brown also cited other reasons behind intervention in Wellington, including "behavioural issues", and the council's debt-to-revenue-split for funding infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm the Minister of Local Government today. I'm focused on the situation in front of me. I received advice, and I followed the advice."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said some people had put their names forward to be observer, but he was still awaiting advice from the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it's an important job, particularly around the financials of the council, but there's also an important role to ensure that the council has an independent stream of advice around some of the significant decisions they're making."</p>
