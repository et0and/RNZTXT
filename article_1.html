        <h2>Bird flu outbreak: Don't eat raw eggs, experts warn</h2>
        <p>
It's important eggs aren't eaten raw - they need to be properly cooked, as part of food safety measures, MPI says.

            <p>People using raw eggs in their smoothies, salad dressings or desserts need to think again now that bird flu has been detected.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) has confirmed 80,000 birds will be culled at an Otago farm after an outbreak was announced on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Six other farms in the area are being tested, and a 10km buffer zone had been placed around the infected farm.</p>
        
            <p>Bird flu is not a food safety concern, as long as products such as eggs and any foods containing eggs are properly handled and cooked, MPI says.</p>
        
            <p>Bird flu viruses were killed by cooking, its NZ Food Safety deputy director director Vince Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>"Raw eggs have always been considered a high-risk food. Our advice remains not to consume or serve raw eggs, especially to those with low or compromised immune systems, as the eggs may contain harmful pathogens, including salmonella.</p>
        
            <p>"Our robust food safety system ensures that only healthy animals and eggs enter the food chain, so it's highly unlikely that any infected products will make it into our food supply."</p>
        
            <p>People will not be infected if eggs are thoroughly cooked which means heating food to an internal temperature of:</p>
        
            <p>The advice is not new - it was included in the response to a salmonella outbreak in 2021, a spokesperson told RNZ on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>MPI has a fact sheet about the latest strain of avian influenza here.</p>
        
            <p>An Australian food safety body also advises against the consumption of raw eggs.</p>
        
            <p>They should not be eaten and eggs that are cracked and dirty should also be avoided, the New South Wales Food Authority advises.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, more than one million chickens had to be culled in Victoria after bird flu was detected at seven farms.</p>
        
            <p>The NSW Food Authority says the chance of any poultry products from birds affected by bird flu entering the food chain is very low. This is because of the measures in place to prevent sick animals from entering the food chain.</p>
        
            <p>Also, avian influenza usually stops birds laying eggs, and the few eggs that are laid generally would not get through egg washing and grading because the shells are weak and irregularly shaped.</p>
        
            <p>However, scientific evidence shows the virus responsible for bird flu is killed through careful cooking - it is destroyed at temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>Its advice:</p>
