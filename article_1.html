        <h2>Ministry for the Environment asks for voluntary redundancies</h2>
        <p>
It is the latest in a stream of government ministries cutting staff to save money.

            <p>Hundreds of workers could leave the Ministry for the Environment as part of cost cutting measures, the Public Service Association says.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has called for voluntary redundancies.</p>

            <p>The PSA said the ministry had been told to slash costs by 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Members asked for a voluntary redundancy option, knowing cuts were coming, but job cuts were short-sighted, the union said.</p>
        
            <p>It said the government was prioritising tax cuts despite the ministry's "vitally important role".</p>
        
            <p>Ministry deputy secretary of business transformation and services Laura Dixon said "expressions of interest" for voluntary redundancies from permanent staff had been called for on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Dixon said the government was looking to find $1.5 billion in savings - and like other government departments, the Ministry for the Environment had also been asked to find savings.</p>
        
            <p>"While the impact of the savings exercise on our work programme and jobs won't be clear until after Budget 2024 on 30 May, we know our organisation will need to reduce in size. Staff have been told redundancies are likely.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry began an operating model review in June 2023 - in part to prepare for a predicted decline in in our baseline over the next few years, as time limited funding for a range of reforms ended. As part of this we reshaped the organisation around our core functions, and identified new ways of working, systems and processes. We also put in recruitment controls, and reduced the size of our tier 2 and 3 leadership cohort by more than 20 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"From today, staff will have the opportunity to submit an expression of interest (EOI) for voluntary redundancy, before a likely formal change proposal and consultation process later this year."</p>
        
            <p>Dixon said staff could submit their interest until midday on 19 April. There was no "specific target" in mind and the leadership team had full discretion over whether it accepted an EOI or not.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge this is a challenging time for our people. Our goal is to keep them informed and supported throughout the upcoming change," Dixon said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, about 30 scientist and engineer jobs at Callaghan Innovation could be axed to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>The research organisation's board said it was refocusing on helping New Zealand businesses by helping to turn their science, technology and innovation into increased profits.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, it said about 30 full time equivalent roles in its Innovation Expertise Hapu could be affected.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation with scientists and engineers is now underway, with a final decision expected in May or June.</p>
