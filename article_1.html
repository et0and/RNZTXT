            <p>Most council-run New Year's Eve celebrations are going ahead Sunday night, despite bad weather forecast for many areas.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, the city council is still planning on holding its waterfront event, despite high winds which have seen several flights cancelled or unable to land.</p>
        
            <p>Covers band Zephyr will be on stage at Whairepo Lagoon to start the festivities at 8pm. There will be a kids' countdown and short burst of fireworks at 9:30pm and the night and year will end with a larger fireworks display at midnight.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity in Auckland will welcome in 2024 with its annual midnight fireworks from the tower. There will be a 10-second countdown which will be projected onto the base of the tower, followed by a laser light and animation show, reflecting the 19 iwi of the region.</p>
        
            <p>The display will last for five minutes and 30 seconds and feature 500 kilograms of pyrotechnics.</p>
        
            <p>However, in Tauranga, thecity council said on Saturday it had made the decision to cancel five New Year's Eve community celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Fireworks displays planned there for 9:30 and midnight are still on schedule.</p>
        
            <p>A Queenstown bar manager said that town will be pumping this New Year's Eve, despite the blustery weather.</p>
        
            <p>White hospitality group operations manager David Dwyer said the wind is due to die down this afternoon, and they are expecting big numbers through their handful of venues this evening.</p>
        
            <p>He said the madness kicks off around 10pm with punters vying for a spot at Public Bar on the waterfront to watch the midnight fireworks, which is always a spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>Dwyer said his team will be closing the doors soon after that, to give staff a well-deserved rest to kick off the new year.</p>
        
            <p>In Gisborne, one business said the town is busy with festival-goers at the iconic Rhythm and Vines festival, which is held over three days at Waiohika Estate, north-east of Gisborne city.</p>
        
            <p>Sarah Scott, manager at coffee company Raglan Roast, said their two locations had been slammed with customers, and the beaches were packed as temperatures hit the high 20s.</p>
        
            <p>Scott said it was great to see the town busy again after a tough year. They should stay busy for the rest of January as holidaymakers flock to the town following the festival, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The police are also promising to have a strong presence across the country.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement police said that "while they encourage people to enjoy themselves at celebrations, partygoers should be sensible and look after their mates to ensure everyone gets home safely".</p>
        
            <p>If anyone feels unsafe or is worried about dangerous, illegal or suspicious behaviour, they should phone 111.</p>
