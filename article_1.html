            <p>Dozens of firefighters are battling a fire at a large commercial building in Hamilton, reportedly a car mechanic.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) sent 12 fire trucks and 35 firefighters to extinguish the blaze on Ellis Street, Frankton.</p>
        
            <p>A FENZ spokesperson said it was too early to determine the cause. The street was closed and people in neighbouring areas had been evacuated.</p>

            <p>A Frankton business owner said its staff were evacuated after the fire broke out.</p>
        
            <p>Jamin from iPlumber said their receptionist called FENZ about 11:30am after noticing Frankton Motor across the road on Ellis Street was on fire.</p>
        
            <p>"She called the fire trucks and they took about 10 minutes to get there. We just saw the smoke and it went up pretty quick. The sign burnt out the front and flames started coming up through the roof in about five or 10 minutes and the smoke got a lot thicker.</p>

            <p>"Surrounding businesses came out onto the street wondering, 'What the hell is going on here?' That's not good for a Monday".</p>
        
            <p>He said FENZ and police made sure everyone in the area got out.</p>
