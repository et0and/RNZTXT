            <p>A controversial backyard structure in South Auckland has been taken down after complaints about safety from neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>The structure in Ōtara - which stood multiple storeys high - appeared to be made by hand out of wood and scrap metal.</p>
        
            <p>The building, dubbed the 'Tower of Ōtara' by locals, was pulled down by contractors on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said at least five skip bins full of material from the structure and nearly a dozen men in hi-vis vests were outside the property.</p>
        
            <p>Workers at Mayfield Superette, across the road from the tower, said they were very pleased to see it gone.</p>
        
            <p>They said contractors began dismantling the structure on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council received two complaints about the property at the beginning of May.</p>
        
            <p>Council compliance officers conducted a site visit and assessed the unconsented structure, which was unstable and not built to code.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the councils' opinion that the structure meets the definition of a dangerous building under the Building Act 2004," the council said.</p>

            <p>The council's compliance unit initially ordered the structured to be removed by 27 May.</p>
        
            <p>"This was subsequently extended to June 7 2024 to allow Kāinga Ora to work through the necessary processes to have the structure removed safely, with consideration for the welfare of the tenant," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora - which has been carrying out the process to remove the tower - also had a representative at the scene who said the man who constructed the tower was not present while the dismantling took place.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown agency has been approached for comment.</p>
