            <p>Forty-five people have died in South Africa after the bus they were in plunged some 50 metres off a bridge into a ravine, authorities say.</p>
        
            <p>An 8-year-old girl, the only survivor, was taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The bus crashed through a barrier and caught fire when it hit the ground in the north-eastern Limpopo province.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers were pilgrims travelling from Botswana's capital Gaborone to an Easter service in the town of Moria.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle lost control and went off a bridge on the Mmamatlakala mountain pass between Mokopane and Marken, around 300 kilometres north of Johannesburg, according to South African public broadcaster SABC.</p>
        
            <p>Rescue operations went on late into Thursday evening, with some of those killed reportedly hard to reach amid the debris.</p>

            <p>Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga, who went to the scene of the incident, extended her "heartfelt condolences to the families affected by the tragic bus crash".</p>
        
            <p>She said the South African government would help repatriate the bodies and hold a full inquiry into the cause of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this difficult time," she added.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to urge responsible driving at all times with heightened alertness as more people are on our roads this Easter weekend."</p>
        
            <p>South Africa has a poor road safety record.</p>
        
            <p>In an Easter message released earlier in the day, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged citizens to "do our best to make this a safe Easter".</p>
        
            <p>It should "not be a time where we sit back and wait to see statistics on tragedy or injuries on our roads", he added.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
