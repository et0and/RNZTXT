        <h2>Running against Hana-Rāwhiti? Māori Queen says 'good luck'</h2>
        <p>
Labour has ruled out any Epsom-style deals with Te Pāti Māori ahead of the next election.
</p>
        
            <p>By Mata with Mihingarangi Forbes </p>
        
            <p>Labour has ruled out any "sweetheart" or Espom-style deals with Te Pāti Māori ahead of the next election.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition parties are polling ahead of the government coalition, but the potential allies will still battle it out in the seven Māori seats</p>
        
            <p>Willie Jackson, who chairs Labour's Māori election campaign, says they're "absolutely" committed to giving voters options, and that his party has history and whakapapa in the Māori electorates.</p>
        
            <p>"You recall when Winston took all the seats in '96, they all came back to Labour in '99."</p>
        
            <p>He told Mata with Mihingarangi that he expects to win a few Māori seats - "Cushla Tangaere is doing fabulously well down the Coast" and "we've had huge interest" in standing in other six seats.</p>
        
            <p>But he admits, one contest is posing a problem: who should take on Te Pāti Māori's Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke?</p>
        
            <p>Maipi-Clarke, who was elected in Hauraki-Waikato 2023, at just 21-years of age, gained international attention after a video of her leading a haka in Parliament and tearing up a copy of the Treaty Principles Bill made headlines around the world.</p>
        
            <p>And, according to Willie, she's "flying".</p>
        
            <p>"Every seat apart from Tainui I've got big interest, and I'm really pleased about that."</p>
        
            <p>He even raised the issue with the Māori Queen, Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po at Te Matatini in Taranaki, asking if she had anyone who could stand against her in the Hauraki-Waikato electorate. "I need someone to go against our Hana" he told her at lunch.</p>
        
            <p>According to Willie Jackson the reply was succinct: "Good luck".</p>
