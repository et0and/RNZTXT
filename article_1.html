            <p>A court in Florence has reconvicted Amanda Knox for slander, years after she was acquitted of murdering her British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>Knox will not go to prison as she has already served four years for the murder, for which she was originally convicted.</p>
        
            <p>At the time she was also convicted of slander for blaming the murder on local bar owner Patrick Lumumba during police interrogation, but that conviction was quashed last year and a retrial ordered.</p>

            <p>Amanda Knox is back in court: What you need to know</p>
        
            <p>Knox's lawyers have said they expect to appeal against the latest verdict.</p>
        
            <p>They added that Knox was disappointed as she was hoping to finally clear her name after years of legal battles.</p>

            <p>She told the court on Wednesday that police had coerced her into implicating Lumumba.</p>
        
            <p>"The police threatened me with 30 years in prison, an officer slapped me three times saying 'Remember, remember'," Knox, 36, said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very sorry that I wasn't strong enough to withstand the pressure from the police," she added, speaking in Italian.</p>

            <p>"I never wanted to slander Patrick. He was my friend, he took care of me and consoled me for the loss of my friend (Meredith). I'm sorry I wasn't able to resist the pressure and that he suffered."</p>
        
            <p>Lumumba was arrested in connection with the 2007 murder and spent two weeks behind bars, but was released without charge after a customer gave him an alibi.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, his lawyers said the case has affected his reputation, and that he "became known everywhere as the monster of Perugia".</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer told reporters outside the courthouse before the hearing: "He lost his job, had his bar seized for months, and had to return to Poland, because his wife was Polish."</p>
        
            <p>Lumumba was not in court.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing was held behind closed doors, and audio and video recording was prohibited.</p>
        
            <p>Knox was famously tried, convicted and later acquitted for the murder of 21-year-old student Kercher, originally from south London.</p>
        
            <p>Knox and Kercher were both language exchange students sharing a house in the university town of Perugia in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>Kercher, 21, was found dead in their house. Her throat had been cut and she had been sexually assaulted.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was the subject of global media interest because prosecutors argued that Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Knox, her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and a third person called Rudy Guede were convicted of murder and sexual violence in December 2009 and jailed. Knox was convicted of slandering Lumumba in 2011.</p>
        
            <p>But the same year, a jury freed Knox and Sollecito on appeal after doubts emerged over forensic evidence used against them, and Knox returned to the US after spending four years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>The duo's guilty verdicts were reinstated in 2014 then ultimately overturned in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Knox is now married with two young children, and is a campaigner for criminal justice reform. She returned to Italy five years ago to address a conference on wrongful conviction, where she spoke of the pain of being tried by the media.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was also the subject of a Netflix documentary in 2016, and Knox also published a memoir about her time in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Sollecito has kept a low-profile since his release. In 2017, he told the BBC that the case had left him in debt.</p>
        
            <p>Guede - a Perugian resident originally from the Ivory Coast - was linked to the scene by DNA evidence and is the only person whose conviction for Kercher's murder was upheld. He was released early in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
