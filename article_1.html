            <p>A&P Society president and pig race commentator Richard Dampney said it was the show's biggest crowd in many years.</p>

            <p>Other attractions included horse events, shearing competitions, dog trials, the Northland Gumboot Throwing Championships, animal displays, and free tours of the nearby Ng훮wh훮 geothermal power station.</p>
        
            <p>Showgrounds entry and all rides were free for children aged 14 and under, to give families an affordable and fun day out.</p>

            <p>Three pig races were held during the day with eight piglets, each wearing a numbered bib, vying for glory on a circular track featuring ramp and tunnel obstacles.</p>
        
            <p>The final race also featured piglets named after Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, Labour leader Chris Hipkins and Greens co-leader James Shaw, but on the final straight they were no competition for coalition partners Seymour and Jones.</p>
