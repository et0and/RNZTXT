            <p>"We got here yesterday, heard about all this, we were invited, and thought, 'yes!'</p>
        
            <p>"To see this many people come together and be unified is such a beautiful thing. Everyone here is so filled with the spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"It's moving. I wasn't expecting it to be as moving as it was.</p>
        
            <p>"It's my first time here, and to go from zero to a million like this."</p>
        
            <p>O'Brien was seen learning and practising some haka skills and being coached by Waititi, among others.</p>
