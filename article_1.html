        <h2>Hundreds of jobs could go under proposed Timaru meatworks closure</h2>
        <p>
Declining sheep processing numbers were blamed for the proposed closure of the plant, which employs more the 600 people.

            <p>Alliance Group has announced a proposal to close its Smithfield meatworks in Timaru.</p>
        
            <p>It told workers consultation would run until 11 October and a final decision was expected to be made by 18 October.</p>
        
            <p>If the closure went ahead, Alliance said wherever possible it would offer workers the opportunity to apply for re-deployment at the company's other plants.</p>
        
            <p>However it anticipated there would be a significant number of redundancies.</p>

            <p>The lamb processing season finished at the Smithfield plant on Wednesday. Venison processing was still running, but workers were told there were no shifts on Friday and to attend the meeting instead.</p>
        
            <p>Alliance chief executive Willie Wiese said a decline in sheep processing numbers was behind the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"This proposal aims to align our operations with current livestock availability, ensuring we have the right scale and cost structure to meet future demands as a leading red meat processor.</p>
        
            <p>"We simply cannot maintain excess processing capacity when livestock numbers don't support it.

            <p>"By optimising our capacity to match livestock flows, we can position ourselves for long-term success and reduce our cost base. We simply cannot maintain excess processing capacity when livestock numbers don't support it."</p>
        
            <p>One of the Alliance workers, Clint Agnew, started work at the plant 20 years ago and said staff were not given the chance to ask questions at Friday morning's meeting. Agnew was annoyed and upset about the proposal to close the meatworks.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling a bit torn up really, a bit emotional and yeah, a bit sad. Luckily I'm venison so I don't finish until December, but by then a lot of jobs will be taken because all the other fellas will go out and have found it."</p>
        
            <p>Agnew said it was hard to find work in Timaru, but he would stay in the town.</p>

            <p>The 139-year-old Smithfield plant was the company's oldest site and required significant investment in repairs and maintenance to keep it operational. It was also facing encroachment from retail development.</p>
        
            <p>"We know our people at Smithfield, their colleagues and the local community will be devastated by this proposal," Wiese said.</p>
        
            <p>"Smithfield has a long and proud history, having been part of Alliance's network for more than 30 years. Our priority is to support affected employees during this immensely difficult period. We will also work closely with local authorities and support agencies and ensure the local community is informed, supported, and included in discussions."</p>
        
            <p>Alliance reported a loss before tax of $97.9 million for the year ending September 2023. This loss was largely due to weakening global markets, changing land use that has resulted in lower livestock volumes, and inflationary pressures.</p>

            <p>On Thursday, the company announced a surprise meeting would be held at 11am on Friday. The company would not say in advance what it was about.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the meeting, Timaru Mayor Nigel Bowen said the plant employed more than 600 people at peak season, and workers were going into the meeting with a lot of questions.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of concern for those workers that are affected. There's been rumours for some time now around possible changes, potential closure, so I guess one thing that is positive is that affected parties will have that confirmed in one way or another."</p>
        
            <p>Bowen said a closure would be significant for the region, given the large number of staff and supporting trades it would affect.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been talking, certainly, with agencies, Chamber of Commerce, economic development, and certainly there'll be as much support as possible wrapped around anyone if there is any closure of sorts," he said.</p>
