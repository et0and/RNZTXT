            <p>The director of an asbestos removal and labour hire company has been jailed for what a judge called the "worst of its kind" tax offending.</p>
        
            <p>Melanie Jill Tatana, also known as Melanie Jill Smith, was sentenced in the Christchurch District Court on 30 October and jailed for three years for what the Judge described as a case involving the wilful diversion of funds rather than business insolvency.</p>
        
            <p>Tatana ran Asia Pacific Group Limited (APG), employing around 60 people and was required to deduct PAYE from workers' wages and pay it to Inland Revenue.</p>
        
            <p>On 63 occasions between August 2019 and September 2022 APG failed to pay the full amounts of $1,602,864.17.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, Tatana was charged with 63 counts of aiding and abetting APG to knowingly take PAYE from workers' wages and not pay it on to Inland Revenue.</p>
        
            <p>An analysis of APG's bank accounts showed that more than $800,000 had been diverted for Tatana's personal use.</p>
        
            <p>Further significant funds had been diverted to Tatana's personal bank account and her daughter's bank account which Tatana was also using.</p>
        
            <p>Tatana was sentenced to three years behind bars.</p>
        
            <p>District Court Judge Michael Crosbie said the offending was the worst of its kind to come before the Christchurch District Court in the last 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>The firm also received more than $2.2 million dollars in Covid-19 wage subsidies, along with $107,500.00 in governmental resurgence support payments, between April and May 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Tatana was the sole director at the time of the offending, was the signatory on the bank accounts and dealt with Inland Revenue in relation to PAYE debt.</p>
        
            <p>She was given several warnings, but the non-payment continued and in May 2021 she was told APG was under investigation for failure to pay PAYE.</p>
        
            <p>The judge agreed with Inland Revenue that there was a lack of remorse shown by Tatana and pointed to the need for his sentence to denounce and deter behaviour of this kind.</p>
        
            <p>He also noted that if everyone had done what Tatana did, we would be in state of chaos.</p>
