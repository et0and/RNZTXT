            <p>A man has been charged with the murder of woman on a bus in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old is facing charges including murder, threatening to kill, assault and burglary.</p>
        
            <p>He will appear in the Auckland District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Alisse Robertson said police will continue to be visible at transport hubs across Auckland this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport has also announced that extra transport officers have been deployed to the route the bus was taking when the incident unfolded on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>There was no single quick fix to ensure travellers' safety but Auckland Transport was taking action across the board, its director of public transport and active modes, Stacey van der Putten said.</p>
        
            <p>Maungakiekie-TƒÅmaki Local Board chair Maria Meredith told Morning Report the Onehunga community has been on edge as of after another death in the Auckland suburb in August.</p>
        
            <p>There was relief in the community that a man had handed himself in to police regarding the incident, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, officers working on the inquiry would still like to hear from anyone who witnessed the attack.</p>
