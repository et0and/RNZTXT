            <p>A Canterbury man taking his battle over a $40 fine to court said it's not about the money.</p>
        
            <p>Rolleston's John Boulton was surprised to receive the ticket last August for parking on the grass berm outside his house.</p>
        
            <p>He said he's been parking there for the last five years and had no idea it wasn't allowed.</p>
        
            <p>His case against the Selwyn District Council at the Christchurch District Court today is a matter of principle, and to raise awareness about the bylaw, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The council argued parking rules keep people safe and reduced costs for ratepayers in case there is damage to the berm or underground infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Boulton disputed this, saying there was no footpath on his side of the road, so nothing to block, and that council infrastructure like pipes and cables were in the middle of the street.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged the area is council land, but said when his family moved in, it was just bare dirt.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no lawn or anything. We planted the grass seed, fertilised it, watered it, maintained it and looked after it."</p>
        
            <p>He also took issue with the width of the streets.</p>
        
            <p>"Once you've got two vehicles on the road, you narrow the road down to 2.6m of clear roadway. If a truck of legal width came down there, that'd give them 100mm."</p>
        
            <p>He said he would have copped a warning, but leaping straight to a fine - and what he felt was the council's intransigence - had resulted in the court stand off.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about the money, it's about their reason and they way they've done it."</p>
        
            <p>"They've said 'it's the bylaw that came in in 2009, just pay it'. I said I'm not paying it, and they said I could take it to court then, and here were are."</p>
        
            <p>Boulton, who is representing himself, said he's had an "overwhelming" amount of support from the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had probably 15 or 20 people come up to me and say thank you, we wish we'd done that too."</p>
        
            <p>"The best part of it is, I've opened it up and let a lot of people know about this bylaw that nobody knew about."</p>
