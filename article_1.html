            <p>The three Chinese navy ships in the Tasman Sea have moved slightly closer to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The ships have been sailing in international waters off Australia's east coast and conducting live firing exercises, causing trans-Tasman flights to divert.</p>
        
            <p>The fleet consists of the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class cruiser Zunyi and the Fuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu.</p>
        
            <p>Australian aviation officials have revealed they first learnt of a potential Chinese "live fire" military exercise in the Tasman Sea last week after a Virgin Airlines pilot relayed warnings he had picked up mid-flight via an emergency radio frequency, ABC reports.</p>
        
            <p>An Emirates flight from Sydney to Christchurch was directly warned by the Chinese military to avoid airspace on Friday morning, before Chinese vessels were believed to have conducted live fire exercises.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the Defence Force said the ships were sitting 280 nautical miles east of Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>It now says they are 218 nautical miles east of Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force is working with its Australian counterpart to monitor the ships.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins on Monday said the warships presence in the Tasman Sea was "unusual" but nothing Kiwis need to be worried about.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand did sometimes send ships through the contested Taiwan Strait, between rivals Taiwan and China - but Collins said they never carried out live-fire exercises.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the advice she had received was that none of the Chinese vessels were nuclear-powered, but "the weapons they have are extremely capable".</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said China did not inform New Zealand before carrying out a live-fire drill on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Sunday, China's Ministry of National Defence spokesperson Wu Qian accused Australia of "deliberately hyping up" the live-fire exercises.</p>
        
            <p>Qian said China had given notice in advance, complied with international law, and did not affect aviation safety.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is due to arrive in Beijing for a 48-hour visit and is expected to raise the issue during talks with China Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
