        <h2>NZ approach to cutting emissions criticised by climate researchers</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand will need to spend billions on projects cutting emissions in other countries to make up for what the Climate Change Commission says was a late start to cutting greenhouse gases at home.

            <p>New Zealand has been criticised by non-profit group Climate Action Tracker in its annual report on climate action.</p>
        
            <p>Along with Japan and South Korea, New Zealand was singled out for its heavy reliance on buying carbon offsets from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand diplomats are at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, debating the rules for making these deals.</p>
        
            <p>Talks over carbon trading between nations have had a rather low profile at this year's summit, relative to issues such as whether to "phase out" or "phase down" fossil fuels, and finance for countries hit by climate change.</p>
        
            <p>But the emerging rules governing international carbon trading are critical to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>According to Treasury, New Zealand is going to need to spend billions on projects cutting emissions in other countries, to make up for what the Climate Change Commission says was a late start to cutting greenhouse gases at home.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is not the only one shopping for credits on the international market - Switzerland and others are already cutting deals.</p>
        
            <p>But with about two-thirds of our 2030 target expected to come from overseas, NZ is unusually reliant on trading.</p>
        
            <p>Non-profit watchdog Carbon Markets Watch global markets expert Gilles Dufrasne has been following the negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>The message to countries like New Zealand was to only use credits as a short-term gap-filler, not a substitute for cutting our own emissions, he said. Trading credits should not be seen as a long-term strategy, he said.</p>
        
            <p>International trading could encompass almost any kind of action, he said, from cutting emissions from rice paddies to electric buses, to planting trees or adding solar farms.</p>
        
            <p>Whether or not it includes promising not to do something - to not exploit oil reserves, or cut down trees, for example - is a matter of hot debate.</p>
        
            <p>Under the rules, countries will need to show the climate benefits are truly additional to what the host country was doing anyway - for example, that a project wouldn't be financed without carbon credits, and that the country's laws don't require the action to happen anyway.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Paris Agreement, there are two ways to trade credits: two-way deals between countries, or buying from a centralised global market supervised by the United Nations.</p>
        
            <p>The global market is not yet operating, but bilateral deals are possible now.</p>
        
            <p>Dufrasne said the global market would be more stringent, with requirements for projects to be signed off by the host country and registered with a UN body.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a built-in complaints mechanism, so environmental groups or indigenous people in the host country can complain if a project has damaging effects.</p>
        
            <p>With bilateral deals "it's up to the buyer to say that they want this thing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was crucial New Zealand wrote its own safeguards into any deals, making sure they were transparent, genuine, and did not trample on indigenous rights, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Official briefings show New Zealand has been exploring partnerships, despite nothing being sealed.</p>
        
            <p>There's also a separate voluntary carbon market, for companies wanting to make claims that a product or business is carbon neutral or lower-carbon.</p>
        
            <p>Toitu Envirocare chief scientist Belinda Mathers said it was not clear yet how these fit with the country's rules.</p>
        
            <p>While two countries cannot count the same project towards meeting their national targets, she said it was less clear what happened when a private company paid for credits.</p>
        
            <p>Rules against so-called double counting are a feature of discussions, but it is not yet settled whether they apply to companies making claims about their products outside of the Paris Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Mathers said businesses at the summit wanted certainty, but it was too soon to say how much would be achieved before it ends next week.</p>
        
            <p>Climate minister Simon Watts flies to the summit today, and said he would be monitoring carbon market negotiations along with other negotiations in which New Zealand had an interest.</p>
