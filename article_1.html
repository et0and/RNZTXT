            <p>A Wellington wastewater treatment plant is breaching consent with a foul odour after a biofilter media was changed.</p>
        
            <p>The Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) has received 43 complaints so far in November around the awful stench coming from the Seaview wastewater treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>Environment group manager Lian Butcher said operator Veolia New Zealand carried out a pre-planned biofilter media replacement on 14 November, "a mechanism designed to help reduce odour levels, which in turn helps ensure compliance with the plant operator's consent conditions".</p>
        
            <p>"While the biofilter media is being replaced, the plant operator is not consented to discharge offensive or objectionable odour beyond its boundary."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water, Veolia New Zealand and Hutt City Council had also received complaints.</p>
        
            <p>Butcher said the GWRC was aware Wellington Water and Hutt City Council notified the public about plans to replace the filters.</p>
        
            <p>They will be holding a public meeting on Wednesday at 5.30pm at Pelorus Sports House at Hutt Park to discuss the odour levels.</p>
