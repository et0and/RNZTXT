The track to the popular attraction has been closed since February 2023, and DOC workers keep having to down tools to deal with "absolutely idiotic" tourists, says Deli Connell. Audio

            <p>Wayward visitors wombling onto the closed Cathedral Cove track are getting in the way of contractors and slowing down repairs.</p>
        
            <p>The track to the popular tourist attraction on the Coromandel Peninsula has been closed since February 2023 after it was badly damaged in extreme weather events, including Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>A report subsequently showed up to 180 landslips along the 3.8km of tracks around the cove and debris up to the size of a kayak.</p>
        
            <p>The closure means the hugely popular attraction can only be accessed from the sea.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation contractors had aimed to finish the repair work by the end of the year, but had suffered a few unwelcome interruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Thames Coromandel District councillor Deli Connell told Checkpoint that some people were "a little bit entitled" and there had been up to 10 people a day wandering along the closed track.</p>
        
            <p>The contractors had been "absolutely fantastic", and took their work very seriously, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But if somebody does womble - as you say - onto the track, they have to down tools immediately, and get rid of them."</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint host Lisa Owen asked whether the visitors did not realise the track was closed, or were simply ignoring the signs?</p>
        
            <p>Connell said her local contacts had been imploring visitors not to use the track while it was under repair.</p>
        
            <p>"People were making comments along the lines of, 'I've travelled 11,000km to do this, so off I go.'"</p>
        
            <p>Tourist operators were providing access to the world-famous spot via sea, and visitors could take photos that way, she said.</p>
        
            <p>DOC workers were focused on their work, and it was "just not fair" to put them under unnecessary stress, Connell added.</p>
        
            <p>The local community was "so frustrated" about their behaviour, because it might delay the reopening of the track in time for the peak summer season.</p>
        
            <p>"We had Covid, we had [Cyclone] Gabrielle. The same year as Gabrielle, we had five other heavy weather events. ... Our small businesses have had it really tough. None of them are Elon Musk. They're all sitting there, relying on the tourist dollar to feed their families during the winter."</p>
        
            <p>Visitors had called local accommodation providers to ask if the Cove was open, and when told it was not, they did not make a booking.</p>
        
            <p>Rather than choose a sea kayak or boat operator, for some people there was a "badge of honour" for having walked the track, Connell said.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think it's a sense of entitlement: 'This is something I want to tick off my bucket list - and I'm not prepared to wait'."</p>
        
            <p>Locals thought they were "absolutely idiotic - and potentially ruining it for everybody else", she said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, DOC Hauraki-Waikato-Taranaki regional director Tinaka Mearns said work to restore walking access to Cathedral Cove was being hampered by a number of people each day who were putting themselves and others at risk by attempting to access the closed track.</p>
        
            <p>"DOC staff and contractors turn away dozens of visitors every day. Continuing to stop work and redirect people away from the site slows progress and may result in someone being hurt.</p>
        
            <p>"DOC is working at pace to restore access to stunning Mautohe Cathedral Cove and we ask that people support this important mahi by giving workers space to get the job done. Thank you to the many people who are showing patience and good sense by staying away. To continue to help us please encourage others to do the same."</p>
