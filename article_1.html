        <h2>Mongrel Mob member's rēwana bread helping feed hungry whānau</h2>
        <p>
Support from the community will see 20 loaves of Vonz Kaukau's bread added to an Upper Hutt foodbank ahead of Christmas.
</p>
        
            <p>A Mongrel Mob member, whose rēwana bread business has taken off on social media, has been flat out baking bread for a foodbank so whānau do not go hungry over Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>His story touched Upper Hutt resident Anna McMartin, who said when she read about Vonz Kaukau's business earlier this month, it struck a chord with her.</p>
        
            <p>She created a Facebook post to see if any of her friends wanted to join her in buying Kaukau's rēwana bread and taking it to the Martin Street foodbank.</p>
        
            <p>"So I put my post out, but it ended up absolutely going off and there was just this overwhelming outpouring of support for Vonz and for the foodbank and people just really got into it."</p>
        
            <p>She said in the first day, she had received about $1000 which would help go towards supporting the foodbank for weeks or even months.</p>
        
            <p>"At that point, I thought, 'wow this is really big'. Need to get some process around this, some admin around this, so I'm actually working through all the offers that have come in, still working that out."</p>

            <p>On Friday, Kaukau made 10 loaves of rēwana bread. He plans to do another 10 on Monday just in time for Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>He works from home and uses a standard household oven.</p>
        
            <p>When McMartin got in touch with Kaukau about her goal, he was onboard with the idea, saying being able to contribute meant a great deal to him - especially because he knew what it was like to struggle.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been in this situation and like this time of the year, it just feels good to give back, to do something right and give back to the ones that need it."</p>
        
            <p>Kaukau had been overwhelmed with the response since his story came out.</p>
        
            <p>"I was quite surprised. I jumped on my daughter's Facebook and she showed me how much support that I have from the community, towards the kaupapa that I'm on, that's to supporting our people in need."</p>

            <p>He said he planned to keep up the mahi around helping those who are struggling.</p>
        
            <p>"Not just the food bank, anyone else that needs help like next year. ... That's what I'm all about anyways because I know how hard it is."</p>
        
            <p>McMartin planned to transport all the bread herself and said it was no problem to her.</p>
        
            <p>"Why would you not? It's just such a cool opportunity to support someone's business and support the foodbank. It's no hardship at all and in fact, people have volunteered to help me with the transporting as things get bigger, so I reckon it's all going to fall into place,"</p>
        
            <p>Both Kaukau and McMartin were hoping the rēwana bread would help make someone's Christmas a little bit brighter.</p>
