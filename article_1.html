            <p>About 14 homes are still without power in Peraki Bay in Banks Peninsula, after torrential rains and gale-force winds lashed Canterbury overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain and strong wind watches are in place for parts of Canterbury north of the Rakaia River and the Kaikōura coast to Seddon until 11am.</p>
        
            <p>MetService says the rainfall has caused surface flooding on some southern slopes of Banks Peninsula, but the rain started to ease about 3.30am on Wednesday.</p>
