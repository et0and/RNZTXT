            <p>Police have issued a fresh appeal for information about the death of Baby Ru.</p>
        
            <p>The toddler died just days shy of his second birthday on 22 October last year.</p>
        
            <p>Three adults known to Baby Ru are considered persons of interest in the homicide probe.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said police were continuing to investigate the boy's death, the result of blunt force trauma, in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>"He would have turned two a few days after his death, but instead of celebrating his birthday, whƒÅnau were grieving and preparing for his tangi," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation team remains absolutely committed to getting justice for Baby Ru and holding the person or persons responsible to account."</p>
        
            <p>We are continuing to engage with them, in an effort to establish exactly what took place at the Lower Hutt property prior to Baby Ru's death, and in the days following."</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard thanked everyone who had provided information to police as a result of previous appeals</p>
        
            <p>"Every piece of information, no matter how small, is valuable and helps us build a picture of what occurred before and after Baby Ru's death.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who has information that could help the investigation team is urged to do the right thing by Baby Ru, and contact Police quoting file number 231022/1708."</p>
