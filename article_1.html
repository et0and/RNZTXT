            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand and the Coastguard will receive a funding boost of $63.6 million over four years, the government has announced.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Transport Minister Simeon Brown, Associate Minister Matt Doocey outlined the new funding as part of a pre-Budget announcement this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has a tragically high drowning toll, and this government is committed to investing in these frontline organisations so they continue their work saving hundreds of lives each year and ensuring thousands of people return home safe after a day at the beach or on the water," Doocey said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said lifeguards and Coastguard were at the frontline of efforts to reduce the country's high drowning toll.</p>
        
            <p>"Costs are rising across the board for these largely volunteer-driven organisations. The funding will cover operational expenses for both organisations as well as rescue equipment, facilities and maintenance."</p>
        
            <p>There were around 4500 lifeguards, Brown said, and the extra funding would help with training and gear as well as the upkeep of their buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard rescued more than 6000 people who got into trouble on the water annually and needed more funds "to deliver their essential prevention and rescue services".</p>
