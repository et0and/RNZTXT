            <p>A 32-year-old South Canterbury woman has been charged with the 2021 murder of Waimate man Anaru Moana.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Joel Syme said the woman appeared in the Timaru District Court on Friday, after her arrest on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>She will remain in custody and reappear in the High Court at Christchurch on 11 April.</p>
        
            <p>Moana was reported missing on 23 December 2021. Extensive inquiries have been carried out to locate him and hold those responsible to account said Syme.</p>

            <p>"Four people are now facing charges in relation to Moana's murder," Syme said.</p>
