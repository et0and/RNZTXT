            <p>A Christchurch secondary school has cancelled a planned centenary event as a former teacher faces historical sexual abuse charges.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who has appealed to the High Court to keep his identity suppressed, is facing a total 11 charges relating to alleged offending against four students of St Bede's College about 20 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The charges include sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection, indecent assault on a boy aged 12-16, and indecent assault on a male over 16.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to the school community on Tuesday, school rector Jon McDowall confirmed its planned Boarding 100 celebrations would not go ahead in April.</p>
        
            <p>"As communicated last year, the College remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing historical abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus remains on supporting those impacted and fostering a safe, supportive environment for all members of our community-past, present, and future."</p>
        
            <p>"In light of this I have decided it is not the right time to hold the [event] as originally planned."</p>
        
            <p>McDowall said a planned 100th anniversary dinner would go ahead in August.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for your understanding and ongoing support of the college."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, McDowall said it was aware of historical allegations and felt it was appropriate to cancel the event, "out of respect for those impacted, whether they number one or many".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement in October, Detective Senior Sergeant Karen Simmons said police believed the man "targeted those boarding at the school during this time".</p>
        
            <p>If you have been abused, remember it's not your fault.</p>
