            <p>New South Wales has crushed Queensland 38-18 to level the State of Origin series in front of 90,084 supporters at the MCG.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues were almost flawless in the first half, flying out of the blocks to score six tries in the most dominant opening 40 minutes in Origin history.</p>
        
            <p>Wingers Brian To'o and Zac Lomax had doubles and Liam Martin and Latrell Mitchell also crossed in the opening period for the Blues, who banished all memories of their under-manned defeat in Sydney in Game I.</p>
        
            <p>Martin and Patrick Carrigan were both sent to the sin bin early in the second half, during which time Queensland scored two tries through Jeremiah Nanai and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, who played through an AC joint injury that forced him from the field in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>But as soon as both teams were back to 13 players each, the Blues struck again, debutant Dylan Edwards diving over in the right corner after another sumptuous pass from player of the match Mitchell Moses.</p>
        
            <p>Murray Taulagi also crossed for the Maroons, but it was too little, too late for Queensland, who must lick their wounds ahead of a deciding Game III at Lang Park on 17 July.</p>

            <p>After losing the opener 38-10 in Sydney, the Blues came to Melbourne hoping to make a statement and made one.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues enjoyed 68 per cent of possession, completed 21 out of 22 sets and scored six tries to nil to take a 34-0 lead to half-time - a State of Origin record.</p>
        
            <p>The bare numbers were extraordinary - the Blues ran for 1041 metres, had 24 tackle breaks and missed just two tackles of their own in the first half, compared to just 419 metres from the Maroons, who had 12 sets in total.</p>
        
            <p>Phil Gould described it as "men against boys" on Channel 9, with former Maroons skipper Darren Lockyer admitting he was "in shock".</p>
        
            <p>The Maroons and Blues head to Brisbane on 17 July for a decider with Queensland chasing a third straight series victory and the Blues looking for just their fifth series win since 2006.</p>
        
            <p>The last time the Blues went to Suncorp Stadium and won a decider was 2005.</p>
