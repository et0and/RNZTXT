            <p>The Wellington Phoenix will have to await their premiership plate fate.</p>
        
            <p>Ending their regular season this evening with a 3-0 win over Macarthur FC to stay top of the table, it will not be known until Wednesday night whether the Phoenix will stay there and claim the A-League minor premiership.</p>
        
            <p>The second-placed Central Coast Mariners played simultaneously across the ditch, where they put away Newcastle 3-1.</p>
        
            <p>The Mariners need just one point against Adelaide on Wednesday night - a draw will be enough for them to take the title.</p>
        
            <p>Two goals in eight minutes to Kosta Barbarouses and Tim Payne in the first half put the Phoenix on top while the returning Oskar Zawada put the icing on the cake in the 90th minute with a penalty.</p>
        
            <p>They end the regular season with 15 wins and 53 competition points.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix skipper Alex Rufer told Sky Sport, minor premiers or not, it had been a special run.</p>

            <p>"Words can't describe how proud I am of this team - we have done our best, and now we will have to wait till Wednesday and if it happens, it happens."</p>
        
            <p>He said they would be sure to reflect on their success this season ahead of the first leg of the semi final in two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to enjoy tonight, relax, recover, and get straight back into training because it's going to be a big game, big pressure but those are the games you live for."</p>
        
            <p>Barbarouses was first on the scoresheet as he netted a superb cross from Ben Old.</p>
        
            <p>Just eight minutes later and Nicholas Pennington put it on a platter for Payne to blast home a header.</p>
        
            <p>As the 90 minutes ticked over, the Phoenix were awarded a penalty after Zawada was brought down inside the area.</p>
        
            <p>The returning Polish striker made no mistake as he thundered home the penalty to seal a one-sided victory for the Phoenix.</p>
