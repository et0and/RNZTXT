            <p>Ten albums in 10 years in 10 different genres - that's Troy Kingi’s goal. But after the release of the seventh album - 2023’s ambient instrumental vibe album Timewasters - he’s admitted in a new TVNZ series Desert Hīkoi it was “starting to feel a bit stale.” He had been feeling a creative block.</p>
        
            <p>Desert Hīkoi follows Kingi on his creative and spiritual journey with his band to regain his mojo. They went to California’s Joshua Tree National Park to record a desert rock album at a legendary studio. Kingi (Te Arawa, Ngāpuhi, Te Whānau-ā-Apanui) has described Rancho de la Luna as “my holy place”, where his favourite album of all time, Songs for the Deaf by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age was recorded. </p>

            <p>In an episode in the series, a doctor from the Kawiya tribe takes the group far into the mountains, at night, to a cave which is said to be a portal into another realm. In another, Kingi tries mushrooms as part of a plant medicine session with shamans. He also attends a sweat lodge. </p>
        
            <p>Yet with Kingi, it’s clear having deadlines and working under pressure pays dividends. </p>
        
            <p>For the Auckland Writers’ Festival next week he is exploring his creative process with an audience - who will help conceive, write and perform an original waiata in 60 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The audience will give Kingi the genre, a key lyric and then he’ll get to work.</p>
        
            <p>Troy Kingi first came to attention starring in and contributing to the soundtrack of 2013 film Mount Zion. This year he played a major role in Rachel House’s film The Mountain, alongside finding time to write the soundtrack. </p>
        
            <p>Culture 101’s Mark Amery speaks to Troy Kingi at home with his whanau in Kerikeri this Mother’s Day.   </p>
        
            <p>A Waiata in an Hour He waiata I Te Hāora is at the Aotea Centre on Saturday 18 May at 5.15pm</p>
        
            <p>Kingi’s eighth album in eight years will be released in the second half of this year.</p>
