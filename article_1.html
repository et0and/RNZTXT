            <p>Train services in Auckland have mostly been restored, after grinding to a halt earlier on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Now, all rail services are operational, with the exception of the Onehunga line which has been suspended until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said commuters should expect delays and some cancellations while the network recovered from the stoppage.</p>
        
            <p>In a travel alert Auckland Transport said the stoppage was due to a KiwiRail track infrastructure issue meaning all rail services have been held until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers were advised that buses were accepting all AT Hop cards and rail tickets.</p>

            <p>There have been a series of train cancellations and delays this month, which have angered Auckland mayor Wayne Brown.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of commuters trying to travel on the Western, Southern and Eastern line train services were affected over one three-day period.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agencies overseeing the rail network said the problems causing delays and cancellations needed to be promptly resolved.</p>
        
            <p>Senior leaders from the agencies attended a please explain meeting with Brown on 14 February.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint statement, Auckland Transport, KiwiRail and Auckland One Rail said they would keep Brown updated as they worked together to fix problems.</p>
