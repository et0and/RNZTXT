        <h2>Judgment clears path for Greens to waka jump Darleen Tana</h2>
        <p>
It is unlikely Tana will be able to seek another order to stop the Greens holding a meeting to vote on her fate, Professor Andrew Geddis says.

            <p>A High Court judgment clears the way for the Green Party to use the waka jumping legislation to evict Darleen Tana from Parliament, a legal expert says.</p>
        
            <p>Tana took the party to court in an attempt to stop them ousting her from Parliament after she was suspended from the party after an inquiry into migrant exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>She resigned from the party in July, but wants to remain in Parliament as an independent MP.</p>
        
            <p>In a decision released on Friday, Justice Johnstone declined Tana's application for judicial review.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Andrew Geddis said Tana had little ground to challenge the Greens on and that it would have been difficult for Tana to prove that her resignation from the Green Party was forced.</p>
        
            <p>He said the judgment cleared the way for the Greens to use the waka jumping legislation to evict Tana from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>It was unlikely Tana would be able to successfully seek another interim order to stop the Greens from holding a meeting to vote on her fate, Geddis said.</p>
        
            <p>She was earlier successful in getting an injunction order to delay a Green Party meeting, where they were going vote on whether to invoke the waka jumping legislation.</p>
        
            <p>If she attempted this method again, Geddis said there would be more scrutiny of its appropriateness.</p>
        
            <p>If the court issued another interim order, it would intrude on parliamentary privilege - the right of Parliament to decide its own affairs, he said.</p>
