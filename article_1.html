            <p>A wealthy Wellington property developer and philanthropist has offered to buy the shuttered Reading Cinema complex in downtown Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington City Council will discuss on Thursday whether it should buy the property from its international owner.</p>
        
            <p>It would then use the money to do upgrades and earthquake work.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Mark Dunajtschik's lawyer has presented his plan to the council.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Nick Wareham said Sir Mark would negotiate directly with Reading to purchase the land and offer it a lease.</p>
        
            <p>"He will make payment to Reading for the land on a progress built completed basis, and he will contribute his funds after Reading have first invested their own money."</p>
        
            <p>The rental proceeds will ultimately end up in Sir Mark's foundation, which would then gift the land back to Wellington citizens in 50 years' time.</p>
        
            <p>If Reading wish to buy back the land prior to this gifting, they can negotiate to do so at market rates.</p>

            <p>Wareham said Sir Mark was urging the council not to go through with the current plan, saying "ratepayers are on the raw end of the deal".</p>
        
            <p>He said the council would be risking ratepayers money up front, with no guarantees that the redevelopment project would proceed.</p>
        
            <p>It would be putting ratepayers in before Reading did, affecting the amount of leverage the council had, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The council will simply be covering its costs of funds.</p>
        
            <p>"It is unlikely that this will match a normal commercial ground rental and therefore the citizens of Wellington will not only be subsidising a commercial entity, they will also be foregoing a normal commercial return on land.</p>
        
            <p>He said the deal could reduce the council's borrowing capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Mark and partner Dorothy Spotswood have donated more than $53 million to build the Wellington Children's Hospital, and has pledged another $50m to build a Mental Health Hospital in Lower Hutt.</p>
