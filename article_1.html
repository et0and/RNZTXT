            <p>Several Auckland schools have had their windows smashed and vehicles damaged in recent days.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook Massey High School said they, and at least four other west Auckland secondary schools, had suffered similar "mindless vandalism" over the past two nights.</p>
        
            <p>"All schools have suffered similar damage, large numbers of broken windows at the front of the school (caused by blunt objects) and damage to school vehicles," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were said to be investigating.</p>

            <p>Massey High School remained open, although access to reception was limited due to the broken windows.</p>
        
            <p>"Our reception office will be closed today due to vandalism that occurred overnight. While we are temporarily unable to receive visitors, students are still expected to attend school as usual," a separate Facebook post said.</p>
