        <p>
He's refusing to express confidence in Chief Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt, and while he won't abolish the commission like ACT wants, changes will be made.

            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith is refusing to express confidence in Chief Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party called for the commission to be abolished during the election campaign, but Goldsmith said he was not planning on doing that.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said changes would be made.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, just in terms of the personnel, the people, and couple of roles have come up and we'll be working through that process."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt's warrant as the Chief Human Rights Commissioner is due to expire in January.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith would not express confidence in him.</p>
        
            <p>"I need to talk to Paul Hunt first, that's the appropriate way to go, but we're going to be making changes across the Human Rights Commission," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The commission also introduced a co-chief executive position, appointing Julia Amua Whaipooti to the role on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said he did not think it was appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"No, I don't think we should be having dual CEOs across the public sector, and I'll be looking for some advice on that."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the ACT Party said Whaipooti's appointment was "just the latest example of a taxpayer-funded bureaucracy serving itself at the expense of delivery for New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>The party noted she had previously worked with JustSpeak, which it called a "left-wing criminal justice reform group".</p>
        
            <p>"The appointment comes after the commission also hired Claire Charters, a co-author of the radically divisive He Puapua report ... ACT has long said the people at the Human Rights Commission are left-wing activists masquerading as politically-neutral bureaucrats. There's no denying it now."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has sought comment from the Human Rights Commission.</p>
