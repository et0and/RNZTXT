            <p>A new case of mpox with a "likely" link to the recent Winter Pride Festival in Queenstown has been detected today, Health NZ has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Today's confirmed case brings the number of cases of mpox in New Zealand to 54 since the disease became notifiable in June 2022. Five have been confirmed so far in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, national clinical director Dr Susan Jack said the National Public Health Service was continuing to investigate after several people who attended the event - including today's case - came into contact with people who later reportedly tested positive for mpox overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"While it is possible that other cases may yet be confirmed, it's important to remember that mpox is a rare infection and the risk of it spreading widely in New Zealand remains low.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to mpox, or who develops symptoms, especially a rash, should seek medical advice.</p>
        
            <p>"As the mpox virus can spread through close contact (including intimate / sexual contact) with a person with mpox, we also strongly urge anyone with symptoms to refrain from sexual activity and seek support."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ said most people with mpox developed a rash or other skin change known as lesions. Lesions are spots, bumps, blisters or sores, usually around the face, hands, feet, mouth, throat, genitals and anus.</p>
        
            <p>The sores usually go through stages - they appear flat, they become solid and raised or bumpy, they fill with fluid, crust over and eventually flake off. The lesions were often painful and itchy, and could take a few weeks to heal.</p>
        
            <p>Pain, bleeding or discomfort in the anus was a possibility.</p>
        
            <p>Some people also experienced flu-like symptoms early on, including:</p>
        
            <p>There are two types of mpox, known as clade I and clade II - both have caused the current outbreaks in African countries with a recent increase in clade I. There are no cases of clade I in Aotearoa, or in neighbouring countries.</p>
