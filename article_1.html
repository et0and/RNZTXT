            <p>The Los Angeles wildfires have now spread to Hollywood as 180,000 people have so far been ordered to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>Six fires are now burning, after the blaze began in the affluent Pacific Palisades area Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The death toll stands at five. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed, but strong winds are hindering firefighting efforts, as water supplies run low.</p>
