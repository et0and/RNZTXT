            <p>Paris will begin its Olympics extravaganza with an unprecedented opening ceremony on the river Seine on 26 July (27 July NZT).</p>
        
            <p>Here is what you need to know about the ceremony:</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have promised a show like no other.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike for previous Olympics, the Paris 2024 opening ceremony will not take place in a stadium. Instead, dozens of boats will carry thousands of athletes and performers on a 6km route along the Seine.</p>
        
            <p>Departing from the Austerlitz bridge, the parade will sail by Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral and arrive near the Eiffel Tower, after passing under bridges and gateways, including the Pont des Arts and Pont Neuf, and near many of the French capital's landmarks.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have said they will take advantage of the historic monuments, the riverbanks, the sky and water "and there won't be a single riverbank or bridge that won't be filled with music, dance, or performance".</p>
        
            <p>The show will have 12 parts, some of which will play on clich√©s about France.</p>
        
            <p>Athletes and artists will take part in the parade together.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything will be woven together, including the protocol (the speeches, the opening by the head of state, the anthems, etc.)," organisers Thomas Jolly et Damien Gabriac told Le Monde newspaper.</p>
        
            <p>The ceremony is due to start at 7:30pm (5:30am NZT) and last about four hours. Organisers said it would reach a climax at about 9:35pm (7:30am NZT) when the sun sets.</p>

            <p>The show will be attended by over 100 heads of state and government and over 300,000 spectators will watch from the river's banks, organisers said, adding that there will be some 80 giant screens along the way.</p>
        
            <p>The Paris 2024 committee said there would be about 10,500 athletes and some 222,000 people will get free invites, while 104,000 will have to buy a ticket.</p>
        
            <p>Boats carrying the athletes will be equipped with cameras to allow those watching on TV or their phone to get a close-up view, the committee said.</p>
        
            <p>There have been training sessions, and boats will be stored in a warehouse for a week before the opening ceremony for security reasons.</p>

            <p>Organising the ceremony in the heart of an iconic city like Paris may make for great pictures, but it's also a major security challenge. Some 45,000 police will be dispatched to ensure the ceremony's security, including special intervention forces. Snipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route. An anti-drone system will be in place.</p>
        
            <p>Spectators and local residents alike will need to carry permits on a QR code to get anywhere near the riverbanks from 18 July. Cars won't be allowed into the area, with few exceptions. Nearby metro stations will be closed, as will many of the bridges.</p>
        
            <p>No planes will be allowed to fly over Paris - unless they are part of the ceremony. With wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security concerns at home, France already has its security alert at its highest level.</p>
        
            <p>Officials have said there were no specific terror threats to the ceremony. But should specific concerns arise, there are backup plans, that would either see the ceremony limited to the Trocadero square near the Eiffel tower, or the Stade de France stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The main potential risk would be from a lone attacker, officials have said over the past months, while also flagging potential petty crime and possible protests, from environmental activists, the far right and far left, the pro-Palestinian movement or others.</p>
        
            <p>A man was arrested in May in Saint-Etienne, suspected of planning an attack in the name of Islamic State at the city's soccer stadium during the Olympics. A right-wing sympathiser was arrested in eastern France in July on suspicion of plotting attacks to take place during the Olympics.</p>
