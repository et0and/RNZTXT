            <p>Oscar Piastri has won the Chinese Grand Prix for McLaren, with NZer Liam Lawson finishing 16th.</p>
        
            <p>Piastri roared back from season-opening disappointment in his home race in Australia by winning the Chinese Formula One from pole position in a McLaren one-two with championship-leading teammate Lando Norris on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>George Russell finished third for Mercedes, ahead of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Saturday sprint winner Lewis Hamilton fifth and sixth.</p>
        
            <p>Piastri's win denied Norris a third victory in a row, including last year's season-ender, but left champions McLaren unbeaten in two races so far this year.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson started right at the back of the grid in 20th, but finished four places higher.</p>
