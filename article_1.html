        <h2>Māori baseballer aims to be the first to play in the Major Leagues</h2>
        <p>
In the 193 years Major League Baseball has existed, no Māori New Zealander has ever featured in the competition.
</p>
        
            <p>Nikau Pouaka-Grego (Tainui) has his sights set on becoming New Zealand's first Māori Major League Baseballer and, at only 19, has been marked as a breakout star in the sport.</p>
        
            <p>With the support of his whānau, Nikau has spent 15 years developing his skill in the game, which landed him a contract with the Philladelphia Phillies in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The young star is currently in Florida taking the diamond for the Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League, the Clearwater Threshers.</p>
        
            <p>In the 193 years Major League Baseball has existed, few New Zealanders have ever featured in the competition, let alone a tāne Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Nikau aims to be the first.</p>
        
            <p>"I really want to put us on the map and get the name out there for New Zealand."</p>

            <p>Born in Ōtautahi, Nikau grew up in Australia before returning to Aotearoa in 2015 for a three-year stint, where he represented New Zealand on the world stage from 10 to 12 years old.</p>
        
            <p>Nikau later returned to play in the Australian Baseball League for the Adelaide Giants in 2018, winning back-to-back championships.</p>
        
            <p>The lefty-hitter later signed a contract with the Philadelphia Phillies for US$250,000 in 2019 - a team which had their eye on him since he was 10.</p>
        
            <p>"I was meant to be in year 12, finishing school back home, but instead I was on the other side of the world starting off my dream."</p>
        
            <p>He has been marked by the MLB as one of the breakout stars for the 2024 season, and currently sits on the organisations' top 30 prospect list.</p>

            <p>Nikau descends from a strong line of talented softballers. His mother, Nic Pouaka, is a former New Zealand White Sox and his father, Todd Grego, Australian born, a former Black Sox representative.</p>
        
            <p>He said his baseball career started as a pēpi, when he was still in nappies.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd run around the house with a plastic baseball bat, and I'd be smacking that thing all day".</p>
        
            <p>His whānau instilled in him and his two younger brothers Jai and Paki Pouaka-Grego the importance of working hard, Nikau said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have always taught me and my brothers that things aren't just gonna come to us and things don't happen by accident.</p>

            <p>His teina have just made a move to Houston where they will play high school baseball.</p>
        
            <p>"They're gonna turn some heads really quickly, and I can't wait to see what the near future has in store for both of them."</p>
        
            <p>Nic Pouaka who is "extremely proud" of Nikau's achievements so far, said while he is an impressive sports star, "he is a great young man and absolutely beautiful through and through."</p>
        
            <p>His dream goes beyond playing in the Majors and being an All-star and it is his aspiration to have his own children next to him while playing in the All-Star game, Pouaka said.</p>
        
            <p>"I truly hope these dreams come into fruition for him.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if they don't, he's a kid grinding and working his butt off hard."</p>
        
            <p>Despite a major setback in 2019 when he tore his ACL, Nikau's determination never waivered, and he made a remarkable comeback.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very focused and mentally tough. I'm so proud of him," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe he gets that from me."</p>
        
            <p>Throughout his journey, Nikau's whakapapa has remained a source of strength and pride. His tāmoko, representing his whānau and life journey is a way to showcase all the challenges he has overcome.</p>
        
            <p>During Covid, his whānau was hit with the news of his mother's breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>"It was hard to see mum go through that, especially during Covid, it wasn't easy but Nic made it look pretty easy."</p>
        
            <p>"There was no complaining, there was no nothing, she just lived her life, she still worked from home, she still walked every day, she still cooked."</p>
        
            <p>Mum was an "absolute trooper" and having her still here is awesome, nikau said</p>
        
            <p>
Nikau Pouaka-Grego said his māmā and softball legend Nic Pouaka has played a massive role in his achievements.

            <p>In early 2024, Nikau wore a pink strip, honouring his mum and raising awareness for breast cancer.</p>
        
            <p>Pouaka said it was an extremely emotional moment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something that we don't really talk about much within our family."</p>
        
            <p>"When I got diagnosed and had to tell the boys, I promised them everything was going to be okay."</p>
        
            <p>"I know he wore that jumper with pride."</p>

            <p>Nikau hopes to see other New Zealanders, especially rangatahi Māori playing at the highest level.</p>
        
            <p>"When I first got here, I thought I was gonna be way behind all of these guys," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll be shocked when you get here, how easy you fit in and since you're the kid from a country that doesn't play baseball, you already stick out."</p>
        
            <p>"When you go out there and you play the way you do, you're gonna be fine and you're gonna turn heads really quickly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nikau's piece of advice to young athletes was to stay committed, be prepared to grind and most importantly play the game you love.</p>
        
            <p>"I went out there and just played baseball like I did when I was a kid," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I played baseball because I love it."</p>
        
            <p>
From representing New Zealand on the world stage at 10-years-old to signing a deal with the Phillies, Nikau Pouaka-Grego (right) hopes other rangatahi will follow their sporting dreams.
