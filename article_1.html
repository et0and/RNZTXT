            <p>The women keep winning on the water with another medal for New Zealand's rowers.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand's third rowing final of the day, the women's coxless four of Jackie Gowler, Phoebe Spoors, Kerri Williams and Davina Waddy took bronze, with the Netherlands winning gold in thrilling fashion.</p>
        
            <p>The Dutch team surged ahead with the British and Romanian rowers right on their tail, but the Kiwi quartet inched closer as the halfway mark approached.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand were still in fourth with 1000m to race, looking to time their run to the finish but it never came, as the Dutch and British fought it out for first.</p>
        
            <p>In a frantic finish, the Dutch bow crossed the line a split second ahead of the British, and the Kiwis held off Romania to settle for bronze.</p>
        
            <p>The women's double sculls team of Lucy Spoors and Brooke Francis won gold in their race, while the men's fours took a silver.</p>
        
            <p>Phoebe Spoors said the women's four race went smoothly and to plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We felt really good throughout. It was important for us to be quick off the line, we knew that there would be no waiting around, so we were really trying to lean into it early and I felt like we did that and I guess we just tried to keep that momentum going to the line.</p>
        
            <p>"We found ourselves in a sprint with Romania, who we know are historically fast and that was a long way to the finish line, man."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was "epic" that her sister Lucy won gold in the double.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just pushing off as they were coming to the line, and I heard their coach celebrating and I had to sort of mentally check myself to hold it together, but they are so dominant together and individually.</p>
        
            <p>"It was epic, it was really cool."</p>
