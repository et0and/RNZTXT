            <p>An 11-year-old from Tauranga has become the youngest ever winner of the Hole in One Challenge at Lake Taupō, and is putting his $10,000 cash prize money towards a family vacation.</p>
        
            <p>Elijah Ellis told First Up he was shocked when it went in, while everyone around him started jumping up and down in excitement.</p>
        
            <p>It all started off as a pretty normal morning, with Elijah sharing a bucket of 50 balls with his dad, while his sister and mum watched on.</p>
        
            <p>"About halfway through the bucket, I hit one, It was like a lowish type of fade in there and it just it slam dunked! It landed right in, and I yelled 'It's in', but my mum and sister didn't see it because they were too busy chatting."</p>
        
            <p>But Elijah's dad Tristan was watching.</p>
        
            <p>He saw the shot fly off Elijah's eight iron, and says straight away it had eyes for the flag.</p>
        
            <p>"When it was in the air, it was going, going and I thought 'this is gonna be close'."</p>
        
            <p>Tristan's instincts were bang on, and the ball disappeared straight into the hole.</p>
        
            <p>"You could hear the faint sound of it hitting the hole, and then it disappears. Then it's about a five or six second delay before it goes down the pipe and then it goes into the like this little black box at the front of the pontoon."</p>
        
            <p>Elijah's older sister Tania confirmed she was chatting with her mum Sheree when the miracle shot landed.</p>
        
            <p>"We all had the hope that one of them were gonna get it, but the chances of it were pretty slim.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're off in our own little world and then all of a sudden we hear Elijah go 'Oh, it's in!'."</p>
        
            <p>Tania was scepitcal, but not for long.</p>
        
            <p>"We looked straight at the black box see if there was a ball going to come down and then. It did, and we all just started jumping around and screaming because he wasn't lying, he actually got it."</p>
        
            <p>At just after 9am on a Monday morning, the Taupō lakefront turned into a frenzy.</p>
        
            <p>"They were like the morning walkers and there was a crowd that had gathered, as they usually do, just to watch, and they all started celebrating with us, which was really nice and giving Elijah a pat on the back and all that kind of stuff. So it was pretty cool to have heaps of people around to witness it as well. "</p>
        
            <p>Elijah was in town competing at the Bay of Plenty Age Group Golf Championships over the weekend, where he finished fourth.</p>
        
            <p>He is now the youngest ever person to win the grand prize at Lake Taupō, and can not believe his luck.</p>
        
            <p>"It still feels like a dream, I can't stop thinking about it. I can remember every single bit of it."</p>
        
            <p>And Elijah has decided to share the $10,000 prize with his parents.</p>
        
            <p>"They said for my birthday next year, we're we're gonna go to Australia. They were gonna save up for it and not spend a lot of money. So I decided we'll just use that money to go to Australia."</p>
        
            <p>Tristan was taken aback.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very special to watch your kids achieve something like that, and then to want to turn around and just give it back to the family, it's real nice."</p>
        
            <p>As for the lucky golf ball...</p>
        
            <p>"I've got it right now. It's Callaway Super Soft 1. Yeah, it's probably just gonna stay on top of my drawer on my room."</p>
