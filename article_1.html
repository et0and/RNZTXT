            <p>An emergency management meeting is being held as more heavy rain has been forecast to hit the South Island's West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService has issued orange heavy rain warnings for the Westland District from 9pm on Friday, and for Buller and parts of Tasman from the early hours of Saturday.</p>
        
            <p> Severe Weather Update  Heavy rain for the West Coast and Southern Alps overnight - particularly intense in the Westland District where it may have a greater impact than usual after last week's event, making surface flooding, slips and swollen rivers more likely.â€¦ pic.twitter.com/o2RiZTKTnM</p>
        
            <p>The already sodden West Coast is tipped to receive 150 to 200mm of rain about the ranges, possibly up to 250mm near the glaciers, and 70 to 120mm nearer the coast. Peak rates of 40 to 50 mm/h are expected on Saturday morning about the ranges.</p>
        
            <p>A local State of Emergency was declared in Westland last weekend after torrential rain lashed the district and caused rivers to rise rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Regional Council chief executive Darryl Lew said 95 percent of the Waiho (Waihau) River's main channel was now flowing into the Tatare Stream.</p>
        
            <p>The Waiho Technical Advisory Group had been preparing for this to happen, he said.</p>
        
            <p>WCRC councillors, Westland District Council, Department of Conservation, NZTA and community leaders will be attending a briefing at 1.30pm this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to assure the community that Council is monitoring the river flow and will be providing an update on the next steps on Friday afternoon," Lew said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said people in Westland should prepare for intense rain overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"The rain event we had last week brought quite a lot of rain up in the ranges and that has all fed into the rivers, and as we saw mid-week we had some more heavy rain out there, so river levels are maybe running a bit higher than they were about two weeks ago," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This rain we're expecting in the overnight period will be bringing extra rain on top of that so we are just keeping an eye on that. If people are in that area it might be a good idea to see what your plans are for the overnight period and make sure you are in a safe place."</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said the rain was expected to ease off Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman residents, meanwhile, should expect 70-90mm of rain; while Buller should expect 75-100mm, especially about the ranges.</p>
