        <h2>Dargaville dentistry demand leads to DIY</h2>
        <p>
However, the town now has its own dentist for the first time in two years. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Dargaville will have its own dentist after more than a two-year wait.</p>
        
            <p>The growing demand had some resorting to DIY or being forced to travel to Whangārei for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>However, media coverage of the town needing a dentist connected the doctor with the clinic, owner Rodney Cotton said.</p>
        
            <p>"This dentist, through friends, heard about our needs from people watching TV, and he actually contacted TV1, and that was how he got hold of us," Cotton told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a senior dentist from Auckland and he's had his own practice. So I'm pretty confident, but my wife, who's got a chipped tooth, she's going in there shortly."</p>
        
            <p>There was pent-up demand for a dentist in Dargaville, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At times there's been three dentists operating full-time in Dargaville. We've only got one guy doing four days."</p>
        
            <p>While some people would have formed relationships with Whangārei dentists, "I imagine majority will will want to just do it locally," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I'm very confident if I could get a second guy which will make my business model a whole heap stronger, we'll easily have enough work for two dentists."</p>
        
            <p>Cotton said WINZ had stepped in to help.</p>
        
            <p>"There's $1000 every person on the WINZ benefit can access per year for dentistry, so we've actually been ticked off to do that work immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"So anyone on a WINZ benefit straight away can utilise that $1000."</p>
        
            <p>For others, he said his clinic's rates were cheaper than others in Northland much cheaper than Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>About half of New Zealanders are now avoiding seeing the dentist due to cost barriers, a national health survey has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Figures from the New Zealand Dental Association showed the price of a typical appointment - including an exam, clean, x-ray and composite fillings - had gone up $98 between 2020 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>And for the community on Great Barrier Island its last resident dentist retired in 2016, leaving all of his dental equipment to the community.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, visiting dentists have operated out of the clinic when possible, but it has been nearly a year since the last visit, and demand for dental services on the island is growing.</p>
