            <p>Otago University has told an inquest into the death of a student at a Dunedin party in 2019 that Campus Watch's role was not to police parties.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago student Sophia Crestani, 19, died during a stairwell pile-up at an overcrowded flat party.</p>
        
            <p>The university's deputy proctor, Geoff Burns, told the inquest that Campus Watch staff were observing the party from across the road.</p>
        
            <p>Police counsel Richard Smith asked if he would expect the Campus Watch team to get closer, given there had already been concerns raised about overcrowding at a previous party at the same flat.</p>
        
            <p>Burns said he would not have expected the team to act any differently than they did.</p>
        
            <p>"We aren't there to spy, but more to be a visual presence for anyone coming out, not to look inside."</p>
        
            <p>They did not want to be oppressive in anyway, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The only exception was that if a young person was believed to be a student, a staff member could require them to provide their name and student ID number, Burns said.</p>

            <p>Smith asked about reports of partygoers approaching the Campus Watch team, saying the party was overcrowded, that the stairs had collapsed and people were getting crushed.</p>
        
            <p>A young man had told the team he had been been stuck for five to 10 minutes and had lost his shoes, and another said he had lost his pants.</p>
        
            <p>Burns said the Campus Watch staff then called their control room to ask them to contact police to shut the party down.</p>
        
            <p>He said from day one after Crestani died, they had looked at whether they should have done anything differently that night, but he had full confidence in the team's assessment.</p>
        
            <p>"In hindsight, it would have been good for a whole lot of things to happen differently, or in a different order. If we'd looked into a crystal ball, we would have done things differently."</p>
