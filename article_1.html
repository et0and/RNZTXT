            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has spoken with the US president elect Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Since Trump's landslide victory last week he has spoken with several world leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and China's Xi Jin Ping.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's usual interview slot with Morning Report was moved to allow for the call from the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Posting on X, Luxon said New Zealand and the United States had a strong and enduring partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"Good to speak with President-elect @realDonaldTrump this morning to congratulate him on his historic election victory.</p>
        
            <p>"We agreed on the importance of deepening ties between our two nations and I look forward to doing just that."</p>

            <p>The prime minister is heading to the APEC summit in Peru on Thursday where he will meet outgoing President Joe Biden.</p>
        
            <p>President-elect Trump campaigned on introducing tariffs of up to 20 percent on imported goods as part of his 'America First' economic policy.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has previously warned against jumping to conclusions about Trump policies that might affect New Zealand and has congratulated the Republican on a "comprehensive win".</p>
        
            <p>"I look forward to working with him and advancing the interests of our great countries," he said last week.</p>
        
            <p>"I know both sides of the aisle in Washington... I've got no doubt we'll do everything we can to work constructively to move forward together."</p>
        
            <p>Asked about Trump's campaigning on trade tariffs which could be bad for New Zealand, Luxon said we needed to wait and see what policies were actually introduced.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi winemakers are anxiously waiting to see whether he follows through on the promise, with the US market accounting for some 40 percent of New Zealand's wine exports.</p>
