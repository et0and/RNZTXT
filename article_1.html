            <p>The number of whooping cough cases this year has surpassed 1000, and the health agency is urging people to get vaccinated against the disease.</p>
        
            <p>Officials declared a national whooping cough epidemic last Friday after weeks of consistently high case numbers, hospitalisations and unlinked outbreaks.</p>
        
            <p>The latest figures from ESR show 77 cases were reported last week, which includes four hospitalised cases - three of which were under the age of 1.</p>
        
            <p>That was down slightly on the two weeks prior - but immunisation leader Nikki Turner said the epidemic would be long and slow, lasting up to 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>Last week's cases brought the total number of cases this year to 1009, Health NZ/Te Whatu Ora public health medicine specialist Dr Matt Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 63 people infected were under 12 months old, and almost three quarters of those were hospitalised, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly important that we do all we can to get our hapū māmā immunised," Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>"Newborn babies aged under six weeks are particularly vulnerable, with Māori and Pacific babies at high risk from whooping cough.</p>
        
            <p>"By getting immunised when you're pregnant, you will protect your pēpi until they can have their first immunisations when they are six weeks old."</p>
