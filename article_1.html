            <p>Kiingi Tuheita typically does not attend the annual commemorations up North, but urged his supporters to join him this year to send a message to the coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>The large delegation this afternoon included iwi leaders and representatives of Rātana, Parihaka and Te Pāti Māori, along with the Kiingitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking in the pōwhiri, Ngāpuhi leader Hone Sadler acknowledged the anger and hurt many felt toward the Coalition - but urged them not to stoop to its level.</p>
        
            <p>"Let us remain peaceful, humble, but don't drop our guard. They will be here to share their thoughts. Let them know our thoughts and our feelings. Let us look for prosperity of unity."</p>
        
            <p>The manuhiri, or guests, responded with a call for peace, love and unity.</p>
        
            <p>Bayden Barber of Ngāti Kahungunu said Māori must stand up and fight, but not with violence.</p>
        
            <p>"Unite, unite. For we must be united. We have representation of the whole country and acknowledging the sacred documents He Whakaputanga and Te Tiriti o Waitangi ... remain steadfast te iwi Māori. This is the right place to meet and unite. To convey our thoughts, our ideas," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Government parties are due to arrive in the North on Monday, and are expecting a much frostier reception.</p>
