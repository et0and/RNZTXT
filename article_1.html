            <p>Aotearoa's door charge is about to get a whole lot more expensive.</p>
        
            <p>From next month the international visitors levy will more than triple from $35 to $100.</p>
        
            <p>International visitors spent over $11 billion in the year ending March 2024, but being popular comes with a cost - increased pressure on regional infrastructure and maintenance costs across the conservation estate.</p>
        
            <p>And the government says the increased levy will help cover the bills.</p>
        
            <p>But some in tourism say the changes will make New Zealand more expensive and less attractive as a destination, damaging an industry that has not yet bounced back from the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Minister Matt Doocey, speaking to RNZ's Checkpoint on Tuesday afternoon, said the government received "well over 1100 submissions" on changing the levy.</p>
        
            <p>"It was fairly overwhelming - 93 percent of submitters wanted the IVL to increase. Two-thirds of them wanted it increased to $100, and about 83 percent said that money should be spent on covering the costsâ€¦ due to international tourism."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
