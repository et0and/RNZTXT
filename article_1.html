            <p>All Blacks great Ma'a Nonu has joined RC Toulon in a surprising comeback, the French club said, with the 42-year-old arriving as medical cover at the Top 14 side.</p>
        
            <p>"Welcome back! Ma'a Nonu is back as a medical joker until the end of the season," Toulon announced on X, using the league's regulation that a short-term replacement can be called in for a player who is not available for at least three months.</p>
        
            <p>Nonu, who earned 103 caps with the All Blacks and won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015, played in Toulon from 2015 to 2018 and during the 2020-21 season. The centre's previous club was San Diego Legion in Major League Rugby.</p>
        
            <p>Toulon are second in the Top 14 standings, three points behind reigning champions Toulouse with nine games remaining. They also play Saracens in the last 16 of the Champions Cup in April.</p>
