            <p>A Dunedin man is getting close to completing a charity walk with a difference as he tackles all of New Zealand's Great Walks in jandals.</p>
        
            <p>After two years, Gus Cope hoped to cross the finish line this weekend when he completes the Routeburn Track.</p>
        
            <p>He said the idea was a joke that had gone too far.</p>
        
            <p>"I got my shoes wet while on a tramp one day and walked in jandals for the rest of it and I said 'oh I could do all the Great Walks in jandals' not even knowing any of the Great Walks at the time," he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>It escalated from there, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cope said he had become used to walking in jandals but walking in mud was difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardest part is dealing with mud, cause they get suctioned in the mud."</p>
        
            <p>At Rakiura, he got bogged in the mud a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely up past my ankle in mud and you'd step into it and go to take a next step but you're bare foot all of a sudden and your jandal's stuck in the mud and you've got to dig it out a little bit."</p>
        
            <p>Cope was aiming to do the entire thing in just one pair of jandals and he said they had thrived.</p>
        
            <p>"They've still got some tread left on the bottom and I've only had one blow-out so far."</p>
        
            <p>He said the jandal's plug just came out when he was walking in the mud, but he popped it back in and they had been fine since.</p>
        
            <p>Lake Waikaremoana was probably the hardest walk, but they had made it difficult for themselves, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have a whole lot of time when we were visiting the North Island and we just had a free day so we thought 'Oh we'll do it all in one day' and that was a 13 hour day of walking in jandals."</p>
        
            <p>People were initially shocked when they saw he was hiking in jandals, but once he explained it they seemed to enjoy it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And go like 'oh good on you' and 'nice work' and they're all pretty stoked about it to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>Last year the walk raised money for Edmund Rice Camps in Dunedin which provide a break for children who need a holiday from their family due to financial or social circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Cope said his aunt gave him a pedicure kit last year.</p>
        
            <p>"And that was not the best present cause all of the calluses that I'd built up on my feet just disappeared and I had to rebuild them again."</p>
