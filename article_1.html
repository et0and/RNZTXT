        <h2>‘Not acceptable’: Freedom camping pressure felt in south</h2>
        <p>
As tourist numbers increase, the lack of a freedom camping ambassador is being felt by locals in the Catlins, with an urgent call made to replace a vacant role.

            <p>As tourist numbers increase, the lack of a freedom camping ambassador is being felt by locals in the Catlins, with an urgent call made to replace a vacant role.</p>
        
            <p>The ambassador is tasked with educating freedom campers on the rules, but funding for the role in the popular tourist spot dried up last year.</p>
        
            <p>Southland District Council is being asked to fill the position by Waihopai Toetoe Community Board, which says a lack of oversight in popular areas is frustrating local communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Previously we had our freedom camping ambassador in the past, through arrangements with different organisations," community board chair Pam Yorke told Local Democracy Reporting.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year, unfortunately, we didn't have one.</p>
        
            <p>"With the increase in tourism numbers, we just need that education perspective and ... people enforcing how long you can stay in the freedom camping areas and keeping an eye on things."</p>
        
            <p>Yorke presented at the council's hearing for its long term plan consultation on Tuesday, where she highlighted the issue in the Catlins - an area covering the south-eastern corner of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>In a strongly-worded submission, Yorke said she had taken up the matter with staff but had not received a satisfactory response.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, tourism numbers were on the rise with approximately 90,000 people visiting Curio Bay alone in 2023, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was advised by staff that when the opportunity for funding came up, it was a brief turn around time frame, so it wasn't applied for last year," her submission stated.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not acceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Key areas for freedom camping referenced in the submission included Fortrose, Weir Beach, Slope Point, Waikawa and Curio Bay.</p>
        
            <p>At the latter, freedom camping was not permitted, but some visitors to the area flouted the rules.</p>
        
            <p>Yorke said having the role moved people along who had stayed longer than their allotted time, which prevented facilities from overloading. It also helped in dealing with people camping in non-certified vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions from Local Democracy Reporting, council group manager regulatory services Adrian Humphries said his organisation had been without freedom camping ambassadors since the summer of 2022/23.</p>
        
            <p>The role was an educational one, to inform people where they could camp and for how long, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tourism Infrastructure Funding (TIF) was not obtained last year so there was no budget to pay for ambassador(s). There has been no indication from the new government that TIF funding will be available this year."</p>
        
            <p>The council was currently reviewing its regulatory requirements and might request funding of ambassadors if it was deemed appropriate, he said.</p>
