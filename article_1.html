        <h2>Good as cold: Polar plunge makes splash for Special Olympics</h2>

            <p>There were hospital gowns, police uniforms and tutus but not a wetsuit in sight as nearly 200 hardy souls braved 9C Wellington water to raise money and awareness for Special Olympics athletes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's first 'Polar Plunge' at Freyberg Beach on Saturday saw emergency services and the Special Olympics New Zealand team up to raise more than $25,000 for the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>After a warm up with Special Olympics mascot Kaha the Kiwi, 180 participants splashed into the water. Waist deep was considered 'official', though most dived in head first.</p>
        
            <p>Special Olympics football athlete Conor McCarthy had the honour of being one of the event openers, jumping in from the lofty heights of the police boat, Lady Elizabeth.</p>
        
            <p>"The swim was absolutely freezing, but it was freezing on the boat ... I just wanted to get it over and done with," McCarthy said.</p>

            <p>The organisation, which he calls 'Special O', is close to his heart - he has been competing for seven years, and went to the world games in Berlin last year.</p>
        
            <p>"It was absolutely amazing, I went with 39 other athletes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I love how everyone just gives everything a go, and I love making friends here, I've made so many friends here. It's great just to communicate with friends that are so like you.</p>
        
            <p>"I love Special O, I really, really do."</p>
        
            <p>McCarthy was "the mascot" of Special Olympics New Zealand, talking with schools and inspiring other athletes to join - which is why he was asked to take the first dip on Saturday morning, he said.</p>

            <p>Globally, the organisation is supported by emergency services. Those taking part in Wellington's Polar Plunge included Police, Fire and Emergency, Wellington Free Ambulance, the Defence Force, and the National Emergency Management Agency - with some police officers fresh off their night shift.</p>
        
            <p>It was an incredible turnout on a beautiful Wellington morning, said Special Olympics New Zealand events director Liz Fitzgerald.</p>
        
            <p>"We were expecting about 100 people, but we've got 180 who have turned out which has been fantastic," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've raised over $25,000, for our first time out we're just thrilled."</p>
        
            <p>After this year's success, Fitzgerald hoped to arrange polar plunges across the country next year.</p>

            <p>Senior Sergeant Andrzej Kowalczyk said he was "blown away" by the support for the event.</p>
        
            <p>"People who have got intellectual disabilities in our community, you know they face challenges on a day to day basis.</p>
        
            <p>"This is one way that the police can come together and partner up with Special Olympics New Zealand and do something special for them, and make a difference."</p>
        
            <p>And 'plungers' said they were only too happy to battle the icy water.</p>
        
            <p>"Refreshing, so good though ... so fun to actually get in there, it's great team bonding and such a wonderful cause," said Elise Bocknek, who was one of a team of Wellington Hospital staff taking a dip.</p>

            <p>"It was cold but invigorating now, well worth it," said Fire and Emergency staffer James Firestone.</p>
        
            <p>"All the people have just really embraced this, it's really nice to see people pushing their boundaries," he said.</p>
