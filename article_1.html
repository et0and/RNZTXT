            <p>Covid-19 booster vaccines are essential to help stem the tide of a fifth wave of the virus sweeping the country, epidemiologist Michael Baker says.</p>
        
            <p>In the seven days to 19 November, 7881 new cases were reported, up by almost 2000 on the previous week.</p>
        
            <p>Baker told Morning Report uptake of boosters had slowed, and people often did not know whether they were eligible.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone over 30 can get a booster at this stage if it's over six months since their last dose or last Covid infection," the Otago University public health professor said.</p>
        
            <p>Boosters were particularly vital for those aged over 75, MƒÅori and Pasifika over 65 or people with underlying health conditions, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>Of people aged 50 to 64, fewer than 40 percent had received their second booster.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the reason for the low rates was people becoming accustomed to living with the virus, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really our biggest infectious disease problem still.</p>
        
            <p>"If people are not getting their boosters, they're far more likely to go to hospital and that's going to put more pressure on the health system, so yes, it's essential."</p>
        
            <p>Baker wanted to see more awareness raised about booster eligibility by Te Whatu Ora and the Ministry of Health.</p>
        
            <p>Wastewater testing had indicated the country was seeing a peak Covid-19, with the highest number of cases since January.</p>
        
            <p>And it may be a recurring trend, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>"We expected that these waves would get smaller over time but now we're seeing the second wave for this year of a similar size [to the first in 2023], so this may be the reality of this virus.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time you are infected and re-infected, you run all of these additional risks, and we are worried about the mounting burden of long Covid. This is different from the way say influenza pandemics behave," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I do think as a society, we need to be taking a lot more precautions to decrease the risk of catching this virus over and over again."</p>
