            <p>The daughter of a woman injured by falling masonry on Auckland's Queen Street says she's yet to get answers from the council two weeks on.</p>
        
            <p>A small piece of concrete fell from 99 Queen Street mid-morning on 11 February, breaking through a glass canopy injuring a pedestrian walking underneath.</p>
        
            <p>The victim's daughter, Vicki, told RNZ her mother suffered a head injury that required stitches and an internal fracture on her ribs, as well as bruising down her side and some memory loss.</p>
        
            <p>Vicki said the masonry falling onto the canopy sounded like a bomb.</p>
        
            <p>"I was totally shocked," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it was a bomb, because it was a big noise at my back ... when I looked back my mum just next to me, she fell onto the ground, she thought she had been [shot].</p>
        
            <p>"Both of us were in a shocked condition."</p>
        
            <p>Vicki said she wanted to know who was responsible for what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really dangerous, it could've hurt anyone," Vicki said.</p>
        
            <p>She wrote to Auckland Council the day after the incident, when police handed to case back to them, asking for more details around what happened, and what was being done to address the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"I emailed the council on 11 February, and till now I still haven't heard anything back from them," Vicki said.</p>
        
            <p>Vicki said she had been walking in around the central city for the last 23 years or so, and had never experienced anything like what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want this kind of thing happening to anyone," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the council needs to ensure the compliance and health safety, to make sure every building [is compliant].</p>
        
            <p>"They should have certain strict compliance requirements before the building can be opened up to the public, or standing over there."</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to encourage people to use a helmet when you come into the city," she said.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Auckland Council said the loose masonry was due to water ingress, but they were not concerned with the building's overall structure or cladding.</p>
        
            <p>Compliance manager Adrian Wilson says work has been completed to make the building safe, and the dangerous building notice has been removed.</p>
        
            <p>"Any further work required would come under general maintenance and it is therefore the responsibility of the building owner to ensure that this occurs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Council did not respond to RNZ's question of why Vicki had not heard back.</p>
        
            <p>Since the accident, two others have been injured while walking on another Auckland CBD street.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called at 5.12pm on Monday to Lorne Street where a glass awning shattered, leaving one person in a moderate condition and another with minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Three crews assisted with the cleanup and making the area safe, Fire and Emergency said.</p>
