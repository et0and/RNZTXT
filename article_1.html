            <p>Passengers have been seen getting out of vehicles and walking alongside standstill traffic on the Kapiti Expressway, as queues and crashes caused chaos around the country.</p>
        
            <p>There were reports on social media of traffic backed up between ÅŒtaki and Levin with the drive taking 40 minutes on Wednesday - double what it usually would.</p>
        
            <p>Movement was slow heading north into Taihape, with a report of a 3km-line of traffic.</p>
        
            <p>And commuters heading from Auckland to Northland via SH1 were also in for a slow drive. Traffic was heavy before and through Warkworth, then again from Wayby through Wellsford up to Te Hana.</p>
        
            <p>For holidaymakers going south, Auckland's Southern Motorway was heavy from Manukau to Drury.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, multiple crashes throughout the country have also added to travel times.</p>
        
            <p>Both lanes on SH1 south of Sanson have now been closed after a campervan crashed near Rongotea just after midday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said no one has been injured.</p>
        
            <p>And Remutaka Hill has reopened in both directions after a three-vehicle crash that left one car on fire. Three people received minor to moderate injuries.</p>
