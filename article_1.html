            <p>A person who fatally stabbed a woman multiple times on a bus in Auckland's Onehunga on Wednesday is still on the run.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services rushed to Church St in Onehunga on Wednesday afternoon at about 2.30pm, following reports of a person being stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was initially in a critical condition and taken to Auckland City Hospital, but police confirmed she had died a few hours later.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are making urgent inquiries to locate the offender who has been identified through CCTV," a police spokesperson said on Wednesday evening, but no arrest has been announced since.</p>
        
            <p>A resident on nearby Victoria Street, who lives in a block of units, said police searched his home an hour after the attack, looking for the offender.</p>
        
            <p>The man said police told him they had been told someone had been seen running down the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know what was going on at that stage, they just asked if I consented to my house being searched because their dog wouldn't leave the area so I let them in."</p>
        
            <p>The man said there were between 15 to 20 officers, outside his home, who were mostly armed.</p>
        
            <p>"It was scary - I don't know why they pin-pointed my house, but they didn't find anything here."</p>
        
            <p>Police left his driveway shortly after 5pm, he said, but were still patrolling nearby hours later.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell has posted on social media describing the attack as a senseless homicide.</p>
        
            <p>My thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim of the senseless homicide on a bus today in Auckland. Police continue to urgently search for the offender who they have identified. This gratuitous violence has no place in our communities.</p>
        
            <p>Gary Froggett - the Auckland president of Tramways union - said he had worked in the bus driving industry for close to 60 years and had never heard of a person being killed on a bus before.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been an increase in violence and safety issues since Covid-19, but nothing to this extent.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had multiple calls from drivers following this death telling me they're concerned about their safety going back to work in the morning."</p>
        
            <p>Many bus drivers had left the job recently, Froggett said, as they'd had enough of violence against them and fights between members of the public.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport confirmed the assault involved a passenger on the number 74 bus service in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with our bus operator to provide support to the bus driver who witnessed this incident as well as our other customers who were onboard at the time," AT director of public transport Stacey van der Putten said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to working with our partner agencies and communities to turn the tide on violence and aggression in our public spaces."</p>
