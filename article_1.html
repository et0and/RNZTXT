            <p>Julian Savea is getting familiar with his new home at Moana Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>"I was pretty anxious at the start, but the boys have been welcoming," the former All Black winger said.</p>
        
            <p>"The pleasing thing is that Tana [Umaga] has set the tone around our expectations and our standards."</p>
        
            <p>And Savea said his personal goal is to "prove that I've still got it".Â </p>
        
            <p>"I'm not finished yet. I still want to be the best player in the comp."</p>
        
            <p>Savea departed the Hurricanes last year after playing 153 games for the franchise - their most-capped player.</p>
        
            <p>As a team, he'd like Moana to win games and place in the top eight.</p>
        
            <p>"It's within our grasp. Last year the boys didn't manage to get a [win], but we are looking forward to that challenge."</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old is also keen to take on a mentoring role, "bringing up the young boys in here".</p>
        
            <p>The ex-Hurricane told the young athletes: "Once you're here, there is a reason why you're here - and the hardest part is staying here.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to be approachable and make sure they can come to me about anything, whether it's rugby-related or off the field."</p>
        
            <p>Now eligible to play for Manu Samoa, Savea said there were chats with head coach Seilala Mapusua prior to the Rugby World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>"I was very close, but I got injured. I didn't want to go over injured and potentially take someone's spot."</p>
        
            <p>The winger said he was sure there would be more discussions around Manu Samoa, but nothing has been confirmed so far.</p>
        
            <p>The Luatuanuu, Siumu and Falesiu Uta athlete says being able to embrace his Samoan culture has been "different but it's nice".</p>
        
            <p>"It's been eye-opening - especially when they cater to your needs, you become a lot happier."</p>
        
            <p>Savea said that he was not a superstitious player when it comes to preparations before a game. However, he does like listening to slow jams like Mariah Carey's 'Always Be My Baby'.</p>
        
            <p>"It gets me up sometimes."</p>
        
            <p>Moana Pasifika open their season against Highlanders on 24 February.</p>
