            <p>Police investigating the death of a Hamilton man found in the Waikato River believe he was subject to a violent attack.</p>
        
            <p>John Wirihana Isaac, 52, was found dead in the river by members of the public who had taken their boat to the river on 18 January.</p>
        
            <p>Following a post-mortem police launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>In a media conference on Thursday, Detective Inspector Darrell Harpur said while he could not go into details of Isaac's death, he had multiple injuries and it was a violent death.</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said Isaac was quite distinctive, at 1.93 metres tall, and he often often rode a black bike around Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they wanted to hear from anyone who saw unusual activity at any of the bridges between Hamilton and Ngāruawāhia on the afternoon of 18 January, and asked for photos or videos people around the river may have taken.</p>
        
            <p>Isaac was believed to have travelled around the Hamilton area and was last seen wearing black cargo pants and a green pattern camouflage t-shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said Isaac had previous familial connections to the underworld and was known to police but was not a gang member.</p>
        
            <p>He had three children and a grandchild, Harpur said.</p>
