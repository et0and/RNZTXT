            <p>There are growing calls for random roadside drug testing after seven people were killed in crashes over the Easter weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The previous Labour government introduced legislation to allow for roadside drug testing - but Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the legislation was flawed and unworkable - after police could not find a suitable testing device.</p>
        
            <p>Labour spokesperson for police Ginny Andersen told Midday Report the legislation was not unworkable and the government could have implemented testing if they wanted to.</p>
        
            <p>Changes were made to the legislation in August 2023 - to back up the roadside saliva test with a laboratory test.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what Australia does and that's best practice to use," Andersen said.</p>

            <p>Legislation was being drafted and if the "current government wanted to enact that, they could have done so very quickly".</p>
        
            <p>It would have been ready to be enforced by August this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know why they haven't proceeded with the work that was undertaken back in August last year," Andersen said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the only technology available was a saliva test which could "throw a false positive".</p>
        
            <p>"This government's priorities are very different to ours and it does seem that cost is a prohibitive factor.</p>
        
            <p>"Potentially the cost of those lab tests or the cost of rolling this out nationwide may be one of the reasons why they haven't acted quicker than they have."</p>
        
            <p>For now, it was up to Brown and Police Minister Mark Mitchell to front up, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In March, Brown said a new legislation to enable roadside drug testing was on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>Last June, he called the state of roadside drug testing "another abject failure by Labour".</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the National Party suggested two roadside saliva tests for drug testing - if a driver failed both, then a sample from the second test will be sent to a lab.</p>
        
            <p>It had proposed to fund it by tapping into NZTA's road safety partnership programme with police.</p>
        
            <p>AA road safety spokesperson Dylan Thomsen said drivers were losing their lives as a result of risky behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the legislation would change this year to allow the use of drug testing devices like in Australia and Europe.</p>
