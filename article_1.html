            <p>A fellow shopper at the mall when McKay was killed says he believes the robbers were initially after her husband's watch.</p>
        
            <p>Dan Sheen said when the shots rang out "everybody just freaked out and ran for cover".</p>
        
            <p>"I was shopping in Whole Foods and I heard some shots ring out as I was walking out.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard the screech of the car, and then I heard what happened afterwards," Dan Sheen told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Sheen believed the robbers were initially after her husband's watch.</p>
        
            <p>"They went after a watch, that he was wearing, from what I understand he was wearing, and then they turned their attention to Patricia with the bag and there was a struggle there."</p>
        
            <p>Later Sheen realised his friend had been involved in trying to hold down one of the offenders.</p>

            <p>"He's the type of person that helps, he's the type of person that will protect someone innocent when something like this is happening.</p>
        
            <p>"He heard screaming... he ran over clotheslined, from what I understand, put his arm out when the guy was running away with the bag."</p>
        
            <p>Sheen said his friend tried to hold onto the man but was shot at by one of the other offenders who was in a car.</p>
        
            <p>"The person jumped in the car, the car sped away really quick and, unfortunately as I understand, ran over Patricia."</p>
        
            <p>Sheen, who has lived in Newport Beach since he was a child, said McKay's death was shocking and nothing like that had happened there before.</p>
