        <h2>Our groceries are officially more expensive than Australia, UK and Ireland</h2>
        <p>
The study looked at a basket of groceries in the four countries earlier this year, New Zealand was also the most expensive when adjusted for wages.

            <p>A new study has confirmed what many New Zealand shoppers already believed - supermarket prices are higher here than overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Australian researchers compared the prices of common grocery items in leading supermarkets in Australia, the UK, Ireland and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was the most expensive place to buy the items, with the UK the cheapest.</p>
        
            <p>Researchers from Edith Cowan University compared the prices of some common supermarket staples, including fruit and vegetables, milk, cheese, chocolate, meat, bread, coffee and some toiletries.</p>
        
            <p>Here's the winning order on price alone:</p>

            <p>Associate Professor Flavio Macau and Dr Alex Wang collected data on 44 grocery items between April and May this year.</p>
        
            <p>The comparison looked at the two largest supermarkets in each country.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand that meant Pak'n'Save and Countdown (Woolworths), which have a 70 percent share of the market.</p>
        
            <p>In Australia Coles and Woolworths (65 percent market share), in the UK Tescos and Sainsbury (42 percent market share), and Ireland Dunnes and Tescos (45 percent market share).</p>
        
            <p>When adjusting for wages the ranking from cheapest to most expensive was:</p>
        
            <p>Macau said there were some reasons why groceries were more expensive in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was as isolated as Australia, somewhat excluded from main global supply chain corridors, with a small population, and heavily reliant on imports, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Macau said the duopoly was even stronger than in Australia, and he had expected product prices to be more alike.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a surprise to see considerable differences in prices for grocery online shopping.</p>
        
            <p>"That it was a race towards the top, towards a more expensive basket, was less of a surprise."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said New Zealand supermarkets were underperforming compared to their overseas counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>"In NZ, it pays even more to do your homework and actively compare prices before shopping.</p>
        
            <p>"And potentially you need to build even more bridges between local producers and consumers as an important tool to fight the cost-of-living crisis."</p>
        
            <p>The research comes as the Commerce Commission blocked Foodstuffs North and South Island divisions from merging.</p>
        
            <p>And intense focus in Australia and New Zealand on supermarket pricing and practices.</p>
