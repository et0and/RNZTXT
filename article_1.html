        <h2>Can pets get carsick?</h2>
        <p>
If you're hitting the road this summer and planning to take your cat or dog with you, it's time to start thinking about how you can get them adjusted to long car rides.

            <p>Just like humans, your pets can get carsick or anxious about going on the road to the point they won't want to return to the car again. But there are some tips and tricks to keep in mind to keep them calm and your car ride smooth and vomit-free.</p>
        
            <p>For dogs, carsick symptoms may display as pacing, excessive drooling, smacking or licking of their lips, lethargy or vomiting and defecation. Cats can display similar symptoms with vomiting, defecation, feigning sleep or being lethargic and can be quite vocal.</p>
        
            <p>SPCA scientific officer Dr Alison Vaughan says generally, there are two reasons why your cat or dog might be carsick - motion sickness or anxiety from negative associations of the crate and car, and usually it's a combination of both.</p>
        
            <p>"We know, for example, a lot of kittens don't get a lot of positive exposures to going in the cat carrier or to going in the car, that usually those things happen for cats when they're going somewhere they don't want to like the vets."</p>
        
            <p>Brachycephalic or shorter-nosed and flat-faced breeds of cats (such as Persian, British shorthairs, and Scottish fold) and dogs (bulldogs, pugs, and boxers) can also be more susceptible to heat exhaustion, which adds to the anxiety of car trips if they've experienced that, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Animal behaviourist Mark Vette says pet carsickness is a common problem, but it is treatable, and he's helped hundreds of cats and dogs overcome this problem.</p>

            <p>If the carsickness is due to anxiety, it's important to break down travel into smaller increments and take them to fun places - like the beach or park for dogs - to create a positive association, Vette says.</p>
        
            <p>"When they're anxious, they're out of learning state … they're in flight or fight, in sympathetic arousal, adrenaline's pumping.</p>
        
            <p>"So a big part of it, from a behaviourist's point of view, is we're trying to switch them into a non-anxious state and then expose them systematically from easy to difficult [car trips]."</p>
        
            <p>Try "clicker training" to get your pet into the car while it's not moving to change how they feel about it. Gradually add another element like turning the engine on and off, then begin taking short trips around the block, Vette says.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm doing a short distance travel, I get someone sitting beside them to click and reward them and just keep their mind off the travel and on the food and focused on learning. And then I just systematically expose them.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're in early training, they [dogs] should get out regularly, every half an hour maybe, up to an hour … Then you can stretch to an hour and then you can make it a couple hours."</p>

Make sure your cat has enough space in its carrier for long trips, Dr Alison Vaughan says. (file image)

            <p>Travel conditioning your pet is easier when they're in their formative years because that's when they are still developing their vestibular system (the sensory system that helps them balance) and in learning mode, Vette says.</p>
        
            <p>Pets develop a bond not only with their owner but the site too, so if you can make their carrier a place for them to sleep at home, they can get used to it as safe place, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Most cats are very territorial and don't like to move out of their territory, and so you've got that added anxiety straight away.</p>
        
            <p>"I make the crate into a bed site as well. I set it up high, I cover it over, I take the door off or open the door, and I set it up so they can jump on that crate and sleep in it and feed in it and get used to it. I want them to love their crate. Similarly, with a dog we do the same."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Vaughan likes to spray down a light towel with some pheromone spray, which is said to mimic chemicals released naturally by dogs and cats that act as invisible communication, and cover her cat's carrier to help reduce any anxiety.</p>

            <p>Chat to your vet, they may be able to offer medication that will reduce symptoms of anxiety and motion sickness, Dr Vaughan says.</p>
        
            <p>You can also give dogs chew toys or supply cats with a piece of their bedding that might have a smell that comforts them, Vette says.</p>
        
            <p>"I tend to make sure that the animal is oriented forward and it's better if they can see things in the distance ahead of them, when they travel, than if you orient them sideways or backwards."</p>
        
            <p>As a general rule, don't feed your pet two hours before travel, except if you are travel training them with a small amount of food rewards, he says.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Vaughan says regular breaks are handy so pets can stretch and relieve themselves. But for cats, getting out whilst on a road trip may not be possible, so making sure they have enough space in their carrier is important.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, seek your vet's opinion for advice concerning your pet's individual needs.</p>
