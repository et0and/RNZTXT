            <p>Kāinga Ora has banned a 93-year-old Auckland pensioner and his friends from meeting for happy hour drinks in their public housing complex's common room.</p>
        
            <p>The group has been meeting every Friday for five years to socialise over a wine and shandy at Ellerslie's 66-unit Ladies Mile complex, tenant Lisa Howard says.</p>
        
            <p>The venerable pensioner parties typically run from 4pm to 6pm, with regular attendees all aged 58 or over, she told the Herald.</p>
        
            <p>However, Kāinga Ora now says it will close the ground-floor community room after 4pm to stop residents drinking alcohol in it.</p>
        
            <p>There have been recent noise complaints in the evening, and activities in the room should not "negatively impact" others, it said.</p>
        
            <p>
Residents say a wild night for them ends at 8.30pm and can't understand why their drinks are being shut down. Pictured from front first and with first names only: Noreen, Barry, Bill and Betty. Second row: Lilly, Lisa, Kathleen, Sybil. Back row: Greg, Bob, Mark, Carol and George.

            <p>But Howard said she is not aware of any recent noise complaints, and the soirees alleviate loneliness and promote community spirit.</p>
        
            <p>And with bad knees and hips putting paid to any hell-raising, she said the events end early: no later than 8.30pm even on rare "milestone" nights like birthday celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not exactly like we're going to be out there destroying public property and dancing on the tables," Howard said.</p>
        
            <p>"Christ, half of us can't even get up off our chairs."</p>
        
            <p>The dispute first flared late last year, Howard said, when her group "got a bit noisy for an elderly gentleman that lives upstairs above the common room" and he complained to the public housing agency's property managers.</p>
        
            <p>Her group made an effort to ensure they did not make as much noise again, she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, John Tubberty, Kāinga Ora's regional director for Central and East Auckland, said the community room is designed as a "welcoming place where tenants can connect, host events, and create a sense of community" and while tenants are allowed to drink in their own rooms, alcohol is not permitted in the community room.</p>
        
            <p>He said as a landlord, Kāinga Ora has a responsibility to protect the quiet enjoyment of all its tenants.</p>
        
            <p>Yet Howard claimed Kāinga Ora's actions lacked sensitivity. She said a Kāinga Ora employee put up an alcohol ban notice on the day the group was holding its last Friday drinks before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Howard says she told the employee to "cut that out".</p>
        
            <p>"I said: 'It's right on Christmas, there's no official policy and it's not in our tenancy agreement, so it doesn't stand'."</p>
        
            <p>
Kāinga Ora this week sent a letter to its senior tenants, saying their common room partying days are over.

            <p>Yet, the issue has not gone away.</p>
        
            <p>Tubberty has received more noise complaints in recent weeks, he said.</p>
        
            <p>His team responded last week by dropping letters in every residents' letterbox.</p>
        
            <p>The letter stated the room would now only open Monday-Friday from 9am-4pm and would be locked at all other times.</p>
        
            <p>"We will keep this under review but for now this arrangement will remain in place to ensure a comfortable and inclusive environment for everyone," the letter said.</p>
        
            <p>"They keep saying they're 'bringing communities together' and now they're trying to stop us from using that room," Howard said.</p>
        
            <p>The soirees have only about 8-10 regulars, including one aged in his 90s, and some do not drink because they are on medication, Howard claimed.</p>
        
            <p>"We play easy listening music and we just have a laugh and giggle - that's our Friday night," Howard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're finished by usually six o'clock ... and half-past-eight when it's been a milestone."</p>
