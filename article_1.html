            <p>The countdown to the end of the year is well and truly on and many of us have turned our minds to those long summer days and a well-earned break.</p>
        
            <p>So how can you use the least amount of annual leave, for the longest stretch of time off? And when are the key dates to be aware of in 2025?</p>
        
            <p>Christmas Day and Boxing Day, as well as the New Year's statutory holidays fall on a Wednesday and Thursday in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Use those stat days, along with six days of annual leave, to take off 23, 24 and 27 December, along with 30 and 31 December and 3 January to get a 16-day stretch of time off work.</p>
        
            <p>These fall in the same week next year so, by booking annual leave for 14-17 and 22-24 April, you'll use seven days of annual leave, but get 16 days off work.</p>
        
            <p>Waitangi Day falls on a Thursday, so by using one annual leave day on Friday, 7 February, you'll get a four-day weekend.</p>
        
            <p>While exact start dates for individual schools differ, Term 1 starts between Monday 27 January and Friday 7 February (at the latest).</p>
        
            <p>Term 1 is 11 weeks long, with the last day being 11 April.</p>
        
            <p>The first lot of school holidays run from 12 April to 27 April and include Easter and Anzac Day.</p>
