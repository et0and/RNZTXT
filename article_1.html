            <p>Delays and confusion in mass casualty shootings like the Christchurch terror attack are not uncommon, an emergency medicine expert says.</p>
        
            <p>United States-based Dr John Hick has praised police and paramedics who responded to the massacre at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre that left 51 worshippers dead on 15 March 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He told the inquest initial confusion and delays were common in situations where many people were dead or injured.</p>
        
            <p>"With 49 initial fatalities and 51 wounded in two different locations, the demands of the ambulance and hospital system were intense and delays in the care delivered are expected due to scene safety concerns, assessment time for the 100 victims, identifying the living and moving them to an ambulance for transport," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are many competing demands on police dispatchers and initially, an unclear understanding of the situation and victims is common."</p>
        
            <p>But Dr Hick also highlighted some areas that could be improved to help emergency services work better together if such an incident occurred in the future.</p>
        
            <p>While Fire and Emergency New Zealand was no involved in the response to the terror attack, he said the agency was an "excellent resource" and it was "imperative" that they be more integrated with police in such an incident.</p>

            <p>Hick said St John should consider automatically dispatching multiple ambulances once a mass casualty incident was declared.</p>
        
            <p>He also suggested adding "stop the bleed" kits to police equipment and using the same codes for police and paramedics to understand when a scene was safe to enter.</p>
        
            <p>First responders needed a rapid "dead or alive" triage policy, with a focus on taking injured people to hospital as soon as possible, Hick said.</p>
        
            <p>Hick said he would also encourage multiple patients being transported in one ambulance, or in private vehicles, if necessary.</p>
        
            <p>The Coroners Court earlier heard people at Al Noor Mosque were told to leave the grounds and even threatened with arrest when they asked to go back inside to help the dying.</p>
        
            <p>Hick told the court he agreed with officers' handling of the situation because they had to prioritise making the mosque safe and there was no time to explain or negotiate with bystanders.</p>

            <p>"They are not there in that time to help heal or even to understand, nor do they have time to explain. They're focused on minimising additional loss of life, but that does not mean that they don't care," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fears a backpack found at the mosque was an improvised explosive device were unfounded, but if it was a home-made bomb, Hick said the was a risk everyone could have been killed.</p>
        
            <p>Hick also recommended joint training and exercises between police, St John and FENZ so staff were better prepared for any future attack.</p>
        
            <p>Given the policies and protocols that were in place prior to the attack, Hick said: "I would have expected a much higher degree of failure in this situation."</p>
        
            <p>The inquest has examined the following 10 issues over seven weeks:</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
