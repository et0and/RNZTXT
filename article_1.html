            <p>Māori All Blacks selectors of Ross Filipo (Muaūopko), Roger Randle (Ngāti Awa), Greg Feek (Ngāti Kahugunu) and Jamie Joseph (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Rārua, Rangitāne) have announced a 28-strong squad.</p>

            <p>The Blues' Corey Evans (Te Aupouri, Ngāti Kahu), Cole Forbes (Ngāti Awa) and Laghlan McWhannell (Ngāti Kahungunu) have been selected for the first time, while Marcel Renata (Ngāti Whanaunga, Ngāi Takoto) and Cameron Suafoa (Ngāpuhi) have also earned selection following a remarkable season with the Auckland-based franchise.</p>

            <p>Moody will add to an already formidable forward pack alongside Billy Harmon (Ngāi Tahu) Isaia Walker-Leawere (Ngāti Porou) and Pouri Rakete-Stones (Ngāpuhi) who represent a wealth of experience, leadership and guidance in the squad.</p>
        
            <p>Among the debutants is Chiefs midfielder Daniel Rona (Te Ātiawa) and Highlanders loose forward Nikora Broughton (Ngā Rauru, Ngāti Ruanui). The Crusaders first five eighth duo of Rivez Reihana (Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Hine, Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Tūwharetoa) and Taha Kemara (Te Whānau a Apanui, Te Whakatōhea) will also bring plenty of speed and accuracy to the back line in their first campaign.</p>

            <p>Māori All Blacks head coach Ross Filipo said it was an exciting time for all those involved.</p>
        
            <p>"The Super Rugby Pacific campaign provided us with a solid platform to select from as the competitiveness shown by the players is exactly what we need against Japan XV. Our new players have been rewarded for their consistency and it's great to see the return of many others to this environment," Filipo said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to congratulate every player in our squad on their selection. Playing for this team is a huge honour and this is an opportunity for us all to represent our whānau, heritage and country on the world stage."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Māori Rugby Board chairperson professor Dame Farah Palmer (Ngāti Maniapoto, Waikato) said the Māori All Blacks served a greater purpose than rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our pou in the New Zealand Māori Rugby strategy is angitutanga - uplifting Māori lives. We want Māori to be successful as Māori and to pursue excellence and we know they will represent our culture with mana on the international stage," Dame Farah said.</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of the Māori Rugby Board, I'd like to congratulate every player and their whānau on making the Māori All Blacks. We are immensely proud of you and cannot wait to support you all in this campaign."</p>
        
            <p>The squad was announced in a live broadcast segment on Whakaata Māori on Tuesday morning, with support from New Zealand Māori Rugby Board representative Rob Clark (Waikato), who was accompanied by Māori All Blacks cultural advisor Te Wehi Wright (Ngāruahine, Ngāti Rangitihi, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Whitikaupeka, Ngāti Kahungunu ki Te Wairoa, Ngāti Raukawa).</p>
        
            <p>The Māori All Blacks have assembled in Auckland to start their campaign preparations before heading to Japan on Wednesday, 26 June.</p>
        
            <p>They will play their first match at Tokyo's historic Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium on Saturday, 29 June, with the following match on Saturday, 6 July at Toyota Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The 28-strong squad is as follows with (iwi, province and Super Rugby club).</p>
