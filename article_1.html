            <p>Police officers have overwhelmingly rejected the latest pay offer, saying it falls short of addressing their concerns and needs.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Association said more than 75 percent of its members voted against the offer, which Police Minister Mark Mitchell said included the overtime rate the union asked for, a $1500 cash payment for members, a pay increase in the third year.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Mitchell said this was an incredibly disappointing outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"The offer was significantly better than what was presented in August last year, with an additional quarter of a billion dollars of government funding.</p>
        
            <p>"The government has been very open about the financial challenges we've inherited, and despite the challenging environment, this was a markedly better offer."</p>
        
            <p>He said the pay increase in the offer was "well beyond the forecast rate of inflation - something which may not have been guaranteed under the offer made last August".</p>
        
            <p>Last month, police described the previous pay offer as "insulting", "disgusting" and "demoralising" as members were presented with the same offer which they had rejected in September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association president Chris Cahill said members were looking for a sincere effort by the government to address the cost of living crisis and recognise the increasing dangers officers faced.</p>
        
            <p>"This offer fails to provide any real attempt to remedy the steady decline in officers' salaries, particularly when measured against comparable professions' salaries, such as teachers and nurses," Cahill said.</p>
        
            <p>"If police and the government genuinely value the role and commitment of officers, they need to lift their game in the remuneration stakes. They have one more chance to do that."</p>
        
            <p>The Police Association will now ask the mediator to immediately direct negotiations to final offer arbitration.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a clear expectation that government will now fund police to improve what it puts on the table at final offer arbitration," Cahill said.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the arbitration process would add more time to what had already been a lengthy process.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a matter for police and the association to work through those steps, and I'm not in a position to comment further while that process is underway."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Mitchell admitted this government could not compete with the salaries Australia was offering New Zealand officers in a recruitment campaign it had launched.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has previously backed Mitchell on the negotiations, saying he was "very focused".</p>
        
            <p>"I think what you're hearing from police, and what I hear from police is, they appreciate the fact that they know they've now got a government from the top that is actually going to make sure that we uphold rights and responsibilities in this country."</p>
