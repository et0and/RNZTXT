            <p>The worst of the strong winds, thunderstorms and rain that hit many parts of the country on Monday may have passed, but the temperatures around New Zealand are set to plummet on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A deep low moved through New Zealand on Monday, with extensive heavy rainfall across much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Several roads were closed and flights were delayed or cancelled. More than 1000 households in Kaiapoi were without power for several hours on Monday night.</p>

            <p>The blustery winds are set to continue tomorrow, and are expected to generate large waves along the western coastlines of both the North and South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Blustery winds continue into Tuesday - this time from the southwestThey also generate large waves along the western coastlines of both the North and South Island, so be sure to take extra care near the water on Tuesdayhttps://t.co/AlVlYMDz7z pic.twitter.com/FqWfvOGnlJ</p>
        
            <p>But MetService meteorologist Karl Loots told RNZ Nights the worst of the wild weather had now passed.</p>
        
            <p>"The good news is that this cold front which has brought in this severe weather is moving very quickly and tonight we've just got a few hours of heavy rainfall expected in Bay of Plenty and the Gisborne region, and this front is now moving east of the country."</p>
        
            <p>Loots said it would be much cooler across much of the country tomorrow, with far less humidity.</p>
        
            <p>Few places are expected to get warmer than 20c tomorrow, with Dunedin and Queenstown only expected to reach 12c. MetService has also warned the wind chill will make it feel even colder.</p>
        
            <p>Loots said there was some good news for later in the week.</p>
        
            <p>"On Thursday, for much of the South Island especially, we're going to see much milder temperatures return, maximums back in the mid-20s for much of Canterbury and Otago."</p>
