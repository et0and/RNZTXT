            <p>A 30-year-old man appeared in Auckland District Court on Monday after a nine-year-old boy was hit over the head with a shovel at the end of a pro-Palestinian rally on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Superintendent Sunny Patel said the accused faced two charges - wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm with a weapon and intent to injure with a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>Patel said the assault happened behind the town hall as crowds were leaving following demonstrations in the city, and was not politically motivated.</p>
        
            <p>He said the man was under mental health supervision and the young victim remained in a stable condition in Starship Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Three other people who were arrested at the protest have not been charged.</p>
