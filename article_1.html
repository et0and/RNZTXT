        <h2>Single gene behind a disorder that causes intellectual disability - study</h2>
        <p>
Scientists have found the genetic root of a disorder that causes intellectual disability, which they estimate affects as many as one in 20,000 young people.

            <p>Scientists have found the genetic root of a disorder that causes intellectual disability, which they estimate affects as many as one in 20,000 young people.</p>
        
            <p>They hope their discovery leads to a new diagnosis that can provide answers to families.</p>
        
            <p>Those with the condition have a constellation of issues, which also include short stature, small heads, seizures and low muscle mass, said the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Medicine on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"We were struck by how common this disorder is" when compared with other rare diseases linked to a single gene, said Ernest Turro of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, senior author of the study.</p>
        
            <p>Syndromes like these could go unnoticed because the traits were sometimes so subtle doctors could not recognise them by just looking at patients, said Dr Charles Billington, a paediatric geneticist at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the study.</p>
        
            <p>"So certainly this wasn't something that we necessarily had a name for," he said. "We're learning more about these syndromes that we recognise only once we are seeing the cause."</p>
        
            <p>Researchers said the mutations occurred in a small "non-coding" gene, meaning it did not provide instructions for making proteins.</p>
        
            <p>Until now, all but nine of the nearly 1500 genes known to be linked to intellectual disability in general are protein-coding genes.</p>
        
            <p>Most large genetic studies so far have used a sequencing technology that typically leaves out genes that did not code for proteins.</p>
        
            <p>This study used more comprehensive "whole-genome" sequencing data from 77,539 people enrolled in the British 100,000 Genomes Project, including 5529 with an intellectual disability.</p>
        
            <p>The rare mutations researchers found in the gene, called RNU4-2, were strongly associated with the potential to develop intellectual disability.</p>
        
            <p>The finding "opens the door to diagnoses" for thousands of families, said study author Andrew Mumford, research director of the South West England NHS Genomic Medicine Service.</p>
        
            <p>More research was needed, Mumford said.</p>
        
            <p>How the mutation caused the disorder remained unclear and there was no treatment.</p>
        
            <p>But Billington said labs should be able to offer testing for this condition relatively quickly.</p>
        
            <p>And researchers said families should be able to find and support each other - and know they were not alone.</p>
        
            <p>"That can be incredibly comforting," Mumford said.</p>
