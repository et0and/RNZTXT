            <p>The father of a boy who was assaulted at an East Auckland intermediate school says he does not know why his son was attacked.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Choo's son, 12, suffered cuts on his cheek after allegedly being punched by another student at Somerville Intermediate, on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened between his son and another student during their lunch break, Choo said.</p>
        
            <p>"The other classroom student, [beat] him," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My son [was] real hurt, and bleeding."</p>
        
            <p>His son wore glasses, which would have been pushed into his face as he was punched, Choo said. He had no idea why his son was attacked, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"No reason, yeah, no reason," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't understand [why] the student hurt my son."</p>
        
            <p>Choo said the school needed to communicate with the parents of the other student to get answers as to what happened and why.</p>
        
            <p>"The school should follow up for this case, communicate for the parents, but the moment, the school, [has not given] any response," Choo said.</p>
        
            <p>After RNZ contacted Choo, he informed reporters the school's principal had called him to arrange a meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were aware of the attack, with officers responding just before 4pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim suffered serious facial injuries and was taken to hospital," a police spokesperson said</p>
        
            <p>"Enquiries are in the very early stages and police are working hard to understand the circumstances surrounding the incident. Victim support is being provided."</p>
        
            <p>Somerville Intermediate declined RNZ's request for comment.</p>
