"Not even a flying F50 was stopping this ferry," SailGP said on its official Instagram account.

            <p>An Auckland ferry cruised through the SailGP course last week, and near several catamarans out on the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Not even a flying F50 was stopping this ferry," SailGP said on its official Instagram account.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland Transport spokesperson says the Bayswater ferry's skipper was called through by the race marshal on Thursday during a SailGP practice session.</p>
        
            <p>"At no point did the ferry get to within 50 metres of any of the SailGP catamarans, and passenger safety was never put at risk."</p>
        
            <p>The harbour was open to all vessels at the time, they said, "and SailGP organisers had been notified of all ferry sailing channels within the harbour".</p>
        
            <p>The ferry slowed down for several SailGP catamarans in Auckland Harbour, the spokesperson said.</p>
