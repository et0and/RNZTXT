            <p>The family of Zara Mitchell have expressed their forgiveness for the teenager who caused her death in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Michael Rapson was behind the wheel of a car which smashed into a house near Rangiora after fleeing police early on 17 September.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, he was sentenced to three and a half years' jail.</p>
        
            <p>Rapson was an 18-year-old learner driver at the time of the crash, had smoked a significant amount of cannabis, the vehicle was not road-worthy, and had been pink-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>Just hours before the crash, he had been directed to drive straight home at no more than 50km/h by a police officer.</p>
        
            <p>But little over two hours later, police were called to a report of illegal street racing in the Fernside area about 4.45am.</p>
        
            <p>An officer noted the vehicle Rapson was driving was subject to a non-operation order.</p>
        
            <p>Police pursued briefly, but abandoned it due to the manner of his driving.</p>
        
            <p>A summary of facts said Rapson was driving the vehicle at speeds of 167km/h to 178km/h in a 50km/h zone.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, police found the vehicle crashed into a house after it appeared to have hit a tree.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was travelling about 140km/h when Rapson lost control, according to the summary of facts.</p>
        
            <p>Zara Mitchell died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Two others were injured as a result of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>But Mitchell's family took the opportunity to express their sympathy and forgiveness for Rapson when he appeared in the High Court on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe Adam has hit rock-bottom and the choices he made that night, he has to live with forever," Mitchell's mother Anna told the court.</p>
        
            <p>"He has taken responsibility for his actions, even donating all his savings to help pay for the cost of her funeral."</p>
        
            <p>Rapson had written a letter to the family expressing his deep remorse his decisions on that morning.</p>
        
            <p>"He wrote how [Mitchell] was trying to convince him to get his life together and get on the straight and narrow," Anna said.</p>
        
            <p>She described her 18-year-old daughter as the light of the world and a mother hen to her younger siblings.</p>
        
            <p>One of Mitchell's younger sisters told the court she had got to know Rapson since the death of her sister.</p>
        
            <p>Instead of growing to resent him, she had instead grown to respect and forgive him.</p>
        
            <p>"He has shown nothing but honesty, remorse and respect for my family," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Rachel Dunningham was moved by the family's sentiments.</p>
        
            <p>"These are powerful statements and I express my admiration for Zara's family in being so forgiving in the face of such a loss."</p>
        
            <p>Rapson was earlier convicted of one count of manslaughter, two of dangerous driving causing injury, one of fleeing the police, one of driving unaccompanied on a learner licence, and one of driving a vehicle ordered off the road.</p>
        
            <p>The now 19-year-old was also disqualified from driving for three years after leaving prison.</p>
