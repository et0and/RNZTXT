            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau now supports selling the city's airport shares, after she made changes to the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau previously opposed Wellington City Council selling its 34 percent stake in the airport, but yesterday was among the majority of councillors who voted to consult the public about the plan.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau told Morning Report that was because of an amendment she pushed through, meaning the proceeds would be used to set up a green investment fund, instead of paying down debt.</p>
        
            <p>She would not usually support selling council assets, but said the council needed to be smarter about its investments given the increasing risks from climate change and higher insurance premiums.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a change in position," Whanau said.</p>
        
            <p>"But by prioritising this perpetual green investment fund, which has actually worked in councils like New Plymouth, I felt a lot more comfortable."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors made several cost-saving and future-proofing decisions in a meeting on 9 November to shape financial plans for the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>They agreed unanimously to scrap $230 million for repairs of Te NgƒÅkau Civic Square and the City to Sea Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>About $135m of funding for cycleways and footpaths was scrapped.</p>
        
            <p>Plans for improved pedestrian access on the Golden Mile were still progressing, but some sustainable transport plans were likely to be put on hold, after the new government formed, Whanau said.</p>
        
            <p>"I will keep supporting the Golden Mile and projects that have already been signed off by council, but I've acknowledged things light light rail, I understand will probably be let go.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a humbling experience... but the incoming government has been very open about that and I need to work with what we can</p>
        
            <p>"I looking forward to sitting down with them and saying 'look, if it's not going to be light rail, how else can we achieve effective public transport and more urban development for our growing population?'," Whanau said.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party previously said if it was elected, it would scrap Let's Get Wellington Moving, an initiative aimed at reducing traffic on the Golden Mile - from Lambton Quay to Courtenay Place - and other sustainable transport projects.</p>
        
            <p>National transport spokesperson Simeon Brown has said improvements were still needed along Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place.</p>
