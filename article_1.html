        <h2>'End of an era': NZ loses Winter Games</h2>
        <p>
Fans, athletes and administrators are reeling from the news that the annual Winter Games New Zealand event will no longer be held due to "adverse economic conditions".

            <p>Feelings of sadness, nostalgia and determination are coursing through the New Zealand snow sports community today.</p>
        
            <p>Fans, athletes and administrators are reeling from the news that the annual Winter Games New Zealand event will no longer be held due to "adverse economic conditions".</p>
        
            <p>Snow Sports New Zealand chief executive Nic Cavanagh admitted it was a dark day for the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"Saddened, not only for Snow Sports New Zealand friends and family, but the wider snow community in the Southern hemisphere. There's a lot of emotion and a lot of feeling out there at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>The multi-sport event had been held mostly in the Queenstown-Lakes district since 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Cavanagh said while gutting news, the community was galvanising to secure a future for snow sports in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"Very much an end of an era. We may see winter games back in a different guise in the future and we look forward to seeing what that might look like when they're ready to do that."</p>
        
            <p>Some of the country's most successful ever winter olympians, including snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott and skier Nico Porteous, had been regular competitors.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to be something that is going to be sorely missed. Our elite athletes are well versed at travelling and competing internationally, so it's not going to impact them too much.</p>
        
            <p>"But the impact is probably going to be on the next generation of athletes coming through, Winter Games has always given them a great opportunity to compete against the world's best at home."</p>

            <p>Cavanagh said he was hopeful the games would return in some form.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to have to work hard to make sure that we can find other opportunities, not only for training, but for competition in the next foreseeable future."</p>
        
            <p>In light of the bombshell, Cavanagh said they had also been sure to reflect on the success of the event.</p>
        
            <p>"We also tip our hats and celebrate the work that Winter Games has done, it's been critical to underpinning most of our success. Zoi and Nico cut their teeth at the games.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's also a time to celebrate, a time back to look back and acknowledge the work of all of those trailblazers and recognise the amazing mahi that they've done to get snow sports where it is and to provide opportunities for our athletes."</p>
