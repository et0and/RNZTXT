            <p>It is the busiest day of the year for Auckland Airport with 63,000 people expected to arrive or leave on flights - including 17,900 travellers taking off to international destinations.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ spoke to some of those travellers on Friday among the sea of luggage trollies stacked five suitcases high and tearful farewells.</p>
        
            <p>William was on his way to London and said the airport was packed.</p>
        
            <p>"My [check-in] line wasn't too bad. I don't think there are too many on my flight, but I can see everywhere else it's crazy.</p>
        
            <p>Tania was seeing her daughter off to spend Christmas in New York and said the check-in hall was chaotic.</p>
        
            <p>"My other daughter was just saying we should have two lanes, one for [people walking] one way and one for the other way."</p>
        
            <p>Hannah had just checked in for her flight to Hong Kong.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a little bit hectic though with the oversized baggage, the system. It was a bit stressful. It's pretty chaotic down there, I haven't experienced this in a while."</p>
        
            <p>Lovleen was preparing her bag for security before her flight to India and said the airport was the busiest she had ever seen it.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't anticipate this sort of rush. I think I got super lucky because Singapore Airlines isn't that busy, compared with Fiji [Airways] I saw it was rushed out there. It took me about five minutes for the whole [check-in] process but I think this immigration step is where it will take some more time."</p>

            <p>Auckland Airport chief customer officer Scott Tasker said the equivalent of the population of New Plymouth would be on flights.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been preparing for several months alongside our airline partners, their ground handlers and the government border agencies to ensure that travellers have the smoothest possible experience today and through the summer peak season."</p>
        
            <p>Tasker said the airport would be a buzz of activity as travel returned to 93 percent of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        
            <p>He said one of the ways people could avoid being a Grinch was to empty pockets before security.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're a departing traveller get to the airport a little early as the roads will be busy, as will the carparks and terminals.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're travelling internationally there is no need to go to the check in until three hours before departure, because that is when the check in for your flight will open. Be prepared for inspection at the aviation security checkpoint. Don't bring your non-compliant items."</p>
        
            <p>For anyone still to head to the airport this holiday season, it's a good to time to make your packing list, check it twice and make sure you have not left your child Home Alone.</p>
