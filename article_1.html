            <p>A Wellington City councillor has taken her colleagues to task at the first public council meeting since government intervention.</p>
        
            <p>This morning's Long-Term Plan, Finance, And Performance Committee meeting came just days after Local Government Minister Simeon Brown announced his intention to intervene at Wellington City Council, appointing a Crown Observer.</p>
        
            <p>The council has to amend its long-term plan (LTP) after it voted to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport..</p>
        
            <p>The sale was a key part of the council's long-term plan with the money from it set to create an investment fund that would cover the council's insurance risk - which is estimated to have blown out to $2.6 billion.</p>
        
            <p>At today's meeting, committee chairperson councillor Rebecca Matthews told fellow councillors it would not be an easy process.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all going to see things that we love not happen, or happen later, or happen in a different way as a result of the decisions that have been made."</p>
        
            <p>She said councillors were under increased scrutiny from the government and the media and hoped to see an improvement in behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"That has been highlighted to us by the minister, and I think we all need to take that extremely seriously."</p>
        
            <p>Matthews said she had increasingly observed that if councillors had not voted for something they believed it had no validity.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to come up with this amendment and we need to respect the validity of the decision once we have made it."</p>
        
            <p>She said that councillors would not all agree on the decisions that needed to be made in order to have a financially prudent LTP amendment, but they needed to get on and do it anyway.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to look forward, get on with it and do so in a way that can increase confidence in our decision-making, otherwise there will not be a next election for us."</p>
        
            <p>Initial decisions on the amended LTP are expected on 21 November, with a draft budget expected by 11 December.</p>
