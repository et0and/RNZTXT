            <p>A student has been seriously hurt and taken to hospital after an assault at Wellington Girls' College.</p>
        
            <p>Police said emergency services were called to the school on Pipitea Street in Thorndon just after 10am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>One person had been seriously injured and was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Girls' College confirmed it was two students involved.</p>
        
            <p>"We did briefly ask students to stay in their classrooms to protect the privacy of the two students involved," principal Julia Davidson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>:Please be assured the school remains open and safe and classes and lunchtime activities are continuing as normal."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were speaking to the second person.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Wellington woman said she was not suprised about a serious assault at the school.</p>
        
            <p>She said it seemed violence between young people was increasingly common.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate and assaults amoung young people aren't acceptable and we need to try and address that together."</p>
        
            <p>The woman said the incident was troubling.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
