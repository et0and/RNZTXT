            <p>Santa may need to bring a raincoat and gumboots as parts of the motu are in for a wet Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop over parts of the northern and central North Island this afternoon and evening.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Hawke's Bay, Tararua and Auckland from 1pm to 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the thunderstorms will accompanied by heavy rain and could produce localised downpours.</p>
        
            <p>Rainfall rates of between 25 and 40 millimetres an hour are likely, which could cause surface or flash flooding.</p>
        
            <p>It said the storms should die away this evening, but there is a further risk of thunderstorms in those areas tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>An orange heavy rain warning is also in place for Taranaki Maunga until 11am tomorrow morning, with warnings for the Tararua Range until 9am, and the ranges of Westland south of Otira in place until 8am tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch is in place for the Tasman ranges west of Motueka from 2pm today until midnight.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said it would be hot and muggy for the rest of the country.</p>
        
            <p>"As we head into the final days towards Christmas, we'll find our weather dominated by some pretty warm and muggy air," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[There's] an area of low pressure that's one of the systems introducing all this warm and muggy air over us."</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas Day itself, while there would have been rain, Law said the weather was expected to improve.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything does look to be improving through the day, so as we head towards the end of the day we should find some dry conditions, perhaps the best of the brightness and the driest, warmest temperatures as well, out towards that eastern side of the North Island ... places like Hawke's Bay up as high as 30 to 32C.</p>
        
            <p>"On the South Island, generally some drier and brighter weather there ... [for] places like Christchurch and Canterbury, [they are] looking pretty decent through Christmas Day."</p>
