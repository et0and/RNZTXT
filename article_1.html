            <p>An American woman has appeared in the Manakau District Court after about 31 kilograms of methamphetamine was found in her checked-in suitcases at Auckland Airport over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Customs said the 24-year-old United States national had arrived on a flight from San Francisco on 18 January, and, following questioning, a Customs search found methamphetamine in vacuum-sealed plastic packages inside wet towels, packed among new clothing.</p>
        
            <p>The amount seized equated to close to 1.6 million individual doses, with a potential street value of up to NZ$11 million, Customs said. The seizure was estimated to have prevented up to NZ$33m in social harm and cost to New Zealand.</p>

            <p>Customs manager Auckland Airport Paul Williams said the quantity of methamphetamine was a significant amount for a passenger to attempt to bring into the country.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is being targeted by transnational syndicates, with multiple couriers having been intercepted in 2025 already. I am pleased that Customs has chalked up another win again to prevent more harm in our communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The woman has been charged with the importation and possession for supply of a Class A Controlled drug, and has been remanded in custody until her next court appearance in February.</p>
        
            <p>Customs said anyone with suspicions about possible drug smuggling can contact Customs confidentially on 0800 WE PROTECT (0800 937 768) or Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
