            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation after the death of a man who was shot in South Auckland in the early hours on New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called after a 19-year-old was shot while in a vehicle in Addington Avenue, Manurewa at 3.20am.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to hospital but has since died as a result of his injury.</p>
        
            <p>A 17-year-old male, who also suffered a gunshot wound, remains in hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Karen Bright of Counties Manukau CIB said a scene examination was completed on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus is now on establishing the circumstances surrounding the incident and supporting both victim's families at this difficult time.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this will have been a shock to the community, however we would like to reassure them this appears to be an isolated incident."</p>
