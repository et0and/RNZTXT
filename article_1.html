            <p>A person has died after being hit by freight train at a pedestrian crossing in Invercargill near Elles Rd.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to the scene near Turnbull Thomson Park at 5.20pm and found a person dead.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene examination has been conducted and police and KiwiRail are working to clear the scene," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were working to identify the person who died, they said.</p>
        
            <p>St John said they sent one ambulance, an operations manager and a rapid response unit to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Elles Rd is closed between Tweed and Forth St while emergency services attend.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said the person was hit on the Ness St crossing which had a pedestrian maze and signage.</p>
