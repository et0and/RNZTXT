            <p>Police have conducted another search on Aoraki Mount Cook for the three climbers missing since 2 December.</p>
        
            <p>Police had earlier called off the search for Americans Kurt Blair and Carlos Romero and an unnamed Canadian national on 6 December.</p>
        
            <p>Due to a change in climatic condition, police, alongside Search and Rescue staff and Department of Conservation, conducted a further search at a location of interest on the mountain.</p>
        
            <p>Staff travelled up the mountain via helicopter, and while the search for the men was unsuccessful, a ski pole was located.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they have been in contact with the families of the three men, to update them on Tuesday's search efforts.</p>
        
            <p>They say they are continuing to follow the process to formally suspend the search, however they remain poised to reactivate the search if fresh information or credible sightings are reported, especially from the climbing community.</p>
