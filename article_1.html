            <p>Te Pāti Māori's president John Tamihere has hit back at allegations his party misused private information to help its election campaign, saying it was being "endlessly attacked" and scapegoated.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ has begun an investigation into the claims - first reported by The Sunday Star Times - which the party strongly denies.</p>
        
            <p>A group of ex-workers from Manurewa Marae claim private data from census forms was photocopied and entered into a database they believe was then used to target voters in the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate.</p>
        
            <p>Tamihere has released a statement calling the allegations part of a continuing narrative of attack on "all matters Māori".</p>
        
            <p>He requested evidence be supplied, and called the claims "baseless innuendo".</p>
        
            <p>"The fact of the matter is, as usual Māori are being used as a scapegoat to cover up and deflect from what is really going on in this country," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Pāti Māori are endlessly attacked and the matter is being made into a race debate through no fault of our own."</p>
        
            <p>Tamihere also took aim in the statement at what he claimed were double standards, referring to National MP David MacLeod who was stood down from his select commitee roles last months after revelations he failed to declare about $180,000 in candidate donations.</p>
        
            <p>"It must amuse our people to watch a National Party MP in Taranaki hide $180,000 worth of expenditure, not report it and nothing happens," Tamihere said.</p>
        
            <p>"When Te Pāti Māori made a late filing the Police were immediately called to investigate and we are sent to the Serious Fraud Office. This shows one law for some and one law for others."</p>
        
            <p>MacLeod said he had mistakenly thought he thought the return was for the 2023 year only, not 2022 as well. The Electoral Commission is still considering whether to refer the matter to the police.</p>
        
            <p>Tamihere's statement also took aim at Allan Halse, the employment advocate representing the former marae workers.</p>
        
            <p>"To their fearless, money grinder Allan Halse, it's best to keep your powder dry for the Employment Tribunal, fool."</p>
        
            <p>In response, Halse told RNZ he had no intention of engaging in a "clash of personalities" with Tamihere.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, I would prefer to deal in facts and in accordance with the law."</p>
        
            <p>Halse said he carried out his work on a "no win, no fee basis" and said his record of representing bullied workers over more than a decade spoke for itself.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't understand why Mr Tamihere refers to the 'Employment Tribunal' because the Employment Tribunal was replaced by the Employment Relations Authority (ERA) in 2000.</p>
        
            <p>"In any event, we haven't yet filed our client's case at the ERA but will at an appropriate time if there is no resolution beforehand.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, our clients will continue to act legally and respectfully and will participate fully with police and any public investigations into the allegations they have made."</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed they were making enquiries into matters relating to Te Pāti Māori, but would give no further detail.</p>
        
            <p>Separately, the Labour Party in November laid a complaint with the Electoral Commission against Te Pāti Māori, over text messages sent by a number Labour believed was managed by Waipareira Trust.</p>
        
            <p>Tamihere - as well as being Te Pāti Māori's president - is also the Trust's chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's complaint raised concerns about the lack of an authorisation statement in the messages, possible misuse of public funds, and the possible use of private data intended for health services for promotion of a political party.</p>
        
            <p>"This is relevant because that shortcode has been previously used to send people government information about COVID vaccinations and other matters ... this may also involve misuse of public funds given to Waipareira trust for developing this service."</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission referred the complaint about a lack of authorisation to police.</p>
        
            <p>Tamihere said the party had not been contacted about it.</p>
