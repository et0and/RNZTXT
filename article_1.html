            <p>Former deputy prime minister and senior Labour MP Carmel Sepuloni is understood to be one of the contestants on the new season of Celebrity Treasure Island.</p>
        
            <p>The reality television show is due to hit New Zealand screens later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's season five of Celebrity Treasure Island was filmed in Te Waipounamu and had a group of 18 contestants vying to win $100,000 for their chosen charity.</p>
        
            <p>Contestants included comedians Courtney Dawson and Eli Matthewson, presenter Mary Lambie, actor Miriama Smith, and activist and artist Tame Iti, among others.</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni first became an MP in 2008, lasting a term before dipping out of politics and returning again in 2014 as the MP for Kelston - a seat she still holds.</p>
        
            <p>She became deputy prime minister in January 2023 when Chris Hipkins took over from Dame Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's first MP of Tongan descent, Sepuloni was a senior minister between 2017 and 2023, holding portfolios including social development and ACC.</p>
        
            <p>The MP has not been seen in Wellington for some time after an achillies injury which required surgery, forcing her to take leave from Parliament for a number of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>She is due back on Tuesday, and will be getting around the halls of power on a scooter.</p>
        
            <p>Sepuloni will be the first MP to compete on Celebrity Treasure Island, but she will not be the only politician to have taken part in a reality TV show.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, ACT leader David Seymour hit the country's screens on Dancing with the Stars and made it all the way to the semi-final, finishing fifth overall.</p>
        
            <p>The following year he made a one episode return as a former contestant.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour is most remembered for his dance routine which involved him wearing bright highlighter-coloured '80s gym gear, where he twerked on stage.</p>
        
            <p>Dancing, it seems, is in the ACT party's blood with former leader Rodney Hide also a contestant in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>Hide received a record low score in one episode, just one point each from the four judges, after he dropped his dance partner, Krystal Stuart, mid-routine, and the pair were eliminated.</p>
        
            <p>A TVNZ spokesperson said the broadcaster would share the full line-up of celebrity castaways in the lead up to the show's premiere "but will not be commenting on any speculation on any contestants before then".</p>
        
            <p>Celebrity Treasure Island completed filming in early 2024 and will air later this year.</p>
