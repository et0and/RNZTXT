            <p>Taylor Swift, Joe Rogan, and Prince Harry are amongst the people New Zealanders listened to most this year, according to this year's Spotify Wrapped results.</p>
        
            <p>The streaming giant's annual event assesses mountains of listening data and gives users a unique snapshot of their listening habits. It stitches together our top artists, tracks and genres, counts up the minutes we listened, and reveals all the new music we learned along the way - with some interesting genre names at times.</p>
        
            <p>In no great surprise, Taylor Swift has kept her crown as New Zealand's most streamed artist on Spotify, with the pop artist's record The Tortured Poets Department; The Anthology taking the number one spot as New Zealand's most-streamed album, followed by Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft and Sabrina Carpenter's Short n Sweet.</p>
        
            <p>Swift was the world's most streamed artist for the second year in a row, grabbing more than 26.6 billion streams. The Weeknd scored silver in the global stats, followed by Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish.</p>
        
            <p>Rising popstar, Benson Boone, made his debut on this year's Wrapped list with his song 'Beautiful Things' which went viral on TikTok this year. Boone has taken out the title of New Zealand's most-streamed track. The American is set to play at Auckland's Spark Arena on January 24 - a resceduled show after two gigs at the smaller Powerstation venue sold out.</p>
        
            <p>Worldwide, it was Sabrina Carpenter's 'Espresso' which was the most listened to song (1.6m streams) followed by the Boone banger and 'Birds of a Feather' by Billie Eilish.</p>

            <p>Since Spotify Wrapped's launch in 2016, SIX60 has consistently featured in New Zealand's top-streamed lists, even surpassing some of the world's biggest artists like Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber back in 2021.</p>
