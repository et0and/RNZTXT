        <h2>What is New Zealand's best sausage?</h2>
        <p>
It beat more than 800 other entries and used a "classic combination" of flavours.
</p>
        
            <p>As New Zealanders dust off their BBQs ahead of summer, a new national sausage champion is ready for grilling.</p>
        
            <p>A pork and leek sausage from Westmere Butchery in Auckland delighted the judges at the 27th annual Dunninghams Great New Zealand Sausage Competition. The sausage beat out more than 800 other entries to take out the Supreme Award, which was announced Tuesday night. The competition celebrates timeless sausages along with recipes and techniques that push the boundaries of ingredients and flavour.</p>
        
            <p>Westmere Butchery's entry scored high in the judging criteria of technical composition, aroma, appearance, texture and, of course, taste, food writer and judge Kathy Paterson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The flavours they used are a classic combination that works well together. They nailed the balance and seasoning, and the leek was perfectly cooked and tender, creating an excellent texture. The flavours of both the leek and the pork came through beautifully, resulting in a truly delicious sausage," she said.</p>

            <p>Technical judge Brian Everton of Cabernet Foods said the ingredients in the winning snag were well-balanced and evenly distributed.</p>
        
            <p>"You could see the flavour, the grind, and the quality of the meat, which came together to create a winning combination," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Sifting through the yum and not-so-yum of New Zealand sausages is serious business. There were 808 sausages and mince products (think meatballs and burger patties) vying to win 13 sausage and three mince categories.</p>

            <p>The first of two judging rounds was completed over eight days to determine what sausage won at the category level. Those winners were rejudged to determine the Supreme Winner and the People's Choice Award, which was voted for by the public during a lunchtime sausage sizzle.</p>
        
            <p>Mapari Meats in Auckland claimed the People's Choice Award for their Venison Chorizo. Princes Street Butcher & Kitchen in Dunedin won the Dunninghams Choice Award for their Traditional Pork sausage.</p>
        
            <p>The 16 categories saw winners from around the country. Peter Timbs Meats in Christchurch won the Meatball Category with its Italian Meatballs. The Four Square location in Martinborough won the Gourmet Beef Sausage Category for its Martinborough Beef and Triple Cheese sausage.</p>
