            <p>A 54-year-old man has been arrested and charged with the murder of father-of-two David Bridgwater.</p>
        
            <p>The arrest was made at a semi-rural property near Timaru on Friday, Detective Senior Sergeant Colin Baillie said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a significant development in the investigation and our thoughts are with Mr Bridgwater's family - his mother, brother and two young children."</p>
        
            <p>Bridgwater, 38, was found dead on Carisbrooke Street, in the Christchurch suburb of Aranui on 4 January.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, police were searching Avon River for items of interest, including a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Police also revealed Bridgwater died as a result of gunshot wounds.</p>
        
            <p>"The National Police Dive Squad and Specialist Search Group have concluded their search of sections of the Avon River and nearby areas of interest and are assessing the results."</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in the Christchurch District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>"As this matter is now before the court police are limited in making further comment."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, a 51-year-old woman was arrested and charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder.</p>
        
            <p>According to court documents, she was charged with "actively suppressing evidence by preventing access to CCTV data".</p>
        
            <p>She was granted name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Her next court appearance was scheduled for February.</p>
        
            <p>Friends and family Bridgwater said they would hold a cricket match in his honour and to raise money for his two boys later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Jarman said the cricket match provided an opportunity to remember Bridgwater and do right by him and his family.</p>
        
            <p>The David Bridgwater Memorial Shield match would now be held annually, Jarman said.</p>
        
            <p>This year's match would also help pay for the cost of Bridgwater's gravestone, but in years to come all money would go to the boys, Jarman said.</p>
        
            <p>"David was one hell of a guy and would've done this for any one, even if he didn't know the person, because that's the sort of guy he was. He was a hard working man, a family man and a hell of a person."</p>
