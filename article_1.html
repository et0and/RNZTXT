            <p>The Foreign Minister has taken a dig at former prime minister Helen Clark after a speech in which she said the UN Security Council's credibility was at stake over the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Clark - the former head of the UN Development Programme - said it was disturbing that nothing had been done to implement the council's resolution calling for a complete ceasefire in the occupied Palestinian territory of Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>"The Security Council has a responsibility to chart a path towards a sustainable peace. A full, immediate, and complete ceasefire in Gaza is an indispensable step," she said in a speech to the council in New York early on Friday morning (New Zealand time).</p>
        
            <p>"It is deeply disturbing that Security Council Resolution 2735 calling for this remains unimplemented."</p>
        
            <p>The current approach to the conflict, led by powerful members of the international community, had "failed", and a new approach, grounded in international law, was needed, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Council members who question the binding status of these resolutions, or who use their veto to protect an ally or to oppose a geo-political rival, are eroding the Council's authority. They also undermine their own reputations and long-term interests."</p>
        
            <p>Clark also said Palestine should be recognised as a state and given full UN membership.</p>

            <p>She called on UN member states to respect and comply with the International Court of Justice's recent advisory opinion that concluded Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory was unlawful and must end as rapidly as possible.</p>
        
            <p>While that opinion was non-binding, it was an "authoritative, landmark ruling", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The General Assembly and Security Council should give effect to the advisory opinion by passing resolutions endorsing it and setting out what action is required by Israel, other member states, and the UN to bring an end to the occupation."</p>
        
            <p>Settlements continued to expand in the West Bank and East Jerusalem while international attention was focused on Gaza, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"More decisive member state action is needed."</p>
        
            <p>Clark also called on UN member states to refrain from giving assistance to, or trading with, any illegal settlements.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is travelling next week to attend the General Assembly leaders' week at the UN.</p>
        
            <p>Peters spoke to Morning Report about the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying "we have to do the best we can to try and see that this misery is over."</p>
        
            <p>In relation to the UN resolution, he said they decided to do what he thinks New Zealanders would want them to do, and "make a statement."</p>
        
            <p>"Of course" he said, Israel has the "right to defend themselves."</p>
        
            <p>"But there comes a time when you cannot maintain that argument, when so many innocent people become the victims of your defense, so to speak."</p>
        
            <p>When asked whether he supports Clark's view the security council needs to do more to uphold its resolutions, Peters said "sometimes when you have left the stage, you should just remember that you have left the stage."</p>
        
            <p>Clark made her speech as a member of The Elders, a group of elder statesmen and women set up by Nelson Mandela in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>"The Elders unequivocally condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks and the holding of hostages by Hamas, which have caused deep trauma for the Israeli people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Elders also welcomed the passing of a resolution made by the General Assembly calling on Israel to end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>
        
            <p>The resolution was passed with 124 nations voting in favour, 14 voting against, and 43 abstaining.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand voted in favour of the resolution, breaking with its Five Eyes partners who abstained from the vote.</p>
