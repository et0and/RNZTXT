            <p>The person accused of murdering a 79-year-old Wellington woman has also been charged with obtaining more than $1000 by deception.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Gregory was found dead in her Khandallah home on 24 January, and the accused was arrested on 11 February.</p>
        
            <p>At the Wellington District Court on Monday morning the accused - a Paraparaumu-based teacher - did not enter a plea.</p>
        
            <p>The matter will be heard alongside the murder charge at the High Court in May.</p>
        
            <p>The 52-year-old was remanded in custody, and interim name suppression kept in place until her next appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Gregory's obituary, published in The Post, said Gregory was a dearly loved mother, mother-in-law and treasured grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in January they believed her death was an isolated incident.</p>
