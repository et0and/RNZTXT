        <h2>Red alerts issued for rivers over toxic algae</h2>
        <p>
Eating just a small amount of the algae - the size of a 50-cent coin - can be enough to kill a dog.

            <p>Dog owners in Wellington are being warned to keep their animals away from several rivers due to widespread toxic algae.</p>
        
            <p>Red alert level warnings are in place for the Hutt River and the Waipoua River, as well as sections of the Ruamāhanga River and the Waikanae River.</p>
        
            <p>Warm, stable conditions meant the algae "exploded" across the region most summers, producing a neurotoxin similar to snake venom, Greater Wellington Regional Council senior advisor Penny Fairbrother said.</p>
        
            <p>"Toxic algae produces a neurotoxin which is harmful to humans and lethal for dogs if ingested. We strongly advise that people avoid contact with water and keep all dogs and children away from the river's edge.</p>
        
            <p>"Ingesting even a small amount of toxic algae, the size of a 50-cent coin, can be enough to kill a dog.</p>
        
            <p>"The problem is that dogs seem to love the smell, and seem to find it irresistible, so they tend to seek it out."</p>

Dogs seem to find the algae "irresistible", Penny Fairbrother from Greater Wellington Regional Council says.

            <p>Toxic algae grows on rocks in the riverbed and forms leathery, dark green or black mats. The algae produces oxygen which lifts the algae off the rocks, forming detached mats that accumulate at the river's edge.</p>
        
            <p>Six or seven dogs died in 2012 before it was known how lethal the algae was, Fairbrother said.</p>
        
            <p>Dog owners who thought their animals had swallowed toxic algae, or showed signs of lethargy, muscle tremors, fast breathing, paralysis or convulsions, should go to the nearest vet immediately.</p>
        
            <p>People who had been in contact with toxic algae and were feeling unwell should see a doctor or ring Healthline on 0800 611 116. </p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington was monitoring popular river swimming spots for toxic algae on a weekly basis.</p>
        
            <p>People were encouraged to visit the Land, Air, Water Aotearoa website for warnings and alerts before visiting their local river this summer.</p>
