            <p>The challenges facing local government, small communities and Māori could keep a rural mayor with more than 20 years' council experience from stepping aside as planned at this year's elections.</p>
        
            <p>Rangitīkei mayor Andy Watson began his political career as a Rangitīkei District councillor in 2004. He served two terms as deputy mayor and this year completes his fourth term as mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Addressing the Rātana faithful on Wednesday - the first of four days celebrating the birth of founder Tahu Pōtiki Wiremu Rātana - Watson said it could be his last time standing before the paepae.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for accepting me, thank you for gently teaching and guiding me. For me, this is a very special place," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>But after the pōwhiri, Watson indicated he was uncertain about his plans to leave office.</p>
        
            <p>"When I stood last time [in October 2022], I signalled that this would probably be my last term," Watson told Local Democracy Reporting.</p>
        
            <p>"I had hoped to see more young people coming through with knowledge of local government and commitment to progressing the district. At the moment, I'm not sure I'm seeing that.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also seeing the challenges ahead of us, in terms of where the government is sitting and the relationships we're going to have to forge in the next two years."</p>
        
            <p>Referring to the government's Local Water Done Well legislation, under which Rangitīkei is likely to form a new three-council water services entity with Whanganui and Ruapehu district councils, Watson said the next few years would be "an incredibly challenging time".</p>
        
            <p>"As part of that, we will need to set up a governance arm for that body. How we include iwi in that governance arm is always going to be a challenging conversation for some people but I'm keen to see that relationship progress."</p>
        
            <p>Alongside this year's local body elections, binding local polls on 11 October will determine whether councils should keep their Māori wards and constituencies.</p>

            <p>"Our relationship with iwi will be tested," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be politicians in local government around the country wondering about the percentage of Māori in their district, and how they should play this out if they want to be elected."</p>
        
            <p>Rangitīkei introduced Māori wards in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Watson said his approach was to reflect on the principles of the late Dame Tariana Turia.</p>
        
            <p>"You do the right thing," he said. "You do what your inner voice tells you is the right thing to do. And in her case, that even meant crossing the floor of the House to do so. You have to admire that."</p>
        
            <p>During his address to Rātana followers, Watson paid tribute to Dame Tariana, who died early this month.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a very, very special person, not only to the country and iwi but to me. My regard for her was incredible."</p>
        
            <p>Watson also told Rātana followers his council had formally opposed the "ridiculous" Treaty Principles Bill but thanked the government for its $10.1 million Regional Infrastructure Fund investment to fix failing marae buildings at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>He asked the paepae to remind Regional Development Minister Shane Jones that he had also promised funding assistance to Rangitīkei District Council for infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Watson assured Rātana residents that the council was committed to removing treated wastewater from nearby Lake Waipu and discharging it to land purchased by the council for that purpose, subject to discharge consents. The council was also upgrading the water treatment plant at Rātana Pā.</p>
        
            <p>Rangitīkei and Whanganui District Councils arrived at Rātana on Wednesday morning, together with iwi from Taranaki and Whanganui, Ngāti Rangi and paddlers from Te Tira Hoe Waka.</p>
        
            <p>Whanganui mayor Andrew Tripe delivered his address entirely in te reo Māori, focusing on the importance of building strong relationships between Māori, pākehā and all people.</p>
        
            <p>In the afternoon, Māori Wardens were welcomed along with the leaders and representatives of different faiths and churches.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, Te Ariki Tā Tumu Te Heuheu, Tūwharetoa and Te Arawa waka will be welcomed and at 3pm Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po will ascend the marae along with the Kiingitanga, Tainui waka, other iwi, and Te Pāti Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Governor General Dame Cindy Kiro will arrive on Friday morning before the Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is welcomed at noon, along with Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins and all political parties.</p>
        
            <p>The annual event will end with a celebration of Tahu Pōtiki Wiremu Rātana's 151st birthday on Saturday 25 January.</p>
