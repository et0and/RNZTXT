            <p>All Whites coach Darren Bazeley said he felt a very good performance by his side was on the cards as the completed the first step in qualifying for next year's FIFA World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand beat Fiji 7-0 in their Oceania semi-final in Wellington and will next meet New Caledonia in the final at Eden Park on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Skipper Chris Wood grabbed a hat-trick while Sapreet Singh, Tim Payne, Kosta Barbarouses, and a own goal completed the scoring.</p>
        
            <p>"I could sense in the warm up and in the changing room beforehand that they were so focussed, that they just wanted to get out on the pitch," Bazeley told RNZ after the game.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole team is so focussed on qualifying for the World Cup that they're not going to let anything get in the way.</p>
        
            <p>"A challenge like today with the complacency aspect was never going to creep in with this group of players."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand completely dominated the game and played with width and skill that was too much for the Fijians who struggled to turn defence into any form of attack.</p>
        
            <p>Bazeley was very happy with his side's performance.</p>
        
            <p>"Really consistent, exciting to watch, some of the football the boys played was outstanding and really showcased some of the young talented players that we have and any day Chris Wood gets a hat-trick is a great day."</p>

            <p>While there was a threat that being favourites might hamper the home side's efforts, Bazeley said he told his players to just keep everything simple.</p>
        
            <p>"Pass and move and when I asked them to do that the result is pretty outstanding, they pass and move so well at pace and some of the football was outstanding.</p>
        
            <p>Captain Chris Wood said his side coped well with the expectation of being favourites.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a game where we know we're going to be on top for most of the game but we have to make sure we nullify their threat of countering on us and then just move the ball the way we worked on in training and try and create chances."</p>
        
            <p>Wood was given a yellow card for entering the stands to sign autographs during the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier New Caledonia took a step closer to a maiden FIFA World Cup appearance after a 3-0 victory over Tahiti, thanks to an outstanding brace from Georges Gope-Fenepej.</p>
        
            <p>The final is at Eden Park on Monday night.</p>
