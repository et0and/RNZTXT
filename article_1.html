            <p>A witness who called the police after a man was hit by multiple vehicles on Auckland's South Western motorway last week says the fact no one stopped is disgusting.</p>
        
            <p>Police were appealing for any dashcam footage and asking anyone travelling on State Highway 20 between 1.30am and 2am to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>The man died on a section of State Highway 20 near Mt Roskill, after walking onto the motorway from the north-bound Dominion Road on ramp in the early hours of last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police Detective Senior Sergeant Kathy Bostock said he was hit by at least three cars, none of which stopped.</p>
        
            <p>Genevieve was on her way home after dinner with her partner, when she spotted what she originally thought was a rubbish bag on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"Then, as you got closer you could see what it was," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said her partner parked the car in front of where the man lay, to prevent any other vehicles from hitting him.</p>
        
            <p>"I rang 111... the police and that arrived pretty quick."</p>
        
            <p>Genevieve said they saw the man take his last breath.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that none of the vehicles that hit the man stopped - Genevieve said that was disgusting.</p>
        
            <p>"If you saw someone lying on the ground, I think it's quite disturbing eh?</p>
        
            <p>"I actually feel I'd be angry too ... it's pretty disgusting," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unless they didn't know ... I think you'd have known if you ran someone over."</p>
        
            <p>Genevieve said the road was very well lit.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was more vigilant after what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving down the motorway ... just always looking now, you just don't know."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were seeking anyone travelling on State Highway 20 between 1.30am and 2am to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever's hit him must be feeling pretty yuck," Genevieve said.</p>
        
            <p>"But they didn't have to see the afterwards, the damage. I think they would have been scared."</p>
