        <h2>What we're watching: Catastrophe</h2>
        <p>
Hormones flare and cultures clash as an Irish woman falls pregnant to an American man after a week-long fling in London. Jogai Bhatt explains why Catastrophe is worth a watch.

            <p>Run out of stuff to watch? Join us as we dig deep into the streamers' catalogues for shows worth your time. This week's watch: Catastrophe.</p>
        
            <p>A goofy American businessman meets a sardonic Irish schoolteacher while on a business trip to London. They have sex - a lot of it - and then they part ways, promising to remember one another as "an extraordinarily good-smelling woman with a magical ass" and "a sturdy love-maker with a massive chin". All is well, until the man receives a call some 32 days later. Catastrophe has struck: she's pregnant.</p>
        
            <p>Created, written by and starring Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, Catastrophe presents a raw and honest comedy about sex, parenthood, and marriage. The show features the kind of hilarious and crude dialogue only a British-Irish production could get away with, like Sharon on the joys of childbirth: "Push it back in and cut it out!" or Rob on co-habitating: "You let me put my penis in your mouth but you won't let me put my t-shirts in your drawer?"</p>
        
            <p>Rob and Sharon's relationship is a real highlight of the series. It all starts when Rob learns that Sharon is pregnant; instead of running for the hills, his immediate reaction is to leave Boston to be with her in London. The pair then enter into a relationship that - amidst much dark humour, sharp wit, and sarcasm - is full of warmth. They're fiery and have a lot of passion for each other, and eventually, their dynamic builds into something very real.</p>

            <p>The show is only strengthened when it dares to put the pair up against some challenging circumstances. For a comedy series, Catastrophe certainly doesn't shy away from the darkness. Rob and Sharon face the dire realities of life over and over; cancer scares, arrests and relapses are just the surface. For one, Rob is introduced to us as a recovering alcoholic, which can only lead to trouble considering the pair meet and hook up in a bar. Midway through the series, another bombshell. Sharon is told that, being 41, she has a much higher than average chance of her baby being born with Down Syndrome. And yet, somehow, the show doesn't lose its comedic edge.</p>
        
            <p>Supported by an equally dysfunctional cast of friends, neighbours and colleagues - including the ever-charming late Carrie Fisher in her final TV role - Catastrophe is abundant in laughs, tears, raunch, and a lot of heart.</p>
        
            <p>Story: 4/5 (brilliantly written, hilarious and crude)</p>
        
            <p>Production: 3.5/5</p>
        
            <p>Bingeability: 3/5 (four seasons with some heavy arcs, better to pace it out)</p>
        
            <p>Crashing: Six 20- and 30-somethings live together as property guardians of a disused hospital. Relationships inevitably start to overlap.</p>
        
            <p>Starstruck: New Zealand's Rose Matafeo plays Jessie, a 20-something living in London who accidentally has a one-night stand with a movie star.</p>
        
            <p>Catastrophe is streaming now on TVNZ+.</p>
