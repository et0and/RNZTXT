            <p>Art lovers are all aflutter after two bronze pigeon statues were pilfered from the streets of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Sculptor Jonathan Campbell created the pigeons in 2022 as part of a WellingtonNZ campaign to celebrate the city's business community.</p>
        
            <p>Each of the 10 sculptures was different - one was sitting on a pile of coins, one was flying with a paper bag of takeaways, and one was eating a bronze pizza.</p>
        
            <p>But recently, two had flown the coop, he told Nights host Emile Donovan - and he suspected students were to blame.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think some middle-aged person would have taken them because you'd probably get told off by your friends," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A dumb straight-out theft would be a bit boring - what would you do with it? I would put money on it being students."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said his feathers were not ruffled by the turn of events and he enjoyed the thought of the pigeons sitting in a student flat.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public had created an impromptu artwork by placing candles and flowers around the spot where one of the birds was last seen, which was a striking memorial.</p>

            <p>"I find that's probably more interesting than what I had sitting there before.</p>
        
            <p>"People will be stopping to look at that ... they probably think it's some quite morbid, serious event taking place but it's the loss of a bronze bird."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said melting down the pigeons would not provide the thieves with any sort of nest egg, as no one would get rich from that small amount of bronze.</p>
        
            <p>"The value of what I do is the time and effort that goes into making them, not the material itself - not at that scale, anyway."</p>

            <p>It was not the first time his poultry had been pinched. Earlier, another pigeon was stolen, but found again shortly after going missing.</p>
        
            <p>"He was bolted to a really heavy table, so I think they gave up and dropped him at the top of some steps somewhere."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell suspected the thieves in that situation had had a few drinks before trying to carry away the table.</p>
        
            <p>The pigeons were never meant as permanent fixtures and were only intended to be on the streets for a couple of years, he said.</p>
