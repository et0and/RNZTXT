            <p>A Wellington bus lane camera has racked up nearly a quarter of a million dollars in fines for drivers in just over a month.</p>
        
            <p>On 9 December new fixed cameras began operating on Riddiford Street, Adelaide Road in Newtown and Chaytor Street in Karori.</p>

            <p>Between 9 December and 17 January, 1475 tickets were issued for people driving on the lane which led to $221,250 worth of fines being dished out.</p>
        
            <p>It was significantly more than the Adelaide Road bus lane nearby that raised $26,250 over the same period.</p>
        
            <p>Felesese Pati who was fined $150 for using the bus lane told RNZ he believed people were driving on it unintentionally.</p>
        
            <p>"To me it's like accidental and kind of confusing."</p>
        
            <p>Pati believed the council could make it more obvious for people to know they could not drive on it.</p>

            <p>A Wellington City Council spokesperson said drivers should always check signs for bus lane operating hours and whether it was a regular bus lane or a bus-only lane.</p>
        
            <p>The person said all bus lanes were clearly marked with signs and green on-road markings.â€¯</p>

            <p>Councillor Nureddin Abdurahman said he wanted to know how it was advertised to residents.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people - they are not on social media, you don't reach them through the normal media channels so it would be interesting to find out how council reached out.</p>
        
            <p>"I will be asking those questions."</p>
        
            <p>Abdurahman said council staff needed to look at what was not working on Riddiford Street that was working on Adelaide Road.</p>
        
            <p>AA spokesperson Dylan Thomsen said nationally they had seen bus lane enforcement result in consistently large amounts of fines.</p>
        
            <p>"What this indicates is that there is a large number of drivers out there that don't actually know the rules about these lanes, or are not realising."</p>

            <p>Thomsen said the number of fines on Riddiford Street raised a red flag.</p>
        
            <p>"It warrants the council taking a look at it and trying to get to the bottom of why there's so many more people being ticketed for this particular bus lane."</p>
        
            <p>The council said it has reviewed the signage and it was comfortable it complied with the rules.</p>
        
            <p>It said international research showed enforcement was a significant factor in changing driver behaviour, and this was demonstrated by the decline in infringements issued since the cameras were introduced in December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Director of the Greater Auckland Transport website Matt Lowrie said the number of tickets being issued highlighted why enforcement was needed in the first place.</p>
        
            <p>"If they [cars] are travelling more than a short distance in them they are delaying buses, they are delaying bus passengers."</p>
