            <p>Survivors of abuse in state care expect the prime minister to honour his word and implement meaningful change before the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Survivor and social worker Paora Moyle contributed to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into abuse in state care and attended the tabling of the inquiry report at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Moyle said the prime minister and other politicians were clearly emotional and shaken by what was revealed and hoped that would strengthen their resolve.</p>
        
            <p>"They were hard hit because these people don't get to see this daily. You can tell as a survivor who is genuine and who is impacted, they were wholly impacted. We are used to the kōrero and the hurt and the mamae but these people that presented in Parliament in response, let us know they were deeply impacted. "</p>
        
            <p>Survivor Ihorangi Reweti-Peters said he did not want the report to "gather dust".</p>
        
            <p>"The experiences of a survivor of abuse in the care of the state needs to be taken seriously," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Reweti-Peters was in state care from age 10 to 18 years old and said it was an extremely harrowing experience.</p>
        
            <p>He emphasised, no rangatahi should have to live through that mamae (hurt).</p>
        
            <p>"As a Māori it's (an) uncomfortable feeling, that 60 percent of Māori are in our care system."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister will issue an official apology on the 12 November and a ministerial working group will be established to work with survivors on next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"I know survivors have been waiting a long time for changes to how the state and churches provide redress. I want to assure you that we understand the urgency and importance of this work and we will provide clarity before the end of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Moyle said the government must consider the experiences of every individual impacted and the ripple effect of that pain and suffering on their whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"Every survivor is a different person and their mamae is never the same as the next person and the impact is different. Our whānau who have lost their loved ones to state abuse also deserve collective redress."</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry provided 138 recommendations and Moyle said all survivors could do was hope and trust the information was actioned as soon as possible.</p>
