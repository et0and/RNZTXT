            <p>Liam Lawson's future in Formula 1 could become a little clearer this week with the possibility of an announcement about Red Bull driver Sergio Perez's plans.</p>
        
            <p>Driving for Red Bull's sister team RB, Lawson finished 14th in Monday morning's Qatar Grand Prix, while the under pressure Perez failed to finish.</p>
        
            <p>The race was won by Max Verstappen with the Red Bull driver having clinched his fourth drivers championship in Las Vegas last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson started 17th on the grid but made contact during a re-start and was given a 10 second penalty. He never threatened the top 10 and with a fateful late decision by his team to switch him and team mate Yuki Tsunoda to soft tyres, the pair then struggled home with the Japanese driver one place ahead of him.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Verstappen's teammate Perez was travelling well in the top 10 before spinning off mid-race and failing to finish.</p>
        
            <p>The Mexican has picked up just 12 points in his last eight races, not good enough for the Red Bull team which won the constructors championship last season but can finish no higher than third in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>That has led to many Formula 1 commentators suggesting they will drop Perez for the 2025 season.</p>
        
            <p>He does have a contract, but Formula 1 is a cut-throat business and they could well buy him out of his contract.</p>
        
            <p>After today's race, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner was asked if he would give Perez the opportunity to announce his own future before the final round in Abu Dhabi next weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very frustrating to be out of the constructors' (championship) because that is where the financial revenues are distributed on," Horner told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"He (Perez) is not enjoying the situation that he is in at the moment, he knows the pressure of this business.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to give him all the support we can to the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi next weekend and what he decides to do that will be his decision.</p>
        
            <p>"He's old enough and wise enough to come to his own conclusions."</p>
        
            <p>Asked who should join Verstappen at Red Bull next year, former world champion Jenson Button thought Tsunoda was better equipped to compete in that seat rather that Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson finished ahead of Tsunoda on his return to Formula 1 at the US Grand Prix, but has now finished behind him in the last three races.</p>
        
            <p>As for the race, Lawson felt things were not too bad following the early spin that cost him the time penalty.</p>
        
            <p>"We caught the back again and the pace was not so bad, we were just completely out of position.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall though we're just not quick enough to be fighting with the guys we need to be fighting with and we lost a lot of points. We've made big steps this year, but more to be taken."</p>

            <p>RB had been in a good battle with Alpine and Haas for sixth place in the constructors' championship but have now slipped back.</p>
        
            <p>Prize money for teams are determined with their final placings in the constructors' competition with tens of millions of dollars at stake between sixth and eighth.</p>
        
            <p>Red Bull have previously said the makeup of their teams will be confirmed following this season.</p>
