            <p>An intense front, embedded in a strong and moist northwesterly flow, is moving north over central New Zealand on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>It has brought heavy rain and severe northwest gales to many South Island areas as well as the lower North island.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, strong winds have forced many flights to be diverted or cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand passengers were warned disruptions were likely, beginning around 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>Those on smaller aircrafts had been particularly affected, and while a few planes had managed to land in Wellington, many had been cancelled or diverted, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said passengers who did not choose to reschedule earlier on Sunday will be rebooked on alternative flights on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService had issued a strong wind warning for Wellington and Wairarapa south of Masterton, the Marlborough Sounds, Kaikoura ranges and Kaikoura coast as well as the Canterbury High Country from 9pm to Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Northwest gale gusting up to 150km/h was possible in exposed places, which could cause damage to trees, powerlines, and unsecured structures, the forecaster said.</p>
        
            <p>Driving may also be difficult, especially for high-sided vehicles and motorcycles.</p>
        
            <p>MetService had also issued a heavy rain warning for Mount Taranaki, the Tararua Range as well as the Grey and Buller Districts from 9pm through to Monday morning, with up to 140 mm of rain possible. It warned surface flooding, slips, and difficult driving conditions are possible.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch is in place for the Bay of Plenty ranges east of Opotiki, and a strong wind watch for Wairarapa including the Tararua District from about Masterton northwards and Hawke's Bay south of Hastings too.</p>
