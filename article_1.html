            <p>The Labour Party is claiming a win for its campaign that the government commit to keeping and funding free school lunches.</p>
        
            <p>The Ka Ora, Ka Ako programme - which feeds about 230,000 students a day at just under 1000 schools around the country - was up for review as part of this month's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, associate education minister David Seymour announced primary students already benefiting from free school lunches will continue to do so in the same way for the next two-and-a-half years, while older students will shift to an alternative model.</p>
        
            <p>Labour education spokesperson Jan Tinetti said Seymour had failed to get the sweeping cuts he wanted.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour had previously told RNZ funding could be cut by up to half.</p>
        
            <p>It is unclear what the programme will look like in size and funding two years from now, following a review by an advisory group.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour has been calling for the government to commit to fully funding the school lunch programme and I am relieved to see David Seymour hasn't got the cuts to the programme he campaigned on," Tinetti said.</p>
        
            <p>Parents will be able to choose to opt-out of the programme. Tinetti, a former school principal, said that was a worry because it might lead to "stigma" for those "kids who need the lunches".</p>
        
            <p>"It's also ironic that this funding is time-limited, given the government's current aversion to that. If they matched their own rhetoric, they'd have funded it from baseline today."</p>
        
            <p>Until the end of this year, the school lunches programme will remain as it is for the 235,000 students in more than 1000 schools receiving it.</p>
        
            <p>A new interim delivery model will kick in next year, which has temporary funding for two years, to allow time for a full redesign of the school lunch programme before any more money was dedicated.</p>
        
            <p>The Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) has also welcomed the news, and the expansion of the school lunch programme to include thousands of pre-schoolers.</p>
        
            <p>President Chris Abercrombie said it was surprising the government was taking two years to review the lunch programme.</p>
        
            <p>"This government has been extremely critical of other governments for being slow with reviews and initiatives - two years seems a very long amount of time for this particular review," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Schools need certainty and work should be focused on expansion of the programme - the more children and young people who can be guaranteed lunch each day, the better."</p>
        
            <p>NZEI Te Riu Roa, the union for educators across Aotearoa, said the news was positive, but it was vital for educators, students and the wider community be included in any redesign.</p>
        
            <p>"It cannot be a one-size-fits all approach dictated by commercial imperatives rather than those who know what's really needed on the ground," NZEI president Mark Potter said.</p>
        
            <p>"The best practice model in the current programme appears to be in-school catering where there is the opportunity to build learning into the programme and catering staff are integrated into the school community, with the ritual of students eating together promoting social cohesion and positive behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>Any extension should not be at the expense of other students missing out, Potter said.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears the government is cutting an important contribution to the health and learning of students in years 7-13, by introducing a targeted approach for this age group which we know can create social stigma for students opting to receive a school lunch."</p>
