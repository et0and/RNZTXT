            <p>A New Zealand high school guitarist whose impressive fretwork wowed the world this week says the response has been "quite unbelievable".</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 students were involved in the performance of Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven' at the St Andrew's College end-of-year prizegiving, mixing rock and classical in front of a crowd of 3500.</p>
        
            <p>The highlight was year 13 student Mia Fraser's guitar solo, nailing Jimmy Page's five-decade-old original note for note. </p>
        
            <p>The performance was filmed in late November, and went viral after being put online earlier this month - shared on social media, guitar forums and even on the Led Zeppelin website. </p>
        
            <p>"Honestly it's been quite unbelievable, the amount of people that I've been able to connect with because of this has been amazing," Fraser told RNZ's Sunday Morning. </p>
        
            <p>"I had a look a few days back and saw a website that said '.za' and I was like, where is that? Is that South Africa? Like, the amount of places people have been commenting from is quite amazing."</p>

            <p>She said it was a great song to do, with so many kids her age at the Christchurch school into rock music - though many of them had never heard the song, released in 1971 on Led Zeppelin's eponymous fourth album, before their teacher suggested they tackle it - using Heart's famous cover version as a template.</p>
        
            <p>It has now been viewed more than 320,000 times on YouTube alone, not counting other platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't really thinking very much when I was playing it," Fraser said. "I was just so overcome with nerves, but it was really awesome just hearing the crowd. It did take me a few months especially to get that little last fast bit quite right. But, you know, been practising my guitar moves in the mirror.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be the lasting memory that I'll have in my time here."</p>
        
            <p>Fraser plans to study engineering at university, but also keep playing in bands.</p>
        
            <p>St Andrew’s College Rector, Christine Leighton, explained the work that goes into such a performance - listen to the audio above for the full interview with both.</p>
