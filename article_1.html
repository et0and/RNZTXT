            <p>Health New Zealand has backtracked and has now cleared the way for a small group of cancer patients to get free early access to the drug Keytruda later this month.</p>
        
            <p>It had initially indicated that the patients - about 20 or 30 people - would have to wait until the treatment was officially funded from 1 October, which sparked a backlash from cancer organisations.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, Health NZ chief clinical officer Richard Sullivan said clinicians had advised they could manage the small group earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Those patients will be prepared for treatment over the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ estimated a total of at least 300 patients were likely to be eligible overall, including that early group of 20 to 30.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has a faster cancer treatment target, intending to have 90 percent of patients receiving treatment within 31 days from decision to treat.</p>
