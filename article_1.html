        <h2>Wellingtonians, Aucklanders hit the beach to cool off</h2>
        <p>
At Freyberg Beach, three friends sought shelter from the blazing sun under the shade of a tree, saying the weather was too good not to make the most of.

            <p>Wellington locals are heading to beaches around the region to cool off in the unusually hot weather.</p>
        
            <p>Most suburbs will peak at temperatures above 25 degrees and a heat alert has been issued for the Hutt Valley, with both Upper and Lower Hutt expected to reach 28 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>While some may scoff at the numbers, MetService explains the temperatures are very hot for these locations.</p>
        
            <p>"What is considered extremely hot for a Cantabrian is very different to what a Southlander will deem hot."</p>
        
            <p>At Freyberg Beach in the central city, three friends sought shelter from the blazing sun under the shade of a tree. They said the weather was too good not to make the most of.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like it's usually so windy here. I've just got back from Christchurch and Christchurch is never windy," Amy Hartwell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were like ... why not? I think it's one of the most beautiful mornings I've ever seen at Oriental, it's so still."</p>
        
            <p>Olivia Ferguson said the water was unusually pleasant.</p>
        
            <p>"It was actually delightful, it was a little bit fresh but I think it was a really nice contrast to the heat so it was good," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Really good morning for it, not normally a morning swimmer but Wellington's putting on a show today so it's quite nice.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been surprisingly warm in Oriental Bay. Normally I'm like 'ugh Oriental', but today it's a winner ... I feel like it's going to pack out this afternoon."</p>

            <p>Iris Garstang works at a nearby gelato kiosk - she popped by to visit her friends during a break and said the beach seemed busier than usual.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be really busy. On a weekday we're not normally busy but because it's over the holiday, there's so many kids out. It's really nice and everyone's happy because it's nice weather."</p>
        
            <p>The gelato store had been busy on and off over the summer so far, which Garstang put down to patchy weather.</p>
        
            <p>"Our summer feels like it hasn't really come yet, but it does feel like it this week, it's so hot now."</p>

            <p>Across the harbour, on the Petone foreshore, twins Paige and Sammy Townsley were about to go for a dip in the sea when approached by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>As the 11-year-olds zipped up their wetsuits, Sammy said the hot weather was no excuse for not being sun-smart.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really want to get sunburnt, and the sea might be cold as well," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last summer [there was a] cyclone, I prefer this by far ... it's very, very, very hot."</p>
        
            <p>A few streets away, other Wellingtonians are heeding advice to stay hydrated.</p>
        
            <p>At an artesian spring on Petone's Buick Street, Tere Rere was filling up half a dozen 20-litre containers with water for her family.</p>
        
            <p>The Porirua resident said it was more than she usually collected, but she wanted to make sure there was enough water to stay cool during the heat.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to get more water because we encourage everyone to drink water [rather] than fizzy drink," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Drinking water is the best, and it's healthy for you."</p>
        
            <p>Rere was expecting long queues at the spring, but was glad to see a steady stream of a few people at a time instead.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, her family was cooling off with a swim at Days Bay beach in nearby Eastbourne, she said.</p>
        
            <p>On the other side of the fountain, Peter Parkes was filling up two 20-litre containers.</p>
        
            <p>The Karori resident did not come to the fountain often, maybe three times a year, but said it would likely go quicker with the hot weather.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice and warm, probably the first hot day this year. It would be nice to have a few more of them and we'll feel as though we've had a summer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a hot day for Wellington, a hot-ish day. If you have about three or four of these days during the summertime it's all you can probably expect - but we may be expecting more with climate change."</p>
        
            <p>Popular Auckland beaches were also packed as sunshine hit the city of sails.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of tourists and locals flocked to Mission Bay to soak in the sun and splash in the water.</p>
        
            <p>Cheryl, a local, said it was lovely to finally get some heat.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so nice to come down here, made our own lunch, sitting down here, and its lovely - and that breeze, really really nice."</p>
        
            <p>A family visiting from Bangkok said they had extended their stay in Auckland because of the fantastic weather and had not left Mission Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't even left this area because we don't even want to get in the car, we've just stayed literally from this end to that end," Dana said.</p>
        
            <p>Hamish, visiting from Australia, said it was a fantastic end to his holiday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile another local, Barry, was making the most of the sunshine by using a metal detector along the shore.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great, and I've retired last week, ever better isn't it? It's like all my weeks are weekends. "</p>
        
            <p>He said he would make use of the sun by getting some exercise using the metal detector and chatting to people on the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said he was unfortunately coming across mostly bottlecaps so far.</p>
