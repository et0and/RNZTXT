            <p>A murder trial over the death of Karori man Rau Tongia has started in the High Court in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Five women are facing murder charges in relation to his death.</p>
        
            <p>Tongia was killed on Percy Dyett Drive in the early hours of 20 December 2020, and was reported to have been shot.</p>
        
            <p>Four out of the five defendants appeared in court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume and Pania Waaka have all pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder.</p>

            <p>Hunt-Weston has also pleaded not guilty to two other charges.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Andru Isac advised the jury this morning that the fifth defendant was not present due to health reason.</p>
        
            <p>Crown Prosecutor Sally Carter opened the Crown's case.</p>
        
            <p>Carter said Tongia was shot in the back while he slept.</p>
        
            <p>She said earlier in the night Tongia was understood to have assaulted Weston.</p>
        
            <p>Weston was understood to have previously "hooked up" with Tongia's partner.</p>

            <p>Carter said while the Crown did not condone Tongia's actions, he should not have died for them.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the death, Weston and Hunt-Weston were witnessed in the driveway of the Percy Dyett Drive address Weston was alleged to return to, in an altercation with Tongia in relation to the assault of Weston.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt-Weston was on an additional charge in relation to this altercation.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown believed Weston, driven by Waaka returned to that address to kill Tongia later that night.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Police used GPS, CCTV, phone messages and data retained by Facebook and Google to track the accused on the night in question.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown believed Weston either pulled the trigger or assisted in the shooting, Waaka drove Weston to the address, Hunt-Weston lent them the car to get there, and Hume supplied the gun used.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is set down for eight weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people in total have faced charges - with a man and a woman accused of hiding a firearm having already been sentenced.</p>
