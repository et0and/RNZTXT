            <p>There are just two days of campaigning left before polls close in a historically close United States presidential election.</p>
        
            <p>Democrat Kamala Harris campaigns in Michigan on Monday (NZ time) while her Republican rival Donald Trump will hit three eastern battleground states: Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.</p>
        
            <p>A poll has shown Harris leading in Iowa, a state that Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020, raising the possibility of an upset there.</p>
        
            <p>Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller has referred to the poll as an "idiotic survey", CNN reported.</p>
        
            <p>Another poll has Trump ahead in the state, according to Reuters.</p>
