        <h2>'Our goal is to make sure everyone enjoys these lunches' - Seymour</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon and David Seymour front questions in Parliament as school lunch woes deepen.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Associate Education Minister David Seymour have been fronting questions in Parliament as school lunch woes deepen.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour says his number one priority with the school lunch programme has been "maintaining the volume and improving the quality".</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal is to make sure everyone enjoys these lunches so much they're almost going on the blackmarket."</p>
        
            <p>On Luxon willing to wait until late April before stepping in on the school lunches programme, he says Seymour is working "incredibly hard through some very challenging issues".</p>
        
            <p>He says the incident last week was unacceptable and Seymour has "fronted really clearly on that".</p>
        
            <p>"This is a minister who's working incredibly hard through some very challenging issues to make sure that we get our food back to scratch, and to make sure that we deliver on time and in full," Luxon says.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon earlier said it was "pretty lame-o" Wellington councils didn't submit a bid for a regional funding deal to be considered by the government.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, school lunch provider Libelle Group Auckland has gone into liquidation.</p>
