            <p>TVNZ has breached its collective agreement with the E tū union when deciding on discontinuing programmes, the Employment Relations Authority has ruled.</p>
        
            <p>It was announced in March that 68 staff members who work for Midday, Tonight, Fair Go, Sunday, Re: and in video content production were affected by redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the company confirmed the axing of Fair Go and Sunday, along with its midday and late night news bulletins.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the Employment Relations Authority (ERA) ordered the broadcaster to go into mediation with E tū union.</p>
        
            <p>"The Authority finds that TVNZ has breached cl 10.1.1 of the collective agreement," the ruling stated.</p>
        
            <p>It said if after mediation, matters were not resolved, an order would be made against TVNZ to comply with its collective agreement.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ executives and staff were among those giving evidence in an investigation meeting at the ERA in Auckland on Monday relating to the state broadcaster's alleged breaches in its redundancy process.</p>
        
            <p>E tū union took the case against TVNZ, arguing the company did not follow the consultation requirements under its collective agreement with its members.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
