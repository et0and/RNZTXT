            <p>Heavy rain in Hawke's Bay has caused flooding, closed roads and a school, and forced the evacuation of three houses.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said three homes had been evacuated in N큰haka due to flooding and people were relocated to a local marae.</p>
        
            <p>Crews helped pump water out of at least one of those houses.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ assisted two drivers stuck in floodwaters on State Highway 2 and one house in M훮hia threatened by flooding.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 2 was closed due to flooding between Wairoa and Gisborne and State Highway 38 and was closed from Wairoa to Waikaremoana.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Civil Defence said trees had come down and flood debris was causing hazards on the roads. It advised drivers to delay travel if possible.</p>
        
            <p>An evacuation centre is open at the Wairoa War Memorial Hall.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa District mayor Craig Little said the Wairoa River level was high but it had not breached its banks.</p>
        
            <p>N큰haka School in Wairoa was closed for the day because of the flooding and road closures.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Raelene McFarlane said it had been a rough night, and her thoughts were with people in Nuhaka and Wairoa who had been affected by the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Primary School was set to open, with a spokesperson said they were waiting for further instruction from the Ministry of Education.</p>
        
            <p>A MetService orange heavy rain warning had been in place for the Wairoa district to 7am, while Tai R훮iwhiti/Gisborne south of Tokomaru Bay had a heavy rain watch through to 8am.</p>
