            <p>A national survey is set to kick off in Tokelau later this year in an effort to measure the cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>The non-self-governing territory of New Zealand's national statistician said the survey would ask questions like:</p>
        
            <p>How much do you spend in one day?</p>
        
            <p>How much do you spend on boat fares?</p>
        
            <p>And, how much do you receive in remittances from your families overseas?</p>
        
            <p>National statistician Malama Uain Kitiona knows it's a tough ask to give that information but said it's vital for the future of Tokelau that people do so.</p>
        
            <p>"That's all data that it's very, very crucial," Kitiona told Atafu atoll's government media team.</p>
        
            <p>"We really, really, really need your support. The information that we will ask you is very critical to our development."</p>
        
            <p>He said people are also welcome to ask questions about the process.</p>
        
            <p>Kitiona started out in Samoa's Finance Ministry (2006-2008) and joined the Bureau of Statistics before taking on his role in Tokelau.</p>
        
            <p>He moved to Atafu atoll last week.</p>
        
            <p>Kitiona said there is a global economic and also regional economic crisis, "and it would be very challenging for small island nations like us in a rising of inflation, the unemployment rate, even family incomes".</p>
        
            <p>"It's becoming a challenging issue for some families, but this is the only way [to measure the impacts]".</p>

            <p>In his address he also took the opportunity to try and try and inspire more youngsters to take on statistics as a profession.</p>
        
            <p>There are only a few statisticians in Tokelau.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people say, and I'm pretty sure they will tell you, it's a very boring job. You just sit your desk doing Excel, reading numbers, but those numbers are your guiding stars to the future."</p>
