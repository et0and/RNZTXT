        <h2>Whooping cough vaccine numbers too low</h2>
        <p>
The priority should be vaccinating young people with little airways who are at the highest risk of severe infection, says Immunisation Advisory Centre founder.

The epidemic would likely last 12-18 months, Immunisation Advisory Centre founder Nikki Turner said.

            <p>An immunisation leader says New Zealand has a long way to go in its latest epidemic.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday health agencies declared a whooping cough epidemic after 263 cases were confirmed in the last month, and have warned vaccination rates are too low.</p>
        
            <p>Immunisation Advisory Centre founder Nikki Turner told Saturday Morning there was no quick fix, but people should get vaccinated now.</p>
        
            <p>"The epidemic is probably going to continue long and slow. It's going to last 12, probably 18 months," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we need to do is to protect as many most vulnerable people as possible from it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's highly infectious, it's way more infectious than Covid," Turner said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're standing in a room you can spread it to everyone"</p>
        
            <p>"You can get vaccinated now and the protection will kick in in about two weeks," she said</p>
        
            <p>The priority should be vaccinating young people with little airways who are at the highest risk of severe infection, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Lets try and get all our infants vaccinated on time, starting at six weeks of age. If we delay, we're leaving our infants at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Adults should also be wary, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you do get a cough that is... paroxysmal (intermittent attacks of uncontrollable coughing), then go and talk to your doctor, to your healthcare professional and get some antibiotics to try and reduce its effects."</p>
