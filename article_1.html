            <p>US share markets posted heavy losses on fears the American economy is headed for recession.</p>
        
            <p>When markets closed at 8am (NZT), the broader S&P 500 index fell 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.6 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.4 percent. Earlier, the Nasdaq opened 6.3 percent lower, but clawed back some of the losses after data showed US services sector activity rebounding in July.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 12.4 percent, a blow to the world's fourth largest economy.</p>
        
            <p>The recession fears come after a US jobs report last week showed the world's biggest economy added significantly fewer jobs than analysts were expecting, at a time of high interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>The state of the US economy and its stock markets have a direct impact on New Zealanders due to the presence of US and global equities in Kiwisaver accounts.</p>
