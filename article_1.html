            <p>Embattled former minister Andrew Bayly has taken two weeks' leave from Parliament to trek to Mt Everest's base camp in Nepal.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly stepped down from his portfolios last month after grabbing a male staffer's upper arm during a discussion he described as "animated".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands he requested personal leave shortly after his resignation.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was very rare for National to grant personal leave while Parliament was sitting, but requests were considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Simpson took over as Minister for ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs. Bayly remained in his role as MP for Port Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>in October, Bayly apologised after repeatedly calling a worker a loser during a site visit for his former small business portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>The worker's complaint said the minister had questioned why they were still working and told them to "take a bottle of wine and go home ... take some wine and f*** off", and later called them a "loser" in front of their boss, the minister's assistant, marketing staff and other employees, forming an 'L' on his forehead with his fingers.</p>
        
            <p>There were questions over the length of time it took Luxon to announce Bayly's resignation to the public.</p>
