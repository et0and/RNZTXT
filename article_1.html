            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump clashed at a White House meeting that ended in disaster on Friday (local time), prompting an outpouring of reaction from across the globe.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that."</p>
        
            <p>Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.</p>
        
            <p>"Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all. Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace."</p>

            <p>"No one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine! That is why we are jointly seeking the path to a lasting and just peace. Ukraine can rely on Germany - and on Europe."</p>
        
            <p>Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians do. Therefore we are working on a common path to a lasting and just peace. Ukraine can rely on Germany – and on Europe.</p>
        
            <p>"Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people. I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. We, that is the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others. And we must thank all those who have helped and respect those who have been fighting since the beginning. Because they are fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children and the security of Europe. These are simple things, but they're good to remember at times like these, that's all."</p>
        
            <p>"Every division of the West makes us all weaker and favours those who would like to see the decline of our civilisation. Not of its power or influence, but of the principles that founded it, first and foremost freedom. A division would not benefit anyone. What is needed is an immediate summit between the United States, European states and allies to talk frankly about how we intend to deal with the great challenges of today, starting with Ukraine, which we have defended together in recent years, and those that we will be called upon to face in the future. This is the proposal that Italy intends to make to its partners in the coming hours."</p>
        
            <p>"He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>"Canada remains committed to providing the necessary assistance to ensure Ukraine's security, sovereignty, and resilience."</p>
        
            <p>Just spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister @andrii_sybiha to reaffirm Canada’s unwavering support for Ukraine.Canada remains committed to providing the necessary assistance to ensure Ukraine’s security, sovereignty, and resilience. </p>
        
            <p>"It's a punch in the gut for Ukraine. ... There must be room for robust conversations - even between friends. But when it happens in front of rolling cameras like that, there is only one winner. And he sits in the Kremlin."</p>
        
            <p>"A brutal dressing down in the Oval Office."</p>
        
            <p>"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace."</p>

            <p>"The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine defends its freedom - and ours. We stand with Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine defends its freedom—and ours. We stand with Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"Ukraine, Spain stands with you."</p>
        
            <p>Ucrania, España está contigo. Ukraine, Spain stands with you. Україно, Іспанія з тобою.  </p>
        
            <p>"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!"</p>

            <p>"What we saw from the White House today is serious and disheartening. Ukraine still needs the US's support, and Ukraine's security and future are also important to the US and to Europe. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has strong support in Ukraine, broad support in Europe, and he has led his people through a very demanding and brutal time, under attack from Russia. That Trump accuses Zelenskiy of gambling with World War III is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from. Norway stands with Ukraine in their struggle for freedom. We hope that the Trump administration also understands the importance of a just and lasting peace in Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>"We stand with Ukraine more than ever. Time for Europe to step up its efforts."</p>
        
            <p>We stand with Ukraine more than ever. Time for Europe to step up its efforts.</p>
        
            <p>"The Netherlands continues to support Ukraine. Especially now. We want lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression that Russia has started. For Ukraine, for all its inhabitants and for Europe."</p>
        
            <p>"The only obstacle to peace is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's decision to continue his war of aggression. If Russia stops fighting, there will be no war. If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine. Estonia's support to Ukraine remains unwavering. Time for Europe to step up."</p>

            <p>"The scenes from the White House are shocking. How can you stab the president of an invaded country in the back like this? Free Europe will not betray Ukraine!"</p>
        
            <p>Die Szenen aus dem Weißen Haus sind schockierend. Wie kann man dem Präsidenten eines überfallenen Landes so in den Rücken fallen? Das freie Europa wird die Ukraine nicht verraten!</p>
        
            <p>"Aim for PEACE, stop this war! Come on @realDonaldTrump".</p>
