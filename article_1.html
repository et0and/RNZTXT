            <p>Two people have died in a two-vehicle crash north of Mangaweka today.</p>
        
            <p>Police were alerted to the crash on State Highway 1 near the intersection with Ruahine Road around 12.42pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed that two people have died, and three others have been taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The accident would raise the unconfirmed holiday road toll to nine.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 between Waiouru and Bulls is closed to southbound and northbound traffic, with diversions in place via State Highway 4 and 49, while the Serious Crash Unit is attending the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists are advised to expect delays as the detour is expected to add around two-and-a half-hours of travel time.</p>
        
            <p>The accident comes as many travellers are on the roads before the New Year's holiday.</p>
        
            <p>A staff at a cafe near where the crash happened said the cafe was full of customers for at least an hour and a half.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia Coleman, who works at the Dukes Roadhouse cafe, said it was mostly people who got stuck in the traffic.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's just trying to work out what's going on, like obviously reading news articles, working out how long they're going to have to be waiting and like, sorting out plans and stuff like that."</p>
        
            <p>Coleman said the roads were empty by about 3pm as most have left to take detours.</p>
        
            <p>UPDATE 1:30PMSH1 is now CLOSED between Waiouru and Bulls. SCU will be attending the scene and can take several hours to complete their investigations. NB traffic detour via SH4 and 49. Reverse for SB. Allow additional time for your detour and plan your trip accordingly. ^EH https://t.co/XdlWgZhCkD pic.twitter.com/zNTzJz6Ohi</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John confirmed two ambulances, a first response unit, two helicopters and an opterations manager were dispatched to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier RNZ reported at least seven people have died on the roads since Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Sunday, Police Superintendent Steve Greally, director of road policing, said seeing eight fatal crashes with nine people dead since Tuesday is incredibly frustrating.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no excuse for any driver to be endangering their lives and those of others with unsafe behaviours.</p>
        
            <p>"There are many families that have been affected by bad decision making from behind the wheel so far this holiday."</p>
        
            <p>Greally said police would continue to be highly visible at high-risk locations over the holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>"We can all work together to avoid unnecessary road trauma," he said.</p>
