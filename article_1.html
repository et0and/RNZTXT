            <p>A pedestrian killed after being struck by a car in Northland was an off-duty policewoman.</p>
        
            <p>The woman died after the collision at an intersection in the village of Helena Bay on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Family and colleagues made tributes online to the police officer, who was a constable in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>She was a mother and a grandmother and was described as an "instrumental" member of the Te Tai Tokerau community.</p>
        
            <p>"A genuine soul that will be sadly missed by us ... and all those who worked with her," former colleagues said.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said emergency services were called to the intersection of Webb Rd and Russell Rd around 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle hit the pedestrian after leaving the road and colliding with a power pole. Sadly, the pedestrian died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Police extend our condolences to their family and friends at this difficult time, and they are being provided with support."</p>
        
            <p>Another person received minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The area was cordoned off while the Serious Crash Unit examined the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A St John spokesperson said they received a call at 3.17pm and sent one ambulance and one rapid response vehicle.</p>
