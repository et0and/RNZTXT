        <h2>Scientists struggle to explain record surge in global heat</h2>
        <p>
In an unprecedented streak between June 2023 and September 2024, global temperatures were unlike anything seen before.

            <p>The world has been getting hotter for decades but a sudden and extraordinary surge in heat has sent the climate deeper into uncharted territory -- and scientists are still trying to figure out why.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past two years, temperature records have been repeatedly shattered by a streak so persistent and puzzling it has tested the best-available scientific predictions about how the climate functions.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists are unanimous that burning fossil fuels has largely driven long-term global warming, and that natural climate variability can also influence temperatures one year to the next.</p>
        
            <p>But they are still debating what might have contributed to this particularly exceptional heat surge.</p>
        
            <p>Experts think changes in cloud patterns, airborne pollution, and Earth's ability to store carbon could be factors, but it would take another year or two for a clearer picture to emerge.</p>
        
            <p>"Warming in 2023 was head-and-shoulders above any other year, and 2024 will be as well," said Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in November.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish I knew why, but I don't," he added.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still in the process of assessing what happened and if we are seeing a shift in how the climate system operates."</p>
        
            <p>When burned, fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat near the Earth's surface.</p>
        
            <p>As fossil fuel emissions have risen to record highs in 2023, average sea surface and air temperatures have curved upwards in a consistent, decades-long warming trend.</p>
        
            <p>But in an unprecedented streak between June 2023 and September 2024, global temperatures were unlike anything seen before, said the World Meteorological Organization -- and sometimes by a considerable margin.</p>

            <p>The heat was so extreme it was enough to make 2023 -- and then 2024 -- the hottest years in history.</p>
        
            <p>"The record global warmth of the past two years has sent the planet well into uncharted territory," Richard Allan, a climate scientist from the UK's University of Reading, told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>What occurred was "at the limit of what we would expect based on existing climate models", Sonia Seneviratne, a climatologist from ETH Zurich in Switzerland, told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>"But the overall long-term warming tendency is not unexpected" given the amount of fossil fuels being burned, she added.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists said that climate variability could go some way to explaining what happened.</p>
        
            <p>2023 was preceded by a rare, three-year La Niña phenomenon that had a strong cooling effect on the planet by pushing excess heat into the deep oceans.</p>
        
            <p>This energy was released back to the surface when an opposite, warming El Niño event took over in mid-2023, boosting global temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>But the heat has lingered even after El Niño peaked in January.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures have not fallen as fast as they rose, and November was still the second-warmest on record.</p>
        
            <p>"It is difficult to explain this at the moment," said Robert Vautard, a member of the UN's climate expert panel IPCC. "We lack a bit of perspective.</p>
        
            <p>"If temperatures do not drop more sharply in 2025, we will really have to ask ourselves questions about the cause," he told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists are looking for clues elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>One theory is that a global shift to cleaner shipping fuels in 2020 accelerated warming by reducing sulphur emissions that make clouds more mirror-like and reflective of sunlight.</p>
        
            <p>In December, another peer-reviewed paper looked at whether a reduction in low-lying clouds had let more heat reach Earth's surface.</p>
        
            <p>At the American Geophysical Union conference this month, Schmidt convened scientists to explore these theories and others, including whether solar cycles or volcanic activity offered any hints.</p>
        
            <p>There are concerns that without a more complete picture, scientists could be missing even more profound and transformational shifts in the climate.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot exclude that some other factors also further amplified the temperatures... the verdict is still out," said Seneviratne.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists this year warned that Earth's carbon sinks -- such as the forests and oceans that suck CO2 from the atmosphere -- had suffered an "unprecedented weakening" in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>This month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the Arctic tundra, after locking away C02 for millennia, was becoming a net source of emissions.</p>
        
            <p>Oceans, which have acted as a massive carbon sink and climate regulator, were warming at a rate scientists "cannot fully explain", said Johan Rockstrom of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.</p>
        
            <p>"Could this be a first sign of a planet starting to show a loss of resilience? We cannot exclude it," he said last month.</p>
