            <p>A man who escaped police custody on Monday, fleeing from a police van outside court, has handed himself in.</p>
        
            <p>Samir Derek Belhajjam, 30, went to the Taupō Police Station just before 9am.</p>
        
            <p>He faces a charge of escaping from custody and charges related to alleged wilful damage and dishonesty offending.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to appear in Taupō District Court on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō area commander Inspector Phil Edwards earlier said said Belhajjam was being taken back to prison after a court appearance when he managed to evade his police escort.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries into how this occurred were ongoing, Edwards said, and police would be conducting a full review.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were no concerns about staffing levels at the time.</p>
        
            <p>.</p>
