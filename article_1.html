            <p>Lower Hutt's mayor says a festival in the city on Friday was a success, despite reports it was marred by bad behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>There were multiple arrests, disorderly behaviour and assaults on police officers at the JuicyFest hip-hop and R&B music festival, which featured international headliners T-Pain and Ashanti.</p>
        
            <p>But speaking to Morning Report, Lower Hutt Mayor Campbell Barry denied it was anything out of the ordinary for a festival, and questioned the media attention it had raised.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of comments of how much of a success the event was," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, there absolutely were a few incidents, and the police dealt with that, but a lot of people had a really, really good time, and it was a showcase event for the Hutt."</p>
        
            <p>While those incidents had to be taken seriously, they were to be expected, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"In events where you have 15,000 people over a 12-hour period with alcohol involved, you're always going to have incidents which security and police have to deal with.</p>
        
            <p>"That's no different to any other festival across New Zealand, and I don't see the type of media focus or coverage on those festivals."</p>
        
            <p>Barry said he would happily welcome back JuicyFest for another year.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the festival there were fears it would be tarnished by an awful stench from the Seaview wastewater treatment plant that had been plaguing the area in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>But the event was free of the foul odour, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"All reports were that there was no issue from the wastewater treatment plant, as we expected.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a longer term fix for that plant, there is still on and off issues, and we'll get on to that through our long term plan."</p>
