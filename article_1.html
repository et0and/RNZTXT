They're often the first people to arrive at Lake Karapiro and the last to leave - and wake up at 4am to prepare for a day in the Waikato heat.

            <p>They're often the first people to arrive at Lake Karapiro and the last to leave - and wake up at 4am to prepare for a day in the Waikato heat.</p>
        
            <p>The volunteers are the heart of this year's Waka Ama Sprint Championships.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Tim Marshall who said the annual event was "cool" to be a part of.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really healthy, really positive vibe, [there's] great support, and it's a sport for all ages - anybody can paddle, we have under eight's to over 80's."</p>
        
            <p>He had been volunteering for about 24 years; his experience was used to guide others rather than instruct.</p>
        
            <p>"We all work together, we're all a team, and we all work pretty well together."</p>
        
            <p>He started taking his role a bit more seriously in 2011, before then he had a 10-year-long career as the manager for his daughters' waka ama team, which landed him a spot in the paddling dad's squad.</p>
        
            <p>"I did have a paddle with a bunch of dads back in the day, but I always say, such as my prowess on the water, I should stay on land helping out."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said there were familiar faces who put their hands up to help every year, but it's a forever expanding team.</p>
        
            <p>Even rangatahi stick around after their races conclude to do what they could.</p>

            <p>In total there are between 100 and 150 volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>"We got extra numbers from our corrections whānau who have been useful as it gives our usual team a break."</p>
        
            <p>And you can't miss them, all wearing fluorescent pink.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, it's the most attractive part of the job for Craig who was one of 20 volunteers from the Department of Corrections.</p>
        
            <p>"As I've heard, only real men wear pink," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Craig had never attended the event before, but he was enjoying watching the competition.</p>
        
            <p>However, he was not convinced that it's the sport for him.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely not fit enough to do it."</p>
        
            <p>"I think I'll give it a hard pass and let others do it, I just enjoy watching."</p>
