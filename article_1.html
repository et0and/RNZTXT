            <p>The top of the South Island is bracing for a big storm as a deep low crosses the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>Orange heavy rain warnings are in force for Tasman (northwest of Motueka), the Buller District and the Westland ranges, and are set to come in for the Marlborough ranges and Mount Taranaki/Taranaki Mounga from 11am onwards.</p>
        
            <p>The heaviest falls were expected to affect the Tasman District, with about 350 to 450 millimetres of rain forecast about the ranges and 150 to 250 mm elsewhere. The orange warning in this area had a moderate chance of upgrading to a red Warning, according to MetService.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman mayor Tim King said this amount of rain could see slips, flooded roads and rivers bursting their banks.</p>
        
            <p>"The general advice is to be aware, if you're in an area that is potentially subject to the impacts of heavy rainfall do the normal things; checking gutters, checking stormwater gates, checking your own property," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Be aware about travel over the course of the next 48 hours, it may well be that non-essential travel is something that people could delay or put off."</p>
        
            <p>The Tasman District Council said slipping could impact the roads on hills east of Tākaka, including the roads into the Abel Tasman National Park and Tākaka Hill, as well as the Whangamoa and Rai Valley Roads.</p>
        
            <p>King said councils in the region had met with Civil Defence, and would be keeping a close eye on the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Federated Farmers Nelson president Stephen Todd said Tasman farmers were hoping the rain would help ease drought conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Todd, whose family owns dairy farms in the Tūtaki Valley, said this year's drought had been brutal and had cut milk production significantly.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll keep our fingers crossed that we'll get the rain and hopefully we don't get any damages out of it but certainly the rain is more than welcome. Even if we do get a bit of flooding I think people will live with that to get the growth again really," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain was also forecast in Marlborough, with up to 300 mm of rain predicted to fall about the Richmond and Bryant ranges.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough District Council said it did not expect the forecast deluge to result in evacuations for Spring Creek residents.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency (NZTA) urged people driving in areas under active weather warnings to take extra care on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>It said bad weather could see roads closed at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>"Wet roads are slippery so road users should drive to the conditions - reduce speed, increase following distances, and avoid sudden braking. They should also use headlights if visibility is poor - be safe, be seen. Heavy rain also increases the risks of slips and localised flooding," NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA West Coast maintenance contract manager Moira Whinham said the most significant impacts on the West Coast were expected through the Buller District, and over the SH73 alpine passes, with smaller amounts of rainfall forecast south of Greymouth that might affect SH6 drivers.</p>
        
            <p>In Buller, up to 300 mm of rain was predicted to fall about the Paparoa Range and 160 to 220 mm elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Buller mayor Jamie Cleine said sandbags were being given out as a precaution to people in Westport who had previously dealt with surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>"With those rain intensities particularly later Thursday afternoon and into Friday there could easily be reasonably significant surface flooding around our urban areas," he said.</p>
