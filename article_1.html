        <h2>Coalition's gang legislation passes into law banning patches in public places</h2>
        <p>
The coalition's gang legislation - that bans patches in public - has passed into law.
</p>
        
            <p>
Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says the legislation has achieved the right balance between limiting gang members' freedom of expression and New Zealanders' rights to live without fear and intimidation.

            <p>The coalition's gang legislation - that bans patches in public - has passed into law.</p>
        
            <p>The government wants to prohibit gang members from wearing their insignia in public places so they are not able to intimidate others.</p>
        
            <p>Two additional amendments to the legislation this week will mean patches are banned from being displayed in cars and police will be able to search the homes of those who breach the ban three times.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said he had the balance right between limiting gang members' rights of expression and New Zealanders' rights to live without fear and intimidation.</p>
        
            <p>... More to come</p>
