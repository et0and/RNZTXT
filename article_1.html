            <p>The University of Otago has 20,000 students. Just one answered the call to help clean up the mess they have made during O-Week.</p>
        
            <p>Keep Ōtepoti Dunedin Beautiful co-ordinator Kelsey Porter said it was "disappointing" that only one person joined her in the cleanup of the north section of Castle St.</p>
        
            <p>"This person collected 50kg of rubbish and a couple of bags of recyclable glass in the space of an hour, but it was not enough to make much of an impact on that street," Porter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, it was a little bit of a bummer to not see more students turn out, especially as the state of Castle St and the surrounding flats area at the moment is very untidy.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's just a matter of developing pride for where you're living. A lot of people want to go do cleanups or something out at the beaches, but really we all need to be cleaning up our own backyards first."</p>
        
            <p>Porter said Salmond College would head towards Bracken's Lookout today, while Arana College would clean along Anzac Ave, heading towards the marina.</p>
        
            <p>She said there were several students who were trying to do the right thing.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a stall over at O-Week inviting people to come to the cleanup, which is how they heard about it, and they agreed that the area needed to be cleaned up.</p>
        
            <p>"So the students were aware of it."</p>
        
            <p>Taskforce Green leader Rik Wilson assisted Porter with the cleanup.</p>
        
            <p>"Frankly, I was pretty disgusted by the student apathy and lack of support."</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the Otago Daily Times.</p>
