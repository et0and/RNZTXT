        <h2>'That is fascism' - Peters on protesters at NZ First speech</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has been repeatedly heckled while delivering a State of the Nation speech in Christchurch.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers while delivering a State of the Nation speech in Christchurch today.</p>
        
            <p>Protesters and counter-protesters were gathered outside the James Hay Theatre where Peters was speaking, raising issues ranging from greyhound racing to the war in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>During the nearly hour-long speech there were seven interruptions by about 10 hecklers who railed against the New Zealand First leader.</p>
        
            <p>"Winston Peters what have you done about the genocide in Gaza," said one.</p>

            <p>To which Peters responded: "We knew they couldn't wait. Go home. These are the kind of fascists they are."</p>
        
            <p>"Get that man a Valium.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not disturbing us here. We're not going to be put off by you."</p>
        
            <p>The disturbances were met with cheers and jeers from a crowd that sounded largely supportive of Peters' messaging.</p>
        
            <p>During the speech Peters hailed New Zealand First as "a true nationalist party".</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to declare a war on woke.</p>
        
            <p>"Make New Zealand first again" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the most concerning and insidious cancers in our society today is the underlying creep of woke social engineering," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"This seeping of the leftist group-think and condoned by too many on the right, has been mostly hidden from society in the way it has implanted itself in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Peters also spoke on reassessing New Zealand's commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"Why are we making a rod for our own backs, punishing our farmers and our taxpayers and our economy, when China or the US could sneeze and produce more CO2 overnight than we do in a year?"</p>
        
            <p>"We together are going to take back control, take back our country, and Make New Zealand First Again," Peter's said at the speech's conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>During a media stand-up following the speech Peter's hit out at the protesters again.</p>

            <p>"They just wanted to waste people's time.</p>
        
            <p>"That is fascism," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He also said that New Zealand First would not work with Hipkins or the Labour Party in its current state.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not wasting our time with the present bunch of ... losers."</p>

            <p>In response to Peters' speech Hipkins said: "While Winston Peters was yelling at protesters and channelling Donald Trump, Labour is focused on what really matters: jobs, health, and homes. This coalition drove the economy into a recession, and now they're trying to distract from the damage they've done with even more division."</p>
        
            <p>The speech came on the heels of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' arrival back from Washington DC, where he met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
        
            <p>Peters has been tight-lipped about the specifics of the meetings he attended, insisting he will brief his Cabinet colleagues before speaking publicly on the issues.</p>
