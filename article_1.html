            <p>Australia has beaten the Black Caps by three wickets in the second cricket test to win the series 2-nil.</p>
        
            <p>Under grey skies in Christchurch, Australia were led to victory by a superb century from Alex Carey to defy the Black Cap bowlers.</p>
        
            <p>Australia have won nine of the last ten tests, with one drawn, over the last decade which had otherwise seen NZ beat other test nations, peak at number one in test rankings and win the inaugural World Test Championship.</p>
        
            <p>It means New Zealand last beat Australia at test cricket in December 2011 in a seven run win in Hobart.</p>
        
            <p>But local fans had to go back to March 1993 to have seen a home win against the Australians, a low-scoring five wicket win in Auckland, featuring players like Martin Crowe and Danny Morrison.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have won just eight of the 62 tests in history against their trans-Tasman rival.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
