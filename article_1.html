            <p>Police are appealing for any information after a 19-year-old woman was reported missing by her family.</p>
        
            <p>Maia Johnston left a family address in Totara Park, Upper Hutt, at around 8.30pm on Saturday to go for a walk and has not been seen since.</p>
        
            <p>Police updated shortly before 8.30pm Sunday saying the search was still active.</p>
        
            <p>Police and Maia's family are concerned about her well-being and are anxious to locate her, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's now been 12 (hours) she has been gone. Please if anyone knows anything please contact me!," her mother Amy Walsh posted on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not in trouble we just want to know you are safe please!"</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking that anyone with CCTV cameras in the Totara Park area check for sightings of Maia between 8 and 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>They are also asking for anyone in the vicinity of Harcourt Park and Brown Owl to review their CCTV for any sightings of Maia after 8:15 PM last night.</p>

            <p>In a Facebook post on Saturday night, Johnston's mum Amy Walsh said she left her house in Akron Grove while intoxicated.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been searching for her since 9pm. She has no phone, no wallet, nothing. Just the black jeans shorts, green shoestring singlet and a black tshirt she was carrying. Wearing converse shoes."</p>
        
            <p>Walsh said she and "half the neighbourhood" had been out searching in heavy rain overnight, and there was "no sign of her anywhere".</p>
        
            <p>"I just can't understand where she has gone."</p>
        
            <p>"She does not know the area and I am seriously concerned for her safety."</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Totara Park may see a drone in the air behind the houses on the northern end of Totara Park as part of the search, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Walsh told Stuff she moved to Upper Hutt in July, and Johnston is visiting from Hamilton for Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information is asked to call 105 or make an online report, and use the reference number 241222/0237.</p>
