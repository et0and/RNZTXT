        <h2>Why you might see more roadworks over summer</h2>
        <p>
NZTA explains why longer days and warm temperatures are the "best time" for resurfacing roads.

            <p>Longer daylight hours and warm temperatures are the "best time" for resurfacing roads, the New Zealand Transport Agency says, because the conditions help new seal stick to the road surface.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as resealing work last week, just north of Tuamarina, caused queues up to 3km long.</p>
        
            <p>The work - part of New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi's (NZTA) summer highway maintenance programme - finished on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>An NZTA spokesperson said the warmer spring and summer months were the best time for resurfacing.</p>
        
            <p>"Warm weather helps ensure the new seal becomes strong and long lasting," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Bitumen (asphalt) and emulsion are liquids when they are hot and hard when cold.</p>
        
            <p>"They can crack in cold weather, return to a liquid state in high temperatures, and wet road conditions during sealing will affect the bond between the bitumen and the road, leading to chip seal failures.</p>
        
            <p>"During the peak summer months, it is a balance to programme as much work as we can before schools return, while the roads are quieter, whilst also minimising the effect on people's holiday travel."</p>
        
            <p>The Tuamarina reseal was separate to work taking place at a water-damaged section of State Highway 1, near Picton, which was expected to be finished in October.</p>
        
            <p>Large cracks had started to form on the highway, near the Picton elevation, following a build-up of underground water pressure.</p>
        
            <p>A northbound slow lane had been closed for the repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, night closures were planned for State Highway 6 between Hira and Rai Valley from 11 February to 1 March. The closure would not happen on Friday and Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA top of the south system manager Rob Service said parts of the highway needed to be resurfaced before winter to ensure the highway was safe and in "tip-top shape".</p>
        
            <p>"We have deliberately timed the work to happen at night and outside the busy holiday period," Service said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means we affect as few road users as possible."</p>
        
            <p>It was the first major work on the Whangamoa Saddle since a seven-week closure for flood repairs in 2022, Service said.</p>
        
            <p>"We realise road closures are disruptive, but they're actually the best option," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The road would open once at 12.30am each night to let traffic through.</p>
        
            <p>The summer maintenance programme included multiple sites across the top of the south, including SH1 Weld Pass.</p>
        
            <p>Work on the installation of two new roundabouts on SH6, west of Blenheim, had also commenced and was expected to take at least until mid-May.</p>
