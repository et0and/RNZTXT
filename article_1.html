        <h2>Bioluminescence resembles blue 'LED lights in waves'</h2>
        <p>
It may be visible again after providing a spectacular light show on Paraparaumu beach last night.

            <p>More bioluminescence may be seen in Kāpiti after a spectacular light show on Paraparaumu beach on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Bioluminescence is a chemical reaction that takes place within some organisms, causing them to emit a light known as luminescence.</p>
        
            <p>It typically makes the water's surface appear to have a blue glow.</p>
        
            <p>Local photographer Bruce Wang was among those who captured the phenomenon last night.</p>

            <p>He said he had been out at the beach to photograph Comet C/2024 G3 (Atlas) - a once-in-a-lifetime comet that has been spotted over New Zealand skies this week.</p>
        
            <p>Wang said he then noticed that parts of the beach were glowing.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Lyall Bay based photographer Bradley Saunders-Garner headed out to Paraparaumu with his wife and a friend after seeing reports of the bioluminescence online.</p>
        
            <p>He said they initially were not able to see anything.</p>
        
            <p>"We decided to look closer and as we walked through a puddle, making our way to the waves, our feet left a blue sparkle. We moved closer to the breaking waves and they would glow in different areas with each breaking wave."</p>
        
            <p>
The spectacle looked like a bit of magic, Bradley Saunders-Garner says.

            <p>The bioluminescence looked like someone had dropped "hundreds of blue dimmed LED lights in the waves".</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty magic," he said. "On a par with seeing the Aurora Australis from Wellington's south coast."</p>
        
            <p>Photographer Matthew Davison, who has been photographing bioluminescence for years, said it was rare to see bioluminescence this far south.</p>
        
            <p>"Typically the most common sightings happen in the northern parts of the North Island, typically where the waters are a little bit warmer."</p>

            <p>Sometimes, if the conditions were favourable the bioluminescence blooms stuck around, but often they were less spectacular over subsequent nights.</p>
        
            <p>"From my experience, generally you have one night where the show is amazing and then the following days tends to really sort of tail off and and disappear," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But sometimes people got lucky.</p>
        
            <p>For those hoping to see bioluminescence water, Davison said seeing pink algae blooms during the daytime was a good sign.</p>
        
            <p>He said a lot of people also sounded the alert of a bioluminescence sighting through social media.</p>
        
            <p>But unlike the equally elusive Aurora Australis, bioluminescence was much easier to see with the naked eye.</p>
        
            <p>Davison has also developed a tool which can help identify when a bioluminescence show might next appear.</p>

            <p>Agal ecologist from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Karl Safi said the organisms people would likely see along the coastline were likely to be a part of the plankton, most likely dinoflagellates.</p>
        
            <p>He said the main bioluminescence species in New Zealand was the Noctiluca scintillans.</p>
        
            <p>Warmer and more stable weather conditions in Wellington over the past few days had likely brought the organisms to the surface, making the light show apparent.</p>
        
            <p>"If the stable conditions continue we might expect we'd see more of the same occurring."</p>
        
            <p>But he cautioned people against jumping into the water, saying that although the bioluminescence species were most likely safe, there were some that were toxic.</p>
