        <h2>What public sector job cuts mean for Wellington small business</h2>
        <p>
It's not just public sector workers who are feeling the pain - the Wellington shops and services who rely on their custom fear they will be hit hard, too.

            <p>Small business owners in Wellington say they are already struggling - and many fear they will be further hit by public sector job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of jobs are set to go across the civil service, with the latest announcements - from the Ministry of Education and Oranga Tamariki - expected this week.</p>
        
            <p>Best of the Bunch Florist owners Vanessa and Steve Jones said their business relied heavily on government workers.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be less people coming into work, and less people coming into our shop, [the job cuts] will definitely affect us," Steve Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are already a lot less customers coming into the shop at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Vanessa Jones said small businesses were struggling and a lot of the shops in the Wellington CBD were empty.</p>
        
            <p>"People have less money to spend, or they just don't have spare money.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to buy food and feed the kids first. I totally understand the situation - but then that means they're not going to have too much money to spend on other things."</p>
        
            <p>The pair said the business was still suffering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially with more people working from home.</p>
        
            <p>"We barely have a few customers every day, and the same goes for all our neighbours. It's been quite hard," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>Ramesh Parbhu from Molesworth Shoe and Bag Repairs said his business had never recovered to pre-Covid-19 levels and the prospect of losing more trade was hard to swallow.</p>
        
            <p>"If we don't get the people from the offices, we don't get business."</p>

            <p>On The Terrace, Frank's Coffee and Eats operations manager Oisín Tegeler said he was nervous about the effect of the job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"Four or five regulars have told us that they've lost their job in the past two weeks, which is tough for them, and tough for us, obviously - we hate to see them go."</p>
        
            <p>He said the cafe still did not have as many customers as it did before the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"The business is healthy - it's just not quite where it was three or four years ago."</p>

            <p>Greater Wellington regional councillor for Pōneke Yadana Saw said some Wellington businesses would not be able to weather the stress caused by the job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 and the recession had put a lot of pressure on owners and the public sector cuts were not helping, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having over 1000 people no longer [with] jobs in the CBD not only impacts the businesses there in terms of the lunchtime trade, but it's also [about] what people have in their back pocket to be able to spend at other times.</p>
        
            <p>"Are these people going to come to our independent retailers who sell books or the clothing boutiques? It's the flow-on effect of that.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be things like exercise classes and gym memberships. It's also the types of people who send their kids to extracurricular arts and music activities."</p>
        
            <p>If customers continued to dwindle, some businesses would have to consider their own job cuts, Saw said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them are facing bankruptcy. I know that there are people who own small hospitality and retail businesses who are going to be extending their mortgage so they can pay out their businesses and their staff."</p>
        
            <p>Businesses were just trying to get by right now, rather than make a big profit, Saw said.</p>
