        <h2>What Mormons think of Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</h2>
        <p>
The "soft-swinging" scandal TV series is very un-Mormon, so what do members of the church think?

            <p>The controversial new TV show Secret lives of Mormon Wives is raising eyebrows around the world, but not so much in the church's New Zealand branch.</p>
        
            <p>The reality TV series that dropped on Disney+ over the weekend depicts a social media savvy group of friends in Utah, where the Mormon church is headquartered, who are dealing with the fallout from a "soft-swinging scandal." There's lots of highly-manicured women, often in tight or barely there clothing, talking or dancing provocatively and drinking alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>It all seems very un-mormon. Much of what is depicted in the show goes against teachings in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the church's preferred name, where alcohol is typically prohibited and monogamous marriage is eternal.</p>
        
            <p>It makes you wonder what everyday church members in New Zealand and in the US, where the church was founded, think of the show.</p>
        
            <p>The eight-episode series on Disney+ follows a group of eight rule-breaking mums who collectively have millions of followers on TikTok. It all hits the fan when queen MomTok influencer Taylor Frankie Paul revealed she was getting a divorce after her and her husband, Tate Paul, participated in some soft swinging (basically all levels of intimacy with other people but sex).</p>

            <p>The show looks at the two years following that initial scandal as the mums bicker and argue, but also have meaningful discussions about friendship and the role women should play in Mormon families.</p>
        
            <p>The show has spawned dozens of hot takes, reviews and not surprisingly TikTok posts. Ave Marin, who claimed to be a former member of the church, said the show did "a fantastic job of capturing some of the Utah bubble."</p>
        
            <p>"I can correlate every single one of the girls in the cast to someone in my life whether it is a friend, a former co-worker, someone I used to babysit for. They represented so many different types of LDS women that I grew up with here in Utah," she said.</p>

            <p>Other former or current church members called the show "Mormon bait," meaning the show was fishing for views by doubling down on the stereotype outsiders have of church members (historically, husbands in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could have multiple wives, but that was outlawed in 1890). There have been countless other shows that hit the "Mormon bait" category such as the creepy but enthralling documentary series Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey and the mini series Under the Banner of Heaven. </p>
        
            <p>Another TikTok user, Morgan Van Wagoner, said she is a current church member in the state of Utah where about 60 percent of people are listed on the church's roll, but attendance is likely less. She binged watched the show over the weekend and agreed it was an accurate depiction of Utah's Mormon culture.</p>
        
            <p>"I have so many friends in the church that are very devout and follow all the rules," she said. "I have a lot of friends who are on the line and struggle with a lot of things."</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we should tear apart other women for making their own decisions on it all," she added.</p>
        
            <p>Brigham Riwai-Couch, 23, who lives in Wellington and is training to be a teacher, said church members here are a bit more reserved. "That's just New Zealand culture, I guess," he said.</p>

            <p>About 55,000 people in New Zealand's 2018 census said they attended the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church says the real figure is more than double.</p>
        
            <p>Like the two other church members RNZ spoke with, Riwai-Couch didn't watch the show and probably won't. He watched the trailer. He saw a few clips online. That was enough.</p>
        
            <p>"It kind of strengthens that stereotype about members of the church that's been formed over the years" he said, referring to when polygamy was accepted in the church.</p>
        
            <p>Jana McQueen, 31 and an HR professional in Auckland, lived in Utah twice for a total of about three years. She disputed other observations that the show mirrored church culture in Utah.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was interesting going from New Zealand, where she was a minority in terms of her faith to Utah "where you are more a minority if you were not in the church," she said.</p>
        
            <p>McQueen attends church every Sunday no matter where she is in the world which has included the USA, Asia and all around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got a character that is kind and helpful and they help...I've experienced a supportive value-based community everywhere I've gone," she said, of church members.</p>

            <p>Take a dive down the rabbit hole of Mormon TikTok videos that mention New Zealand and you will find lots of "missionary call letter" openings. They're like a gender reveal party, but swap expecting parents for young church members about to find out the location of their mission trip, a rite of passage for devout churcWe are just as normalh members (In this case, destination: New Zealand!).</p>
        
            <p>Other videos show off the raging youth dances the church puts on for young people that are -presumably- drug and alcohol free.</p>
        
            <p>"There's some island songs that are played but mostly just clean tracks. There's still Chris Brown in there, and other cool songs, but all the clean versions," said Riwai-Couch.</p>
        
            <p>His mother is Dr Melanie Riwai-Couch, 50, who now works for the church after two decades in education. She said her daughters will often post a photo on social media of themselves after church, where members typically go for a "sunday best" outfit: women in dresses (or not) and men in a shirt and tie. But it's worlds away from opulence shown in Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we have secret lives anymore than anyone else has secret lives," said Riwai-Couch. ", as dysfunctional, as functional as represented in other people."</p>
