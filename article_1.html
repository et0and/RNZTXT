            <p>Kuini Nga wai hono i te po has ascended the throne of the Kiingitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Her father, Kiingi Tuheitia who died one week ago, was laid to rest yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A group of 14 rangatira - known as Tekaumaarua - conferred to decide who would succeed him, and to consult with other iwi and rangatira.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Morning Report, Tekaumaarua chairperson Che Wilson said although the advisory council's name meant 12 in te reo, it was more of a "concept rather than a number".</p>

            <p>"It's based on King Pootatau, King Tāwhiao and their council ... they leaned into the term connected to the disciples [of Christ]."</p>
        
            <p>The process for appointing a new kiingi or kuini was agreed to by iwi leaders throughout Aotearoa, rather than the privy council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our job was to facilitate the hui, with ariki Tumu Te Heuheu - the paramount chief of Ngāti Tūwharetoa - presiding over the hui."</p>
        
            <p>As chairperson, his role in the hui was to guide the process and "allow our people to speak", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a really good process, we focused in on attributes - not just for the role, but also how we then support the new monarch. And we had a really good talk."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson had been present at the 2006 hui for the appointment of the Kiingi Tuheitia, and said he was taken there to ensure consistency.</p>
        
            <p>"There were about seven young people at that hui, and I was taken there by my elders ... Sir Archie Taiaroa, who took me in. He was at the decision of King Korokī's tangi for Dame Te Atairangikaahu ...</p>
        
            <p>"So it was important that we maintain that process this time, of ensuring that there will be somebody who is alive in at least 30-plus years."</p>

            <p>The new kuini would need to build on the kotahitanga movement, Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, iwi turned out in force at Tuurangawaewae in response to a rare royal proclamation from Kiingi Tuheitia to come together.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hopes are that she takes her time to get used to the role, while maintaining some momentum.</p>
        
            <p>"She still needs to mourn her father, but there's some momentum that her father has created for te iwi Māori with the different hui-aa-motu, and as she gathers her breaths we're there to support her...</p>
        
            <p>"Kotahitanga is often translated as unity, but I see it as unity of purpose.</p>
        
            <p>"People think it means you've got to be the same. You don't need to be the same, and I think if she can continue that momentum of kotahitanga...</p>
        
            <p>"Because what Kiingi Tuheitia did yesterday - you had gang members next to each other, you had people in suits, people in gumboots. There's a photo online of her with the grave diggers.</p>
        
            <p>"He was able to connect to all walks of life, and already she wanted to acknowledge the people who did the last work on her father."</p>
