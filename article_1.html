            <p>Tauranga based drummer Stan Bicknell is facing an agonising wait after the audition of a lifetime with unconventional American prog rock band Primus.</p>
        
            <p>Bicknell was one of 11 drummers selected from more than 6000 applicants after the band threw their selection process open to the world late last year.</p>
        
            <p>In response to - long time drummer - Tim 'Herb' Alexander's abrupt departure from the group last year the band issued a callout online for their next drummer.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeking a well-mannered, affable individual with original sensibility and aesthetic, possessing a desire to open new doors in the creative world.</p>
        
            <p>"Flashy chops are wonderful, but groove, pocket, and the ability to listen, react, and contribute to the musical conversation is a must," the band posted last November.</p>
        
            <p>Bicknell - a fan of Primus from his teenage years - said he immediately felt aligned to the qualities the group requested.</p>
        
            <p>"I would call them an alternative rock prog [progressive] band. They're quirky, they're fun. Throughout their whole career they've been risk takers, they've never really conformed. Les [Claypool], he's one of the most talented bass players in the world. Everything they do is from a creative stance and he's never really given that up, which I really admire," Bicknell said.</p>
        
            <p>Born in Hastings, Bicknell played in bands in his hometown and Hamilton before moving to Melbourne to pursue a "career in music and coffee" before returning to New Zealand during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>He's toured and recorded with artists such as Kimbra, Miami Horror and his own outfit The New Caledonia as well as creating online content filming drum videos for his online subscribers.</p>

            <p>Bicknell said - in applying for the gig - he made sure to focus on the qualities that he felt matched the band's requirements and avoided recording a clip of a Primus song hoping his existing posts would speak more to his skills as a player.</p>
        
            <p>"I said to them that 'I could definitely honour your past but also cater to your future and it would be a pleasure' and then I left it at that. I've got so much content online that if they're not into anything that I've already recorded showing myself then there's no point in us getting into a room together.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew not to post a Primus cover because that's literally what 6200 drummers ended up doing. That's how many submissions they got and they watched all of them. Larry [LaLonde, guitarist] said 'I would've felt bad if I didn't because that could've been someone's dream'," Bicknell said.</p>
        
            <p>A few weeks later an email arrived from bass player Les Claypool.</p>
        
            <p>"It opened up with 'Ahoy there Stan Bicknell down in Hobbit land'. I could almost hear his voice as I was reading it. I had a damn near outer body experience. I thought it was fake to be honest," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last week Bicknell travelled to Los Angeles to meet with the band and jam in their personal rehearsal space - dripping with psychedelic imagery and Primus memorabilia. He was quickly mic'd up for the cameras filming the auditions.</p>
        
            <p>"They've gotta make the biggest career decision that they have in a long time based on a two and a half hour interaction. So the whole thing was getting recorded and then they can go back through with a fine tooth comb," Bicknell said.</p>
        
            <p>LaLonde and Claypool arrived and after a quick fist bump and a few probing questions the three musicians started jamming.</p>
        
            <p>"I had an hour to set up but I think I was ready in about 20 - 25 minutes and so we jammed for about 30 minutes. Just free form jamming like old school - three dudes jamming in a room - just riffing off each other.</p>
        
            <p>"It was cool. When he started playing I thought to myself 'just stay present and just listen' and then I felt like I was just jamming with some mates," he said.</p>

            <p>The trio then worked through four songs, two chosen by the band and two that Bicknell got to select from a pair of set lists.</p>
        
            <p>He purposefully chose a technical "deep cut" that he felt would show the depth of his preparation and musicality.</p>
        
            <p>Another brief chat and and a moment to check out the player's instruments and "I was sent on my merry way".</p>
        
            <p>A week later Bicknell was still content about his performance.</p>
        
            <p>"It was surreal. I said to myself 'far out, I couldn't have done any better' and there is something really great about that alone.</p>
        
            <p>"I now know the other 10 drummers that were in the room, I know all those drummers and they are all weapons. But for some reason I still feel that I'm the right guy. But I also don't know what Les and Larry want, ultimately, so the rest is with the universe but my cup's pretty full man, I'm pretty happy," Bicknell said.</p>
        
            <p>Bicknell said he would find out whether he had won the gig within the next week but it could be a while before any decision came out publicly.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had discussed the role with his partner of 18 years and he knew he had the backing of her and his three children.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not like your average session gig. They're looking for a member. Over my 27 years as a drummer I've often pulled back on big opportunities - to make sure that my family are at the forefront - but at the same token an opportunity like this could potentially change my family's life.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be hard to be away. Their first tour is called the Sassanta 2.0 tour where it is A Perfect Circle, Primus and Puscifer all on tour for six weeks but this is a needle moving career opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that my wife's got my back and my kids will be forever better for it because I've reached for something big and gone with it."</p>
        
            <p>Now, Bicknell and his family wait for the call that could change their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awful. It's kinda like waiting to find out if you've won the lottery or not. It is a needle in a haystack situation already and to be waiting just kinda sucks. I'd rather know that I didn't get it now than have to wait for another week. Limbo sucks man," Bicknell said.</p>
