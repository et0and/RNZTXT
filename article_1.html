            <p>Lydia Ko turned in the round of the day but it wasn't quite enough as she finished third at the LPGA Tour's season ending tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Ko appeared to fall all out of contention after a disappointing second round dropped her outside the top 20 at the NZ$18.8 million Tour Championship in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>However she fought back over the weekend and started the final round seven shots off the lead.</p>
        
            <p>Her nine under par 63 was the best of the day and moved her up nine spots.</p>
        
            <p>The world number four hit 15 birdies in her final two rounds and recorded just one bogey.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old Kiwi finished five shots behind winner Jeeno Thitikul of Thailand.</p>
        
            <p>Ko said she stayed patient during the final round.</p>
        
            <p>"I played really solid, I gave myself a lot of good looks for birdies and it was the best way I could hope to end my official season," she told the LPGA Tour.</p>
        
            <p>The Tour Championship is the richest women's tournament with Thitikul picking up $6.8 million, while Ko pocketed $940,000.</p>
        
            <p>Ko had a remarkable season, winning Olympic gold, claiming her third major title (the British Open) and becoming eligible for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>Her official season is over, winning three LPGA tournaments this year and earning $5.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>She said her Olympic success was the highlight.</p>
        
            <p>"Knowing that Paris was going to be my last (Olympics) opportunity to win a gold and to represent New Zealand at an Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>"To make all my dreams come true by winning the gold there was unbelievable.</p>
        
            <p>"The string of events I had after that and just playing consistently has helped a lot with my confidence."</p>
        
            <p>Ko will defend her title at the Grant Thornton Invitational teams tournament with Australian Jason Day next month.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month Ko was the recipient of the LPGA's Heather Farr Perseverance Award.</p>
        
            <p>The award honours an LPGA Tour player who, through her hard work, dedication and love of the game of golf, has demonstrated determination, perseverance and spirit in fulfilling her goals as a player.</p>
