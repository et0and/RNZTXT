            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has given his annual State of the Nation address from Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>Peters used roughly half of the speech to criticise the previous Labour government, along with the media and the Green Party, before outlining New Zealand First's plans for the country.</p>
        
            <p>Those included training 500 new frontline police officers and introducing new measures to tackle youth crime.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to know where their parents were on the night or day of the offence."</p>
        
            <p>The party also planned to repeal the Therapeutic Products Act, upgrade the SuperGold card and the Veteran SuperGold card and "properly fund" Mike King's mental health initiative Gumboot Friday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest cheers from the crowd - which was standing room only at the 240-seat convention centre - came when Peters spoke about removing gender and sexuality lessons from the school curriculum, and making English an official language of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Peters called for unity in closing his speech, saying New Zealanders needed to work together to restore New Zealand to what he said was its former glory.</p>
        
            <p>"We can become again the envy of the world."</p>
        
            <p>This week, in his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peters returned to New Zealand after a whirlwind trip visiting several countries in the South and South East Asia region.</p>
