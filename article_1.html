        <h2>How a Māori parliament could work</h2>
        <p>
Te Pāti Māori has called for a separate Māori parliament, which is being discussed among hundreds gathered at a national hui.

            <p>Hundreds of Māori gathered at Ōmāhu Marae near Hastings for the second national hui this year following one at Ngāruawāhia.</p>
        
            <p>Among those in attendance are Kiingi Tuuheitia, Rātana Church tumuaki Manuao Te Kohamutunga Tamou and Sir Robert 'Bom' Gillies, the last surviving soldier of the 28th Māori Battalion.</p>
        
            <p>Strategies for how to put the kaupapa of kotahitanga (unity) into action are being discussed at the hui.</p>

            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Tākuta Ferris spoke at the pōwhiri and presented the party's declaration of Māori independence to establish a Māori parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu chair Bayden Barber said Māori held their own future.</p>
        
            <p>He shared some details of a potential Māori parliament, which he said would be modelled on the Māori parliament which first stood at Waipatu Marae in Hastings in 1892.</p>
        
            <p>"Kei te kapu o ā tātau nei ringaringa te apōpōtanga o te iwi Māori, we have it in our hands e hoa mā.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's time we organise ourselves nē, we need to organise ourselves koira tō tātou nei mahi i te rā nei."</p>
        
            <p>The parliament would include an upper and lower house with traditional leaders - like Kiingi Tuuheitia sitting above acting as spiritual guidance, Barber said.</p>
        
            <p>The government still had an important part to play in Māori affairs, as seen with the Budget, he said.</p>
