        <h2>Road and rain warnings from far south up to lower north</h2>
        <p>
Drivers are being urged to take extra care on South Island roads, and warned that roads could close, as heavy rain and wind warnings spread orange and yellow across the MetService map.

Heavy rain is on the way for several regions, including Westland - where flooding caused major road damage last month.

            <p>Drivers are being urged to take extra care on South Island roads, and warned that roads could close, as heavy rain and wind warnings spread orange and yellow across the map.</p>
        
            <p>An intense front is expected to move north over the South Island and then up the lower North Island, with heavy rain and severe gales likely for many places between Sunday morning and Monday, MetService forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>The west of the South Island is expected to be particularly hard hit, after flooding and slips closed major roads there for almost half of last month.</p>
        
            <p>As much as 250mm of rain could fall in some Westland areas between 6am and 9pm on Sunday, MetService said, with possible thunderstorms and peak rainfall up to 35mm per hour. Through Sunday and into early Monday the headwaters of Canterbury lakes and rivers could also expect up to 250mm, parts of the Grey and Buller Districts could expect up to 160mm in places and parts of Tasman could expect up to 150mm of rain.</p>
        
            <p>Waterways could rise rapidly, with surface flooding, slips and difficult driving conditions all possible.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, heavy rain could hit the Tararua Range, from late Sunday into Monday, with up to 100mm of rain possible.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency said State Highway 6 - the main corridor up the west side of Te Waipounamu - could shut at short notice if the storms create fresh slips or rockfalls.</p>
        
            <p>Rockfall protection work was still being carried out on the highway, as part of the clean-up from the November flooding, NZTA central South Island system manager Mark Pinner said, and there were concerns that heavy rain could trigger more.</p>
        
            <p>"We are monitoring the area around Epitaph Slip this weekend, and if rainfall does intensify on Sunday, we may close that section of route ... either because of fresh activity, or as a precautionary approach. This will be the largest rainfall since we had the original issues there," Pinner said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned that people should stay up to date with the latest forecasts.</p>
        
            <p>Updated Severe Weather Watches and Warnings have been issued for the passage of an active front tomorrow and into Monday morning.  Warnings for heavy rain have been issued for the West Coast and adjacent ranges. In addition, strong wind warnings have been issued for much of the… pic.twitter.com/zoV91ULUXl</p>

The Bridge Hill fire has not yet been contained, and while heavy rain is expected on Sunday, strong winds are too.

            <p>Meanwhile, severe gales are forecast from Sunday, for the Canterbury High Country, including for State Highway 73 where the Bridge Hill scrub fire is still burning - and for the Marlborough Sounds, Kaikōura coast and ranges, Wellington and up into south Wairarapa.</p>
        
            <p>Near the Bridge Hill fire, the road is open, but a 30km/h speed limit is in place during the day, with traffic being taken in convoys between Flock Hill and Castle Hill.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency incident commander Colin Russell said the fire was not contained, firefighting was continuing on the side of the State Highway 78, and people were not permitted to leave their cars in the exclusion zone around the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"A large number of firefighters, trucks and tankers are still working in the area, with helicopters operating close to the road in places. We want to keep the traffic flowing on the state highway, while at the same time make sure that our crews can operate safely," Russell said.</p>
        
            <p>"From 8am [Sunday] until about 8pm the area will be under traffic management, with single lane access and escorted convoys led by a pilot vehicle. Overnight there will be two-way traffic but a 50km/h speed restriction."</p>
        
            <p>Strong winds watches had also been issued for winds possibly approaching severe gales for much of the rest of the South Island and further north, including: Stewart Island, Fiordland, Southland, Otago, the Canterbury Plains, Banks Peninsula, wider Marlborough region, Tararua District, north Wairarapa, and southern Hawke's Bay.</p>
