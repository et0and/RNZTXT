            <p>Two men have died and three are critically injured after a huge brawl in Gisborne overnight.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 people were involved in a massive fight on Lytton Road in Elgin, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers arrived about 11.30pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of police units were needed to gain control of the scene, and during this time two men were located deceased," acting inspector Danny Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>"Three others have been transported to hospital in a critical condition."</p>
        
            <p>A woman who lives on the Gisborne street where the brawl took place described it as a gang area.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who asked to be anonymous, said she heard yelling and fighting breaking out at what was otherwise a quiet party about 11.30pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>She came home from work to the quiet party across the street, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would've been just after 10.40[pm] when we got home and I happened to see a Mongrel Mob coming up.</p>
        
            <p>"It was actually a quiet party. Yeah, it was just a party. I didn't even know that anything was gonna happen."</p>
        
            <p>She said she did not feel safe living in the area today.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in the middle of Black Powers and Mongrel Mobs, so Black Power do actually live really close, so it is a gang-related sort of thing.</p>
        
            <p>"I can go to work, because there is a back way to go to work, but I refuse, just for my own safety."</p>
        
            <p>The resident said she saw gang members at the party, before hearing a fight break out later on.</p>
        
            <p>"All I heard was just swearing, yelling, and I heard the pops as well. My partner was telling me, oh there's a lot of pops and cops coming. ... [we] didn't realise it was that close to home."</p>
        
            <p>The woman said police cordons were still in place outside her house, and she had been told roads were closed until Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Gisborne Hospital spokesperson confirmed to RNZ the hospital is in lockdown. It is unclear if this is related to Saturday night's incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide inquiry after the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons remain in place and a scene examination will be carried out this morning," Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that events like this are incredibly concerning for our community. Police will have a highly visible presence across Gisborne over the coming days, and extra patrols will be carried out to provide reassurance to members of the community."</p>
        
            <p>Additional police staff had been called on to assist, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Further information would be released when it became available.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne Mayor Rehette Stoltz said the news was "heartbreaking".</p>
        
            <p>"It's heartbreaking for our community and it's heartbreaking for the families of the men involved."</p>
        
            <p>Mass brawls had not been an ongoing problem in Gisborne, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that our community will feel this. It doesn't matter what happened, families are affected and there are families mourning this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with them and our thoughts are also with our police who have to deal with this and keep our community safe."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said she had spoken to police on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The update I got is that they want to reassure the community and them having more visible police around will give that reassurance to the community in this tough time."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had heard the brawl was a party gone wrong.</p>
