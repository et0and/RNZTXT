            <p>The two people charged in relation to a homicide investigation sparked by a body found in the Gulf Harbour in March, can now be named.</p>
        
            <p>They are 36-year-old man Kaixiao Liu, and 36-year-old woman Lanyue Xiao.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were charged with offering an indignity to a dead human body early last month.</p>
        
            <p>They were initially granted interim name suppression, but the judge had declined an application for continued name suppression at a subsequent call of the case.</p>
        
            <p>Their names continued to be suppressed for some time as their lawyer Michael Kan intended to appeal that decision.</p>
        
            <p>However, Kan confirmed on Thursday that they are no longer seeking name suppression.</p>
