            <p>There will be enough support for both junior and overseas-trained doctors with more placements set to be available from next year, Health Minister Shane Reti says.</p>
        
            <p>The Medical Council is tripling the number of places for NZREX exam spots for international candidates next year, with up to 180 places instead of the 60 initially planned.</p>
        
            <p>It will now have three exam dates in March, June and September 2025, up from two in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The NZREX is an exam that assesses the clinical safety of overseas-trained doctors who aren't eligible to be registered through any of the Medical Council's other pathways.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said the lack of exam places had been raised with him repeatedly as a barrier to those doctors being employed by the health system, along with a lack of clinical placements.</p>
        
            <p>"We find ourselves in a position that the first gateway for those doctors who are here in New Zealand, but they've been unable to participate in the New Zealand health system," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first hurdle in getting places on the NZREX exam has been a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of these doctors were sending me information, saying one minute after when the exams had opened, all the places had been taken.</p>
        
            <p>"This makes no sense."</p>
        
            <p>Internationally-trained doctors had reported that they had been working in call centres and driving Ubers due to barriers in getting registered.</p>
        
            <p>The Association of Salaried Medical Specialists said an increased number of placements for international doctors could put more pressure on senior doctors in workplaces.</p>
        
            <p>Executive director Sarah Dalton said this is already a problem in "some of the smaller hospitals".</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of a medical workforce, they are being offered very very inexperienced people to come and work there which puts a huge amount of pressure on the specialist doctors that are there."</p>
        
            <p>However Dalton said any increase in the number of doctors working in the country was cause for celebration.</p>
        
            <p>Reti referred to last month's announcement of frontline funding for 50 new senior doctors when RNZ asked if more placements could lead to a lopsided workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw part of that plan three weeks ago when [I made that announcement].</p>
        
            <p>"I've got my attention on all parts of the health workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a junior doc so I know what this looks like and you do need senior mentors to mentor junior doctors."</p>
