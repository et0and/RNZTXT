            <p>Prime Minister Chrisopther Luxon says small political parties will always try to get media attention and he's not worried about ACT leader David Seymour's actions.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour attempted to drive a Land Rover up Parliament's steps on Monday, and his of two criminal cases was also being questioned.</p>
        
            <p>"Small parties are always going to try and get media attention - that's politics", Luxon told Morning Report. "That's what I've learned in the last four years. But I can tell you, I'm very focused on actually growing and driving the economy."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Finance Minister Nicola Willis has added to the criticism of Seymour's letter of support for Philip Polkinghorne, who was later charged and then acquitted of murdering his wife.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately I agree with the prime minister, of course, and I think he's formed a view that it was ill-advised for David Seymour to write that letter…</p>
        
            <p>"And in terms of the publicity stunt earlier… I don't even know what it was publicising. We've got a bit of a lack of car parks on Molesworth Street at the moment, but I'm not sure the situation's so desperate that you needed to find a car park on Parliament's steps."</p>
