        <h2>‘We’re evolving’: Robertson pleased with All Black effort against Fiji</h2>
        <p>
Scott Robertson says the All Blacks got what they wanted out of the San Diego trip - but there's more to come as the Rugby Championship looms. Video

            <p>All Black coach Scott Robertson was happy his side broke the shackles a bit in their 47-5 win over Fiji in San Diego, and said the team is "evolving" after three wins in a row to start the season.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks outscored the Fijians eight tries to one in front of a large crowd at Snapdragon Stadium, with the lower intensity of defence in contrast to the series against England - meaning the backs were able to operate with a bit more attacking intent.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a balance of the both," said Robertson when asked about the combination of more space and positive attitude.</p>
        
            <p>"We were a little bit more courageous in playing. We were aware [that] sometimes we didn't take opportunities against the English by having a crack.</p>
        
            <p>"We really focused on making sure we took those second test positives into this one, get the boys set early and take those opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of last-pass stuff, some called back by the ref, some of those didn't stick. But what we created was exciting, we're evolving."</p>
        
            <p>The only drawback from the game was the early withdrawal of Cortez Ratima due to a heavy landing on his head and failing the subsequent HIA. Debutant Noah Hotham took his place and played out the remaining hour of the match.</p>
        
            <p>"[Ratima] woke up well, [and the] doctor said he was in good spirits. He'll go through the next two- or three-week protocols," Robertson said, before confirming that fellow halfback TJ Perenara was expected to be available for selection for the upcoming Rugby Championship.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll get into selection chats on Wednesday or Thursday before we publicly release the team for the Rugby Championship on Sunday," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>It was another good display by Damian McKenzie, after his performance in the second test against England at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"DMac's starting to own the 10 jersey, ask and demand of others more. He kicked extremely well - six out of seven conversions, out of hand he can grow as we all can."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said the partnership McKenzie had with the experienced Beauden Barrett at fullback was "exceptional".</p>
        
            <p>"How they see the game and how they see the kick space, opportunities out wide … with Beauden out the back giving that voice worked well."</p>
        
            <p>It's one of a few interesting selection conversations going forward.</p>
        
            <p>Anton Lienert-Brown and debutant Billy Proctor's combination in the midfield worked very well right from the opening kick-off.</p>
        
            <p>Proctor was rewarded with a first half try, after a strong season with the Hurricanes saw him called up to the test side.</p>

            <p>As for the occasion itself, Robertson was full of praise for the support both from the locals and travelling All Black fans.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people came to be a part of it. The Americans put on some show, the stadium, the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"It was good to share that with the American public, the Kiwis that travelled and the passionate Fijian supporters. To showcase our beautiful game, when it's played well, it can create an atmosphere like that."</p>
