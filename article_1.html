        <h2>Why watching the sun set is good for you</h2>
        <p>
"Nature takes you away from those things that stress you, and brings you back to the things that regulate and connect you. I think we have to make that more of a priority."

            <p>Sunsets leave artist Jayde Hopkins feeling peaceful and reset.</p>
        
            <p>While "not religious", the Gurindji and Woolwonga woman, who lives on Larrakia lands in Darwin, says a sunset can also make her feel in "awe of the universe".</p>
        
            <p>"I think as an artist it's the colours that really speak," Jayde says, "the warm colours make me feel that way too."</p>
        
            <p>She'll even point a sunset out to strangers at the petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll never see the same sunset again. It's only there for a short amount of time. It's up to you to notice and appreciate it before it's gone."</p>
        
            <p>It's the same feelings and emotions she tries to recreate abstractly through her painting.</p>
        
            <p>Jayde also welcomes sunsets because they mark the end of the day.</p>
        
            <p>"You're finished work and now your life is in your hands," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Psychologist Carmen Cubillo, also a Larrakia woman, says spending time in nature can have positive health impacts, and that a sunset - particularly on the beach - is a multi-sensory experience which can help us reflect.</p>
        
            <p>"Nature takes you away from those things that stress you, and brings you back to the things that regulate and connect you," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we have to make that more of a priority."</p>
        
            <p>Cubillo says that for her, time on country isn't only beneficial in the present but also an opportunity for her to build up resilience before future stress.</p>
        
            <p>Watching the sun set from the beach at Bulgul on her Wadjigan grandmother's country, south of Darwin, is "very special".</p>
        
            <p>"I was there in my mama's belly, and now I get to take my daughter out there."</p>
        
            <p>CEO of the Australian Psychological Society, Zena Burgess, says a sunset can connect us with something bigger than ourselves.</p>
        
            <p>She says research has shown the positive impact natural environments can have, especially on low levels of anxiety or negative thinking.</p>
        
            <p>"It triggers a positive effect for people," like walking on the sand barefoot instead of in shoes.</p>
        
            <p>It's why people remove their shoes at the beach, or are drawn to looking and commenting about a sunset.</p>

            <p>Based in Naarm/Melbourne, Burgess' usual morning routine involves swimming in the bay as the sun rises.</p>
        
            <p>It rewards her with a "sense of optimism for the whole day".</p>
        
            <p>Burgess says to get the most out of time in nature, you should be enjoying it regularly and "not expecting it to be a singular event".</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a substitute for mental health care, but it's something that can contribute in a positive way," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Cubillo says watching a sunset can also be unifying experience if you're with your family or a larger group.</p>
        
            <p>Burgess agrees; "It can have a quite a communal aspect watching a sunset".</p>
        
            <p>She says when people gather to watch a sunset, "there's a sense of being part of the community, you don't feel alone". This can have an emotional impact, she says.</p>
