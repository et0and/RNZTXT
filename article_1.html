        <h2>Live: Ships comb harbour in hunt for man missing from ferry</h2>
        <p>
The odds are tough if the man went overboard in the dark and cold in Wellington Harbour, a deputy harbourmaster says, as boats and helicopters search.
</p>
        
            <p>A search is on for a man who is believed to have fallen overboard from a ferry in the Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>The missing person is a Pākehā man in his 40s, police say. They are urgently seeking information to help identifying him.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood said he was told the sole passenger on the first East by West ferry crossing from Queens Wharf to Days Bay on Friday morning was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>Atwood told Morning Report the odds were not in favour of the missing man, given he would have fallen in during a cold morning and in the dark.</p>
