            <p>A New York jury's guilty verdict against Donald Trump may have shocked the general public - but some who watched the case closely were not surprised.</p>
        
            <p>With the burden of proof on prosecutors, the case was Trump's to lose.</p>
        
            <p>But his team's lack of a counter-narrative and a flawed strategy to undercut the case's weaknesses stymied the defence, lawyers and former prosecutors told the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>And before they even walked into court, one factor already had set up a tough battle.</p>
        
            <p>"The single biggest problem that the defence had in this case," said Mitchell Epner, a New York civil litigator, "was that Donald Trump was their client".</p>
        
            <p>To convict Trump, the jury had to be certain he falsified his business records, and that he did so intending to conceal or commit a second crime.</p>
        
            <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's Office's case went like this: With Trump's approval, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid adult film star Stormy Daniels US$130,000 to stay silent about an alleged sexual encounter so as not to derail Trump's 2016 campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Trump then approved a fraudulent scheme to disguise the reimbursement to Cohen as legal expenses to hide the hush money.</p>
        
            <p>In doing so, he ran afoul of election rules, prosecutors said, which amounted to "election fraud, pure and simple".</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution then called 20 witnesses and offered scores of crucial documents, including cheques to Cohen bearing Trump's signature.</p>
        
            <p>Trump pleaded not guilty to the 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>
        
            <p>But "the defence never had a story that the jury could accept," said John Moscow, who spent 30 years working for the Manhattan DA.</p>
        
            <p>While they did not have to disprove the prosecution's case, giving the jury a plausible reason behind Trump's reimbursement to Cohen, for example, would have helped, experts said.</p>
        
            <p>During his final argument, Trump's attorney Todd Blanche provided an alternate explanation for the fraudulent documents: that they were payments for actual work Michael Cohen did in 2017, and therefore recording them as legal expenses was not fraud.</p>
        
            <p>The defence also argued that Trump paid Daniels only to protect his family, not to defraud voters, but then the team never developed that argument, Epner said.</p>
        
            <p>"They never picked a lane, and because Donald Trump closed off every lane that could have been reasonably been picked," Epner said.</p>
        
            <p>"They tried to throw dust in the air and make the jurors confused."</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution used meticulous documentation to show falsified business records, but the evidence that Trump actually intended to commit or conceal that all-important second crime was "thin to nonexistent", Randall Eliason, a professor at George Washington University Law School, told the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's team did not focus on hammering this weakness, though in his summation, Blanche gave the jury a list of reasons for reasonable doubt.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, they argued that the central events of the case never happened, or that witnesses had lied.</p>
        
            <p>But the jury may have found these claims were not supported by later evidence and testimony.</p>
        
            <p>Eliason said a more effective defence would have been: "Assume for the sake of argument all of this happened. The sex happened, the hush-money happened, and Trump knew about it. Fine. That's not what the charges are. What's the evidence of Trump's actual intent and knowledge? That's where the case falls short."</p>

            <p>In Trump lawyer Susan Necheles' cross-examination of Daniels, she sought to portray the actress as a liar wanting money and fame for her story.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a surprise to no one that there was most likely a lot of pressure from the client to paint certain people as liars," said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not necessarily the best defence strategy. Stormy Daniels didn't have to be a liar for [the defence] to win."</p>
        
            <p>The defence's best chance at winning was discrediting Cohen, a star witness.</p>
        
            <p>Cohen certainly created plenty of ammunition over the years: guilty pleas for lying to Congress and other crimes, endless public statements bashing his former boss, and questions about whether he had lied to a judge.</p>
        
            <p>Blanche hammered these points.</p>
        
            <p>In his closing argument, he called Cohen the "GLOAT" - the "Greatest Liar of All Time".</p>
        
            <p>During the trial itself, he cast serious doubt on Cohen's testimony that he had called Trump - who was using a bodyguard's phone - about the hush money on 24 October 2016.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought that was a huge win for them, potentially catching him in a flat out lie or misremembering," Cominsky said.</p>

            <p>But the defence also made some fumbles.</p>
        
            <p>Blanche's first real question to Cohen was a provocative one: "'You went on TikTok and called me a Crying Little Sh**' didn't you?"</p>
        
            <p>Cohen evenly responded, "Sounds like something I would say."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Juan Merchan admonished Blanche in a sidebar. "Why are you making this about yourself?" he asked.</p>
        
            <p>"That was an astoundingly bad moment," Epner said. "It was a showdown at high noon, and he got trounced."</p>
        
            <p>The defence called only one substantial witness, lawyer Robert Costello, to undercut some of Cohen's claims.</p>
        
            <p>But Costello's testimony was contradicted by his own emails, and in an unusual and chaotic moment, a furious Justice Merchan cleared the courtroom so he could admonish Costello about his behaviour on the stand.</p>
        
            <p>Not every lawyer, however, believed there was much the defence could do.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure they did anything wrong," said Karen Agnifilo, who was the chief assistant district attorney at the Manhattan DA's office until 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"The case is what it is."</p>
        
            <p>The evidence linking Trump to the crime was strong, others said.</p>
        
            <p>"People get convicted on evidence a great deal less secure than this," Moscow said.</p>
        
            <p>Not every legal expert was convinced the prosecution's legal prowess won the case, however.</p>
        
            <p>Jed Sugarman, a professor at Boston University School of Law who said he identifies as politically progressive, thought the election fraud aspect was exaggerated for political effect, and that the underlying crimes warranting a felony charge were never clarified.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors' victory, he believed, came down to bringing the case in a liberal-leaning jurisdiction and selecting a favourable jury.</p>
        
            <p>"Trump's mistake," Sugarman said, "is doing crime-y stuff in Manhattan".</p>
