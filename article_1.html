            <p>McLaren's Lando Norris swept to victory in a wet and wild Australian Grand Prix on Sunday, holding off defending champion Max Verstappen in a white-knuckle finish to a Formula One season-opener littered with crashes and safety cars.</p>
        
            <p>Mercedes' George Russell was third on the slippery Albert Park circuit where only 14 of the 20 cars finished in the treacherous conditions.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Liam Lawson went out on the 47th lap and was unable to finish his first race with the top Red Bull team, as many drivers were tripped up by the wet conditions.</p>
