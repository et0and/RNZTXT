            <p>Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec may have gone viral for his calm and casual demeanour at the Paris Olympics but what he was feeling inside was quite the opposite.</p>
        
            <p>Dikec's nonchalant pose, with his non-shooting hand casually tucked into his pocket, sparked a flurry of memes on social media as he won silver alongside Sevval Ilayda Tarhan in the mixed team 10-metre air pistol event.</p>
        
            <p>But the 51-year-old said: "At that moment, everyone says I seemed very calm, but actually, storms were raging inside me.</p>

            <p>"I think my shooting pose represented the Olympic spirit very well: the fair play, simplicity, clarity and naturalness. That's why it got so much attention."</p>
        
            <p>Dikec opted not to wear the high-tech gear of his shooting competitors, donning a simple yellow earplug and regular glasses instead.</p>
        
            <p>His pose has been emulated by fellow athletes, with Sweden's pole vault champion Armand Duplantis paying tribute after breaking his own world record at the Games.</p>

            <p>Turkey midfielder Irfan Can Kahveci also appeared to copy the celebration during Fenerbahce's 2-1 Champions League qualifying defeat by Lille on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>After securing his first Olympic medal, Dikec is aiming to go one better at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles and dethrone Serbian champions Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec.</p>
        
            <p>"My partner and I will get the gold at the Los Angeles 2028 Games," said Dikec.</p>
        
            <p>"I've only lent the gold medal until 2028."</p>
