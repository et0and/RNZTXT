            <p>Wednesday would see more road snowfall warnings, this time on Arthur's Pass and Milford Road.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's warning for Arthur's Pass was in place from 9am until 3pm with one or two centimetres of snow possibly accumulating above 800 metres.</p>
        
            <p>The Milford Road warning was in place from 2am until 10am with between two and five centimetres possible above 600 metres.</p>
        
            <p>In a video forecast, MetService meteorologist John Law said much of the rain would clear overnight into Wednesday but some "brisk" southwesterly winds would remain on the western side of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Cloud and showers were expected for parts of the South Island, including Westland and Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>"But for many of us, what we'll find through the night time will be clear skies and cold temperatures," Law said.</p>

            <p>Heading into the early hours of Wednesday, Law said many parts of the North Island would be below zero degrees, including Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the rest of the day, sunny weather was expected for the Bay of Plenty, as well as Nelson and Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>However, any exposed places could expect cloud and "showery weather", he said.</p>
