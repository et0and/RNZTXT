            <p>Veteran award-winning journalist and presenter Mihingarangi Forbes is joining RNZ's Saturday Morning programme as co-host.</p>
        
            <p>"After many years of current affairs and more recently documentaries focusing on Aotearoa's history, this is an opportunity to explore new subjects including lighter topics," Forbes (Ngāti Paoa/Ngāti Maniapoto) said in a statement on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super excited to be part of a new kaupapa and sharing ideas to entice new audiences."</p>
        
            <p>Forbes began her journalism career at TVNZ's Te Karere in the 1990s, as a reporter.</p>
        
            <p>She will be a familiar face to many RNZ listeners, having worked in roles on current affairs shows Campbell Live (Three), The Hui (Three), 20/20 (TVNZ) and Native Affairs (Whakaata Māori).</p>
        
            <p>Most recently Forbes has been presenting Māori current affairs programmes Mata with Mihingarangi Forbes (RNZ) and Mata Reports (TVNZ).</p>
        
            <p>She was the joint winner of the Te Tohu Kairangi Award at this year's Voyager Media Awards. The award "recognises excellence in storytelling demonstrating mātauranga/Māori knowledge and understanding, sensitivity in dealing with kaupapa Māori, kaupapa wairua etc, adherence to tikanga and/or te reo Māori skill".</p>
        
            <p>Former Morning Report host Susie Ferguson took over the Saturday Morning hosting duties from Kim Hill earlier this year.</p>

            <p>"Susie has been very well received as Saturday Morning presenter," said RNZ chief content officer Megan Whelan.</p>
        
            <p>"The show is one of RNZ National's most popular long-running programmes and it's exciting to be able to update it with the addition of another presenter. Susie and Mihingarangi are incredibly experienced and talented interviewers, who will make a really engaging on-air team."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ said the show would retain its present magazine format, with "long-form in-depth feature interviews on current affairs, science, history, culture, the arts and entertainment, lifestyle and practical topics such as gardening and food".</p>
        
            <p>Forbes was expected to be on-air from mid-August.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no shortage of ideas for an updated Saturday Morning, and look forward to sharing our plans once we've locked them in," Ferguson said.</p>
