            <p>A Hamilton woman defrauded four property rental companies over nearly three years, costing them tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>Christine Joy Scott, aged 49, went to such extreme lengths to avoid paying rent that she falsified her driver's licence and handed over fake bank statement payments in a series of different Tenancy Tribunal hearings over two years.</p>
        
            <p>She was so dogged in her lies that one property management company even created a Kiwibank account to make it easier for her to make her fake payments into.</p>
        
            <p>After two years of defrauding two property management companies - with a third noticing her altered driver's licence - she was arrested but told police, "Sounds like someone has been using my name for something."</p>
        
            <p>She eventually admitted her charges and was bailed but just three months later, in July 2023, she was back at it.</p>
        
            <p>This time she targeted two more property rental companies, clocking up more than $10,000 in unpaid rent.</p>
        
            <p>Scott was in the Hamilton District Court for sentencing on Friday afternoon before Judge Glen Marshall on four charges of knowingly altering documents, two charges of intending to mislead a tribunal, and three charges of using an altered document with intent to defraud, which has a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>On 15 March 2021, Scott viewed a rental property on Bellmont Ave, Hamilton, that was being managed by Harcourts Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>An essential part of her application to rent the property was to submit proof of identification, to enable companies to carry out background and credit checks.</p>
        
            <p>For reasons unknown, Scott altered her driver's licence by incorrectly changing her middle name to "Jen" and altering her date of birth and driver's licence number.</p>
        
            <p>She was given the property on 9 April but by 21 July she was nearly $1400 in arrears. In mediation it was arranged she would pay an extra $300 a week on top of her weekly $490 payment.</p>
        
            <p>Scott didn't. Instead, she ended up in the Tenancy Tribunal owing $2130.</p>
        
            <p>She attended the hearing via phone and told the tribunal she had paid two outstanding payments so the tribunal was unable to terminate her tenancy.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, the tribunal must terminate a tenancy that is at least 21 days in arrears unless satisfied it has been cleared or is unlikely to reoccur.</p>
        
            <p>Harcourts challenged Scott's claim, saying nothing had been paid by 30 July.</p>
        
            <p>Two further hearings were held, and Scott produced fake ASB Bank screenshots showing payments had been made. She was so convincing that the adjudicator ruled in her favour.</p>
        
            <p>But Harcourts didn't give up. The company got further information from ASB that no payments had been made and at a final hearing in December 2021, the adjudicator reversed their decision and an order of $3150 was made.</p>
        
            <p>In July 2022, Scott successfully applied for a Heaphy Terrace property through Me & My House Property Management, again by falsifying her driver's licence, for $560 per week.</p>
        
            <p>She missed eight rent payments totalling $4480.</p>
        
            <p>Again she faced a series of Tenancy Tribunal hearings, producing more falsified bank statements and denials of missing rent payments.</p>
        
            <p>She again won the hearing, but the company complained to the police, who sought a production order from Kiwibank which confirmed the payments were never made.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, by the time she left the property, on 7 December 2022, she owed $9214.50 in rent.</p>
        
            <p>While Scott, who was working as a learning assistant at a local primary school, was battling that tenancy hearing, she applied for another property on Ascot Rd, Chartwell, through Lodge City Rentals.</p>
        
            <p>However, the eagle-eyed employee reviewing her documentation was suspicious of the paperwork and upon closer inspection noticed the background and lettering of her driver's licence had been altered.</p>
        
            <p>When eventually questioned by police in March 2023, she said, "Sounds like someone has been using my name for something."</p>
        
            <p>While on bail she did it all over again - this time for a property in Rototuna North through PC Property Management, and again altered her driver's licence.</p>
        
            <p>She got the house on 1 August 2023, for $700 per week but between then and 10 January last year missed several rent payments.</p>
        
            <p>Scott denied missing payments and was so convincing that the company opened its own Kiwibank account for her to pay rent into. She didn't pay anything.</p>
        
            <p>Then, on 21 January last year, she successfully applied for a property on Holford Place, Hamilton, through McQuire's Property Ltd, using her same M.O.</p>
        
            <p>But by 1 March, she was $1700 behind in rent. The company did not receive any money.</p>
        
            <p>When questioned again by police she denied altering any documents.</p>
        
            <p>Scott's counsel, Kane Bidois, was tasked with convincing Judge Marshall to keep his client out of jail, despite her getting a sentence indication of home detention from her first set of offending.</p>
        
            <p>He said Scott was remorseful and had begun making "constant" reparation payments in 2023 and was continuing.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not seeking reparation for any of the payments because that would be sorted in the civil court.</p>
        
            <p>Another reason to keep her out of jail was the fact she was still employed which would enable her to keep up with her reparation payments.</p>
        
            <p>"That's her taking responsibility for her offending," Bidois said, while also asking for credit for previous good character.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall said the "real sting" in her offending was misleading the Tenancy Tribunal, which Bidois acknowledged bordered on perverting the course of justice.</p>
        
            <p>Bidois said his client would have gone to restorative justice with the victims but it was declined.</p>
        
            <p>"The offending itself is unusual and . . . quite puzzling for a person at your age and stage in life, Ms Scott," the judge told her.</p>
        
            <p>"Up until this offending, which is by no means usual, and it's repeat offending of a nature that you must have known you'd be caught out in the end.</p>
        
            <p>"It escapes me."</p>
        
            <p>Scott's offending had also put the property management companies through a "considerable amount of angst and inconvenience and the owners of properties were considerably out of pocket".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall was baffled by her behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Why you engaged in this offending and tried to carry it on escapes me, really. I don't know why someone in your position would have done that.</p>
        
            <p>"You appear to be a responsible mum. No doubt your children are equally puzzled as to why you are here."</p>
        
            <p>He agreed to issue a home detention sentence, stating it "would be a great shame" to put her behind bars.</p>
        
            <p>Scott was sentenced to 10 months of home detention and 200 hours of community work, but he issued her a warning.</p>
        
            <p>"Do not come back before the court again."</p>
