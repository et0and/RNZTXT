            <p>A row over a courtesy coach outside an Invercargill pub led to a 78-year-old man being pushed to his death, a jury has heard.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Robert Fulton, 46, is on trial in the High Court at Invercargill this week defending a charge of manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's case is on 28 January last year, after a scuffle over courtesy coach rules, Fulton pushed Douglas Watson.</p>
        
            <p>He fell backwards and hit his head on the ground, causing a brain bleed that ultimately led to his death, the court heard.</p>
        
            <p>Fulton denies the charge and says the assault was justified.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday the jury was shown CCTV footage of the confrontation that night.</p>
        
            <p>In the video, Watson is seen throwing a bottle and Fulton reacts by jolting away.</p>
        
            <p>Fulton then grabs Watson in a restrictive hold from behind.</p>
        
            <p>Less than a minute later Fulton pushed on Watson's chest with both hands, causing him to fall backwards on to the concrete where he lay motionless.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Hugo Young outlined the defence, saying Watson was "disorderly and out of control" on the night.</p>
        
            <p>The defence says Fulton was, in the circumstance of this particular case, legally justified in pushing Watson away from him as he did.</p>
        
            <p>"Either Mr Fulton was acting in defence ... and/or he was preventing a breach of the peace."</p>
        
            <p>If the jury agreed that was the case, Fulton must be found not guilty, Young said.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Mary-Jane Thomas said given the circumstances, Fulton should have known the assault was likely to cause more than trivial harm.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard from the Newfield Tavern courtesy coach driver, who knew both men as regulars at the pub.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were arguing because Watson was trying to bring his bottle into the van, and that was against the rules.</p>
        
            <p>The driver said Watson just wanted to get into the coach, and after Fulton told him not to bring his drink on board, he threw the bottle across the carpark.</p>
        
            <p>"I was actually quite surprised he threw it - no one's ever done that."</p>
        
            <p>She was panicked about the escalating nature of the argument.</p>
        
            <p>"I could see that it wasn't going to resolve itself."</p>
        
            <p>The driver was shocked by the incident and was surprised the pair were so angry over getting into the bus.</p>
        
            <p>"Kevin's normally  happy-go-lucky, calm farmer."</p>
        
            <p>She recalled Fulton saying things such as "why the f*** would they let you in if you're biffing stubbies?" and "get the f*** out of my face" before the fatal push was delivered.</p>
        
            <p>She had saved enough seats on the coach for Fulton, his friend and Watson.</p>
        
            <p>She did not leave the tavern until the ambulance had taken the victim, who was conscious and talking at that stage.</p>
        
            <p>Later, she dropped Fulton home in the coach.</p>
        
            <p>The assistant manager was called to help when the men were becoming worryingly agitated.</p>
        
            <p>He came out and saw Watson being pushed to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>There was a loud "crack" as his head hit the concrete, the driver said.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember him falling like a tree."</p>
        
            <p>After the push, she grabbed Fulton by the arm to prevent any further trouble.</p>
        
            <p>Another regular who was in the passenger seat of the van during the fight spoke to Fulton shortly after the assault.</p>
        
            <p>He recalled the defendant saying "I barely touched him".</p>
        
            <p>Fulton was "distraught" and not his usual self, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is being presided over by Justice Jonathan Eaton and is expected to take a week.</p>
