        <h2>Kiwi pilot killed in Cairns crash wasn't reckless, former colleague says</h2>
        <p>
Blake Wilson was a "goody good" and the dramatic circumstances of his death don't make sense, a coworker says.

            <p>A former colleague of the pilot killed in a helicopter crash in Cairns says he wasn't reckless, and the circumstances don't make sense.</p>
        
            <p>Blake Wilson, 23, died after 'misappropriating' a helicopter from his employer's hangar about 2am on Monday and flying into a no-fly zone over the central city before crashing into the roof of the DoubleTree hotel.</p>
        
            <p>His employer, Nautilus Aviation, said he was a member of its ground crew and had been celebrating his promotion with workmates on Sunday night, before he took the helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson held a New Zealand commercial helicopter licence, but was not authorised to fly in Australia, Nautilus said.</p>
        
            <p>A former colleague, who did not want to be identified, worked with Wilson at Coronet Peak in Queenstown - she was a ski instructor and he worked the lifts.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a happy guy you know. He did silly dances, let my students throw a bunch of snowballs at him, gave a million high fives. He just wanted to bring the vibe up and get everyone stoked on the mountain. He was always up for a good yarn or adventure," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It had been years since they caught up, and hearing of his death was "devastating", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So young and heartbreaking because he did everything right. He got out, lived his dream of becoming a pilot and he made a great life for himself.</p>
        
            <p>He was not reckless - rather, a "goody good", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Head-screwed-on kind of guy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not adding up."</p>

            <p>Others who knew Wilson told RNZ on Wednesday he was a "good all-round fella" and "one of the best out there".</p>
        
            <p>Queensland police are still investigating, and will prepare a report for the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said safety investigators were due to finish collecting evidence on Wednesday, and would provide a preliminary report in six to eight weeks' time.</p>
