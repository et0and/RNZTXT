        <h2>Great Barrier Island goes without resident dentist for 8 years</h2>
        <p>
The last resident dentist retired in 2016, and some residents are resorting to DIY solutions for pain relief.

            <p>Great Barrier Island is in dire need of a dentist, with some residents resorting to DIY solutions for pain relief because they cannot afford the trip to the mainland for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The island community in the Hauraki Gulf had resident dentists in the past, but the last one retired in 2016, leaving all of his dental equipment to the community.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, visiting dentists have operated out of the clinic when possible, but it has been nearly a year since the last visit, and demand for dental services on the island is growing.</p>
        
            <p>Joanna Piekarski has lived on Great Barrier Island for nine years.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, part of her tooth broke off while she was eating dinner - leaving her with a nasty toothache.</p>
        
            <p>"It got painful, and it was keeping me up at night, and the pain travelled down the nerve, right to my jaw."</p>
        
            <p>Joanna has not been able to travel to the mainland for treatment because of a broken leg, so she contacted an off-island dentist friend for an at-home remedy and posted the positive results on the local Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>"People were grateful that I [had] done that, because they could be in a similar situation. In fact, someone responded to my post that during Covid, he actually had to pull a tooth of his own. And people may be in that situation if they can't get to town or can't afford."</p>
        
            <p>Locals could catch a flight, or a four and a half hour ferry to reach the mainland.</p>
        
            <p>But the rising cost of airfares on the island made it even more difficult for people to get the help they needed, Joanna said.</p>
        
            <p>"Meanwhile, everyone's teeth are deteriorating, because many people here don't have the resources to just go to town to get their teeth checked, and cleaned."</p>
        
            <p>Other locals felt regular visits from a dentist were desperately needed.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really hard, and it's quite expensive to get off-island just to go to the dentist, flights are like ridiculously expensive," one resident on the island said.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be nice to have something here on the island, especially for older people or emergency stuff," another said.</p>

            <p>Community worker Lisa Eves said Work and Income funding of up to $1000 was available for people who could not afford a trip off the island.</p>
        
            <p>"The most immediate dental stuff has been dealt with really well with assistance from WINZ. It's definitely a need, but the emergency dentistry has been managed quite well I think."</p>
        
            <p>However, if the total cost was more than $1000, the extra money had to be paid back.</p>
        
            <p>Leonie Howie, a trustee of the community health trust, said preventative care was what the island really needed.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff that WINZ is able to provide by this flying off service. We want people who have problems, to have a dentist coming at least once a month, if not once a fortnight."</p>
        
            <p>The community trust put out the call to the Dental Association, and it hoped to set up a roster of volunteer dentists to service the island.</p>
        
            <p>The money spent on appointments would then be used to pay for their flights and other expenses.</p>
        
            <p>The hope was to attract a dentist to stay on the island long-term.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe the social enterprise is only for a period of, say, two to five years until we can prove to dentists that this could be a flourishing business for them."</p>
        
            <p>Howie encouraged any dentists keen for an adventure on the island to get in touch.</p>
