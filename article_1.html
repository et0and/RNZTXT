            <p>The Waitangi Tribunal's urgent inquiry into the proposed repeal of section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act has found clear breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>The government is planning to repeal Treaty obligations from the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>However, a Waitangi Tribunal report said it would cause harm to vulnerable children.</p>
        
            <p>The law change was part of ACT Party's coalition deal with National.</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal said there were clear breaches of the guarantee to MƒÅori of self determination and the Treaty principles of partnership and active protection.</p>
        
            <p>It also found that prejudice would arise from the rushed and arbitrary repeal of the section of the Act.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
