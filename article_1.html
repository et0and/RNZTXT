            <p>The Reserve Bank is reassessing how much capital banks need to hold in reserve amid criticism its policy is too tough and costly.</p>
        
            <p>Board chair Neil Quigley told the Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry into banking that an evidence-based review of capital requirements will be undertaken by international experts with a report expected by the end of this year.</p>
        
            <p>He said the review will take time, and cannot be rushed.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot just decide next week we're going to do something different," he said, adding the current requirements took two years to set.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said higher capital requirements increased the cost of borrowing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important that the Reserve Bank's prudential regime preserves the stability of our financial system, while taking care not to not impose excessive costs in the process," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to see settings that preserve financial stability while encouraging investment, job creation and income growth."</p>
        
            <p>Quigley said the review will clear-up any perceptions about the relative toughness of the capital regime compared with Australia and other countries.</p>
        
            <p>It will also address concerns raised by a recent Commerce Commission review into banking competition.</p>
        
            <p>In addition Quigley said there were a number of other matters before the Reserve Bank, including the appointment of the next Reserve Bank governor, following the resignation of Adrian Orr.</p>
        
            <p>The review also coincided with other Reserve Bank reviews, such as deposit-taking standards.</p>
