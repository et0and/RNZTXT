        <h2>Medical assesments of pilots made harder by new software - doctors</h2>
        <p>
The Aviation Medical Society says the "out of date" and "cumbersome" system will make it harder to decide on a pilot's fitness to fly.

            <p>Doctors say new software being rolled out nationwide will make it harder to decide on a pilot's fitness to fly.</p>
        
            <p>They are telling the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to backpedal on a multimillion-dollar German IT system they say has already failed across the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>They are also asking why the CAA has not taken up Australia's offer to share its system for free, or evaluated New Zealand software that many examiners - including those at Air New Zealand - already use.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty trained doctors perform 5000-6000 checks on pilots and air traffic controllers every year.</p>
        
            <p>The system, which records and tracks the history of each person before sharing the results, is designed to help keep air travellers safer.</p>
        
            <p>CAA paid about $4m for a German system - EMPIC - three years ago. It was designed to handle many IT tasks, including medical assessments, and the CAA wants everyone to be using it by mid-year.</p>
        
            <p>The Aviation Medical Society (AMSANZ), wrote to Civil Aviation yesterday, pleading with it to hold off on the IT system.</p>
        
            <p>"In its planned form, it does not deliver a safe, efficient and [internationally] compliant aeromedical system," wrote president Dr Michael Drane in an open letter.</p>
        
            <p>He called it "out of date" and "cumbersome", with "extremely limited medical classification and data-mining capability".</p>
        
            <p>It said it presented "a risk to the integrity of the aeromedical regulatory system".</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown doctor Ben Johnston said examiners would be left with a tool that did not do what they needed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be very difficult for medical examiners to necessarily have access to all the information they need, and that situational awareness is really, really important when you're making a decision about a person's fitness to fly," Dr Johnston told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>AMSANZ told the CAA in December that EMPIC was "poorly suited to the risk-based approach to regulatory medicine practised in Australasia".</p>
        
            <p>It is widely used in Europe which has a much more rules-based, black-and-white system.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Greg van der Hulst - who helped write the letter to the CAA - said two years ago doctors gave the agency the message that this might not work.</p>
        
            <p>"The feedback was pretty negative. Then everything went quiet and the next we hear at the end of 2023 was, 'here's a working group to how we're going to implement the software'."</p>
        
            <p>The doctors said Australia was forced to salvage EMPIC's medical module years ago by creating new software - MRS.</p>
        
            <p>It had since offered this software to this country for free, the society's letter said.</p>
        
            <p>But the authority did not appear to have looked into that, nor evaluated the existing Skycert medical check system already in use, Dr van der Hulst said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've written... to ask him [the director] to take our concerns seriously and to give us some pause, before we pour more money into a system that may not deliver."</p>
        
            <p>He added that the CAA had people who knew about these issues, but that it appeared its IT team had not talked to them.</p>
        
            <p>And it became clear for the first time a fortnight ago that officials were forging ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Peter Hurly of Palmerston North also felt left in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had used, and liked, both alternative systems - MRS and Skycert - but he knew far too little about EMPIC, and nothing about the meetings with examiners that CAA began having about it back in December.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not confident about it until I actually know what it's going to involve, and I do think it's probably a bit draconian the way it seems to be forced on us."</p>
        
            <p>He said it might be enough to make him quit the work.</p>
        
            <p>"If it really becomes too difficult to use and too time consuming, then I might say, 'Well, what's the point?'."</p>
        
            <p>The number of aviation medical examiners has been slowly dwindling, and now sits at about 50.</p>
        
            <p>There are just two in the central region. A pilot at Kapiti aero club said they had to book months in advance in order to get an appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Johnston said the CAA should have asked pilots and air traffic controllers and examiners what they needed first.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ approached EMPIC for comment, which said CAA would handle the request.</p>
