            <p>Taranaki police are investigating after a rugby player was floored by a punch as opposing players were shaking hands after a premier grade match at Yarrow Stadium on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki Rugby Football Union (TRFU) chief executive Mike Sandle said a Coastal Rugby player was punched by a Spotswood United player as the teams were shaking hands "well after the final whistle".</p>
        
            <p>"The Coastal player was knocked to the ground, an ambulance was called and he was taken to Taranaki Base Hospital and examined, then later discharged.</p>
        
            <p>"We are extremely disappointed that this incident has detracted from what was an entertaining game played in good spirits."</p>
        
            <p>There were no other players involved, Sandle said. Although RNZ understood there was a bit of pushing and shoving following the incident, which simmered down quickly.</p>
        
            <p>Sandle said Taranaki Rugby had instigated a judicial process and was supporting both clubs.</p>
        
            <p>He could not comment further because the incident was being investigated by police.</p>
        
            <p>Spotswood United chairperson Shanan Dick acknowledged a member of the club had "physically assaulted" a Coastal player during the "customary post-match handshakes".</p>
        
            <p>"Regrettably, the altercation resulted in the Coastal player being knocked to the ground, necessitating medical attention. We are relieved to report that the player has since been discharged."</p>
        
            <p>A police investigation had been launched into the "distressing incident" and the club would be not commenting further, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nonetheless, we wish to express our profound disappointment that such an event has overshadowed what was an otherwise enjoyable and spirited game."</p>
        
            <p>Spotswood United was committed to working with both clubs to address the "regrettable" incident, Dick said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our utmost priority remains ensuring the safety and well-being of all players and maintaining the integrity of the game. Spotswood United has contacted both players involved and are supporting their well-being to the upmost."</p>
        
            <p>Coastal Rugby and Sports Club chairperson Janet Fleming referred RNZ to the TRFU statement, adding "Coastal Rugby have no further comment to make".</p>
        
            <p>Coastal were third in the points table while Spotswood were second from last.</p>
        
            <p>Spotswood United lost the close match 29-35.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Taranaki said a patient presented after a fight following a rugby match on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"He was in a stable condition and discharged the same day."</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth police said they were making initial inquiries following a report of an assault on Maranui Street in Westown about 4.30pm on Saturday, and speaking with those involved to establish the circumstances.</p>
