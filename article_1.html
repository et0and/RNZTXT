            <p>Parliament's Speaker Gerry Brownlee has referred complaints about Green MP Julie Anne Genter's behaviour in the House last Wednesday night to the Privileges Committee.</p>
        
            <p>The complaints came from National and ACT.</p>
        
            <p>Genter last week apologised after National accused her of intimidating and attacking one of its ministers, Matt Doocey, in the House.</p>
        
            <p>As MPs were debating roading projects as part of the Annual Review - Transport on Wednesday night, Genter rose from her seat and walked across the chamber towards Doocey.</p>
        
            <p>She then waved a book in his face and repeatedly yelled: "Read the report".</p>
        
            <p>National senior whip Scott Simpson told the House that Genter's actions were threatening and unbecoming of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>A Green Party spokesperson told RNZ her actions were "unacceptable" and fell short of the standards they expect of their MPs.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday evening, a further allegation of intimidation was made against Genter, by a Wellington florist.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens' co-leaders said they had no prior knowledge of the allegation.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come...</p>
