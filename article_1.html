            <p>In the shade of Auckland's Britomart Square, Jon Low - known better by his customers and fans as Patchy - prepares a cup of $1.50 street coffee.</p>
        
            <p>For a dollar and some change, Patchy makes paper cup orders out of a supermarket trolley using instant coffee, boiled water stored in a Thermos, white sugar, and blue cap milk.</p>
        
            <p>Pay $2, and Patchy will throw in two biscuits for your troubles - a stark difference in price compared to the cafés sitting above him in Commercial Bay, where you're more likely to purchase a coffee and cookie for $10 and above.</p>
        
            <p>Patchy was told on Thursday morning by Auckland Council he will need a permit to continue operating his wallet-friendly business.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily, sudden TikTok fame and his can-do attitude has won him over a group of supportive fans - some of whom have even set up a Givealittle page to help him pay for the permit and the tools needed to make his business official.</p>
        
            <p>After building hype in his first few weeks of (unofficial) trading, Patchy said he was now moving into "phase two" of the business: build, officialise, and create a coffee empire.</p>
        
            <p>Patchy has these ambitions because he has been homeless in Auckland since June 2023, living in car parks across the city.</p>
        
            <p>"It taught me a lot actually, being here hustling and homeless in the city, and I want to build this coffee concept - even though it seems so simple - into an empire to compete with Starbucks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's room [in the market] - coming in with the point of difference that it is instant coffee, it's so cheap that I can sell it at $1.50 and still be profitable."</p>
        
            <p>He uses a storage shed on High Street to store his goods, kettles to boil his water, and access to a few supermarkets dotted around the CBD to restock his ingredients.</p>
        
            <p>
He says living on the street and having to beg to get by has "humbled" him, and "hustling" every day to survive has furthered his ambition.

            <p>Patchy said he ended up here, homeless for almost a whole year, following a marriage breakdown within his young family a few years earlier which left him in a "dark place".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not blameless, I neglected the marriage and I took her for granted," Patchy said.</p>
        
            <p>"The new guy that she's with is really decent with the kids, so I'm very grateful for that."</p>
        
            <p>Eventually, he ended up living out of a car and making a living by delivering Uber Eats orders, before a robbery left him with nothing.</p>
        
            <p>"I ran into Newmarket mall to pick up [an] Uber Eats order, and when I came back down my car was gone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It had my MacBook, my clothes, my whole life in it - that's how I ended up here in the CBD."</p>
        
            <p>He said living on the street and having to beg to get by has "humbled" him, and "hustling" every day to survive has furthered his ambition.</p>
        
            <p>He has found a community amongst the other homeless in the CBD, two of whom have joined him as business partners.</p>
        
            <p>The idea for a cheap alternative to café coffee only just came to him a few weeks ago, and despite being in a city with a competitive café culture, his business has taken off - thanks to TikTok.</p>
        
            <p>So, after all of this, is Patchy's coffee actually worth the hype?</p>
        
            <p>He asks how you like yours done - two sugars, a bit of milk - and gets crafting straight away.</p>
        
            <p>The trick, he says, is to use very hot water, and only add a splash a milk - and, yes, it works.</p>
        
            <p>His coffee is creamy, sweet, and made with love and, after pouring, a woman on the street approaches Patchy to show her support.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen your TikToks," she said. "You're a big inspiration."</p>
