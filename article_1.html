            <p>Two local staff members working for New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Vanuatu are unaccounted for after Tuesday's devastating earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>High Commissioner Nicci Simmonds in Vanuatu has confirmed all other staff from New Zealand are safe, MFAT said.</p>

            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters told Morning Report the two missing staff were not in the High Commission building at the time of the quake.</p>
        
            <p>They were locally employed staff, but "they're part of our team and we treat them the same and they are still yet to be found," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>While the death toll from the 7.3 quake is unclear at this stage, the International Federation of Red Cross said the Vanuatu government was reporting 14 confirmed deaths.</p>
        
            <p>There are 58 New Zealanders registered as being in Vanuatu, though MFAT expects there are more who are not registered. At this stage, it is not aware of New Zealanders killed or injured.</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency has been declared in the worst affected areas and police have been given powers to impose curfews.</p>
        
            <p>Concrete buildings collapsed with people inside, homes and infrastructure were destroyed and the road to the main port is blocked by a large slip.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand Defence Force P8 aircraft military surveillance plane was to fly above Vanuatu on Wednesday morning to check the situation, Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>If it could land, a C130 would land on Wednesday afternoon with rescue teams, supplies and consular people.</p>
        
            <p>"We've put a lot of work into it overnight and we're set to go."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were trying to get as much on the ground as fast as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We are just desperate for information at this point in time."</p>
        
            <p>The best information so far was that damage was mainly in the capital Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand would provide further support, as requested by Vanuatu, working closely with partners Australia and France, Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Red Cross secretary general Sarah Stuart-Black said they were on stand by to assist Vanuatu's Red Cross.</p>
        
            <p>The teams there were already helping to provide shelter, she told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>They had equipment for 4000 households.</p>
        
            <p>"We're needing to wait and see what will actually benefit the most in country."</p>
        
            <p>Often the best thing to send was money, she said.</p>
