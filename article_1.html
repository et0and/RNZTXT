            <p>The Black Caps hero of day two has come to the party again, this time with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips made a fighting half century yesterday afternoon as his team-mates collapsed around him and his side conceded a 205 run first innings lead.</p>
        
            <p>Australia has a lead of 350 but now have just two wickets in hand thanks to a five-for from Phillips.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips now has 5/38 with the off-spinner dismissing Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh in consecutive balls.</p>

            <p>Australia had gone to lunch on 113 for four, after nightwatchman Nathan Lyon, who frustrated the host with 41, and opener Usman Khawaja were dismissed in the morning.</p>
