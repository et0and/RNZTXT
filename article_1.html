            <p>Warnings of toxic shellfish have been extended for the second time as more areas of ocean are found with an algal bloom that produces a dangerous toxin.</p>
        
            <p>The government's Food Safety agency is advising people not to collect or consume shellfish gathered from the East Coast of the North Island because of the paralytic toxins.</p>
        
            <p>This extends the earlier warnings in Hawke's Bay and Northland.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said they are closely watching the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"We are monitoring an algal bloom off the East Coast, which is spreading. This type of algae produces a dangerous toxin and when shellfish filter-feed, these toxins can accumulate in their gut and flesh.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally, the more algae there are in the water, the more toxic the shellfish get.</p>
        
            <p>"Cooking the shellfish does not remove the toxin, so shellfish from this area should not be eaten."</p>
        
            <p>Far North Mayor Moko Tepania said it is common for people in the region to supplement their groceries with kaimoana.</p>
        
            <p>He urged people who collect shellfish to heed public health warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want anybody getting unwell from this. Hopefully these toxins, these algal blooms are going to clear up quickly so we can continue gathering kaimoana as we do up here.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely a little bit extra concerning though with the cost pressures that everybody is facing. Whānau here in the Far North rely on kaimoana to supplement our kai."</p>
        
            <p>He said if people are struggling with the cost of living they could reach out for help.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Food Safety said mussels from Tolaga Bay had toxin levels 11 times over the safe limit.</p>
        
            <p>The existing warning for Hawke's Bay has been extended from East Cape all the way south to Blackhead Point, just north of Pōrangahau.</p>
        
            <p>Arbuckle said follow-up tests on mussels from Waimarama Beach showed levels of paralytic shellfish toxins three times over the safe limit.</p>
        
            <p>"Please do not gather and eat shellfish from this area because anyone doing so could get sick."</p>
        
            <p>Affected shellfish include bivalve shellfish such as mussels, oysters, tuatua, pipi, toheroa, cockles and scallops, as well as pūpū (cat's eyes), Cook's turban and kina (sea urchin).</p>
