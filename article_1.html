            <p>Tributes are flowing in for one of New Zealand's "most naturally gifted drivers" Mark Tapper, who has died at the age of 44.</p>
        
            <p>His death was reported by RallySport Magazine on Tuesday, shortly after his birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi rally driver Hayden Paddon posted to Facebook that Tapper's death had "shocked the whole rally community."</p>
        
            <p>"Mark has many stories that leave a lasting memory and a smile for so many reasons within rallying.</p>
        
            <p>"Mark was always one of the first to support us and give a bit of stick/encouragement when needed.</p>
        
            <p>"I would say he was one of the most gifted rally drivers in NZ - never afraid to commit that little more, keep it a gear higher and leave nothing on the table. Following in his footsteps in the Pirelli Star Driver, the memories and stories that he left behind in Europe will be forever remembered by many."</p>
        
            <p>Motorsport New Zealand said it was "deeply saddened" to learn of Tapper's passing.</p>
        
            <p>"A fierce competitor and true character of the sport, Mark made his mark both at home and on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>"From being the first Kiwi home at Rally New Zealand in 2005, claiming the Group N 2WD NZ Rally Championship class in 2007 to winning the Pirelli Star Driver award in 2008, he showcased immense talent and determination. His international rally career saw him compete in the Production World Rally Championship, taking on some of the world's best.</p>
        
            <p>"Mark's legacy lives on in the stories, memories, and inspiration he leaves behind. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and the rally community."</p>
        
            <p>Rally driver Emma Gilmour said she was "heartbroken" to hear about Tapper's death, and that he was an "immense talent and one of the most likeable, one-of-a-kind people in our sport."</p>
        
            <p>"I'll never forget watching him pull a perfect handbrake 180 at speed into a car park right in front of me on a recce convoy - seriously impressive, even with the gravel spray across the manicured lawn.</p>
        
            <p>"Gone far too soon. He will be so missed."</p>
        
            <p>Former New Zealand rally champion Chris West remembered him as a "real character, competitive and talented steerer" and said he "enjoyed every moment" with Tapper.</p>
        
            <p>Mad Mike Whiddett also paid tribute to Tapper and the memories they shared as youngsters.</p>
        
            <p>"Those days were so freakn cool bro, both of us learnt the talent together of how hard to push vehicles to really find the limit of them, never did we think both of us would make it on the global stage at the highest level racing and entertaining behind a steering wheel."</p>
