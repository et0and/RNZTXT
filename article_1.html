        <h2>Live: 'A sombre day in NZ media': Newshub to close</h2>
        <p>
The company's proposed closure is a blow to New Zealand's democracy, sports presenter Andrew Gourdie says.
</p>
        
            <p>Newshub, one of the key media companies in New Zealand, is to close its newsroom on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were told of the closure at an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sports presenter Andrew Gourdie was one of the dozens of employees who learned that owner Warner Bros Discovery intended to axe the newsroom on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>He says New Zealand's democracy needs multiple news organisations to hold people to account.</p>
        
            <p>But until Newshub closes its doors for good, Gourdie says the show will go on.</p>

            <p>Newshub is owned by global entertainment giant Warner Bros Discovery which also owns eden, Rush, HGTV and Bravo.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020 it took over the channel's assets which had been then part of Mediaworks.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, Warner Bros Discovery dropped AM Early and Newshub Live at 11am.</p>
        
            <p>In October, it announced it was axing The Project, its 7pm news and current affairs show.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, a spokesperson said: "We have commenced consultation to discontinue The Project on Three from the end of the year - our primary focus is to support our people as we work through this process."</p>
        
            <p>The new show that was expected to replace The Project, hosted by former AM Show present Ryan Bridge, has yet to begin.</p>
