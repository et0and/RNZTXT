        <h2>Signs found of worryingly fast Antarctic ice melt - NZ expedition</h2>
        <p>
Scientists returning from a voyage into Antarctic waters say they found worrying evidence about how much ice has melted and how quickly.

            <p>Scientists returning from a voyage into Antarctic waters say they found worrying evidence about how much ice has melted and how quickly.</p>
        
            <p>The ice-breaking ship the RV (Research Vessel) Laura Bassi returned to New Zealand waters on Saturday morning after two months in Antarctica's Ross Sea, which is part of the Southern Ocean.</p>
        
            <p>The team of New Zealand scientists from the Antarctic Science Platform - along with a research team from the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide - crossed the Ross Sea on the ice-breaker to witness the sea ice retreat first-hand.</p>

            <p>Their research found that the ocean - the southernmost on the planet - is changing substantially, said NIWA and University of Auckland professor of physical oceanography Craig Stevens, who led the New Zealand team.</p>

            <p>They found the area covered by ice had decreased dramatically, and in the past couple of years there had been record lows of the amount of ice surrounding Antarctica</p>
        
            <p>While the amount of salty and oxygenated water getting into the deeper parts of the oceans was changing.</p>

            <p>The changes to the sea-ice indicate that in the coming decades coastal cities will need to be reconfigured because of sea level rise, Stevens said.</p>
        
            <p>While the effects these changes will cause to ecosystems will impact mammals like penguins, whales and seals, and weather systems would also change around the Southern Ocean.</p>

            <p>With a climate emergency underway, the work they were doing was urgent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The scientific community [has] really got its pedal to the metal on this because it's such a major challenge for humanity.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to affect ice shelves. It's going to affect marine ecology. It's going to affect sea level rise."</p>

            <p>Stevens said the research trip had allowed them to deploy robots, leave behind instrumentation to collect data and take measurements of all sorts of marine DNA and zooplankton.</p>
        
            <p>But he said further research was needed to collect more data to inform their forecasting models better.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the information would be used to inform future government documents, such as for regional planning, and to inform the public about how the planet is changing.</p>
