            <p>A large fire has broken out in Auckland's Takanini.</p>
        
            <p>Lala, who lives in nearby Parehurehure, said she could hear "very loud explosions" and see the flames getting larger and brighter on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>"Thick smoke filled the air very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"It took less than 15 minute for the smoke to turn black and reach our area just above our roof.</p>
        
            <p>"We could hear endless sirens and helicopters making their way to the scene."</p>
        
            <p>
Thick black smoke could be seen billowing across the area.

            <p>The fire was believed to be on Tironui Road and was spotted about 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>Lala said the fire had "definitely" got smaller by midnight, and looked as if it had been contained.</p>
        
            <p>"There's currently lots of flashing red fire truck lights."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
