            <p>Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting.</p>
        
            <p>A man who served more than 17 years behind bars for a Palmerston North murder is making good progress in the outside world and has secured a 90-day work trial, the Parole Board has heard.</p>
        
            <p>However, the board is concerned that Andre Gilling remains too guarded during its meetings with him.</p>
        
            <p>Gilling, 35, was released in May after being jailed for murdering Stanley Waipouri in a gruesome and probable homophobic attack in Waipouri's Rangitīkei Street flat on 23 December 2006.</p>
        
            <p>Gilling was 17 at the time. He acted alongside Ashley Arnopp, then 19.</p>
        
            <p>The pair, who had tough upbringings, were found at the blood-spattered scene. They had drugs and alcohol in their systems.</p>
        
            <p>Gilling appeared before the Parole Board in November for a progress report six months after his release.</p>
        
            <p>In a report, released to RNZ, the board said he was making good progress at the property he was released to in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>It said he was rated at an "orange" level there, below the "red" upon his release, and people there spoke highly of him.</p>
        
            <p>"He is a positive influence in the house. His probation officers also speaks very positively of his progress."</p>
        
            <p>Gilling had not breached his special release conditions and had a 90-day work trial, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"He has had two drugs tests, which have both been negative."</p>
        
            <p>However, the report noted that Gilling often gave one-word replies in response to questions.</p>
        
            <p>"Even when he does discuss an issue he seems to be very guarded," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"We now need him to talk openly. That will be a very important part of his release and a very important part of getting a safe release into the community after he leaves [his current residence]."</p>
        
            <p>Gilling will next meet the board in April.</p>
        
            <p>He has 15 special conditions to abide by, including a ban on communicating with Arnopp, an obligation to tell his probation officer about intimate relationships beginning and ending, and a daily curfew from 10pm to 6am.</p>
        
            <p>Arnopp was released from prison in 2023, but recalled months later. He will see the Parole Board again in early 2025.</p>
