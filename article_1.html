            <p>A man is facing charges for indecent assault and breaching extended supervision in Upper Hutt, after reports of suspicious behaviour in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>The man lives at an 'outside the wire' facility Te Korowai in the grounds of Rimutaka Prison and is subject to an extended supervision order, including an evening curfew (9pm to 7am).</p>
        
            <p>Corrections has been granted resource consent to expand the facility.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a man was arrested after a reported indecent assault on 10 January.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in Hutt Valley District Court on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said he was also facing charges for breaching extended supervision following a number of reports of suspicious behaviour over the last few months.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections said on Saturday a senior staff member in the region became aware of concerns raised on social media and referred them to police.</p>
        
            <p>Brigid Kean from Corrections said in a statement it has laid six active breach charges against the man for testing positive for drug use, being in public places he should not be in, and not attending an alcohol and other drug test.</p>
        
            <p>"Corrections has opposed bail, however, bail was granted by the court."</p>
        
            <p>She said no further information would be provided as it could potentially prejudice court proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>"Our highly experienced Community Corrections staff have been working hard to actively monitor this offender to ensure he complies with his court-imposed conditions and hold him to account for breaches," Kean said.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes working closely with local police to manage this offender."</p>
        
            <p>Corrections has resource consent to build four additional one-bedroom units at the site, increasing the number of beds from 11 to 15.</p>
        
            <p>Te Korowai is in the grounds of Rimutaka Prison but outside the secure perimeter. It is not part of Rimutaka Prison, and none of the people who live there are prisoners.</p>
        
            <p>It gives accommodation for people on community-based sentences or orders where they will receive 24/7 oversight and support and are required to follow the rules of the residence.</p>
