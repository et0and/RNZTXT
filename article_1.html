            <p>A major investigation is underway in Perth after police shot dead a teenager who stabbed a member of the public.</p>
        
            <p>The 16-year-old boy had been known to police and was part of a programme designed to help individuals at risk of being radicalised, the ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>The incident unfolded in a Bunnings car park in Willetton, in the city's south, overnight.</p>
        
            <p>At a press conference on Sunday, Police Commissioner Col Blanch said police received an emergency call just after 10pm on Saturday, from a teen who said he was going to commit "acts of violence".</p>
        
            <p>Members of Western Australia's Muslim community, who had received messages from the teen and were "concerned" by his behaviour, also contacted police prior to the shooting, the ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>"Our police responded within minutes," Blanch said.</p>
        
            <p>The teen was shot by an officer after he rushed at police with a kitchen knife.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found later with stab wounds to his back. It was believed one could have punctured a lung, the ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>The man was recovering in hospital and was in a serious but stable condition on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Blanch said the teenager had "complex issues, both mental but also online radicalisation issues".</p>
        
            <p>He was known to police, but it was believed that he acted alone.</p>
        
            <p>Blanch said the teen was part of a support programme for people with concerning ideologies, who "may not be committing any crimes".</p>
        
            <p>The stabbing was not being labelled a terror attack at this time, the ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police were working with the boy's family, who were being "very forthcoming", Blanch said.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, I think this is a very challenged individual who was there on the night.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the family really do understand the situation that police were in."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Paul Papalia said the fact that the teenager was in the Countering Violent Extremism programme showed how challenging it was to "de-radicalise" people.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a really tough task and none of the programs that have been attempted anywhere have been universally successful," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"[It is] a really serious challenge in changing someone who's been radicalised and attempting them to get back into a more reasonable pathway.</p>
        
            <p>"This individual may not have done anything that would have enabled police to do anything other than get him into this programme."</p>
        
            <p>WA Premier Roger Cook said he had called a meeting of multi-faith community leaders and would attend that later on Sunday.</p>
