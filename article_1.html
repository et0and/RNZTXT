            <p>Israel says it has resumed fighting with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, the Israel Defense Forces said that Hamas had opened fire at Israel, therefore violating the terms of the truce agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before the seven-day truce was set to expire, Israel said it shot down a rocket fired from Gaza while media outlets affiliated with the Hamas group reported explosions and gunfire in northern Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The truce was initially set to last for four days and extended twice.</p>
        
            <p>As of Thursday, 110 hostages held in Gaza have been released since the truce started on 24 November, while Israel has released 240 Palestinian prisoners.</p>
        
            <p>The Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October killed 1200 people. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,800 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign, including about 6000 children.</p>
        
            <p>Several air strikes have hit the southern Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run interior and national security ministry said on its Telegram account.</p>
        
            <p>BBC sources inside Gaza have confirmed this as well. The sources also said several explosions have bveen heard in nothern Gaza and there has been an exchange of fire northwest of Gaza City.</p>
        
            <p>The Israel Defense Forces says its fighter jets are currently striking Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
