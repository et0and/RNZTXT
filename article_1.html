            <p>A man has been arrested after a police officer was allegedly stabbed multiple times in the back of the head in Sydney's CBD on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The incident unfolded just after 1pm when a 33-year-old man wielding a knife about 30 centimetres long confronted two police officers on traffic duties on the corner of Castlereagh and Park Streets, near Hyde Park.</p>
        
            <p>He did not say anything to the officers as he approached them.</p>
        
            <p>"[The man] stabbed the male constable in the back of the head a number of times," Detective Superintendent Martin Fileman said.</p>
        
            <p>"The injured officer and a female officer then gave chase along Park Street off to Hyde Park near Elizabeth Street, where assisted by other police officers, that offender was arrested."</p>
        
            <p>Paramedics treated the officer for non-life threatening injuries at the scene before he was taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where he remains in a stable condition with two skull fractures.</p>
        
            <p>Two crime scenes were established, one at the corner of Castlereagh and Park Streets, and the other near where the man was tasered before being arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Fileman said the knife remained in the man's hand until his arrest, where he was "demanding that police shoot him".</p>
        
            <p>He was known to police for minor matters and according to Fileman "there is no history of mental illness on our database".</p>
        
            <p>The man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for assessment and was under police guard.</p>
        
            <p>He was expected to be released shortly and will be facing "very serious charges".</p>
        
            <p>Fileman praised the action of officers, particularly the constable who despite his injuries continued working.</p>
        
            <p>"Just shows you the type of training that we go through," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're faced with a situation that you know, if an officer is injured that they keep going, and this officer did, this officer gave chase."</p>
        
            <p>Detectives are investigating the motives behind the man's attack.</p>

            <p>A witness told the ABC he saw a "lot of cops" rush in and "hold the man down".</p>
        
            <p>"It looked like he was riding a push bike," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They just came, had him on the ground and held him there."</p>
        
            <p>Shireen Hayes and her family were having lunch at Hyde Park after visiting the museum when they heard the police sirens.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a bit scary because we could see all the cops were in one area and cordoned it off pretty quickly," Ms Hayes said.</p>
        
            <p>"There seems to be a lot of that happening at the moment [stabbings] so that's really concerning."</p>
        
            <p>North coast resident Maree Ahern had also spent the day at the museum with her family after being reluctant to travel to Sydney due to the recent stabbings.</p>
        
            <p>"We sort of feel that we have to be very aware of our surroundings now more than we ever did before," Ms Ahern said.</p>
        
            <p>"And we watch now as to who is around us because we are a little bit nervous about coming to Sydney."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was shocked at today's event.</p>
        
            <p>'We feel very sorry for the people of Sydney who have to live with this every day.</p>
        
            <p>"We just feel now that the city is not quite as safe as it used to be. Yeah, so it's very sad for the policeman that's been stabbed."</p>
        
            <p>The stabbing comes a little more than a month after six people were killed by 40-year-old Joel Cauchi with a knife at Bondi Junction Westfield.</p>
        
            <p>Ashlee Good, Dawn Singleton, Jade Young, Pikria Darchia, Faraz Tahir and a Chinese national whose family has asked she not be named, all died in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>A few days later, a 16-year-old boy was arrested after allegedly stabbing Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel at a live-streamed church service in the Sydney suburb of Wakeley.</p>
