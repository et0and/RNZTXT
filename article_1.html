            <p>Government ministers have confirmed job cuts at television station Whakaata Māori.</p>
        
            <p>There were no specifics given on how many jobs, as all ministers said it was an operational decision.</p>
        
            <p>Last week chief executive Shane Taurima and Board of Directors chairperson Jamie Tuuta fronted the Māori Affairs Select Committee for the annual review of the 2022/2023 year.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged the key challenge the service faced was the reduction in funding.</p>
        
            <p>In July, it was reported the television service faced a $9.5 million funding decrease over the next three years. Tuuta told the select committee this was "in the order of $10.3m".</p>
        
            <p>Taurima said after the meeting it was a cut of 25 percent, which would mean significant change in terms of what the service provides, but he was determined to future-proof the service as well.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
