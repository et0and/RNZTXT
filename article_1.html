            <p>Thousands of people are attending a candlelight vigil for the victims of the attack Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A special force has been created to investigate the attack, with New South Wales Police saying it could take months to present its findings.</p>
        
            <p>Police will try to find out how and why Cauchi, who is from the state of Queensland, committed such violence.</p>
        
            <p>He had been known to police, but had never been arrested or charged in Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>Cauchi had lived itinerantly for several years and was first diagnosed with a mental illness at 17, Queensland Police said.</p>
