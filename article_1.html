            <p>Rhythm and Vines organisers are defending a $5 fee for optional pre-driving breath testing.</p>
        
            <p>The Gisborne festival, which attracted more than 26,000 punters, concluded on Tuesday after three days.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, the festival shared a checklist for people leaving the festival, which promoted a breath-testing service.</p>
        
            <p>"For $5, breath testing will be available at the General Store in Grand Central. Be sensible and responsible drivers," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>"Be warned that police will be conducting random breath-testing outside of Rhythm and Vines. Please make responsible decisions before getting behind the wheel."</p>
        
            <p>But some commenters were frustrated the service would cost money.</p>
        
            <p>"Breath testing should be free," one person wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Haven't you made enough money. $5 for breath testing?? I would have thought your customers leaving safe would be a priority and breath testing should be absolutely free!" said another.</p>
        
            <p>But some festival-goers supported the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"What's another $5. Good on them for offering this."</p>
        
            <p>Responding to Facebook commenters, the festival stood by the fee.</p>
        
            <p>"We are promoting sensible decisions and a private vendor is offering the service for people who choose to use it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is the first time this service has been offered, so hopefully it's a success and something we can look at in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Festival ticket prices start from $400 for a three-day pass and $200 for a single-day pass.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines was approached for comment.</p>
