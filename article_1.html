            <p>A fourth person has been arrested and charged with the murder of a man in his 80s and the arson of his Stokes Valley home last year.</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old Upper Hutt man had been charged with murder, arson, conspiring to commit arson and participating in a criminal group, Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>The man was due to appear in the Hutt Valley District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched in November after one of three arsons at the Hanson Grove block of flats.</p>
        
            <p>Ian David Moller, 82, was critically injured and died four days later.</p>
        
            <p>Three others appeared on Wednesday on similar charges.</p>
        
            <p>The fire that killed Moller was the third alleged attack on Hanson Grove in the space of a month. The first took place on 5 November, another on 10 November, and the third on 14 November, all during the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police continue to investigate three fires.</p>
        
            <p>Charges against one person relating to the first blaze were dropped last month.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information has been asked report it on 105, with reference file number 241105/2249 or quote Operation Sove.</p>
