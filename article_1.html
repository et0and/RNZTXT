            <p>Concerns are being raised new maths requirements for primary school teachers will deter applicants and don't make sense.</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced it is bringing forward the 'Make It Count' maths curriculum for years 0 to 8 that will now begin in Term 1 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It was brought forward over concerns about achievement rates.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Chris Luxon said recent data showed around 50,000 children in Year 8 did not meet their expected benchmarks in 2023. Although the opposition has questioned his figures.</p>
        
            <p>The changes included going forward, any candidates for teacher training programmes would need to pass NCEA Level 2 maths.</p>
        
            <p>In a snap hui between the Teaching Council and ITE providers on Tuesday, a number of issues were raised, including:</p>
        
            <p>Teacher Education Forum executive chair Dr Rosina Merry said the changes did not make any sense.</p>
        
            <p>"The kind of notion around having a higher entry level will then mean, you know, accumulate into better outcomes for graduate teachers doesn't really make that much sense, there is not a lot of evidence that shows that it will make a difference."</p>

            <p>Merry said the changes could actually deter good candidates from applying in first place, which would only exacerbate the current staffing shortage.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on our current entry criteria, which is still very robust, and there are many applicants that don't get through, if we lift the level even more, it would pretty much decimate a lot of Initial Teacher Education programmes in the primary sector, it will definitely have a huge impact on the teaching workforce." she said.</p>
        
            <p>TEFANZ said evidence from Ireland and Australia suggested this kind of change did not increase the quality of mathematics teaching, but rather significantly and negatively impacted teacher diversity.</p>
        
            <p>It also had concerns about the speed of change and the limited time and opportunity for robust consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford declined to comment earlier.</p>
