            <p>Distraught and embarrassed Formula One rookie Isack Hadjar was consoled by Lewis Hamilton's father when the French driver's Australian Grand Prix debut ended before the season-opening race had started on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The Racing Bulls driver, who had qualified 11th and best of the rookie crop, crashed his car backwards into the wall on the formation lap at a wet and slippery Albert Park track.</p>
        
            <p>Anthony Hamilton, in Melbourne for his seven-times world champion son's Ferrari debut, put an arm around Hadjar's shoulder when the shell-shocked 20-year-old returned to the paddock -- helmet still on -- and offered some crumbs of comfort.</p>

            <p>"He told me to keep my head high, and be proud. He did say I did well yesterday. It was a nice gesture from him," said Hadjar of the exchange.</p>
        
            <p>"These cars, in these conditions, they just snap so fast that it's unsaveable. I couldn't get the grip back. I tried to save it but it was just...," he told Sky Sports television.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew it was going to be tricky. Even on the laps to the grid I was like 'Oh yeah, this is tricky but definitely driveable' but... I'm just sorry for the team right now and my close ones watching the race. It's just embarrassing."</p>
        
            <p>Sky Sports commentator Martin Brundle suspected the youngster had been "crying his eyes out" after a crash that forced the start to be aborted.</p>

            <p>"It's a lifelong commitment; you've done karting, junior racing, the family sacrifices. He's a Formula One driver (at last) and boom! He's had a very silly mistake," added the Briton.</p>
        
            <p>Hadjar was one of six drivers on the 20-strong grid starting a season for the first time and one of four rookies who failed to finish.</p>
        
            <p>Alpine's Jack Doohan, Red Bull's Liam Lawson and Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto all hit trouble with only Mercedes's Andrea Kimi Antonelli -- a stunning fourth from 16th on the grid -- and Haas's Oliver Bearman making it to the chequered flag.</p>
        
            <p>"He will learn from this and turn his frustration into good energy for the next race," said Racing Bulls principal Laurent Mekies.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be here to support him over the next few days before Shanghai and not let this cloud all the positives we can take from this weekend."</p>
