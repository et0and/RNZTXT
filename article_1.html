            <p>Dunedin police have seized a gang pad while targeting an organised crayfish crime ring believed to have stolen almost four tonnes of commercial crayfish.</p>
        
            <p>Police and Fisheries New Zealand have been investigating the theft from a Dunedin business in the year to October.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said police believed the 3.75 tonnes of crayfish were stolen to order.</p>
        
            <p>"This is theft on a massive scale, with the value of stolen crayfish estimated to be several hundred thousand dollars," she said.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday morning, three search warrants were carried out, targeting two people and three properties in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>One of them was on the King Cobra's David Street pad that was believed to be linked to the crayfish theft.</p>

            <p>The property has been restrained by police under the Criminal Proceeds Recovery Act, which allows police to forfeit assets to the Crown that were acquired as a result of criminal activity.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Larry included teams from Southern District Organised Crime, Southern Asset Recovery unit and Fisheries New Zealand carrying out simultaneous warrants at 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Reeves said charges were likely.</p>
        
            <p>"The offending has had a significant impact on the victims, and the losses to them are huge."</p>
        
            <p>The theft was first reported to police back in October.</p>
