            <p>The minister for local government has responded to calls for Tauranga's 10 year plan to be delayed until elected officials are in office.</p>
        
            <p>The Long Term Plan caused division amongst city leaders when former mayor Greg Brownless called for it to be put on hold until the commission term was over.</p>
        
            <p>ACT Party MP Cameron Luxton came out in support of Brownless. "I'm asking the new minister for local government to take steps to delay the Long-Term Plan," Luxton said.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners were appointed to overlook the council by the previous government in 2021 because of significant governance problems among the councillors.</p>
        
            <p>Some local business leaders took jabs at Brownless and Luxton and said further delays to address the city's infrastructure would be "catastrophic".</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he wanted to see "local democracy restored for the people of Tauranga".</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the commissioners were under an obligation to deliver the 2024-34 plan for the city.</p>
        
            <p>"The terms of reference given to them provide the commission with the same decision-making powers and consultation obligations as an elected council," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"I expect to see the wider community consulted on any significant decisions, just as would happen under an elected council."</p>
        
            <p>Brownless was concerned the plans would bind council and ratepayers to contracts for a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Brown acknowledged the plans would, "require long-term contractual arrangements," but said, "no council has the ability to bind the next council to any particular direction or actions".</p>
        
            <p>The commission term is scheduled to end in July when the city undergoes its local election for city councillors and mayor.</p>
