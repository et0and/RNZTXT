            <p>An Auckland hospitality entrepreneur hopes to flip the New Zealand culture of 'no tipping' at bars and restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>Luke Dallow told Morning Report a struggling economy means many hospitality spots are employing fewer waiters, so diners are getting slack service.</p>
        
            <p>With the cost of goods and rents increasing, something needs to change, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And what is controllable is wages.</p>
        
            <p>"My concept would be to reduce the menu price on the menu, then that would get more consumers into the restaurants or bars.</p>
        
            <p>"Now to top this up you would tip, encourage tipping."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would mean minimum wage plus tips for wait staff, though Dallow's maths could be a bit off.</p>
        
            <p>"Minimum wage is $24 or I think it's roughly around that at the moment, and a waitress or waiter could easily make $10 in an hour, that's about $44 in an hour, that's pretty good - I reckon that's pretty good money."</p>
        
            <p>The minimum wage is currently $23.15 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Staff would need to be serving an average of more than $160 worth of food and drinks an hour to bring their pay up to $44, more if the tips were shared with other staff.</p>
        
            <p>Dallow would suggest a 12.5 percent tip.</p>
        
            <p>There would be a fair tip distribution, he said, with 30 percent distributed between chefs, kitchen hands, and everyone else involved.</p>
        
            <p>But would staff lose a sense of stability?</p>
        
            <p>"Well, the best people would get the best tips and the best restaurants would remain the best, the best, the best.</p>
        
            <p>"It's then up to the restauranteur or the bar owner to create that, you just can't be sitting on your lorrels, charging $18 glass of Heineken and go, oh yeah I've got your money, good luck, see ya...go behind the bar, behind the bloody phone again and text ya mates.</p>
        
            <p>"I want my staff to go out there and hussle, hussle, hussle and charge out a $13 glass of Heineken and get bonuses on top of that with tipping."</p>
        
            <p>To get consumers on board, he was setting up a couple of pop-up bars with low prices, where they can pay what they think their meal, and service, is worth.</p>
        
            <p>Would New Zealanders actually tip?</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year a roll out of new, upgraded Eftpos machines included a new feature that asks if consumers want to tip a 5, 10 or 15 percent portion of their bill.</p>
        
            <p>Some restaurant owners and staff believed it was time Kiwis were a bit more generous, while others said it puts pressure on customers.</p>
