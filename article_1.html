            <p>A second severe thunderstorm warning for Gisborne has been lifted by the MetService.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's weather radar detected severe thunderstorms near Gisborne, Te Karaka, Waipaoa, Ormond and Ngātapa just after 6pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>That weather system was also forecast to affect Waimata and Kanakanaia just before 6.40pm and Tolaga Bay and Tauwhareparae just before 7.10pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService also issued Wairoa with a severe thunderstorm warning which has now been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today severe thunderstorm warnings for the Bay of Plenty and parts of Canterbury were lifted. A heavy rain watch and a severe thunderstorm watch has also been cancelled for Northland.</p>
        
            <p>However, a heavy rain watch remains in place for the Bay of Plenty, east of Rotorua and Gisborne, as does a severe thunderstorm watch - which is also in place for Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>A local Gisborne resident Roger Handford said that dark clouds could be seen piling up over the hills to the west just after 1.15pm and then minutes later the rain burst over Gisborne, accompanied by thunder.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane advised people to stay updated on the weather forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"Severe thunderstorms bring a risk of very intense downpours and the possibility of surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>"While festivities are underway, it's prudent to stay updated on the latest forecasts ... as a Red Thunderstorm Warning will be issued for any storms that become severe."</p>
        
            <p>For the eastern South Island though, Tuesday marked a shift to cooler, fresher air, extending to the lower North Island on Wednesday, temporarily lowering temperatures in those regions.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said this brief cooldown, following warm and humid days, preceded a return to warmer conditions on Friday, potentially reaching 30°C in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>As warmth dominates the east, Friday brings a wetter narrative elsewhere, courtesy of one of the last active weather system of the year.</p>
        
            <p>But wet weather was set to remain for western parts of the North and South Island, accompanied by strong winds in the South Island and lower North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane encouraged everyone to "take full advantage of the good weather when it's there" during this changeable week.</p>
