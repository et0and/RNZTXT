            <p>After two electrifying weeks, the 33rd Summer Olympics are coming to an end in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>However, there is still a chance for New Zealand athletes to bag more medals, with a handful of strong contenders competing on day 16 of the Games.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the time difference, day 16 begins on Sunday evening and runs late into the night, with the closing ceremony taking place on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Here's who to look out for. All times are in NZT.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will live blog the final day of the Olympics tonight from about 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>Camille French, nee Buscomb, will be running in her second Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>In Tokyo, she finished 19th in the 10,000m and exited the heats of the 5000m before switching her focus to the marathon distance.</p>
        
            <p>She posted an Olympic entry standard mark of 2:26:08 in December 2023 in her debut appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Ally Wollaston is the first in a line-up of New Zealand cyclists to take to the velodrome on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>She'll be riding the gruelling women's omnium, which sees riders tackle four different races in a test of speed and endurance. Athletes accumulate points depending on their finishing position in each race, and the cyclist with the highest total wins the omnium.</p>
        
            <p>Wollaston has already won a silver medal at these Games, in the women's team pursuit.</p>
        
            <p>She rides the scratch race at 9pm, the tempo race at 9.57pm, the elimination race at 10.53pm and the points race at 11.56pm.</p>

            <p>Ellesse Andrews is returning to the velodrome in fine fettle.</p>
        
            <p>She already bagged a silver medal in the women's sprint relay, then followed it up with gold in the women's keirin.</p>
        
            <p>After breezing through her quarterfinal early on Sunday morning, she will face the semifinals from 9.22pm.</p>
        
            <p>The final decider is at 11.44pm.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Dakin is the final Kiwi cyclist to ride on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>He'll take part in the keirin, which sees cyclists keep pace with a motorised bike for the first three laps, then race full-tilt for the final three laps.</p>
        
            <p>Dakin was unlucky in the men's sprints earlier this week, when he failed to make it out of the heats, and will be looking to better that performance.</p>
        
            <p>The quarterfinals are at 9.29pm, the semifinals at 10.29pm and the final at 11.32pm.</p>

            <p>The closing ceremony will see a parade of athletes, the extinguishing of the Olympic flame, and the handover of the Olympic flag to Karen Bass - the mayor of Los Angeles, where the 2028 Games will be held.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be an artistic section, featuring Snoop Dogg, French artists Air and Phoenix, and a raft of dancers and circus artists.</p>
        
            <p>Artistic director Thomas Jolly said the show would take the audience on a dream-like journey through time, beginning with the origins of the Olympics and going into a dystopian future, where the Games have disappeared and must be reinvented.</p>
        
            <p>Actor Tom Cruise is also rumoured to be taking part in the show, abseiling down a building.</p>
        
            <p>The ceremony runs until 9.30am NZT.</p>
