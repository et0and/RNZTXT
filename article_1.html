            <p>Wairoa kuia Marie Tuahine says she and her daughter and five mokopuna - the youngest just ten months' old - had to walk through knee deep water in the dark on Wednesday morning, after the evacuation warning sounded.</p>
        
            <p>The council says more than 400 homes have been flooded - 100 seriously - in the district.</p>
        
            <p>And those families are now staying with family or friends or at the Wairoa Memorial Hall which is where Tuahine is.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report she was a bit disorientated waking up to the alarm going off. He niece was banging on the window trying to wake them up and tell them there was flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Her daughter carried the two youngest to the car because the water was too deep.</p>
        
            <p>"The water was up to my knees and it's sloshy brown, you just couldn't see anything."</p>
        
            <p>The carpets throughout the house are covered in silt and slush.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no idea where I'm going to go."</p>
        
            <p>There are no vacancies in the two motels in Wairoa, she says.</p>
