            <p>A South Island community is outraged after a four-wheeler drove through a coastal native bird breeding site, killing birds and chicks.</p>
        
            <p>Now, those studying the banded dotterel in Kaikōura are calling for motorbikes to be banned on beaches.</p>
        
            <p>Study lead Ailsa McGilvary-Howard said she found tyre tracks through a breeding area at Gooches beach, near Kaikōura township, when she went to check on a hatch last week.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was heartbreaking, as a dotterel found dead was one the study had followed for years .</p>
        
            <p>"I know, with watching the nest and seeing the dates and everything, I know when she's going to hatch. So I went down to deal with recording the hatch and signing it off, and what I saw ... she'd been killed, during the hatch."</p>
        
            <p>There are only about 50,000 banded dotterels or pohowera throughout Aotearoa, and their population is declining.</p>

            <p>McGilvary-Howard said the community had been outraged by the death of the birds.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing that completely blew me away was the profound amount of love there is for the species. It was almost absolute outrage.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a huge outpouring within our community - in the wider New Zealand community and the bird community, there was an outpouring."</p>
        
            <p>A post on social media has racked up hundreds of comments expressing that outrage.</p>
        
            <p>"Awful. Dreadful for you, and for the species. Ban quadbikes on beaches," one comment said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's simply not good enough to allow vehicles on beaches in this area," another said.</p>
        
            <p>McGilvary-Howard said the breeding site was marked with signs, but the vehicle that drove though - likely a four-wheeler quad bike - must have done so at night, on a "joyride".</p>
        
            <p>She said vehicles and bikes driving through coastal areas was "incredibly destructive on wildlife".</p>
        
            <p>She wanted the rule that treated all beaches as roads unless specified otherwise to be changed to protect birds during their breeding season.</p>
        
            <p>"This bird [the banded dotterel] is not everywhere. This bird is only in highly nutritious and selected places.</p>
        
            <p>"We could have a rāhui that would specify behaviours in three months of the year, and the rest of the year, the beach is free for everything."</p>
