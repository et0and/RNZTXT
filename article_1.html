            <p>New analysis from Infometrics shows that returning the GST charged on rates to local councils would cost the government at least $1.1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Analysis by Infometrics shows central government collected about that amount in GST from rates in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Infometrics chief executive and principal economist Brad Olsen said the amounts collected in 2022 ranged from as high as $317 million in Auckland, to just $100,000 on the rates charged on Chatham Islands.</p>
        
            <p>"In total, 29 of the 78 councils across New Zealand would receive more than $10m if GST on rates was returned to councils," Olsen said.</p>
        
            <p>That money would then be available for local councils to help fund the services and investments being made around the country.</p>
        
            <p>In March, Auckland's mayor Wayne Brown called on the government to return GST on council rates to help fund the region's infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Olsen supported GST being charged on rates, as councils were providing goods and services for local residents, ratepayers, and others.</p>
        
            <p>"But given constant discussion about the need to fund local government differently, perhaps GST on rates should be collected and then returned to local councils."</p>
        
            <p>He pointed out that central government finances were under pressure too, but the value of GST collected on rates was worth 0.9 percent of total government revenue in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) president Sam Broughton said that despite councils' ever-increasing responsibilities, local government's share of overall tax revenue has remained at 2 percent of GDP for the last 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no secret that the funding system for local government is broken. Relying so heavily on rates is unsustainable," Broughton said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need a range of levers to address the funding and financing challenges in front of us. Returning GST on rates would be an excellent place to start.</p>
        
            <p>"We've also put an accommodation levy, GST sharing on new builds, mineral royalties, and congestion charging on the table."</p>
