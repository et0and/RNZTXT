            <p>Labour is warning that allowing just three ministers the last word on fast-tracking infrastructure projects opens them up to accusations of bias, especially when political donations might muddy the waters.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Rachel Brooking said they had identified at least two businesses on the government's list of organisations invited to apply for fast-tracked consents, which have donated to National.</p>
        
            <p>The law change will give three ministers - Chris Bishop, Simeon Brown and Shane Jones - the ability to green-light roads, dams and mines, whether or not their approval is recommended by an expert panel, risks biodiversity, or has previously been denied consents by the courts.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a risky position for ministers to put themselves in.</p>
        
            <p>"They're actually making the decisions," she said. "That then in turn opens them up to allegations of improper behaviour if they've had donations made by those different players. So it's a very strange thing for the ministers to want to open themselves up to."</p>
        
            <p>The legislation is still being considered by the select committee, and the list of projects to be pushed through for consideration by the ministers is not finalised.</p>
        
            <p>Two hundred names were on the government's list of companies and iwi it sent letters to, providing information on how to apply for fast-track consents.</p>
        
            <p>Some companies had taken this as an invitation.</p>
        
            <p>But Bishop has been consistently quick to point out that being a recipient of the letter did not necessarily mean an organisation would be putting forward a project.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a catch-all list, and included everyone he had corresponded with.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands a number of iwi groups were included on the list because they were consulted on whether the bill threatened treaty rights, rather than because they had a project which might make the list.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop has defended his inclusion of those groups on the list.</p>
        
            <p>"If I hadn't included them, I would probably be being accused of leaving people out," he said. "There will be people on that list who oppose the fast-track process, there will be people or companies on the list who strongly support it, there will be people who don't care either way, I suspect."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an environmental group is warning the legislation could breach New Zealand's international trade agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Environmental Defence Society chief executive Gary Taylor said New Zealand was party to a number of international agreements on climate change, preventing coal extraction, and switching to renewable energy.</p>
        
            <p>He said companies should consider their international reputation. </p>
        
            <p>"If you are an export company in New Zealand, you should be having a careful think about what harm being associated to all of this is doing to your export market."</p>
        
            <p>Public submissions for the bill closed on Friday, only hours after the minister released his list of correspondents.</p>
        
            <p>The public and private sectors have until 3 May to submit a project for a spot on the list.</p>
