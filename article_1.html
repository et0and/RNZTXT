            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described the case of an 11-year-old being mistaken as a 20-year-old and put in a mental health unit as "extremely distressing".</p>
        
            <p>"As a parent, you identify with what is a horrific set of circumstances... it's just incredibly distressing and concerning," Luxon told reporters at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Massive amounts of empathy and concern for her and her family."</p>
