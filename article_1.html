            <p>Kiwi marathon runner Stefan Ozich is running the length of Aotearoa - twice - and he could be the first to do so, making a world record.</p>
        
            <p>He is hoping to raise $1 million for The Last Chance Project, a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the health and well-being of men in New Zealand communities.</p>
        
            <p>While running in the Bombay Hills, Ozich told RNZ's Summer Weekends he choose to tackle the task for The Last Chance Project because of his brother, who took his own life.</p>
        
            <p>"When my brother was struggling two years ago he happened to reach out and find out about this organisation... and it was through that process of meeting them, hearing what they were about and connecting profoundly.</p>
        
            <p>"That was kind of why I eventually decided to go with [The Last Chance Project]."</p>

            <p>Ozich has almost been running every day since 1 October, taking only a few days off due to unsuitable weather conditions.</p>
        
            <p>His support crew of three, now down to two, had followed him around the country from the get-go.</p>
        
            <p>"They are helping with cooking, cleaning and kind of logistics.</p>
        
            <p>"So yeah, they have been with me the whole time, one in particular who's the main head chef you could say."</p>

            <p>When asked about the physical pain and experience, Ozich compared his experience to the end of a marathon.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sort of like if you run a marathon, it's like the last 5-10km, some days it feels like that the whole day, like I'm battling that last 5km.</p>
        
            <p>"That's probably the best way I can describe the sensation and the pain that you ensure in the day to day grind of this mission," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But Ozich said what kept him placing one foot in front of the other was his values.</p>
        
            <p>"I've set up to do this thing bigger than me and I realise that I've told myself I can do this, that's been a really main anchor.</p>
        
            <p>
Ozich had raised $134,172 as of Sunday, with the goal of reaching $1million.

            <p>Another big motivation for Ozich was his brother.</p>
        
            <p>"The suffering he went through mentally, he didn't choose that and I've chosen this, so I'm able to then take another step and then another step.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at it a day at a time."</p>
        
            <p>The funds raised will be spent on funding practitioners, facilitators and eventually to build a facility for the The Last Chance Project, he said.</p>

            <p>Cape Reinga is the finish line, which Ozich hopes to reach on 22 January.</p>
