            <p>The Hamilton City Council is wrestling with what to do about people showering in a central city fountain.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Geoff Taylor told Morning Report  people had been spotted showering in the Garden Place fountains.</p>
        
            <p>He said the fountain's water is recirculates so it doesn't drain off. He added that children then play in that water.</p>
        
            <p>However, it's not just showering that is causing problems for Hamilton's town square.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said there are people defecating, hanging clothes lines, taking drugs, begging and displaying threatening behaviour in the square.</p>
        
            <p>"There's obviously mental illness and addiction issues going on but Garden Place is an area where people like to come and sit and relax at lunch time, and this is obviously not conducive for that," Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there are businesses wanting to move out of Garden Place to due some of the behaviours in the hub.</p>
        
            <p>"Garden Place is our showcase place, it's our town square, so there is an argument to move them elsewhere," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"... If you reach a stage where businesses want to leave and people don't want to go to Garden Place anymore then I suggest it's time to make a change."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor wants tougher bylaws that allow the police and council safety officers that patrol the city to be more empowered to act. His colleague Ewan Wilson has put forward a proposal to do just that.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pointless slapping people with fines, but if you could actually move people on when they exhibit this behaviour and move them on two hours later when they return, then maybe that's worth looking at," Taylor said.</p>
