        <h2>First heatwave of 2025 engulfs Australia's south-east</h2>
        <p>
Temperatures across south-east states are predicted to soar up to 12 degrees Celsius above the January average this weekend, raising the risk of major fire outbreaks.

            <p>2025 is opening with a broad heatwave stretching through the heart of Australia, continuing a pattern of exceptional heat which included the nation's hottest spring on record, and third hottest December on record.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures across south-east states are predicted to soar up to 12 degrees Celsius above the January average this weekend, raising the risk of major fire outbreaks in South Australia and Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>For eastern New South Wales, temperatures will peak on Monday, including highs nudging 40C in Western Sydney, before a cool change flushes out the heat and threatens the fifth India-Australia test match on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>And while the south-east sweats, the tropics are stuck in a holding pattern, with still no sign of the staple summer monsoon.</p>
        
            <p>The ongoing absence of monsoon westerlies is unusual this deep into the wet season, and will result in its latest onset in at least 25 years - while also preventing tropical cyclones reaching our shores.</p>
        
            <p>In a repeat of the pattern seen numerous times through December, another heatwave is sweeping east across Australia.</p>
        
            <p>This next burst of scorching temperatures developed in Western Australia this week, sending maximums as much as 17C above average on Thursday, including a high of 43C at Esperance on the state's south coast - the town's hottest January day in 12 years.</p>
        
            <p>The broad mass of hot air then tracked through the western interior on Friday and is now descending over south-east states as a sweltering north-westerly blows south off the outback deserts.</p>
        
            <p>
In 2024 Australia saw its third hottest December on record, with large bushfires in Victoria.

            <p>Today's highs should exceed 40C over northern Victoria, western NSW and inland SA, peaking at around 45C over the central interior.</p>
        
            <p>And as temperatures rise so will the fire threat - despite relatively light winds, exceptionally low humidity down to just five per cent will lift dangers into the "extreme" category over Victoria's Wimmera and SA's Mount Lofty Ranges, Murraylands and south-east districts.</p>
        
            <p>For coastal areas today, a brief afternoon sea-breeze will bring slight relief, although both Adelaide and Melbourne should still reach the mid to high 30s.</p>
        
            <p>The hot north-westerly winds will continue through Sunday, leading to a second consecutive day above 40C for the south-east inland, however the heat will also reach eastern NSW, sending Western Sydney to 39C.</p>
        
            <p>While humidity will rise tomorrow, freshening winds will offset the increase in moisture, again leading to extreme fire danger in parts of SA and inland Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>This northern wet season is not following a traditional path as both the monsoon and tropical cyclones remain absent from the weather charts.</p>
        
            <p>In the 25 years of the Bureau of Meteorology analysis charts, the average onset date of the monsoon trough on Australia's mainland is December 19, with the latest arrival on January 11, 2013 and the earliest on November 17, 2007.</p>
        
            <p>The monsoon trough is the boundary between moist westerly winds which blow across the equator and easterly winds through the remaining tropics.</p>
        
            <p>Along the trough is a near continuous and persistent band of thick cloud and rain, as opposed to the more sporadic showers and storms which develop over the tropics when the monsoon is absent.</p>
        
            <p>The monsoon trough also spawns tropical lows and tropical cyclones, but so far this wet season the great rainmaker has mysteriously disappeared off our weather maps, only briefly appearing in the northern Indian Ocean in early December.</p>
        
            <p>The lack of a monsoon explains why the Australian region has only seen one tropical cyclone this season, Robyn, and none anywhere remotely near the mainland.</p>
        
            <p>So when will cyclones become a threat?</p>
        
            <p>Modelling shows the true monsoon may not arrive on our shores until late January, easily the latest onset so far this century.</p>
