            <p>Wellington motorists are being warned by The New Zealand Transport Agency to take extra care this morning, as low fog blankets the region's state highways.</p>
        
            <p>Visibility is poor from the central city to Lower Hutt along State Highway 2 and at the Ngauranga Gorge Flyover on State Highway 1.</p>
        
            <p>So far, no warnings have been issued in Auckland - which has been blanketed by fog in recent days.</p>
