            <p>"There are multiple injuries, the extent of which is still being confirmed."</p>
        
            <p>About 40 firefighters from four crews around Twizel, Lake Tekapo, Omarama and Otematata are at the scene.</p>

            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi (NZTA) advised motorists to expect delays, with this section of the road possibly staying closed for the rest of the day and no immediate detours available.</p>
        
            <p>"Drivers should allow at least two hours longer for travel times while SH8 remains closed.</p>
        
            <p>UPDATE 10AMThe SCU is en route to carry out an investigation in relation to the serious crash. The road is likely to remain closed for several hours. Please avoid the area and consider delaying your journey, while SH8 remains closed between Lake Tekapo and Lake Pukaki. ^AP https://t.co/1KJtuLpfW6</p>
        
            <p>"Westbound travellers should use SH8 east to Timaru, SH1 south to the SH82 junction, and the inland route on SH82 to Kurow/SH83 junction, with westbound to SH8/83 Otematata. Eastbound travellers should use the reverse route."</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit is investigating.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said as this was a serious crash on a state highway, they would be conducting an investigation of the road and roadside conditions, alongside police investigations.</p>
        
            <p>"The condition of both buses will also be examined as part of the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this morning's crash."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA has a black ice and winter driving conditions warning out for that stretch of road.</p>
