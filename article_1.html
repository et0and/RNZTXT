            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has used his first speech of the 54th Parliament to accuse the new government of "trashing New Zealand's international reputation" by adopting Covid-19 conspiracies as policies.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wondered why the Labour caucus had not rolled Hipkins, saying he squandered the party's historic 2020 majority.</p>
        
            <p>The party leaders on Wednesday squared off in the House for the first time in the new term, with the Address in Reply debate to the Speech from the Throne.</p>
        
            <p>The speech, delivered by the governor-general on Wednesday morning, set out the government's priorities. Parties were invited to respond, but usually used it as an opportunity to trade barbs.</p>
        
            <p>While Hipkins and Luxon frequently faced off last term, they now sat in different seats.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking first, Hipkins spoke of the drawn-out process to form the coalition government, as well as the move to roll back anti-smoking legislation which had made international headlines.</p>
        
            <p>"This could well be the most shambolic beginning of any government in New Zealand's history," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins accused the government of leaning on plans to repeal, replace and disestablish laws, instead of focusing on taking New Zealand forward.</p>
        
            <p>He further said the government had taken a "massive step backwards" by questioning the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
        
            <p>"I say to the members opposite who have pledged to end all Covid-19 mandates, can they name one that's still in place? Can they name one? I hear crickets on the Treasury benches, speaker, because there aren't any. They want to buy into the conspiracy theorists' view."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the new government would send New Zealand backwards on issues of climate change, gender diversity and workers' rights.</p>
        
            <p>"We leave government proud of our track record, committed to holding the incoming government to account, concerned about the direction that they are taking New Zealand in, which is backwards on all of the important measures that should be important to New Zealand's future, and absolutely resolved that for the first time in New Zealand's history, this will be a one-term National government."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon meanwhile said New Zealand was "under new management," prompting applause from his side of the House.</p>

            <p>"Just like there are laws of nature, and just like there are laws of physics, there are laws of politics. Because if you want lower taxes, you vote for us. If you want the government books managed well, you vote for us. And if you want to create more opportunities for everyone, you vote for us."</p>
        
            <p>Describing Hipkins as "bitter, twisted, and negative," Luxon attacked Labour for failing to set up a political dynasty.</p>
        
            <p>"No reason they shouldn't have been in power for 10 or 12 years, they didn't make it. They squandered the opportunity that they got."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon described Hipkins as an arsonist continuing to loiter around the scene of the crime, with the rest of the caucus having survivors' guilt.</p>
        
            <p>"How has he survived, when nearly half of his caucus lost their jobs under his leadership? Why is he still here?"</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the public voted Labour out because it prioritised ideology over New Zealand's interests.</p>
        
            <p>"Labour earned its loss, it worked hard for it. Labour wasted time, they squandered public money, and they made this great country and its people miss out on opportunities."</p>
