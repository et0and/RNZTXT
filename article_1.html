            <p>On a sticky day in January, dozens of nannies and aunties from Tainui shook and waved fronds of greenery as they called manuhiri onto Tuurangawaewae Marae.</p>
        
            <p>Over 10,000 people had responded to a rare call for unity from the Māori King to discuss what the new government's policies meant for Māori. It set the scene for what became a massive year for te ao Māori.</p>
        
            <p>A few months beforehand, just in time for Christmas 2023, the newly formed government had announced its coalition agreements.</p>
        
            <p>The agreements included either rolling back previous initiatives considered progressive for Māori or creating new policies that many in Māoridom and beyond perceived to be an attack on Māori rights and te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>So as the rest of the country wound down for the year, te ao Māori went to work, planning for the year ahead.</p>
        
            <p>This year saw everything from controversial debates about the place of New Zealand's founding document to mourning the loss of the Māori king, and a viral haka.</p>
        
            <p>The Hui-aa-motu in January was the first sign of the year to come.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi from across the motu arrived at Tūrangawaewae, including Ngāpuhi, an iwi who don't typically follow the Kiingitanga, suggesting a growing sense of shared purpose in Māoridom.</p>
        
            <p>At the centre of the discussions was the ACT Party's Treaty Principles Bill, which aims to redefine the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and enshrine them in law.</p>
        
            <p>Māori also expressed their concerns over the axing of Te Aka Whai Ora, (the Māori Health Authority), the re-introduction of referenda on Māori wards, removing references to Tiriti o Waitangi in legislation, and policies related to the use and funding of te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The day was overwhelmingly positive. Visitors were treated with manaakitanga, all receiving packed lunches and ice blocks to ward off the heat.</p>
        
            <p>Raising some eyebrows, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon chose not to attend, sending newly-appointed Māori-Crown Relations minister Tama Potaka and Māori Affairs select committee chair Dan Bidois instead.</p>

            <p>Other than the sheer number of people who showed up, the hui was memorable for these words, spoken by Kiingi Tuheitia as he addressed the crowds, and quoted repeatedly as the year progressed:</p>
        
            <p>"The best protest we can make right now is being Māori. Be who we are. Live our values. Speak our reo. Care for our mokopuna, our awa, our maunga. Just be Māori. Be Māori all day, every day. We are here. We are strong."</p>
        
            <p>The momentum continued, with the mauri of Hui-ā-Motu passed to Rātana pā next, and then to Waitangi in February.</p>
        
            <p>Waitangi Day has long been a place of activism and discussion, and this year was no exception.</p>
        
            <p>February saw the most well-attended Waitangi in years. Traffic in and out of Paihia was at a standstill for hours as people flocked to the historic town, to discuss, protest, and commemorate the country's founding document.</p>

            <p>Veteran Māori activist Hone Harawira addressed David Seymour, the architect of the controversial Treaty Principles Bill and ACT Party Leader, directly.</p>
        
            <p>"You want to gut the treaty? In front of all of these people? Hell no! You and your shitty-arse bill are going down the toilet."</p>
        
            <p>A new activist group, 'Toitū te Tiriti', also seized the moment to make themselves known.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers Eru Kapa-Kingi and Hohepa Thompson led two dozen protesters onto the atea (courtyard) of Te Whare Rūnanga during the pōwhiri for government officials, peacefully singing over David Seymour's speech.</p>
        
            <p>"Whakarongo, e noho…" they began - "Listen, sit down".</p>

            <p>It was just the start of a movement which led to a nationwide hīkoi from the top of the North Island to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>In the past year, the government's policies have faced significant formal scrutiny too, with a record number of urgent claims heard before the Waitangi Tribunal in such a short period of time.</p>
        
            <p>The claims have been wide-ranging and contentious, including the disestablishment of the Māori Health Authority, ACT's Treaty Principles Bill, limiting te reo Māori use, reinstating referendums for Māori wards, and the repeal of smokefree legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has also criticised the function of the tribunal itself. In May, he argued it had become "increasing activist", going "well beyond its brief".</p>
        
            <p>"The tribunal appears to regard itself as a parallel government that can intervene in the actual government's policy-making process," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>The government has made no secret of its plan to review the tribunal's future role, a coalition promise.</p>
        
            <p>The review is expected to refocus the tribunal's scope, purpose and nature back to its "original intent". While the government has not yet released any specific details about the review, it's anticipated that Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka will oversee it.</p>
        
            <p>In August, when the seas were choppy, te ao Māori lost a rangatira.</p>
        
            <p>Te iwi Māori were shocked and saddened by the death of Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau te Wherowhero VII, who just days before had celebrated his 18th year on the throne.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, thousands arrived outside the bright-red, ornately-carved gates of Tuurangawaewae, waiting to say one last goodbye.</p>
        
            <p>The tangi, which lasted five days, saw tears, laughter and plenty of stories about Tuheitia, who has been called 'Te Kiingi o Te Kōtahitanga', the King of Unity.</p>

            <p>On the final day, led by Kaihaka, his body was driven the two blocks in a black hearse to the banks of Waikato River. He was placed on a waka specially crafted for him, and made the journey to his final resting place at the top of Taupiri Maunga, alongside his tūpuna.</p>
        
            <p>Just hours before, Tuheitia's youngest child and only daughter, Nga wai hono i te po was announced as the new monarch of the Kiingitanga. The news was met with applause and tears from the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>At just 27 years old, the new Kuini signals a societal shift, where a new generation of rangatahi who know their whakapapa, their reo, and are strong in their identity as Māori, are now stepping up.</p>
        
            <p>An example of this "kohanga generation" is Aotearoa's youngest MP, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke.</p>
        
            <p>Elected in 2023, the 22-year-old gained international attention after a video of her leading a haka in Parliament and tearing up a copy of the Treaty Principles Bill made headlines around the world.</p>

            <p>Maipi-Clarke and several other opposition MPs performed the Ka Mate haka in response to the Treaty Principles Bill, a move that cost her a 24-hour suspension from the debating chamber.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, another up-and-coming leader within Māoridom, Eru Kapa-Kingi, led a hīkoi from the top of the North Island to Wellington, in what is believed to be the largest protest to ever arrive at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi mō te Tiriti was the culmination of a year of action, and organisers predicted it would be big. But almost no one anticipated the true scale of the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced that he will not be travelling to the Treaty grounds in Northland for Waitangi Day commemorations in February next year, opting to attend events elsewhere. Māori met the decision with mixed emotions - some calling it a missed opportunity, and others pleased.</p>
        
            <p>We're set for a big year to come, with submissions on the Treaty Principles Bill closing 7 January, the ensuing select committee process will be sure to dominate the conversation at Waitangi 2025 and beyond.</p>
