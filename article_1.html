            <p>After a desperate public plea, precious religious garments stolen from a Wellington church have been returned - complete with an apology note.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 2am on Tuesday, CCTV footage showed a trio wandering into the Serbian Orthodox Church on The Parade in Island Bay, priest Father Predrag Grubacki said.</p>
        
            <p>When they left, one was carrying his robe and hat - "sanctified pieces" that should not be worn by anyone except priests, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I do realise that they look like a costume, and maybe those youngsters took it for fun. But without knowing, they are desacralising it, by using it in the purpose they are not meant to be used."</p>

            <p>A plea for their return was posted on social media, but the theft was not reported to police - Grubacki was hopeful those who took it would do the right thing.</p>
        
            <p>And when he arrived at the temple for Thursday evening's service, he came across a bag, with his robe, cap, and an apology note inside.</p>
        
            <p>"He said sorry for the troubles and stress," Grubacki said.</p>
        
            <p>"He promised he won't be coming again and doing such a thing again, he learned his lesson."</p>
        
            <p>Upon finding the bag, Grubacki was "super happy" - and said there were "no hard feelings" against the thief.</p>
        
            <p>The thief signed the letter with his first name, which Grubacki chose not to share - he was just relieved they seemed to realise how important the garments were.</p>
        
            <p>"It means a lot not just for me, but for our small community here in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"I would gladly shake his hand."</p>
        
            <p>The items had been in Grubacki's possession for eight years since he had become a priest, and he brought them from Serbia to Aotearoa when he emigrated seven years ago.</p>
        
            <p>They were "just a piece of cloth" to others, but had a special meaning and purpose for worshipping, and could not be replaced in New Zealand, Grubacki said.</p>
