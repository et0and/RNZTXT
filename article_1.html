            <p>The team who enforce rules on the water in the Bay of Plenty are anticipating a busy few months after dishing out 150 infringements last summer.</p>
        
            <p>The region's harbourmaster and maritime team are also emphasising lifejacket rules after a series of water deaths around the country prior to the holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>Lakes senior maritime officer Roly Bagshaw said he was anticipating another busy summer for boating in the Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The former Tauranga Sport Fishing Club manager has been with the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for four years and recently took Local Democracy Reporting on a trip to Lake Ōkāreka in Rotorua to go over some of the work he and the team do.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped educating boaties would be easier this summer than in other years.</p>
        
            <p>"We've gone through Covid-19 where everyone was buying a boat ... we were on this major education drive to get everyone up to speed."</p>
        
            <p>There were a couple years of thinking "this is crazy", he said, with many more people out on the lakes who did not know the rules or have the right skills.</p>
        
            <p>Things improved last year, Bagshaw said.</p>
        
            <p>The maritime team began their regular patrols after Labour Day and these involved making sure harbour and lake users knew the rules.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>He said improving boaties' water safety skills was his favourite part of the job.</p>
        
            <p>"I think after people talk to our patrol they come away with a greater understanding and operate more safely.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a nice feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Things patrols looked for included vessels sticking to speed limits such as 5 knots within 200m of the shore, and kept clear of swim-only zones.</p>
        
            <p>Both of these were relevant to Ōkāreka, with the first 600m of Acacia Bay being a 5-knot limit and a swim-only zone at Boyes Beach.</p>
        
            <p>He said it gave the many passive lake users "a nice buffer zone".</p>
        
            <p>"That might be people swimming or in kayaks and stand-up paddleboarding, which is really popular now.</p>
        
            <p>Bagshaw said wearing a lifejacket was something the team could not stress enough and was a heavy focus of the patrols.</p>
        
            <p>The present law required boats to have lifejackets on board of the correct size and type, while an incoming council rule change - subject to Ministry of Transport approval - meant lifejackets must be worn in vessels under 6m while under way.</p>
        
            <p>Bagshaw said the rules were important.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen a number of fatalities on the lakes in the last few years and really don't want to see anything else."</p>
        
            <p>It was great to see children wearing them lifejackets, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all just about going home to our loved ones at the end of the day after enjoying these amazing scenes."</p>
        
            <p>Bagshaw said it was important people read the signage at boat ramps and "know before you go".</p>

            <p>Harbourmaster Jon Jon Peters presented the team's annual report in June.</p>
        
            <p>"Summer in the Bay of Plenty is extremely busy for our maritime team with visitors and locals alike using our rivers, harbours and coastal waters."</p>
        
            <p>Last summer's initiatives were delivered by 30 patrol crews and five students on board six vessels, and at boat ramps across the region.</p>
        
            <p>The team completed 520 on-water patrols, producing 400 bylaw breaches and 150 infringements.</p>
        
            <p>"Data gathered from the 1150 surveys completed help us paint a picture while informing and measuring our recreational craft harm prevention work and related compliance activities, allowing evidence-based decision-making for next season."</p>
        
            <p>In a December statement to Local Democracy Reporting, he emphasised safety messages after a series of drownings and water-related incidents in the lead-up to the holiday season, including four in 24 hours nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>One of these included a man who leapt from a boat into the water off Whakatāne and could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the tragic drownings around the country in the weekend, we would like to reiterate Water Safety's message that people need to stay safe and be cautious around water.</p>
        
            <p>"From a boating perspective that includes checking the tides and weather before you head out and most importantly, wearing a lifejacket."</p>

            <p>According to Water Safety New Zealand, of the 90 people who drowned last year, five were in the Bay of Plenty. None related to boating. The 10-year average was 7.7 drownings a year.</p>
        
            <p>Preliminary 2024 data recorded 67 drownings nationally as of mid-December.</p>
        
            <p>Water Safety New Zealand chief executive Daniel Gerrard previously told Local Democracy Reporting the importance of a lifejacket could not be overstated.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 14 watercraft-related deaths in the first nine months of this year, 13 had not worn lifejackets.</p>
        
            <p>"Wearing a lifejacket significantly increases your chances of survival, and it is a simple step that can save lives."</p>
        
            <p>He praised the regional council for its rule change and said it was a critical measure to reducing drowning fatalities.</p>
