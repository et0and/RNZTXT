            <p>The Labour Weekend road toll stands at zero so far, as holidaymakers begin to make their way home.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency warns that traffic congestion on highways in and out of the main urban centres was expected to be high throughout Labour Day.</p>
        
            <p>The official holiday road toll period began at 4pm Friday and does not end until 6am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>If the toll remains at zero, it would be a record for recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Six people died on the roads during the 2023 Labour Weekend period, and this year's Easter road toll was the highest since 2021, with seven people killed.</p>
        
            <p>The lowest Labour Weekend road toll was recorded back in 2013, where only one person died and 109 were injured.</p>
        
            <p>The worst was in 1983, where 13 people died and 248 were injured, according to the Ministry of Transport.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Agency spokesperson Andy Knackstedt warned people not to be complacent on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>He said even if there are no deaths, those who are seriously injured in crashes can have lifelong impacts.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just asking people to do the basics - drive and travel at a safe speed, to share the driving, make sure you're well rested, and just take the the time that you need to to get home safely."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Superintendent Steve Greally, Director of Road Policing, said staff would be visible patrolling roads.</p>
        
            <p>"Our teams continue to work tirelessly throughout the country to make sure everyone remains safe on our roads every day and long weekends are no different.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no room for complacency and we want motorists to take note whenever and wherever they are travelling."</p>
