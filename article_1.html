            <p>It's been a disastrous Saturday for Liam Lawson at the Melbourne Grand Prix.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was knocked out in the first part of qualifying and will start a lowly 18th for Sunday's race, after a late lock up put paid to his hopes of progressing further up the field.</p>
        
            <p>It was the last thing the 23-year-old New Zealander would have wanted entering his first full season in F1, and his debut weekend with Red Bull Racing.</p>
        
            <p>With time expiring in the first qualifying period, Lawson locked up his front tyres heading into the second to last corner, veering onto the grass.</p>
        
            <p>A few corners earlier he dropped his tyres into the gravel and went sideways on the exit of the corner, losing plenty of time.</p>
        
            <p>He ended up aborting his lap, heading straight down the pit lane.</p>
        
            <p>Only two drivers qualified slower - Haas drivers Esteban Ocon, in 19th, and Oliver Bearman, who failed to complete a lap and qualified 20th.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's teammate Max Verstappen, the four-time reigning world champion, qualified in third, getting the most out of the car.</p>
        
            <p>McLaren's Lando Norris qualified in first place, edging the hometown hero Oscar Piastri, his McLaren teammate, in second spot.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's substandard Saturday started with the third practice session, spent almost entirely in the pits due to a mechanical issue.</p>
        
            <p>While completing his first timed lap of the afternoon, something went wrong with the power unit in Lawson's car, and his Red Bull engineers immediately urged him to return to the pits.</p>
        
            <p>When Lawson asked if it was a major issue, his engineer wouldn't say.</p>
        
            <p>He was one of two drivers who didn't complete a lap during the third practice session, along with Haas rookie Oliver Bearman.</p>
        
            <p>Bearman crashed out in the first practice session, and his car hadn't been repaired in time for the second. It means he only completed a handful of laps before Saturday evening's qualifying session.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson's engine issue came at a terrible time.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>He is the only driver on the F1 grid who hasn't raced in Melbourne, and every tour of the circuit was an opportunity for him to iron out any issues he has had with his new car.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson showed good improvement in the second practice, compared to the first, bringing down the gap to his four-time reigning World Champion teammate, Max Verstappen.</p>
        
            <p>Talking on 10 Sport's live coverage of the third practice session, former World Champion Damon Hill said Lawson's entire race weekend had been "compromised" by the mechanical issue.</p>
        
            <p>But not all hope is lost.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's race is expected to be a wet one, and often rain affected races can bring carnage, allowing drivers to make huge gains through the field.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson will be hoping to take advantage of any opportunities that arise should the rain fall.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's race begins at 5pm.</p>
