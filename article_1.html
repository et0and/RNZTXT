        <h2>Photos: Aurora australis makes spectacular return to NZ skies</h2>
        <p>
People have been reporting displays of the Southern Lights from Southland to Northland on Friday night.

            <p>The aurora australis has made a spectacular return to New Zealand skies, with people reporting displays of the Southern Lights from all parts of the country on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the Southern Lights have been unusually active, as the Sun undergoes a period of intense activity, which occurs in 11-year cycles.</p>

            <p>In Canterbury, residents drove to Lake Ellesmere to capture the aurora reflected off the water. Shanelle Siaki was there around 9pm and captured a number of images on her iPhone 14.</p>

            <p>At Karioitahi Beach, south of Auckland, Simon Jarman (@sjarmanphoto) said it was a "decent show" on Friday, posting on NZ Dark Skies the aurora "went off" around 9pm, "died down then came back around 11.15". His shot was taken facing west.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile in south Auckland, Katrina Piggott described the skies around Papakura looking "pretty in pink tonight".</p>

            <p>Further north, RNZ's Northland reporter Peter de Graaf captured an image of a glowing purple night sky late on Friday night at Marsden Cross, Rangihoua Heritage Park, in the northern Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>He said the aurora was barely visible with the naked eye, but the colours were revealed with a long, 15-second exposure.</p>

            <p>Many in the Northern Hemisphere have also been sharing images of the Aurora borealis this week.</p>

            <p>The aurora displays are related to activity from the Sun.</p>
        
            <p>Usually particles from solar flares bounce off the Earth's magnetic field, but when there is a severe eruption, they can penetrate the ionosphere and interact with gases around the magnetic poles - causing the ribbons of colour.</p>
        
            <p>Auroras are usually confined to certain latitudes in the north and south, which makes them relatively rare to observe for most of the population.</p>
        
            <p>The pinks, purples and greens that are often associated with aurora are the particles interacting with different gasses. Simply put, oxygen - which emits greenish-yellow or red light - and nitrogen - which emits blue light - in the upper atmosphere release specific colours when bombarded by solar radiation.</p>
        
            <p>Atoms, molecules and ions in the atmosphere are excited by the electrically charged particles and, in turn, release photons - which is the light we see.</p>
