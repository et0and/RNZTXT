            <p>Wellington councillor Nicola Young is discussing government criticism of the council with Checkpoint's Lisa Owens. Listen</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Nicola Young agrees with the government description of her council as a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has floated the possibility of intervening at Wellington City Council after councillors last week halted the sale of airport shares.</p>
        
            <p>The decision leaves the council's Long Term Plan with a major budget shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Christopher Luxon said he was concerned while Finance Minister Nicola Willis - who's Wellington-based - separately described the state of the council as a shambles.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he was seeking advice on the options available to him but will not give a timeline for potential developments.</p>
        
            <p>Young told Checkpoint on Tuesday her concerns included council paying tens of millions a year in interest payments, liveability of the city and the leadership at council.</p>
        
            <p>She also took issue with mayor Tory Whanau, saying they had never had a "functional chat".</p>
        
            <p>"I find this really distressing because I want Wellington to be a flourishing city."</p>
        
            <p>A Crown observer would be a step in the right direction, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Diane Calvert said she agreed with the need for outside intervention.</p>

            <p>"To quite a few of us, and the public included, intervention has been needed for some time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A number of councillors wanted council spending to be reduced, a plea which had been "completely ignored by the mayor and others".</p>
        
            <p>"From my perspective, it's quite clear that you can't undertake a new Long Term Plan under the same process that created the problems in the first place," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said there were several options for intervention, from a review team to a commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>"Most people believe that a midway point, an observer tasked with a role such as a facilitator, is the best outcome."</p>
        
            <p>She said a facilitator would ideally make sure advice to the councillors was accurate, current and neutral, and support council relationships with the government and other councils.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau earlier on Tuesday did not directly address the statements made by the government but said work was underway with councillors on the council's Long Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau declined to be interviewed on Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
