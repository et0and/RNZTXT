            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell has finally declared his full confidence in Police Commissioner Andrew Coster, after repeatedly dodging the question.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell has set his expectations of Coster, laying out the government's direction and priorities in a letter. The pair agreed to the terms when they met on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The minister has openly criticised the direction the organisation's taken over the past six years.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter, released by the public service commissioner, Mitchell told police he wants a more visible police presence and new legislation used to crack down on gangs.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report he went public with the letter to let New Zealanders know he was confident the commissioner can do the job.</p>
