        <h2>Building wall not enough to stop sea level rising, research says</h2>
        <p>
New research suggests even building a giant wall in the sea would not be enough to stop sea level rise stemming from two crucial Antarctic glaciers.

            <p>New research from Victoria University in Wellington suggests even building a giant wall in the sea would not be enough to stop sea level rise stemming from two crucial Antarctic glaciers.</p>
        
            <p>Pine Island and Thwaites are retreating and thinning faster than falling snow can rebuild them.</p>
        
            <p>If they collapse, it could eventually reshape the world's coasts by unleashing around three metres of sea level rise from the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>
        
            <p>Saving these glaciers is considered so critical, scientists are working on designing a 'curtain' more than 100 metres high attached to the seabed, to protect them from warmer water which is now reaching the area because of climate change.</p>
        
            <p>But a New Zealand study out today suggests even radical measures might not restore the glaciers to health once they shrink.</p>
        
            <p>Alanna Alevropoulos-Borrill ran almost 200 simulations on a state-of-the-art ice sheet model, to figure out if slowing the melting might let the glaciers rebuild.</p>
        
            <p>The outlook, she said, was "gloomy".</p>
        
            <p>Ideas like building a giant wall or curtain, known as geoengineering, are deeply controversial for the cost, uncertainty and risk of unintended consequences.</p>
        
            <p>Her study found even if a drastic intervention blocked warm water from reaching the glaciers and slowed their retreat, centuries of snowfall would be needed to rebuild them to their current thickness.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Nicholas Golledge, who was also involved in the study, said it showed the dangers of relying on geoengineering rather than stopping emissions.</p>
        
            <p>"My concern with the geo-engineering approach, in any field, not just in Antarctic ice sheets, is that it sort of offers a fantastic idea that we can just turn the switch off and stop these changes from happening and that sort of gives people a license to just keep emitting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Thwaites glacier alone is around the size of Great Britain. The researchers testing the idea of a curtain have been clear they do not know if the plan would work, and say it could cost US$50-100 billion, excluding maintenance. They say it could be worth it, given the eye-watering cost of sea level rise.</p>
        
            <p>However, Golledge said there were other, major sources of sea level rise aside from these glaciers - and the only sure way to slow it, was by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>If Thwaites collapses, research suggests it would destabilise the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>
        
            <p>In the natural course of events, compressed snow and ice slowly flows in the glaciers to the ocean, where it melts into the sea.</p>
        
            <p>But, now, warm meltwater is flowing down, between the glacier and the bedrock it sits on, hastening the melting process by 'floating' what used to be grounded ice, Alevropoulos-Borrill said.</p>
        
            <p>Because the ice is melting from land, it raises sea levels. (By contrast, melting sea ice is already sitting in the ocean, displacing water, before it melts.)</p>
        
            <p>Many scientists globally are trying to pinpoint how many degrees of heating it will take to 'flip' the melting into irreversible territory.</p>
        
            <p>Some studies suggest that point has passed.</p>
        
            <p>But Golledge said other research suggested Thwaites was still "hanging in there".</p>
        
            <p>The latest study suggested once these glaciers retreat, there was no easy way to get their current health and size back, even using extreme measures.</p>
