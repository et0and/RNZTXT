            <p>Analysis - Policy changes, a steady OCR rate, low construction costs, and the high cost of home ownership are all impacting the housing market. Here's what moved real estate this week.</p>
        
            <p>Residential property values have barely changed with slow sales and a glut of listings.</p>
        
            <p>And in a bid to attract more landlords, the government will present a bill on rental changes next month.</p>
        
            <p>The QV House Price Index for March shows the national average home value rose 2.2 percent to $924,734 over the first three months of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown saw the most growth at 2.7 percent, then Wellington at 2 percent and Christchurch at 1.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland values fell the most at 0.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Flat remains the word of the year so far when it comes to the current state of New Zealand's residential property market," QV operations manager James Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>He expected little change over the winter months, given high interest rates and stretched household budgets.</p>
        
            <p>The large number of properties on the market was giving buyers choice and helping maintain downward pressure on prices, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Investors are yet to respond in large numbers to changes in tax policy, designed to make residential property a more desirable investment.</p>
        
            <p>After reinstating interest deductibility, the government is moving on a suite of changes to tenancy laws.</p>
        
            <p>They include:</p>
        
            <p>they want to move themselves or a family member into the property, or</p>
        
            <p>the tenancy agreement notes the property is usually used to house employees, and they want to move an employee into the property, or</p>
        
            <p>where the property is subject to an unconditional agreement for sale requiring vacant possession.</p>
        
            <p>The government will introduce a bill to Parliament in May, with the measures expected to come into effect in early 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop said the changes would make it easier for "mum and dad landlords" to get into the rental market, boost supply and put downward pressure on rents.</p>
        
            <p>"We need more landlords in the market, but more fundamentally, we need to reform the RMA and our planning laws at the same time," Bishop told Morning Report on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The government wanted to "flood the market" with development opportunities so more houses were built, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A small sentence in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement could speed up development of papakāinga and address overcrowding, builders say.</p>
        
            <p>The line suggests removing the need for consent for dwellings less than 60m2, instead requiring only an engineer's report.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said he intended to introduce the change as part of a Resource Management Amendment Bill this year.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Cordell Construction Cost Index showed the construction cost growth rate had dropped to its lowest level in eight years.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said costs rose 0.5 percent in the first quarter, compared to the long-term quarterly average of 1.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That would give more certainty to people building new homes and doing renovations but builders were experiencing a decline in their workloads and some were going into liquidation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It could be at least two years before any change from the government's fight for lower building costs was seen by consumers, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Official Cash Rate (OCR) is still at 5.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It has remained unchanged since May 2023, when inflation had fallen to 6 percent from 6.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank says increasing the OCR rates helps bring inflation down. Inflation is currently at 4.7 percent. The inflation target is 1-3 percent and RBNZ will review the OCR again in May.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said she did not expect cuts until 2025.</p>
        
            <p>ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley told Stuff, no change in the OCR could mean a halt in interest rate hikes.</p>
        
            <p>Recent surveys have shown business and consumer confidence slipping, as households keep a lid on their spending, and firms struggle with lower sales and high-interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced targets for the government to deliver in the next six years. It includes a 75 percent reduction of households in emergency housing.</p>
        
            <p>The housing and finance ministers have already sent a letter demanding Kāinga Ora take a tougher stance on unruly social housing tenants.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as a new social housing development opens in the Gisborne suburb of Tamarau which will house 31 families, many of whom are moving from motels or social housing.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora manages more than 70,000 properties nationwide, accommodating nearly 185,000 people, with more than 160 homes built in Gisborne in the past three years.</p>
        
            <p>It said another 162 state homes were in progress, and early plans were under way for about 120 more.</p>
