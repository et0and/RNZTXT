1News was inundated with complaints over what the PM called "frothy" poll coverage this week. Many saw inconsistency in the backlash, but there was a glimmer of a point under the double standards.

            <p>Maiki Sherman introduced Monday’s 1News-Verian poll result with shots of Chris Luxon, Winston Peters, and David Seymour chowing down, or at least preparing to eat, what she called "coalition comfort food".</p>
        
            <p>"The prime minister may reach for a bowl of hot noodles tonight. Winston Peters a super wine biscuit with a cup of tea. David Seymour some golden greasy fish and chips," she said, over the gastronomic montage.</p>
        
            <p>No-one wants to kick off their Monday evening with a shot of politicians slurping noodles airing on the news, and things didn’t get much better as the week wore on for the prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>He turned up to his regular weekly interview on RNZ’s Morning Report the next day to a blunt welcome from presenter Ingrid Hipkiss.</p>
        
            <p>"What is going wrong?" she asked, immediately after warmly greeting him.</p>
        
            <p>The intro wasn’t much more cheery over at TVNZ’s Breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>"Only five months in and the wheels are falling off. The honeymoon is over and the blame game has started," said TVNZ's Anna Burns-Francis.</p>
        
            <p>"Good to be with you," replied Luxon, who also wished her well on her upcoming maternity leave.</p>
        
            <p>There was no letup over at Newshub's AM on Three.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been no single-term National-led government before. For reaction, we've got prime minister Christopher Luxon this morning," began presenter Melissa Chan-Green.</p>
        
            <p>"Good morning, how are ya?" said Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>The tone was cheery but National may have been a bit rattled by the barrage.</p>
        
            <p>Finance minister Nicola Willis dredged up a 35-year-old line from David Lange about politicians being poll-driven fruitcakes, telling reporters in Parliament frostily the coverage was “fruitcake business”.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon took a different path, explaining that things only feel bad right now because the government is enacting its policies.</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's tough for those individuals but it's not easy for a government to drive through that programme as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not easy to actually put sanctions on beneficiaries not upholding their obligations on the jobseeker benefit. It's not easy to evict unruly tenants out of Kāinga Ora. So I get all that. But we have a hell of a mess and we are going to turn the show around."</p>
        
            <p>That strategy didn’t get lot of sympathy from Newshub’s political editor Jenna Lynch.</p>
        
            <p>"Turn it around by cutting jobs with one hand and taking pay rises with the other," she said referencing this week's recommended pay boost for MPs. </p>
        
            <p>Thankfully for Luxon, there was one moment of respite; an oasis in the desert of tough questions and negatively slanted coverage.</p>
        
            <p>When that hazy vision of paradise swam into focus, it looked a lot like Mike Hosking’s studio at Newstalk ZB.</p>
        
            <p>"I’ll be honest Mike, I’m pretty focused on that job not the polls, and ultimately New Zealanders make their calls in two-and-a-half years time," Luxon began, though he needn't have been defensive.</p>
        
            <p>"I would understand that if the mess was your fault. It isn’t," replied Hosking. "Why aren’t you getting some credit for the fact that the mess isn’t your fault?"</p>
        
            <p>Now that’s a nicer question.</p>
        
            <p>Hosking did find someone to blame for the lack of credit – TVNZ's Maiki Sherman, who he criticised via a montage of her emotive adjectives from Monday's poll coverage.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon agreed the coverage was "frothy and sensationalist".</p>
        
            <p>The tone was markedly different to the one Hosking adopted with Chris Hipkins last year when Labour’s polling took a tumble before the election.</p>
        
            <p>"What I’m asking you is why do you think it’s not working?" he asked the then-prime minister. </p>
        
            <p>When Hipkins tried to deflect, talking about the prospect of what he saw as a frightening National government, Hosking rebuffed him for going negative about his opponents.</p>
        
            <p>"They look at Hipkins, they don’t like you anymore. What’s happened do you reckon?"</p>
        
            <p>Over at The Spinoff, Stewart Sowman-Lund pointed out that Newshub has long been injecting large quantities of froth and sensation directly into their poll coverage with far less critical pushback. </p>
        
            <p>Newshub’s previous political editor Tova O’Brien, for example, didn't exactly play down polls when she was in the role.</p>
        
            <p>In her Tova podcast for Stuff the week she asked three former MPs from the parties making up the current coalition if it would implode before the next election. </p>
        
            <p>All three said ‘yes,' though one of them - former attorney-general Chris Finlayson - also reckoned TVNZ’s political editor had gone over the top this week. </p>
        
            <p>"The day after Maiki's breathless performance, which was worthy of an Oscar, there was a Roy Morgan poll that showed quite a different result," he said.</p>
        
            <p>O’Brien didn’t agree with that though — or with the criticism of Sherman: </p>
        
            <p>"I thought she did a brilliant job, and I think everything she said was actually on point," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It did send shockwaves across the parliament. Talking to party MPs, to Labour MPs, to National MPs, they were rattled by the poll this week."</p>
        
            <p>On the social media platform Bluesky, political commentator and academic Morgan Godfery posed a question that may have contained traces of sarcasm about the discrepancy in the amount of blowback 1News and Sherman were receiving compared to their equally frothy rivals.</p>
        
            <p>"Strangely the media class never united against them like they are Maiki. My gosh what could explain the difference? Hmmm what is different about Maiki?" he asked.</p>
        
            <p>Potential double standards aside, did Hosking and Luxon have a point?</p>
        
            <p>A single poll, on its own, isn’t much of a bellwether for the mood of the electorate - or a sign of governmental collapse. </p>
        
            <p>As politics commentator and author Grant Duncan says on his Substack blog, don’t lay bets based on this one unless you really like risk.</p>
        
            <p>It’s the trend over time that matters, and this poll’s headlines about the government losing its grip on power were mainly thanks to New Zealand First falling just shy of the 5 percent threshold. </p>
        
            <p>Two other poll results did come out this week. The Roy Morgan one showed the coalition maintaining its majority while a leaked internal Talbot-Mills poll, commissioned by Labour, aligned more closely with the 1News-Verian results.</p>
        
            <p>Definitely concerning stuff for the right, but still not quite enough for Labour to pop the champagne corks over Chris Hipkins’ triumphant return to power.</p>
        
            <p>Last year former political gallery reporter Andrea Vance summed up the dangers of over-the-top poll coverage.</p>
        
            <p>Bad polls can beget bad polls, and blanket coverage of a drop in support can induce a kind of media-driven narrative, she said in on Stuff’s daily podcast Newsable.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to squeeze the hell out of it. You've paid $11 or $12,000 for a poll, it's got to be the top story.  It's got to have the fancy graphics," she said. </p>
        
            <p>"But it just feels like we're manufacturing news. We're taking a piece of information that's a snapshot in time and we're pretending that we know the future," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Polls are valuable when you look at them as a trend over a long period of time. One poll will not tell you what you need to know. It'll tell you about a point in time but it won't tell you about the trend. It definitely won't tell you what will happen at the election."</p>
        
            <p>That was actually briefly acknowledged on 1News by presenter Simon Dallow on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>"As we know Maiki, polls are a snapshot in time," he said in conversation with Sherman.</p>
        
            <p>"This poll will absolutely rock the entire parliament," Sherman replied.</p>
        
            <p>"You will have MPs from political parties across the spectrum sending 'OMG. What's up?' messages to their caucus group chats right this very minute," she said.</p>
        
            <p>That might be part of the problem. It’s not just the media frothing about one poll; it’s politicians and their staffers as well.</p>
        
            <p>Lots of people in and around the Beehive are a bit obsessed with support numbers going up and down, even 30 months out from an election. After all, their jobs depend on them.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, real issues that affect us all here and now can be pushed down the editorial pecking order.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, 1News published stories about the responses to other questions in its Verian poll.</p>
        
            <p>One found majority backing for public service job cuts. It was covered by TVNZ business correspondent Katie Bradford on Breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>Another uncovered a popularity problem for the fast track consenting bill. It ran just before the first break on Wednesday’s episode of 1News at 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>They may not have been OMG text-worthy but both stories delivered meaningful new information on topics that will impact people’s lives in a real way either right now, or pretty soon. </p>
        
            <p>Despite that, neither got quite the same billing as the coalition parties' polling slump - or the same level of reaction and commentary.   </p>
