            <p>In an effort to get thousands of roaming dogs off the streets and into forever homes Auckland Council is opening the country's first council-operated dog adoption centre in Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>The need is more pressing than ever with all Tāmaki Makaurau's dog shelters at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Less than half of roaming dogs in the city were reclaimed by their owners last year - the lowest level in a decade.</p>

            <p>Shelter manager Carly Triska said the centre would take some of the strain off shelters in Silverdale, Henderson and Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>By taking in just over 40 dogs at a time and giving them a second chance.</p>
        
            <p>"We give them a lot of support, a lot of training, we spend a lot of time with the dogs to try and help them be the best dogs they can be for their new families."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The centre will be solely focused on training and nurturing the dogs for adoption, something not possible until now.</p>
        
            <p>"Those three shelters do an amazing job caring for the dogs, but unfortunately, they're also looking after dogs that have been impounded, looking after dogs that have been found roaming and aggressive dogs," Triska said.</p>
        
            <p>After a temperament test around toys, food and strangers, dogs that pass come to Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>In the 12 months to October last year, there were 8306 dogs taken in by Auckland council shelters and only 43 percent were reclaimed by their owners.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Covid, there has been a huge boom in the dog population this then also means that there's a huge increase in roaming dogs [and] there's been an increase in attacks," Triska said.</p>
        
            <p>"The adoption centre is set up to help create a little bit more space at those shelters they can now hold more of those dogs that need to be off the streets."</p>

            <p>Training at the centre starts with learning basic commands and socialising at the local shopping centres and parks.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the centre not officially opening until Saturday, six dogs have already been adopted.</p>
        
            <p>The owners are reaping the rewards of the training.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the owners has emailed us back and said how happy they are that their dog is a lot calmer than they expected.</p>
        
            <p>"A few basic manners were already in place so that has made that dog fit into their home really quickly which they didn't expect necessarily from a council or pound dog."</p>

            <p>Kylie Mossey is one of the animal shelter officers at the adoption centre.</p>
        
            <p>She said each of the dogs has their own personality and it was hard not to get attached.</p>
        
            <p>"Lance came in, he has been with us for about three weeks now and he is just full of energy.</p>
        
            <p>"He's one of those pups where he came in and was a little bit shy, a little unsure, but has just really opened up in terms of being just a fun-loving dog."</p>

            <p>From Pitbull to Pug Kylie said there was no discrimination on breed, age, sex or colour they want to give every pooch a chance at adoption.</p>
        
            <p>For those interested, she said do not judge a dog by its cover, come on down and get to know them first.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't judge a dog by especially just its photo so, coming in, seeing what they're like when they're out playing, how they interact with toys, other dogs, stuff like that, you really get to know them inside and out."</p>

            <p>Long-term plans for the centre include school visits, family events, and public education programmes for responsible pet ownership.</p>
        
            <p>The centre officially opens on Saturday 15 March with the opportunity to pat and play with the dogs and hopes it will bring them one step closer to their forever homes.</p>
