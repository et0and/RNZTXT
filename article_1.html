            <p>Analysis: Where to now for Israel Adesanya?</p>
        
            <p>'The Last Stylebender' was submitted in his grudge match against Dricus Du Plessis at UFC 305 on Sunday, his second consecutive loss for the middleweight strap.</p>
        
            <p>It marked his third defeat in the UFC, after losing his title to Sean Stickland at UFC 293 in a stunning upset.</p>
        
            <p>However, the 35-year-old is still the third-ranked middleweight in the UFC, 15th on the pound-for-pound rankings, and remains a huge threat to his division.</p>
        
            <p>As his CIty Kick Boxing teammate Carlos Ulberg told RNZ, write Adesanya off at your peril.</p>
        
            <p>"The UFC love him. He's exciting. He draws a lot of people in to watch him, it's never over for Izzy."</p>
        
            <p>With no clear path ahead, here are seven possible next steps for the Stylebender.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya has two potential trilogies with rivals Robert Whittaker or Alex Pereira. The latter could see him have another crack at light heavyweight after an unsuccessful attempt at double champ status against Poland's Jan Błachowicz.</p>
        
            <p>Though a third bout with Whittaker is unlikely to garner much excitement with the ledger 2-0 in favour of Adesanya, the ongoing narrative he has with Pereira will attract plenty of eyeballs.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya is the only man to have defeated Poatan in the UFC, with the Brazilian chasing the Stylebender into the sport after beating him twice in kickboxing years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>It was an interview Adesanya gave which was the catalyst for Pereira's arrival and takeover.</p>
        
            <p>Referencing the fact Pereira would repeatedly post videos of the fight where he knocked Adesanya out, the Stylebender said "he will be sitting in a bar one day saying 'I beat that guy one time'".</p>
        
            <p>The words prompted Poatan to the UFC, where he quickly became the company boogeyman, winning both the middleweight and light heavyweight titles within two years.</p>
        
            <p>With the MMA scorecards reading 1-1. another showdown could spark an epic career comeback for Adesanya if he could slay the monster once again.</p>
        
            <p>As the company's cash cow, Adesanya is unlikely to leave the UFC for its rival promotion.</p>
        
            <p>But having already started to lap the middleweight division prior to his title loss, some fresh competition could re-ignite Adesanya.</p>

            <p>One man Adesanya is yet to cross paths with is the former phenom turned polarising figure, Khamzat Chimaev.</p>
        
            <p>Chimaev stormed the UFC like few men had before, setting a record for the fastest turnaround in the cage and notching three wins inside 66 days.</p>
        
            <p>However, his stock has plummeted after first having his aura eroded by Gilbert Burns. The man renowned for his activity has been sighted just three times since April 2022, most recently picking up a decision win over Kamaru Usman.</p>
        
            <p>Although still undefeated at 13-0, fans have soured on Chimaev due to his failed weight cuts, Twitter rants and association with Russian warlords.</p>
        
            <p>With Chimaev's future seemingly set at middleweight, Adesanya could stop the hype train once and for all.</p>
        
            <p>While beaten and forced to tap out, Adesanya was not completely humiliated by Du Plessis - well, not in the cage at least.</p>
        
            <p>Adesanya showed he is still a world-class striker, and had far more success on the feet than many before who have attempted to solve the Du Plessis puzzle.</p>
        
            <p>Though they showed plenty of respect post-fight, there is no doubt still animosity after an incredibly personal build-up.</p>
        
            <p>Du Plessis caused Adesanya to break down in tears, having referenced his childhood servants in Nigera.</p>
        
            <p>The bad blood runs very deep between the two African-born middleweights, and a rematch could see it boil once again.</p>
        
            <p>The presser alone would be worthwhile rebooking this one.</p>

            <p>Adesanya has always been a performer.</p>
        
            <p>His walk-outs have often been more entertaining than his fights, and he has even paid homage to WWE legend The Undertaker during his entrance of his fight with Jared Cannonier.</p>
        
            <p>The two worlds are closely connected, now even owned by the same company, and several wrestlers, such as Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley, have enjoyed successful careers in both.</p>
        
            <p>Ronda Rousey re-ignited her career with a shift to the squared circle, and Adesanya is a natural fit for pro wrestling.</p>
        
            <p>With a team writing his material for him, there would be less room for cringe-inducing mic moments such as his infamous 'Frozen like Elsa' line.</p>
        
            <p>Seeing Adesanya dance his way into Wrestlemania would be an electric moment.</p>
        
            <p>Izzy has nothing to prove.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the downfall, he remains one of the greatest middleweights in UFC history.</p>
        
            <p>If he hung up the gloves tomorrow, he would do so as a legend of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>Regardless of what he does next, he has built a legacy of which both he and New Zealand can be proud.</p>
