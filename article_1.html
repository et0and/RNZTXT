        <h2>'Disappointing and distracting' - Blues dismiss haka controversy</h2>
        <p>
The Blues Women are brushing off any thought of the big issue in women's rugby this week, instead focusing on their match against Chiefs Manawa.

            <p>Blues Women v Chiefs Manawa</p>
        
            <p>Kickoff: 2pm Saturday, 9 March</p>
        
            <p>Bell Park, Auckland</p>
        
            <p>The Blues Women are brushing off any thought of the big issue in women's rugby this week, with it coming a distant second to the preparation for their upcoming match this weekend. They face Chiefs Manawa at Bell Park in Pakuranga, with their opponents now embroiled in the haka controversy from last Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Willie Walker said that it had detracted from "two really good games of footy".</p>
        
            <p>"For something like this to take the focus away is probably a bit disappointing and distracting for the players especially. So I think we've just got to bring the focus back to the quality competition that we've created and that these girls are playing."</p>
        
            <p>Blues Women co-captain Maia Roos said the team had "talked about it briefly, but our focus has been on the game."</p>
        
            <p>"We have such a condensed time together, so we haven't spent much time on that. So that's their thing…we're pretty all good up here."</p>

            <p>Roos takes over as sole captain for her side after Ruahei Demant was ruled out with injury. It's a fairly heavy loss for the side after their upset 24-17 win over champions Matatū in round one, she is replaced at second five by Daynah Nankivell in her first Aupiki start.</p>
        
            <p>"Huge loss, obviously," admitted Walker.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone with Ruahei's experience and ability is always going to be [hard]. Having someone like Dayna, she's been around this group a long time, with Auckland at FPC, it's a good opportunity to get her involved. She's had a really good preseason."</p>
        
            <p>Chiefs Manawa have named a strong side, with an all-Black Fern front row of Krystal Murray, Tanya Kalounivale and Luka Connor. Coach Crystal Kaua is wary of the challenge posed by the Blues, though.</p>
        
            <p>"All teams are in a much better place than the same time last year and they were impressive against Matatū. It's always an entertaining game of rugby when our teams come together," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Walker is mindful of his side's slow start last weekend, that saw them down 7-0 at halftime after a litany of errors and penalties. It's something he says his side has been working hard on.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't go into a game against the Chiefs and allow them to have that much ball. It's a huge focus on our game so we start well."</p>
