The Wellington city took the crown, but a handful of small New Zealand towns also made the top 10 list.

            <p>Lower Hutt is the top-trending New Zealand destination according to Airbnb, up there with Aoraki and Omahau.</p>
        
            <p>The accommodation booking website ranked the most-searched destinations locally and abroad, by Kiwi travellers looking to get away next year.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington city of Lower Hutt took the crown for 'top trending domestic destinations', with Aoraki/ Mount Cook in second place, and Thames claiming the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Among the top ten were some notable small towns, including Twizel and Lake Tekapo in Canterbury, and Mosgiel in Otago.</p>

            <p>Country manager for Airbnb New Zealand and Australia Susan Wheeldon said travel was becoming more widely dispersed across Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"The economic benefits are being shared across more destinations in areas such as Lower Hutt, Aoraki, Thames, ÅŒmarama, Karitane and Twizel, enabling a valuable economic contribution to rural and regional areas."</p>
        
            <p>Airbnb said it was an indication of where New Zealanders were looking to travel over the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis love to travel and we know the summer holiday period is a particularly popular time," Wheeldon said.</p>

            <p>The website said New Zealanders were also looking to Japan for their global travels next year with Hokkaido and Tokyo among the 'trending global destinations for Kiwi travellers'.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was Sydney which took the top spot in the ranking, something Airbnb attributed to "major international concerts taking place across the ditch next year".</p>
        
            <p>These include Taylor Swift bringing her international Eras Tour to Australia, where she will perform seven concert shows, four of which are at Sydney Olympic Park.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was snubbed in the tour locations, leading thousands of local 'Swifties' to plan trips to catch the global sensation in Australia in February.</p>
        
            <p>Also rated highly among global destinations New Zealanders were planning to visit were the city of Austin in the United States, and France.</p>
        
            <p>For travellers across the world, Indianapolis in the US took the crown for 'top trending global destination', followed by Warsaw in Poland, and the Japanese cities of Osaka and Kyoto.</p>
        
            <p>The website said Japan was a hot destination, with searches for accommodation in the land of the rising sun having tripled since last year.</p>

            <p>France also frequented the top 24 and Airbnb said searches for the country had grown seven times since last year thanks to Paris hosting the 2024 Olympic Games in July.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand did not manage to snag a global spot, but Australia did, with Melbourne claiming 11th place.</p>
