            <p>New Zealand Herald publisher NZME has told staff about 30 journalists will lose their jobs, with reports that some of the company's most senior reporters will be leaving.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Michael Boggs sent a company-wide email announcing the changes today including that it had accepted a number of voluntary redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald's Media Insider column reports senior affected staff include political editor Claire Trevett, deputy business editor Grant Bradley and senior sports writer and columnist Chris Rattue.</p>
        
            <p>The company last month announced it planned to cut up to 38 roles in a newsroom restructure and staff were offered to apply for voluntary redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>A source within NZME told RNZ the confirmed structure was shared with newsroom teams this morning and the changes include a new Herald streaming channel.</p>
        
            <p>The email says there is significant potential to grow revenue and audiences in video and their strategy includes expanding that team.</p>
        
            <p>The changes take affect from 17 March.</p>
        
            <p>The company expects to have the operational changes in place by mid-March, and production journalist changes in place by 30 April.</p>
