            <p>The Auckland businessman facing charges of assaulting a police officer and obstructing another last July can now be named.</p>
        
            <p>Leo Molloy appeared briefly in the Auckland District Court on Monday morning, where his lawyer, Quentin Duff, said name suppression could lapse.</p>
        
            <p>Molloy had previously pleaded not guilty to the two charges.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded at large until his next court date in April.</p>
        
            <p>The businessman was in the running to be Auckland's next mayor in 2022, before deciding to pull out of the race.</p>
        
            <p>His decision came after polls suggested he would not win the election.</p>
