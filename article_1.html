            <p>A witness to a Christchurch teen who received an intense electric shock while climbing a power pylon says the boy suffered serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The teenage boy remains in a critical condition in Christchurch hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Ashtead Lane in Sockburn at 7:40pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Eyewitness Josh Phillips said the teen was visibly on fire for a minute after the electric shock.</p>
        
            <p>"So basically the first initial sound was just this big bang.</p>
        
            <p>"And then you could literally see flames. He literally blew his shorts off, like they'd exploded. That's how much electrical current went through this guy.</p>
        
            <p>"He was on fire for about a minute straight."</p>
        
            <p>Phillips said when fire crews rescued him, there were fears about the state of his body temperature lowering rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>"He was complaining a little bit before ... that he was cold and I feel like there might have been a fear that he could possibly be going into cold shock because it was quite windy.</p>
        
            <p>"He went from speaking to not speaking for about 10 minutes and I think that's when the crew kind of started ramping things up a bit.</p>
        
            <p>"He was probably up there for about two hours."</p>
        
            <p>Phillips said a group of teenagers were at the scene crying over the boy.</p>
