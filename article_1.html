            <p>Everyone aboard a New Zealand Defence Force ship which ran aground off the Samoan island of Upolu has been rescued.</p>
        
            <p>HMNZS Manawanui, the navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, regularly conducts tasks across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com's ship tracker showed the vessel was 'aground' near the village of Siumu, on the southern side of Upolu, at 10.45pm Saturday.</p>

            <p>Maritime component commander Commodore Shane Arndell said the grounding occurred while conducting a reef survey.</p>
        
            <p>The 75 crew and passengers were at first evacuated onto life rafts, before being taken ashore by rescuers.</p>
        
            <p>"They are being supported in Samoa or on supporting vessels," Arndell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Defence Force worked closely with Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ) which coordinated rescue efforts. Several vessels responded and assisted in rescuing crew and passengers. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-8A Poseidon was also deployed."</p>

            <p>HMNZS Manawanui departed Auckland's Devonport naval base for the Pacific on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Defence Force website, the ship has a core crew of 39. It has been in service since November 2019 and has a top speed of 14 knots (26km/h).</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, it was used in a seven-week operation to conduct underwater surveys and help to dispose of submerged World War II bombs in Niue, Fiji and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of our crew hail from Pacific nations and so for them our deployments to the Pacific are a way for them to give something back to their communities," Commanding Officer Yvonne Gray said at the time.</p>
