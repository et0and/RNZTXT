            <p>Court documents have revealed the child found dead in South Auckland last month was allegedly smothered.</p>
        
            <p>A 37-year-old Conifer Grove man, who has interim name suppression, was charged with murder after a child was found dead in his car in early January.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in the High Court at Auckland on Wednesday morning, but did not enter a plea.</p>
        
            <p>Both the man and the victim were granted identity suppression, however, court documents obtained by RNZ have revealed details of what happened, much of which cannot be reported.</p>
        
            <p>The court documents said the child was smothered in the car.</p>
        
            <p>The man was remanded in custody and a trial date has been set for May next year.</p>
