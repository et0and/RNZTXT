        <h2>Warriors 'not getting carried away' after turnaround against Broncos</h2>
        <p>
Andrew Webster and his players know there's work to be done, despite their valuable win over the Broncos.
</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors are keeping their feet on the ground. That's the message from the coach and players, even though they managed to turn around one of the worst defeats in club history with a solid 32-16 win over old rivals the Brisbane Broncos at Go Media Mt Smart Stadium on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>After conceding 66 points last weekend against the lowly Gold Coast Titans, the Warriors burst out of the blocks early against the Broncos, establishing a 16-0 lead after half an hour. However, it was the defence that pleased coach Andrew Webster the most.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we put our energy into the right things tonight: defence, going after the opposition," Webster said post-match, before quickly noting there was plenty to work on.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's pretty clear we weren't the smartest at times. We made it hard on ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>Despite having two thirds of the possession, the Warriors let the Broncos, who were missing Origin players Reece Walsh, Payne Haas and Pat Carrigan, back into the game after halftime when the visitors closed to within a converted try.</p>
        
            <p>Selwyn Cobbo looked to have achieved that in the 48th minute, only for his otherwise impressive effort to be ruled a knock on as he put the ball down.</p>
        
            <p>A concerted effort on defence sealed the win though, something Webster put down to his players not letting the Titans result "define them".</p>
        
            <p>"But I still think the boys had that feeling of embarrassment from last week, to make that right - but not letting it define them this week." he said.</p>

            <p>It was a view shared by prop Addin Fonua-Blake, who finished the game with 163 run metres and 23 tackles.</p>
        
            <p>"We got on top of them early but we clocked off and let them back in," said Fonua-Blake.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a funny one, an up and down season. As soon as we look like we've got a handle on things, we get a spanner thrown in the works ... our main focus has to be our D, we've been guilty of clocking off at times. Teams are putting it to us, we've been guilty of letting them back in at times."</p>
        
            <p>Halfback Te Maire Martin said the Warriors were "good in patches".</p>
        
            <p>"A lot better than last week but there's a lot to work on. Obviously we'll take the two points but we're not getting carried away with it."</p>
        
            <p>Martin pointed out the Origin players missing from the Broncos, as well as injured playmaker Adam Reynolds, made a difference to the side that beat the Warriors in last year's preliminary final. Kevin Walters' side had now dropped four games in a row and were dealing with a mounting injury list.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors centre Roger Tuivasa-Sheck scored a crucial second half try off a third-tackle kick by Martin.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something we practised at training and it paid off ... confidence is a big factor in the game, finding momentum. Even when the game is real tight and in the balance ... it's moments like that when you're like everyone's here to play," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To have the confidence to kick when we probably should've been holding the ball, but we're playing our cues and executing."</p>
        
            <p>The win puts the Warriors in 13th spot. However, with only three points separating them from the fourth-placed Roosters, next weekend's game against the Bulldogs in Sydney suddenly becomes a big one as the Warriors have a bye the weekend after.</p>
