            <p>Another full-scale search for Saturday is being planned by police for a fisherman that went missing more than a week ago near Whangārei Heads.</p>
        
            <p>Two men were reported missing on the evening of 1 May after going fishing from rocks at The Gap - a popular, but sometimes treacherous, fishing spot at Taiharuru.</p>
        
            <p>One body was recovered two days later following an extensive search by the Police National Dive Squad.</p>
        
            <p>Senior sergeant Cliff Metcalfe said Search and Rescue, LandSAR volunteers, Coastguard, a plane and drones would be deployed on Saturday in a search area stretching from Ngunguru Sandspit to Ocean Beach.</p>
        
            <p>If he was not found on Saturday the search would continue on Sunday using drones, Metcalfe said.</p>
        
            <p>Searchers were hoping the current easterly conditions would bring him ashore so he could be returned to his family.</p>

            <p>Both men were members of the Malayalee community from the south Indian state of Kerala, who had moved to New Zealand last year.</p>
        
            <p>They have been named by the Whangārei Malayalee Association as Sarath Kumar, 37, and Ferzil Babu, 34.</p>
        
            <p>Kumar, who is survived by his wife and five-year-old daughter, started work as a registered nurse in Whangārei Hospital's emergency department in March this year.</p>
        
            <p>His friend Babu, whose body has yet to be found, is survived by his wife and six-month-old son.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page set up by the Whangārei Malayalee Association, to help the families with funeral, repatriation and other costs, had raised just under $100,000 as of Thursday afternoon.</p>
