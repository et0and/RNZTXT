            <p>A police officer was allegedly bitten on the hand by a man wielding a samurai sword who was then tasered into unconsciousness after officers stopped a fleeing car this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still at the scene in Ōrere Point in the Auckland region following the incident.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said a driver failed to stop after an officer recognised the car - which was being sought as part of an ongoing investigation - in Great South Road in Papakura at 2.15pm today.</p>
        
            <p>The driver failed to stop for police and was followed by the Eagle helicopter as they drove to Ōrere Point, where the car stopped on the beach at about 3.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>While the driver of the car was taken into custody without incident, the male passenger threatened officers with a samurai sword and bit the hand of one officer.</p>
        
            <p>Officers used a Taser, OC spray and a police dog unit, which allowed them to take the man into custody without any further injury to officers.</p>
        
            <p>The man because unconscious while in custody and is now receiving medical assistance.</p>
        
            <p>That officer who was bitten has been transported to a medical centre for treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are in place around the area.</p>
        
            <p>More to come....</p>
