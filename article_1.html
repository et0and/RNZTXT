            <p>New Zealanders have their eyes set on a second medal at the Paris Olympics, as the triathlon finals get underway.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders Hayden Wilde and Dylan McCullough are competing for the men's final while Ainsley Thorpe and Nicole van der Kaay will be taking part in the women's final.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest about 6pm NZT, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.</p>
        
            <p>The men's event will take place immediately after the women's race.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the Black Ferns Sevens fought back to beat Canada 19-12 to defend their Olympic gold and hand New Zealand a first medal of the Paris Games.</p>
