        <h2>Live: Choppers, planes heading back to fight Castle Hill fire</h2>
        <p>
Efforts are ramping back up to fight the massive blaze, which has seen some Cantabrians evacuated.
</p>
        
            <p>Nine helicopters and three planes are due back in the air on Friday morning as efforts to fight a massive Canterbury scrub fire ramp back up.</p>
        
            <p>An overnight crew of firefighters have been fighting the blaze from State Highway 73 as it has been deemed too dangerous to go off road in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday night, firefighters encouraged Castle Hill residents to leave their homes as the 535-hectare scrub fire burned.</p>
        
            <p>A community meeting was scheduled for 1pm Friday at the Tawera Memorial Hall in Springfield in case people were still evacuated at that point.</p>
