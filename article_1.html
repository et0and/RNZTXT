        <h2>'Kākā-tastrophe': Check roofs for kākā, Wellington urged</h2>
        <p>
People checking attics for rats have instead found a parrot with a large beak looking back at them, DOC says.

            <p>The Department of Conservation is warning of kākā hiding in Wellington eaves and attics.</p>
        
            <p>Breeding season for kākā is in full swing from September through to April.</p>
        
            <p>And an attic is prime real estate for these feathered flat-hunters, ranger David Moss said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a few calls from people checking for rats in their attic and finding a parrot with a large beak looking back at them instead.</p>
        
            <p>"Rangers corralled a kākā in the attic of a house in Aro Valley last week, and we expect it won't be the last one."</p>
        
            <p>North Island kākā have a conservation status of At Risk-Recovering under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest threats to the kākā is loss of habitat, as they require large tracts of forest to thrive.</p>
        
            <p>They also nest in hollow trees, and if there are none nearby it can make unsecured attics an attractive option.</p>
        
            <p>Moss added mated pairs will be looking for sheltered, enclosed spaces for nesting sites.</p>
        
            <p>"Old houses with large attics are ideal, especially if there's a hole in the roof they can squeeze through or make larger.</p>
        
            <p>"They can sound a lot like rats or mice, so definitely check for birds before baiting or setting traps to avoid catching some kākā in the crossfire."</p>
        
            <p>Kākā can be very destructive and determined to find the ideal nesting place, and could do serious damage to homes and especially insulation, Moss added.</p>
        
            <p>He advised to call 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468) if a kākā or other native bird is found.</p>
