Tourists driving on a road next to the Dart River in Otago found the road had been undermined, and had to quickly scramble out of the car.

            <p>Tourists driving on a road next to the Dart River in Otago on Saturday found the road had been undermined, and were forced to scramble out of the car.</p>
        
            <p>Their SUV was later washed down the Dart River and one local says she is furious, as her business had contacted council about the risks on the eroded road.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists' car became stranded early on Saturday morning on Kinloch Road, and they had to hike to Kinloch, arriving about breakfast time.</p>
        
            <p>People from Kinloch headed back to the car to try to save it, but were unable to, and it was carried off by the river about midday.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Queenstown Lakes District Council said Kinloch Road was closed about 8am on Saturday, after overnight monitoring and on local advice. The road had been washed out and was impassable, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kinloch Road is vulnerable and a known risk for those in the area, particularly following severe weather. Further inspection to understand what work will be required to get the road reopened will occur once the water has receded.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, this morning a member of the public attempted to drive around the washed out area, resulting in the loss of the vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"No one was in the vehicle at the time and support was provided to the driver to ensure their safety. We'd like to remind locals and visitors to obey road closures for their own safety."</p>
        
            <p>Kinloch Wilderness Retreat co-owner Toni Glover said the road was still open when the tourists used it. RNZ has asked the council for clarification.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Glover, said the council should have closed the road sooner. She videoed the SUV being swept down the river, and said she was "furious" the council had not listened to their warnings that the road was getting worse.</p>
        
            <p>
Toni Glover said nothing could be done to save the tourists' car, but she was grateful everyone got out safely.

            <p>The lodge is currently hosting the Green Party caucus, and people had been put in danger by the council's slow response, Glover said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Queenstown Lakes District Council had known the river was undercutting the road for at least two weeks, and while there had been plans to put rocks in place to help protect it, the lodge owners had been concerned the response was too slow.</p>
        
            <p>They had contacted council again just hours before the incident, to let them know the problem was worsening, but were told by an engineer that the road would hold, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He said the road's going to be fine - but if they'd checked it at first light this morning, this wouldn't have happened to those poor Chinese guests ...</p>
        
            <p>"They were trying to drive down an open public road - they were driving at the side of the road the water wasn't covering."</p>
        
            <p>Glover estimated about 40 or 50 vehicles typically travelled the road on any day: "It's a pretty heavily used country road."</p>
        
            <p>"The road was okay at 11 o'clock last night, but we've been worried about it for quite a while because [the river] was just digging into the road, undercutting it. It's taken them all two weeks - till this afternoon to even get here."</p>
        
            <p>The lodge was now cut off by land, as it relied on access from the road, Glover said, but a local jetboat tour company had been helping to ferry visitors in and out.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the council and contractors were exploring "all possible options" but due to the significant damage, the road was likely to remain closed for some time.</p>
        
            <p>The council had been in contact with those affected, including the lodge, the Department of Conservation and Greenstone Station, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Further communication is underway to understand the need for travellers in the area and what support might be available for those who need it."</p>
