            <p>A pod of false killer whales has been refloated after stranding at a beach near Māhia on the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah manager Daren Grover said there was concern that the whales would not swim out to sea and strand themselves again as the tide went out.</p>
        
            <p>The team at the beach were creating a "human chain" in the shallows, splashing and making noise to prevent the whales from running aground again.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a video posted on a Facebook community page showed the whales thrashing in the shallows of a rocky beach and waving their tails, surrounded by water.</p>
        
            <p>Grover said the beach was isolated and a major stranding for an area where there were not many people nearby to help.</p>
        
            <p>He warned that any locals wanting to help should not get in the water with the stranded whale because it could be unpredictable and dangerous.</p>
