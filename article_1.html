        <h2>The women battling for excavator supremacy</h2>
        <p>
History could be made at the National Excavator Operator Competition, where contests have had to dunk basketballs, pour tea, and scoop eggs in heavy machinery.

            <p>History could be made at the annual National Excavator Operator Competition this weekend as three women compete to be the first female ever crowned.</p>
        
            <p>In its 31-year history a woman has never made it to the finals.</p>
        
            <p>Tanya Claxton is the Hawke's Bay East Coast regional champ and is feeling quietly confident going into the nationals.</p>
        
            <p>There will be 12 competitors battling it out at Feilding's Manfeild Park during the Central Districts Field Days.</p>
        
            <p>This year's tasks are secret, but previous years competitors have had to slam dunk a basketball with an excavator bucket, paint, pour a cup of tea, and scoop an egg up without breaking it.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately the egg was a task Claxton couldn't crack.</p>
        
            <p>"Only two of the guys got it, I was close but it sort of rolled off," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like those things, they're fun because those aren't things you do on a day-to-day basis, you don't go round picking up eggs or opening beer bottles on a job site."</p>
        
            <p>Claxton trained as a dressmaker, but while looking for summer work outside she found a job as a stop go sign worker.</p>
        
            <p>Now, she's a foreperson and has been in the same industry for 23 years.</p>
        
            <p>For most of her career in construction she's been the only woman on machinery on job sites.</p>
        
            <p>"Back when I started, it was sort of unheard of for females to be on machinery, and until probably the last two years I've been the only female in my depot on machinery.</p>
        
            <p>"My operations manager Lily, put me forward when I was overseas and she thought it would be good to put me out there and said 'you can do it, show them that girls can do anything'."</p>

            <p>Alongside Claxton competing to be the first female to take out the competition is Georgia Lyford from Canterbury Westland and Lydia Hill from Nelson Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>Lyford from Schick Civil Construction in Christchurch is the youngest of the trio and dedicated her qualifying win in Canterbury Westland's regional event to other young women.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm only 23 so it will be cool to go to the finals in Feilding and prove to all the other young girls considering a career in civil construction that we can do it too," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Blenheim-based Hill - who learnt how to operate excavators on her family's farm when she was 14 years old - has been working on large projects in her region like the new Whale Trail from Picton to Kaikōura.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was "mindboggling" that women had never competed at the nationals before.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super excited - the boys have got to watch out this year."</p>
