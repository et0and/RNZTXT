            <p>Heroin has been found in a white powder that was sold as ketamine in the Auckland region.</p>
        
            <p>Drug Information and Alerts Aotearoa New Zealand (DIANZ) posted an alert on its High Alert website over the weekend, warning that people who consumed the powder, thinking it was ketamine, were at high risk of experiencing serious harm, including death.</p>
        
            <p>"It is believed this powder is present in Auckland and possibly other regions. The concern is that this substance may continue to be sold as ketamine," the alert read.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to never assume that what you have is the same as what you are being told it is. Misrepresentation can occur anywhere along the supply chain."</p>
        
            <p>A sample of the substance had been brought into a drug checking clinic in Auckland. Preliminary testing by the New Zealand Drug Foundation indicated the presence of heroin and no ketamine, according to the alert.</p>
        
            <p>Further analysis will be conducted by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research to confirm the contents of the powder.</p>
        
            <p>"High Alert urges extreme caution should you choose to take white powders and testing is recommended to help minimise the risk. Drug checking services can identify when a substance isn't what it's been sold as - it's free, legal and confidential."</p>
        
            <p>The alert continued: "If you, or someone you know, take this substance and start to lose consciousness or breathe slowly, call 111 immediately. Tell them what you think has been taken and that it could be an opioid overdose. Naloxone can be used to help reverse an overdose."</p>
