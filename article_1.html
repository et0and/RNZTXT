            <p>A heavy dump of snow on the South Island has shut schools, closed roads and cut off power to several thousand people.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy snow warnings remain in place until midday today for Otago and 3pm for Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>There are reports some areas of Otago already have around 15 centimetres of snow.</p>
        
            <p>Crews have been working to reconnect properties which lost power around central Otago overnight and this morning, and about half have had their electricity restored.</p>
        
            <p>Access to MƒÅniototo is cut off and a number of state highways are closed.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency is warning people to take caution on roads across the Central Otago area due to the snow and icy conditions.</p>
