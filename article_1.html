            <p>Two members of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign staff had a "verbal and physical altercation" with an Arlington National Cemetery official during a visit by Trump this week, NPR reported on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Trump on Monday participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery honouring the 13 service members killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Later in Detroit, Trump blamed Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival for the White House, and President Joe Biden for what he termed a "catastrophic" withdrawal.</p>

            <p>Citing an unnamed source, NPR reported that when a cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staffers from filming and photographing in an area where service members are buried, the Trump staff "verbally abused and pushed the official aside".</p>
        
            <p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung disputed the report. "There was no physical altercation as described and we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made," Cheung said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony."</p>
        
            <p>Arlington National Cemetery confirmed in a statement that an incident had occurred and that a report was filed.</p>
        
            <p>"Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign," the cemetery said.</p>
        
            <p>It did not respond to requests for a copy of the report or an explanation of why the Trump campaign was allowed to visit the cemetery as part of his campaign.</p>
