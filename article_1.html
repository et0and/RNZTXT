        <h2>'This is my last Olympics': emotional Ko after Games win</h2>
        <p>
"I tried really hard to not cry too much on world-wide television," the Kiwi golfer says about being presented with her gold medal.

            <p>Kiwi golfer Lydia Ko has played her last Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Ko completed her set of Olympic medals with a gold in Paris on Sunday, adding to the silver she won in Rio and the bronze in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>And that is enough for the 27-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>"I said earlier in the week that I didn't know if this would be my last Olympics. I can tell you now, this is my last Olympics," Ko said after her victory at Le Golf National.</p>
        
            <p>To have achieved that feat seemed to present Ko with some relief.</p>

            <p>"Being tied for the lead going into today, I knew that the next 18 holes was going to be some of the most important 18 holes of my life."</p>
        
            <p>And it had its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>She started the day in a share of the lead, mixed a couple of great saves and some fine putts in the front nine to stretch her lead out to five shots.</p>
        
            <p>That soon shrunk as she double bogeyed the 13th and the field closed to within one.</p>
        
            <p>Cool and calm, she maintained that lead before birdying the last to seal a two-shot victory.</p>
        
            <p>Ko took a page out of US gymnast Simone Biles' story as she prepared to play the last couple of rounds in her Olympic career.</p>
        
            <p>"I kept telling myself I get to write my own ending - and it's a quote that Simone Biles said.</p>
        
            <p>"So I kept telling myself that, and I wanted to be the one that was going to control my fate and the ending to this week and to have ended this way is honestly a dream come true."</p>
        
            <p>The feat also means Ko has gained enough qualifying points to be eligible to join World Golf's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>"It was never a goal of mine, but when that chance came I felt it was something I had to make a move towards and for it to happen after winning the gold medal, it's unbelievable."</p>
        
            <p>Ko also shed a tear standing on the podium listening to the national anthem.</p>
        
            <p>"I got to listen to the Korean national anthem in Rio and the American national anthem in Tokyo and I was emotional then.</p>
        
            <p>"So I knew I was probably going to be an emotional wreck listening to ours, so I tried really hard to not cry too much on world-wide television."</p>
        
            <p>Ko now heads off to Britain for a couple of tournaments including the British Open, so retirement hasn't been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"I have great days and I want to play as long as I can, and then I have days where I wake up with a sore back [and] I think I can't make it any more, so I don't think there is a specific date.</p>
        
            <p>"Now that I've got into the Hall of Fame I don't know if that affects anything, but for now I just want to enjoy this moment."</p>
