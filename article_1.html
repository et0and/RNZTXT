        <h2>New coffee contract for Tauranga City Council will cost $94,000 each year</h2>
        <p>
Tauranga Mayor says the focus should be on 'big issues', not coffee costs. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Is it a bad brew at Tauranga City Council or a fair staff perk?</p>
        
            <p>It's been revealed the council's got a five-year contract for coffee machines and coffee supplies at the cost of $470,000, about $94,000 a year.</p>
        
            <p>Criticism from some ratepayers has been scorching, but is it better for productivity to have onsite brew and not just the instant stuff?</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Mayor Mahe Drysdale told Checkpoint the costs needed to be put into perspective.</p>
        
            <p>The council had over 1000 staff so the coffee worked out to be about 65 cents a cup, compared with 35 cents using instant, Drysdale said.</p>
        
            <p>"While $94,000 may seem like a big number in most people's budgets, we've just put out our annual plan today where we propose to spend and invest $1.1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>"Look my focus is not on this, this is such a small decision."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said the decision to spend $94,000 a year on coffee "did not come over the desk of elected members.</p>
        
            <p>"Look there are perks for every employee and, you know, that's really an operational matter, it's not something we see as councillors."</p>

            <p>He added it was more important to focus on the "the big issues."</p>
        
            <p>"We've gone out for consultation on our annual plan and local waters has done well, both of those have a huge impact on how our city runs in the future, and that's what we want to hear about.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're gonna get nitpicky and, you know, talk about $94,000, as I say, those are decisions that don't even come over our desk.</p>
        
            <p>"In the context of council it is a minor expense, and as I say, I'm not focusing my time on that as I have way bigger issues to solve."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said the Tauranga council spent about $120 million a year in staff personal expenses and perks.</p>
        
            <p>He said staff also got a bus card, but did not mention any other perks.</p>
