            <p>The government is cracking down on waitlists for driver's licences by scaling back the eligibility for free test re-sits.</p>
        
            <p>It reverses a decision made by the previous government last year, which replaced re-sit fees for theory and practical tests with an upfront all-inclusive fee. It was hoped those changes would save drivers $86 each on average.</p>
        
            <p>But Transport Minister Simeon Brown said it had led to "unacceptable" wait times and no-shows, and an increase in failure rates.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said in some parts of the country, applicants were waiting more than 60 days to sit their tests, up from an average 13 days in the three months prior to the previous government's changes.</p>
        
            <p>From 8 July, applicants for Class 1 theory and practical tests will only be eligible for one free re-sit, and will be required to pay for any additional tests, while overseas licence conversions will no longer be eligible for free re-sits.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government has sought to take a balanced approach to this issue by limiting the number of free re-sits to get these wait times under control," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes will reduce no-shows and incentivise driver licence applicants to prepare and pass their tests, reducing the driver licence backlog, while continuing to ensure that Class 1 applicants remain eligible for a free re-sit."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Transport spokesperson Tangi Utikere said it would impose another cost on motorists, in addition to the reversal of the Clean Car Discount and a planned 12-cents per litre increase to fuel excise from 2027.</p>
        
            <p>He said the removal of re-sit fees also removed barriers for people who may have struggled to get a license, including to get into employment.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everyone is able to get their license on the first go. But this is going to penalise those who want to make a real go of it and do the right thing," Utikere said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that for many people, getting a drivers license is also a pathway to employment, and so that's going to be another deterrent, and disappointing for many."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said NZTA would also address the backlog by recruiting more driver testing officers, and increasing the number of courses to train them up.</p>
        
            <p>Available hours for theory and practical tests would also be expanded, and text alerts would be introduced to remind people their test is coming.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a three-month transition period for drivers who have already paid the up-front application fee to progress through their current licence stage.</p>
