        <h2>Global tech crash opened like a Hollywood disaster film. So how does it end?</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - Friday felt frighteningly similar to the 12-minute mark in a disaster movie. The difference is that in the movie, a villain is pulling the strings, rather than an IT stuff-up.

            <p>Analysis - Friday afternoon felt a lot like the 12-minute mark in a disaster movie.</p>
        
            <p>Choked airports, crashed payment systems, news anchors improvising, and the sudden ubiquity of Microsoft's now famous blue screen of death, with its strangely ominous sad face.</p>
        
            <p>The difference of course is that in the movie, there's a villain pulling the strings - a hostile foreign power, a money-hungry cyber gang, or even a fanatical cult, intent on bringing entire nations to their knees.</p>
        
            <p>In the version we witnessed yesterday, the culprit was in some ways more dangerous; it was our own systems.</p>
        
            <p>Cyber security experts all over the world are still scrambling to understand what caused the largest outage in history.</p>
        
            <p>It may be weeks or even months before we have the full picture, but what's certain is that two separate systems - Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, and a software update from cyber security company CrowdStrike - malfunctioned on the same day.</p>
        
            <p>CrowdStrike has since apologised and taken a large measure of responsibility, saying a software bug in one of its updates triggered the problems for Microsoft too.</p>
        
            <p>Both are thoroughly woven into the fabric of the world's digital ecosystem.</p>

            <p>CrowdStrike has an almost 18 percent share of the global market for anti-virus protection, while Microsoft's Azure enjoys a 25 percent share of that cloud services market.</p>
        
            <p>Felling two giants like that had a catastrophic effect, and the resemblance to the long-running nightmares of governments and movie fans alike was uncanny.</p>
        
            <p>As the crisis was unfolding, UNSW's sober-minded and well-respected cyber security expert, Professor Richard Buckland, named it as such on national TV.</p>
        
            <p>"It is playing out how an attack would play out," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"We could be getting a taste now, even if it is just a dress rehearsal for what a cyber warfare or cyber terror attack would look like."</p>
        
            <p>If yesterday was an inadvertent dress rehearsal for anything more sinister that may come down the line, the obvious question is: how did we go?</p>
        
            <p>Using Hollywood as a benchmark, not appallingly. Flights were cancelled, but none dropped from the sky, and at the time of writing, not a single government has fallen.</p>

            <p>But life doesn't always imitate art.</p>
        
            <p>And cyber security experts are emerging from the past 24 hours more worried, not less.</p>
        
            <p>"The key to resilience is not in predicting the future, but in being prepared to adapt," Shane Ripley, chief information security officer at cyber security firm Recorded Future said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yesterday was a clear indication that the collective 'we' is certainly not ready to adapt".</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, we may have sleepwalked into what Dr Ripley calls a "shadow risk" as great as those that dominate our nightmares and screenplays.</p>
        
            <p>That risk, he argued, is the over-reliance of the world's critical systems on a shrinking pool of service providers.</p>
        
            <p>Put simply, there are too many of us using too few of the same tech companies - all in the name of cost-saving and convenience.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a cost to that convenience and we all paid that yesterday," Dr Ripley said.</p>
        
            <p>Many in the cyber security field, including Professor Buckland, are now questioning whether it's even been a wise trade.</p>
        
            <p>"It gives us all of the benefits of using this great software from [these] companies but it is a risk," Professor Buckland said.</p>
        
            <p>"With airlines using it, banks using it, we do have to think: what other risks are we accepting as well as the benefits?"</p>
        
            <p>If we want to stop short of the 13th minute in every single disaster film, we might have to change.</p>
        
            <p>"Better legislation and guidance is needed â€¦ the smallest deed is better than the greatest intention," Dr Ripley said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need action, not ideas, to stop this re-occurring."</p>
