            <p>England's Luke Humphries fought back to end the fairytale run of 16-year-old Luke Littler and become world darts champion for the first time at a raucous Alexandra Palace on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Littler, whose staggering progress to the final has captured the imagination of the British public, was one dart away from a 5-2 lead in the best-of-13 set final.</p>
        
            <p>But the 28-year-old world number one Humphries stormed back with a succession of 180s and clinical checkouts to reel off five successive sets and claim a 7-4 victory.</p>
        
            <p>Humphries sealed victory with a nerveless double eight to claim the title and the $1,000,000 winners' cheque.</p>
        
            <p>Littler had been attempting to become the youngest ever world darts champion.</p>
