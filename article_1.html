            <p>An Auckland homeowner says he's lucky to be alive after a car tore through his living room.</p>
        
            <p>The car careened off Don Buck Road in Massey at 4:20am Thursday, flying through the living room of one house before smashing into the bedroom of another.</p>

            <p>"At 4am, I heard a big noise... And I saw outside, the car was there and my living room was gone," Tsubasa, who had lived in the area for two years, said.</p>
        
            <p>As he spoke to contractors and organised repairs, Police were still searching for the driver who abandoned the car and fled the scene on foot.</p>

            <p>"[The police] told me the driver's run away, and they're still chasing them," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>The car had been removed but black skidmarks and a stray hubcap remained, tracing a path of destruction through the two properties and their shared driveway.</p>

            <p>"At the moment I'm not sure what to do," Tsubasa admitted with a nervous laugh.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what to think... I'm just surprised. It was lucky I'm still alive."</p>
