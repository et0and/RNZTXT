            <p>Day two of the Paris Olympics is chocka with strong New Zealand contenders in swimming, rugby sevens and sailing.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ will be bringing you live coverage throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>Two of our top swimmers are taking to the pool: Erika Fairweather took second place at this year's swimming world championships in Doha in the 200m freestyle, so she is a strong competitor for the heats for the same event at 9pm Sunday (and hopefully the semifinal at 8am Monday).</p>
        
            <p>Also at 9pm Sunday, Wellington swimmer Lewis Clareburt dives in for the heats for the men's 400m individual medley, hoping to make the final which is at 6.30am Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Clareburt swam at the Tokyo games four years ago but didn't place, has two gold and two bronze Commonwealth medals under his belt, and also won the 400m individual medley title at the swimming world champs in February, so is a strong contender.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, Jo Aleh and Molly Meech - both previous Olympic medallists - will sail in the women's 49er FX sailing, beginning at 1.35am Monday, while the Black Ferns women's sevens team plays China at 4am and Canada at 7.30am.</p>
