            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis has added to the criticism of future Deputy Prime Minister David Seymour over his letter of support for Philip Polkinghorne while he was under investigation by police.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Seymour was "ill-advised" to send a letter in support of Polkinghorne while police were investigating his wife's death. Seymour said Luxon did not have all the facts.</p>
        
            <p>Willis sided with Luxon while talking to First Up on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately I agree with the Prime Minister, of course, and I think he's formed a view that it was ill advised for David Seymour to write that letter…</p>
        
            <p>"And in terms of the publicity stunt earlier… I don't even know what it was publicising. We've got a bit of a lack of car parks on Molesworth Street at the moment, but I'm not sure the situation's so desperate that you needed to find a car park on Parliament's steps."</p>
