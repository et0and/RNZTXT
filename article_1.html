        <h2>Lange to Luxon: A timeline of the capital gains tax</h2>
        <p>
For decades, the question over one tax change has been kicked down the road, over and over.
</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon has followed his prime ministerial predecessors Jacinda Ardern and Chris Hipkins in ruling out ever introducing a capital gains tax (CGT) while in charge.</p>
        
            <p>The commitment - unsurprising given National's long opposition to a CGT - is just the latest development in one of the country's perennial political debates.</p>
        
            <p>Late 1980s - As part of its radical overhaul of the tax system, the Labour government, under David Lange, begins working up a blueprint for a comprehensive CGT. Work on the proposal pauses in the lead up to the 1990 election and is scrapped following Labour's defeat.</p>
        
            <p>2001 - The Labour-led government, under Helen Clark, commissions an independent review of the tax system. It recommends against taxing capital gains at the point of sale and proposes another model.</p>
        
            <p>2009 - The National-led government, under John Key, sets up a tax working group to review the tax system. Its final report floats the possibility of a comprehensive CGT, but notes "practical challenges" and "potential distortions".</p>
        
            <p>2010 - Key rules out introducing a CGT or land tax in response to the working group's report.</p>
        
            <p>July 2011 - Labour leader Phil Goff announces a CGT as the centre-piece of his party's tax policy for the election.</p>
        
            <p>November 2011 - Goff gets tripped up over economic costings during a town hall debate with Key in Christchurch. It prompts Key's catch-cry: "show me the money!" Labour subsequently loses the election.</p>
        
            <p>June 2012 - Key rules out ever introducing a CGT under his leadership.</p>

            <p>January 2014 - Labour leader David Cunliffe confirms the party will stick with its CGT policy.</p>
        
            <p>September 2014 - Cunliffe gets tripped up over the details of his CGT policy during The Press leaders debate with Key in Christchurch. Labour subsequently loses the election.</p>
        
            <p>May 2015 - Under pressure over the hot property market, Key announces a new bright-line test, considered by many to be CGT-lite. Property investors who sell a house within two years of buying it have to pay tax on any capital gain.</p>
        
            <p>May 2016 - Labour announces plan to set up a new working group if elected to review the tax system.</p>
        
            <p>March 2017 - Labour leader Andrew Little rules out making any tax changes, including introducing a CGT, after the election</p>
        
            <p>August 2017 - Little resigns as Labour leader. Jacinda Ardern takes over. Ardern reopens the debate, saying she reserves the right to act on the Tax Working Group's advice.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>September 2017 - Panicked by the polls and pushback, Ardern performs a U-turn, reverting to Little's position. She says Labour will consider the Tax Working Group's advice, but won't make any changes until after the 2020 election.</p>
        
            <p>November 2017 - The Labour-NZ First coalition, under Ardern, announces the Tax Working Group will be chaired by former finance minister Sir Michael Cullen.</p>
        
            <p>March 2018 - The Labour-NZ First coalition extends the bright-line test to five years.</p>
        
            <p>February 2019 - The Tax Working Group delivers its final report, recommending a broad extension of taxing capital gains. Labour says it will take a "measured approach" as it considers its response.</p>
        
            <p>April 2019 - Ardern rules out ever implementing a CGT while she is prime minister, saying the public had made its view clear. It comes after NZ First refused support for a CGT during that term.</p>
        
            <p>March 2021 - The Labour government extends the bright-line test to 10 years.</p>

            <p>January 2023 - Ardern announces shock resignation. Chris Hipkins takes over as prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>February 2023 - Hipkins refuses to take a position on a CGT, calling it "inane" to rule anything in or out.</p>
        
            <p>July 2023 - Hipkins rules out introducing CGT: "Under a government I lead there will be no wealth or capital gains tax after the election. End of story."</p>
        
            <p>November 2023 - Following Labour's election defeat in October, Hipkins backtracks on his previous pledge and puts a possible CGT or wealth tax back on the table.</p>
        
            <p>March 2024 - National returns the bright-line test back to its initial two-year timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>November 2024 - Prime Minister Christopher Luxon rules out ever introducing a CGT under his leadership.</p>
