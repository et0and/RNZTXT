            <p>Flight restrictions are in place at Auckland Airport as fog blankets the city following a weekend of dramatic weather.</p>
        
            <p>Flight restrictions were put in place at the airport just before 2am, but as of 6.50am no domestic or international flights had been cancelled or delayed.</p>
        
            <p>International and domestic regional flights are also all operating as normal.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said fog in Auckland could persist for a few hours.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after severe thunderstorms at the weekend caused heavy rain and lightning over much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa was struck by lightning almost 60,000 times.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said a large weather system moved across New Zealand on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>She told Morning Report most of the country would have noticed frequent lightning strikes.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned it was not over yet and the gnarly nor'wester would continue on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It issued an orange heavy rain warning for the headwaters of the Otago lakes and rivers; and an orange strong wind warning for the Canterbury High Country, the Canterbury coast and Plains south of Ashburton, and North Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said changeable weather is to be expected as the southern hemisphere moves into spring.</p>
