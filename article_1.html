            <p>Police searching for a missing Auckland man have found a body.</p>
        
            <p>They believe it to be 60-year-old Ronny Okeke - who has been missing for more than 50 days.</p>
        
            <p>The death is now being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said police were conducting searches in the Kaimai Ranges when they came across the body.</p>
        
            <p>"While searching a section of bush in the Kaimai Ranges, the team have come across a man's body.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene examination has been conducted and the body has now been removed from the site.</p>
        
            <p>"Formal identification procedures still need to be carried out, however based on the information we have gathered to this point in the investigation we believe that this is Ronny."</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said the investigation team has spoken with Okeke's family overnight in Nigeria.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier revealed Okeke had been in an altercation around the time he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>"This is news that no family ever wants to hear, and they are devastated that Ronny will not be coming home.</p>
        
            <p>"A post-mortem is scheduled to take place over the coming days, and this will hopefully assist our team in shedding some light around Ronny's death."</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said police were committed to figuring out the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have previously executed search warrants and spoken with a person of interest in this investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"A forensic examination of Ronny's mobile phone is continuing after it was recovered as part of enquiries in previous weeks."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with further information surrounding Okeke's death was asked to call police, referencing file number 24501/3879.</p>
