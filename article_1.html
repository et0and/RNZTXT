        <p>

            <p>The leaders of the Anglican Church in New Zealand have told their church they support Te Tiriti because it offers hope for the future, a Catholic bishop has reflected that 2024 was a hard year for many, and a Presbyterian reverend says Christmas is a time for thinking about 'home'.</p>
        
            <p>In a Christmas message, the three archbishops who lead the Anglicans in Aotearoa New Zealand and Polynesia say people find hope in standing up for justice and what is right.</p>
        
            <p>Archbishops Don Tamihere, Justin Duckworth and Sione Ulu'ilakepa say there is a "lethal absence of hope" leading to war, genocide, famine and suffering around the world.</p>
        
            <p>At Christmas, Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus, who they believe is the Son of God.</p>
        
            <p>Around a third of New Zealanders said they were Christian in the latest census in 2023, with Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian the largest denominations.</p>

            <p>The Archbishops say the birth of Jesus, like any child, reminds people to think of the future.</p>
        
            <p>"We find hope when we love our neighbour, to stand up for justice and for what is right, and to remind each other that tomorrow is worth fighting for," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We hīkoi to Parliament because we hope. We stand up for Te Tiriti and all that it promises to be, because we hope. We give to our neighbours in their time of need because we hope.</p>
        
            <p>"We speak out against war crimes in the Ukraine, in Gaza, and elsewhere in the world, because we hope. We hope for peace, and for a world where war will be waged no more."</p>
        
            <p>They say they hope for a world where culture and diversity are honoured, human lives are sacred and minorities are protected and uplifted.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Catholic bishop Stephen Lowe also said 2024 had been a hard year for people.</p>
        
            <p>In a message posted to YouTube he said people here and overseas had seen war and conflict, growing problems with climate change, and increases in poverty.</p>
        
            <p>"More and more people seem lost, not knowing where to turn, it almost seems as if hope has been destroyed."</p>
        
            <p>But he said people had hope through the message of God and Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop Lowe said he had been given a cross by a young man in Bethlehem who had come to New Zealand as a Palestinian refugee aged eight or nine, and had returned to run the family's olive wood factory. The two had prayed for peace in the "Holy Land".</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe that should be our prayer as well - for peace as well, for peace in the Holy Land, peace in our world, peace in our nation and peace in our hearts."</p>
        
            <p>The Moderator of the Presbyterian church, the Right Rev Rose Luxford, said Christmas felt like a time for people to "come home" and, for Christians, to reflect on God. In her message to the Church, she said it was a time of renewal and gratitude.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time, we are also very aware that there are many who have no physical or spiritual home to go to. Those who are not welcome at home, where there is 'no room in the inn'.</p>
        
            <p>"We hold them in our prayers and also seek practical ways in which we can help."</p>

            <p>The Anglican bishop of Christchurch has urged his community to pray for peace because there are "too many wars".</p>
        
            <p>In a Christmas message, Peter Carrell says the world is not at peace.</p>
        
            <p>He says he is struck by the name that was given to Jesus was the "Prince of Peace" and yet in 2024 the world seemed consumed by war.</p>
        
            <p>And he urged Christians to pray for peace in Ukraine, the Middle East, Susan and elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>At this time of year, Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus who they believe is the Son of God.</p>
