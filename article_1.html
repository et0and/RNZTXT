            <p>Margins have been the theme of All Blacks coach Scott Robertson's rein so far.</p>
        
            <p>The man touted as the side's saviour has tasted the bitter reality of test rugby, and the moments that can define legacies.</p>
        
            <p>Razor said his biggest lesson from his seven-test tenure to date was "how the little marginal things can make a big difference".</p>
        
            <p>With his next assignment the woeful Wallabies, RNZ looks at the 15 times that a single moment, mistake or 'margin' cost the All Blacks a test against their old enemy from across the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 16-15 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks sharpshooter shanked this late shot to steal victory, after Michael Lynagh put the hosts ahead with less than ten to play.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 19-17 in Brisbane. </p>
        
            <p>A towering Michael Lynagh bomb saw John Timu knock it back into the hands of Bunce, only for the centre to be stripped and ruled to have knocked-on. From the ensuing scrum, wing Paul Carozza sneaked it onto the chalk just inches from the sideline for the match winning try.</p>

            <p>Lost 20-16 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>That tackle. Goldie grasses it in the tackle of George Gregan.</p>
        
            <p>1998 - Xavier Rush - Dropped bomb</p>
        
            <p>Lost 19-14 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>Up by five with just two minutes remaining, Matt Burke sent up a kick which proved too much for Xavier Rush, and he dropped it cold. Just two phases later and George Gregan burst down the blind, finding a flying Burke to score, John Eales converting to clinch the match.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 24-23 in Wellington. </p>
        
            <p>Heartbreak at the Cake Tin. With the crowd begging for the fulltime whistle, Jonathan Kaplan instead blew for a Wallaby penalty after Mark Hammett's wayward lineout throw put Australia in range. Eales needed no second invitation to slot the points.</p>

            <p>Lost 29-26 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>It was eight-on-eight as time ticked past and Wallaby Totai Kefu prevailed, with Ron Cribb slipping off the attempt, as Kefu crashed over to keep the Bledisloe in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 16-14 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>Clinging onto their one-point lead, desperate defence form the All Blacks repelled the Wallaby onslaught - until a stray hand from Leon MacDonald allowed Matt Burke to once again break All Black hearts.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 23-18 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>Time up and needing a try to win, the All Blacks strung together a solid nine phases deep on attack before Mose Tuiali'i burst clear and looked to set up his second five to go in under the bar, only for the chance to slip through Tuitupou's hands in what many believed was an early tackle.</p>

            <p>Lost 20-15 in Melbourne. </p>
        
            <p>Up by 15-6, a yellow card to Carl Hayman for going off his feet then led to tries for Adam Ashley Cooper and Scott Staniforth as Australia took the lead late. Hot on attack and inside the host's 22, McAlister had the ball stripped from his grasp.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 26-24 in Hong Kong.</p>
        
            <p>One of the most maligned mistakes in All Blacks history. Donald became public enemy number one after failing to find touch with his clearance and gifting Australia possession and a late converted James O'Connor try. Fortunately just one year and one World Cup-winning kick later, all was forgiven for Beaver.</p>

            <p>Drew 18-all in Brisbane. </p>
        
            <p>Sometimes even the greatest miss the mark. Five minutes into injury time and with the scores level, Carter had a pop at goal from 30 out pretty much in front, but it sailed wide.</p>
        
            <p>Lost 27-19 in Sydney. </p>
        
            <p>Two of the biggest All Blacks on the field, and it was the smallest in Nic White who waltzed right between the pair to scoot across and seal another famous Wallaby win in Sydney.</p>

            <p>Lost 23-18 in Brisbane. </p>
        
            <p>Needing at least a try to level it up, the All Blacks pressed hard inside the 22 with the siren having sounded, Cane tried to clear the back of a ruck, and lost control.</p>
        
            <p>Drew 16-all in Wellington. </p>
        
            <p>While the finger could also be pointed at Reiko Ioane's failure to properly ground the ball in an attempt to score just before halftime, it was ultimately a poor pass from halfback by Sotutu deep in added time that led to the final turnover and the end of a dramatic 90-minute match.</p>

            <p>The last time Australia tasted success against the All Blacks. Needing to go 80 metres up field in the final thirty seconds, Marika Koroibete put a thunderous hit on Damian McKenzie who in a panic fired it to Barrett. As he attempted to tidy things up, Barrett had the ball ripped away from him by Koroibete.</p>
