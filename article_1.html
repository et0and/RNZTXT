            <p>Five people have been killed in a knife attack at Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre in Sydney's east this afternoon, NSW Police say.</p>
        
            <p>Nine people were stabbed by a man in the centre. Police said some of the victims are in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>One of the victims is a small child.</p>
        
            <p>The offender was shot dead at the scene by a police officer.</p>
        
            <p>NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke said authorities believe the man acted alone and there is no ongoing threat.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Cooke said he did not have further information about the man's identity.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no indication of the offender's motive but police had not ruled anything out.</p>
        
            <p>They said the man was in the shopping centre around 3pm before leaving and then returned around 20 minutes later with a knife.</p>
        
            <p>A police officer, who was nearby, was directed towards the man by witnesses, and she shot him dead after the offender confronted her.</p>
        
            <p>"She confronted the offender, who had moved by this stage to level five, as she continued to walk quickly behind him to catch up with him. He turned to face her, raised a knife," Cooke said.</p>
        
            <p>"She discharged a firearm and that person is now deceased."</p>

            <p>The shopping centre said an operation was underway to evacuate shoppers.</p>
        
            <p>Aerial footage from outside the complex shows a large number of emergency vehicles and personnel.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police could also be seen conducting a search on the roof where the car park is located.</p>
        
            <p>ABC sound engineer Roi Huberman said he was inside a shop when he heard gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>"And suddenly we heard a shot or maybe two shots and we didn't know what to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then the very capable person in the store took us to the back where it can be locked.</p>
        
            <p>"She then locked the store and then she then let us through the back and now we are out."</p>
        
            <p>Shopper Adriana was with her two daughters at a beauty store when they heard gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>"All of a sudden the front doors were closed and in a matter of seconds we heard some gunshots and got sent to the storage room at the back of the shop. There were about 30 or 40 people there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone was screaming, crying, trying to call their relatives. It was an horrific experience.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of screaming and people just screaming 'Get out, get out, get out of the shopping centre'."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
