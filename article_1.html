            <p>Coastguard and police ran a dummy run exercise about finding someone lost in the harbour at night the evening before a man went missing after falling into Wellington harbour from a ferry.</p>
        
            <p>A search has been underway in the harbour today since the man in his 40s fell from the East By West Ferry travelling from the city to Days Bay in Eastbourne early this morning.</p>
        
            <p>He was the only passenger onboard, and was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>Police are appealing for information from the public about the man's identity.</p>
        
            <p>They say anyone with information which may help in identifying the missing man should call police on 105, referencing job number P058830805.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter, the police maritime unit and the coastguard including volunteers, as well as other vessels, have been taking part in the search.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood said just last night there was an exercise practising finding someone lost in Wellington harbour in darkness.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Facebook, Wellington Volunteer Coastguard said members on the Spirit of Wellington and Reremoana teamed up with the Wellington Police Maritime Unit on Lady Elizabeth IV for a night exercise.</p>
        
            <p>"The perfect conditions provided an excellent opportunity to hone our communications and coordination skills. Great teamwork, everyone!"</p>
