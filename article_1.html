            <p>Actor and star of The Brokenwood Mysteries Fern Sutherland has just wrapped her tenth season on the television detective drama.</p>
        
            <p>Sutherland believes it is in part due to the show's enthusiastic and loyal international fan base.</p>
        
            <p>The show has been sold in more than 20 countries, and is particularly popular in French territories.</p>
        
            <p>"It's amazing. No one thought when we first started that we'd still be making the show. Now it's just been a fortuitous series of events that made that happen.</p>

            <p>"But we're the only show, obviously, apart from Shortland Street to have gone on for this long. I don't quite know how or why but it's in large part due to the fact that we have a really enthusiastic overseas audience that have been able to carry us to this point before it started streaming on mainstream as in TV1 here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm finding that New Zealanders are only just starting to kind of pick up on it now."</p>
        
            <p>She started enjoying working on the show about three seasons into the "heightened, fun, frivolous" show.</p>
        
            <p>"It's murder but you don't have to feel too bad about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Guilt-free murder."</p>
        
            <p>After filming 10 seasons, she will spend the next six months in Phuket, Thailand during the show's hiatus, getting her mind and body into a different set: Muay Thai boxing.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm going to go to Thailand but that's mostly because I can't afford to live in this country when I'm unemployed, I don't even know how you can afford to live here when you are employed."</p>
        
            <p>Travelling to Thailand off-and-on for the past five years, Sutherland is drawn to going directly to the source for training. And this time, she's promised her trainer she'll train for a fight.</p>
