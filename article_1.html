            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Elon Musk on Tuesday for failing to properly disclose his ownership of X, then known as Twitter, which allowed him to buy shares of the platform at "artificially low prices."</p>
        
            <p>Before he closed his US$44 billion deal to buy Twitter in October 2022, Musk began to acquire a "significant number" of Twitter shares.</p>
        
            <p>By March 2022, he owned more than 5 percent of the company's common stock and was required to disclose that to the SEC within 10 calendar days. The filing alleged that Musk failed to disclose that information.</p>
        
            <p>Musk and his wealth manager did not disclose the purchases because Twitter's stock price could shoot up as a result, the suit alleged.</p>
        
            <p>In keeping these purchases at low prices, Musk "underpaid Twitter investors by more than $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock during this period," according to the complaint, which was filed in DC federal court.</p>
        
            <p>The SEC has been probing the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive over his acquisition of the social media platform. Last year, he ran into trouble with the commission because he failed to appear for testimony in the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>CNN has reached out to Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, for comment.</p>
