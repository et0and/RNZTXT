            <p>Senior Labour MP Kelvin Davis is calling time on politics, announcing he will quit Parliament effective from Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>Davis was first elected in 2008 and has been a senior figure in the party as deputy leader during the 2017 and 2020 terms.</p>
        
            <p>He was also Minister of Corrections, Children, Māori Education, Māori Crown relations and Tourism.</p>
        
            <p>In the lead-up to the election, Davis indicated he would quit politics if he lost his Te Tai Tokerau seat, saying he would have lost his mandate.</p>
        
            <p>Davis was defeated by Te Pāti Māori in Te Tai Tokerau in October, but stayed on as a list MP.</p>
        
            <p>He said in November ACT's proposal for a referendum on the Treaty of Waitangi had motivated him to stay.</p>
        
            <p>But Davis this week told his caucus his time was up.</p>

            <p>"Having been an MP since 2008, and now that we are no longer in government, it is time to move on to other opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I am proud of what we delivered during my time as Minister of Corrections, Children, Māori Education and particularly as Minister of Māori-Crown Relations.</p>
        
            <p>"Huge progress was made in making the government a better Treaty partner.</p>
        
            <p>"Although that progress is currently under threat with this new government, I leave knowing that our strong Labour team will hold the Coalition government to account."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Peeni Henare told Morning Report he was sad to see his colleague go.</p>
        
            <p>"[He's] somebody who's been a consistent feature of my entire political career, nine years in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been a strong leader for the Māori caucus in particular. And if I think of the times with Prime Minister Ardern, Kelvin was the perfect offsider for her because he provided the kind of stability within the party and was a great representative for our country."</p>
        
            <p>Reflecting on Labour's loss of most of the Māori seats, Henare said it was a "hugely disappointing election".</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear our people wanted change. I do think that there was quite a, an impressive strategy employed by the Māori Party that really mobilized the vote for Māoridom but that doesn't detract from the fact that ... Kelvin did a great job in his service and made clear that without the mandate, he chooses not to continue."</p>
        
            <p>Davis departs for a new yet-to-be-announced job and will step down officially on Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>He will be replaced by the next person on Labour's list, Tracey McLellan.</p>
