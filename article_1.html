            <p>When the owners of an Airbnb got suspicious about a guest, they called police who found loaded firearms and $300,000 worth of drugs and cash at the short-term rental.</p>
        
            <p>Drug dealer Jonathan Clay Spear, 51, has since been sent to prison and police have now gained a High Court order to confiscate nearly $37,000 found at the property.</p>
        
            <p>Spear and his partner rented the rural accommodation at Karapiro in Waikato, a location known for its lake and world-class rowing venue, in November 2021, through the Airbnb website.</p>
        
            <p>While they were staying there, the accommodation owners, who lived nearby, became concerned about visitors coming and going from the property.</p>
        
            <p>They contacted police, who visited to see Spear run out of the house into the garden, where he tried to get rid of a plastic snap lock bag which was later found to contain 506g of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>He also tried to dump $1590 in cash.</p>
        
            <p>Police searched the Airbnb and a vehicle parked outside. They found a black Adidas bag containing $35,087 in cash bundled up in "bricks".</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the meth Spear tried to dump in the garden, they found smaller amounts in the house, along with electronic scales, more snap lock bags and a money counter - all common indicators of drug dealing.</p>
        
            <p>They also found two loaded pistols and several "tick lists" detailing drug deals adding up to $100,000.</p>
        
            <p>In total, police discovered 534g of meth on the property, with a potential street value of $267,000.</p>
        
            <p>Spear later pleaded guilty to breaching prison release conditions, two charges of possessing methamphetamine for supply, two of unlawfully possessing pistols and two of possessing cannabis.</p>
        
            <p>He was sentenced in September 2022 to six years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Police later made inquiries with Inland Revenue and found that between 2016 and 2022, Spears' declared income came from Ministry of Social Development benefits.</p>
        
            <p>They told the High Court this meant he should have had "limited means" - too little to fund his lifestyle and from which to source the $36,677 in his possession at the Karapiro Airbnb.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2023, Spear was interviewed at Hawke's Bay Regional Prison, where he admitted the cash was his but was unwilling to say where it came from.</p>
        
            <p>He did not oppose the police application to forfeit the money under the Proceeds of Crime (Recovery) Act 2009, which aims to separate criminals from their ill-gotten gains.</p>
        
            <p>In the High Court at Hamilton this month, Justice Christian Whata said he accepted that there was a "clear basis" for the $36,677 to be forfeited to the Crown, and issued an order for that to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"More specifically, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the money is tainted property, having been acquired or derived from significant criminal activity, namely the supply of methamphetamine."</p>
