            <p>Also included is former All Black captain Sam Cane, who brought up his 100th test against the Wallabies in Wellington last month, and veteran halfback TJ Perenara.</p>
        
            <p>Both players are heading overseas at the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks' next test is against Japan in Yokohama at the end of the month, followed by tests against England, Ireland, France and Italy in November.</p>
