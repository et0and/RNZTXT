The community came together when a spreadsheet error meant not enough gifts turned up at Naenae School.

            <p>An error in a primary school's Christmas present order meant 220 pupils were set to miss out on their end-of-year gift, but the community has come together in the ultimate display of the Christmas spirit.</p>
        
            <p>The Christmas Shoebox Project was a nationwide initiative to support families living in hardship. Donors provide a gift, that fits in a shoebox, anonymously. They're given to children to take home at the end of the school year.</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt's Naenae Primary School had only a third of its shoebox Christmas presents turn up due to a mistake on the spreadsheet.</p>
        
            <p>Initially when the smaller number showed up, the teachers assumed the rest were still on their way.</p>
        
            <p>With school wrapping up at lunchtime on Tuesday - and no more presents arriving - they realised the mistake.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy principal Kirsten Reid took to the local community Facebook pages late last night.</p>
        
            <p>She told Nine to Noon she was overwhelmed by generosity from the community since.</p>
        
            <p>"People have come far and wide, donated money... and the most incredible gifts. I actually cannot believe the quality of the gifts that our tamariki are going to receive," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in a real predicament yesterday because we knew that only one syndicate had got gifts... initially we thought that syndicate could come tomorrow and get their shoe boxes so other children couldn't see.</p>
        
            <p>"And then this kind of happened - 7.30pm, 8pm last night - and so every child is going to get a gift today."</p>
        
            <p>Reid said some builders had turned up with a ute full of balls, while a constant stream of others in the community - whānau, other schools, companies, and charities - had been "just delivering, delivering, delivering".</p>
        
            <p>Some had even donated money for playground equipment next year. While others had come in to help wrap all the extra presents.</p>
        
            <p>"Our community went through... we've had a lot in the last week, there's been a shooting, we've had increased police presence. And this is just made the end of the year, like picture perfect.</p>
        
            <p>"So whoever's given, we are so grateful and you have made a difference."</p>
