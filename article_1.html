        <h2>Christopher Luxon announces India trip</h2>
        <p>
The stakes are high for Luxon after he promised during a 2023 election debate that he would strike a free trade deal with India in his first term.

            <p>New Zealand will send one of its largest ever prime ministerial delegations to India next week in a concerted charm offensive designed to boost trade and security ties with the fast-growing economic giant.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced the four-day trip to Delhi and Mumbai at his post-Cabinet media briefing on Monday afternoon, departing on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>While there, Luxon will sit down with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and deliver the inaugural address at the Raisina Dialogue, India's premier defence and security dialogue.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told media he was determined to build a much broader relationship with India, the world's most populous country, on track to be the third biggest economy by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>"They are, indeed, one of those multipolar leaders in the world now... it's the fourth largest military spending country," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got a rapidly rising middle class, which creates huge trade opportunities... sadly, only 1.5 percent of our exports are actually going into India, as it currently stands today."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the relationship had been broadly "non-existent" prior to the coalition taking power: "we have had to start from scratch".</p>
        
            <p>Labour trade spokesperson - and former trade minister - Damien O'Connor rejected that his party had neglected the India-relationship and told RNZ that the pandemic had hampered opportunities for travel.</p>
        
            <p>The stakes are high for Luxon after he promised during a 2023 election debate that he would strike a free trade deal with India in his first term.</p>
        
            <p>Formal negotiations have yet to resume and the opposition has called the deadline "completely unrealistic".</p>
        
            <p>Pressed on the pledge, Luxon said he stuck by it, but he described his "real commitment" as one to deepen the trade relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"What I'm looking for is just a much more comprehensive economic partnership and how we can move that forward," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about momentum... you don't just go straight from zero, or even behind, with no relationship with India, to just walking through the front door and saying, you know, I want to have a deeper trade relationship."</p>
        
            <p>The dairy sector will be one of the largest obstacles to making progress, as it was during the last rounds of trade talks between 2011 and 2015.</p>
        
            <p>India's dairy industry is dominated by small-scale rural farmers who fear disruption from New Zealand's industrialised producers.</p>
        
            <p>One possibility could be for New Zealand to follow Australia's lead and negotiate an "early harvest" deal without dairy, focused instead on other sectors.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had a different view from the former government which believed it was not worth pursuing a dairy-free deal.</p>
        
            <p>"[Dairy will] be a very difficult part of a conversation, and it'll be hard, it'll be very tough, very difficult. But that's not a reason to shy off, and just say that's a market we turn off, when it's going to be the third biggest economy in the world, very, very shortly. It's just insane to me that you just wouldn't try."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's visit to India also comes against the backdrop of New Zealand unease at China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>China caused some alarm last month when it sent three navy vessels into the Tasman Sea to conduct live-fire exercises.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told media he viewed India as being "very much aligned" with New Zealand's views on security and stability in the region.</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand needed to do a lot more with India as a partner on security and defence.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot more that we can do in a defence joint exercises, visits, a whole bunch of different things that we can do in that space."</p>
        
            <p>While India was likely to resonate with New Zealand's worries about China, there would be less alignment on the war on Ukraine. India has pursued a largely neutral stance and has never criticized Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was sure the conflict was come up in his conversation with Modi where he would make New Zealand's position clear: "No change for us. We stand with Ukraine."</p>
