            <p>Negotiations to form the new government are back in full swing, with the leaders of National and New Zealand First set to meet in-person again shortly.</p>
        
            <p>The possibility of another three-way meeting is on the cards, with National leader Christopher Luxon saying a deal is down to the very last stages.</p>
        
            <p>"We're getting closer and closer to getting an outcome where we can have a coalition government that is strong and stable and can take New Zealand forward," he told media waiting outside the hotel where he is holding more talks with New Zealand First leader Winston Peters this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by one journalist about the "final stages" of talks seeming to be lasting several days, Luxon responded that it would take as long as it needed to and the leaders needed to "bottom out" the last couple of issues.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to work our way through it."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said negotiations had not just centred on face-to-face meetings - there had been a lot of phone calls between the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>He had spoken to both Seymour and Peters by phone this morning as well as members of his caucus and the National Party's board.</p>
        
            <p>"Things are moving and that's why we want to close it out with a meeting."</p>
        
            <p>He said once a deal had been secured, it would be formally announced in Wellington.</p>

            <p>ACT leader David Seymour and Peters have already met face-to-face this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Peters confirmed to media the meeting had taken place, when he arrived at the hotel at midday.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "an urgent matter" to try and make progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been working seriously hard on it ..."</p>
        
            <p>He refused to provide any details on his talks with Seymour this morning, except to say: 'We're out to get to a conclusion as soon as we can."</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday Luxon said the cost of holding talks in Auckland to form a new government was the price of democracy.</p>
        
            <p>Today marks the fifth day of discussions between National, New Zealand First and ACT being held at hotels in the city as the country waits to see the shape of its new government.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was comfortable with taxpayers footing the bill (via Parliamentary Services), saying aside from the get-togethers being part of the democratic process the leaders of all three parties lived in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He said the parties were trying to get a deal done as quickly as possible.</p>
