            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens have swept the 2024 New Zealand Rugby Awards picking up team and individual accolades.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-year-old Jorja Miller claimed the player of the year title, Black Ferns Sevens coach Cory Sweeney was named coach of the year and the Olympic champion Black Ferns Sevens were recognised as team of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Miller is the second-youngest recipient of the player of the year gong in its 30-year history (behind Jonah Lomu), another piece of history for the Timaru-native, after becoming New Zealand's youngest female gold medallist at the Paris Olympics earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Sweeney has now won coach of the year five times, equalling the record held by Sir Steve Hansen.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues almost made a clean sweep of the awards they were nominated for, picking up both national men's and women's titles, Hoskins Sotutu and Katelyn Vahaakolo winning the Super Rugby Pacific and Super Rugby Aupiki player of the year awards and Vern Cotter taking home the national men's coach of the year.</p>
