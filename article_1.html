            <p>Troubled Interislander ferry Aratere was damaged berthing into Wellington Harbour about 3.30pm on Thursday, Wellington's harbourmaster confirmed to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>There is a hole in the hull but it is high on the ship, and no injuries are reported.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said in a statement that while docking in strong winds, the ferry made contact with the link span, the dock ramp which allowed vehicles to access the vessel.</p>
        
            <p>There was some damage to the link span and the hull of the ship.</p>

            <p>There were 106 passengers and 40 crew on board, KiwiRail said.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the ship told RNZ there seemed to be a problem berthing this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They said passengers were being fed hot chips, tea and coffee and were now being allowed to leave the ferry.</p>
        
            <p>They said cars are now disembarking.</p>
        
            <p>The 4.30pm sailing from Wellington has been cancelled.</p>

            <p>The Interislander ferry ran aground on 21 June just north of Picton while on a freight-only sailing.</p>
        
            <p>It only returned to passenger service at the end of July.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander's three ferries were all built in the 1990s and have been hit by mechanical problems in recent years and there has been increased debate about replacing the ships.</p>
        
            <p>In July, ship assessors found the ferries were in better shape than previously thought, and would be fine to sail for five more years.</p>
        
            <p>A similar accident tore a hole in the hull of another Interislander ferry, the Kaiarahi, in November last year.</p>
        
            <p>The government has been criticised for pulling funding to the iReX project, with the maritime union warning the cancellation cost could reach half a billion dollars.</p>
