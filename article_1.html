            <p>Passengers have been seen getting out of vehicles and walking alongside standstill traffic on the Kāpiti Expressway earlier today, as queues and crashes caused chaos around the country.</p>
        
            <p>There were reports on social media of traffic backed up between Ōtaki and Levin with the drive taking 40 minutes on Wednesday - double what it usually would.</p>
        
            <p>Movement was slow heading north into Taihape, with a report of a 3km-line of traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple crashes throughout the country have also added to travel times.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway One south of Sanson has reopened, after being closed for more than an hour due to a campervan crash near Rongotea this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured, but both lanes of SH1 near Rowe Road were closed, and diversions were in place.</p>
        
            <p>And Remutaka Hill has reopened in both directions after a three-vehicle crash that left one car on fire. Three people received minor to moderate injuries.</p>

            <p>A crash on Haywards Hill Road in Wellington, which previously closed the road to eastbound traffic, has since been cleared.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, motorists heading north through Auckland to holiday hotspots face a long, slow drive as the summer exodus gets underway in earnest.</p>
        
            <p>At 2pm, northbound motorway traffic was backed up from the Harbour Bridge to Newmarket, and was slow-moving as far south as the Greenlane interchange.</p>
        
            <p>Those heading south faced slow-moving queues from the junction with State Highway 20 in Manukau almost to Ramarama, at the foot of the Bombay Hills.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the Harbour Bridge was closed for maintenance, which was also causing delays but for southbound traffic only.</p>
        
            <p>North of Auckland, traffic was heavy but mostly flowing.</p>
