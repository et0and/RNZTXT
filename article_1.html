            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters has spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken about a range of topics, including conflicts overseas.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media platform X, Peters said they had discussed the importance of US-New Zealand strategic partnership, strengthening cooperation to address regional and global challenges, the situation in Ukraine, and the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>
        
            <p>It comes a day after New Zealand joined another statement by the US and 10 other countries in reiterating their December call for a halt to attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthis.</p>
        
            <p>Yemen's Houthis have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea since November to show their support for Hamas, prompting major shipping companies to take the longer and costlier route around the Africa's Cape of Good Hope rather than through the Suez Canal.</p>
        
            <p>The Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12 percent of global trade and vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe.</p>

            <p>In November, the US House also approved a nearly US$14.5 billion military aid package for Israel, in response to the war with Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>Blinken had previously said Israel should lower the intensity of its strikes.</p>
        
            <p>On another conflict, the White House recently approved another tranche of US military aid to Ukraine worth about US$250 million (NZ$401m).</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has said he reiterated New Zealand's support for Ukraine to President Volodymyr Zelensky. In May, former prime minister Chris Hipkins announced increased military, humanitarian, legal and economic support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>In December, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon signalled the government was exploring Pillar Two of AUKUS - a security partnership for the Indo-Pacific region between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>The deal progressed as the US Congress authorised the sale of nuclear submarines to another country, Australia, for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>While New Zealand's non-nuclear status is non-negotiable, Pillar Two is about sharing technology, and Luxon told reporters at a conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that he was exploring it.</p>
