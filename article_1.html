            <p>Police are searching a section of beach north of Napier in relation to the disappearance of Gisborne man Joseph Ahuriri during Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Ahuriri was last seen with his white Toyota Hilux at the Waitomo petrol station in Bay View, just north of Napier, early on 14 February last year.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been investigating ever since, and began searching near the Esk River mouth on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>There was a cordon in place near the river mouth, and excavators could be seen digging up the beach, 1News reported.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are making enquiries in the Esk River area as part of an ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Joseph Ahuriri," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Search activity will continue in the area tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Late last year, police and GNS Science searched the Eskdale area with a magnometer drone system - which can identify large metallic objects buried underground.</p>
        
            <p>GNS was reviewing the results, and police had been expecting those results by mid-March.</p>
        
            <p>Ahuriri, a father of eight, had been trying to head back to Gisborne from Napier, but his family previously said they feared his ute was washed away by the floodwaters.</p>
        
            <p>It was also feared Ahuriri, who had links to the Gisborne-based chapter of Black Power NZ, had been targeted due to his gang links.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, police searched Whakatu, Clive, Esk Valley, the Napier-Taup≈ç road, State Highway 5 and State Highway 2 for the missing 40-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>Police divers and personnel from the Navy's dive and hydrographic unit, HMNZS Matataua, also searched the coastline near Esk River.</p>
