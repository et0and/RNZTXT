            <p>Due to the time difference, day four begins on Tuesday evening NZT and finishes on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Here's who to look out for. All times are in NZT.</p>

            <p>The Dunedin swimmer just missed out on the bronze in the 400m freestyle on day one - can she go one better this time?</p>

            <p>McCullough makes his Olympic debut today, joining Tokyo bronze-medal winner Wilde in the individual men's race.</p>
        
            <p>Wilde has four World Series victories, is consistently at the top of the world rankings and is one of Team NZ's strongest medal contenders.</p>
        
            <p>He has focused his entire 2024 season on winning gold in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>However, poor water quality in the Seine River has cast doubt on whether the swimming leg will even go ahead, and organisers have set aside 2 August as a contingency day for the individual races and 6 August for the mixed relay in case water quality levels do not improve in time.</p>
