            <p>A man was shot at a mall in Sydney on Saturday following reports of multiple people stabbed, police in the city said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Westfield Bondi Junction just before 4pm (local time) following the reports, New South Wales Police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"People are urged to avoid the area," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"Inquiries are continuing in relation to the incident and there are no further details."</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people were evacuated from the shopping centre after the incident, news site news.com.au reported.</p>
        
            <p>State broadcaster ABC reported some people remained trapped inside.</p>
        
            <p>Two witnesses told Reuters they heard shots fired.</p>
        
            <p>"Even 20 minutes after people were rushed out of the mall, I saw SWAT teams of people sweeping the surrounding streets," one of the witnesses said.</p>
        
            <p>One witness said they saw a woman lying on the ground and took shelter in a jewellery store.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales state police said a police operation was underway but did not provide further details.</p>
        
            <p>Several posts on social media showed crowds fleeing the mall and police cars and emergency services rushing to the area.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
