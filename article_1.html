            <p>Mangawhai residents have been left in shock after a tornado tore through the Northland community at about 3am this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The damaged caused cut power to almost 5000 homes overnight, and about 1000 are still without an electricity supply.</p>
        
            <p>Two people have been taken to hospital in a serious condition, one was airlifted to Auckland hospital while the other was driven to North Shore hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Mangawhai resident Matthew Taylor said Mangawhai was pulling together.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been various people offering accommodation, food, coffees, whatnot, from various other places.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a lot of messages ourselves come through.</p>
        
            <p>"And yeah, I think just small towns, they sort of all get together when things like this happen, which is really cool.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Mangawhai will be back to normal pretty soon."</p>
