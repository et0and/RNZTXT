            <p>Chumbawamba have reportedly issued Peters a cease-and-desist notice after he used their song 'Tubthumping' ahead of a speech he delivered at the weekend in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>He went on to paraphrase the song, telling supporters: "We got knocked down, but we got up again - and nothing is going to stop us now."</p>
        
            <p>The band told The Spinoff they did not authorise Peters' use of the song, and had asked their record label to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>Peters has been contacted for a response.</p>
