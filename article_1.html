        <h2>Run-in with an iron doesn't stop Kiwi at Melbourne Cup fashion comp</h2>
        <p>
A Gisborne financial analyst has scooped a top prize at Australasian racing's fanciest fashion event.

            <p>A nasty run-in with an iron hasn't stopped a Kiwi from flying high in the prestigious Melbourne Cup Fashion on the Field event.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne financial analyst and farmer Laura Williams is riding high after coming second in the Best Suited category, despite accidentally burning her Brat-green trousers while ironing them before the contest.</p>
        
            <p>"The iron had a surge and burned a big mark, jet-black and the size of a fist, right on the front of one of the legs," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband Jack ran to a nearby art supplies store and the couple painted as best they could over the stain. Then, when on the catwalk in front of VIP judges including model-actress Elizabeth Hurley and her model son Damien, Williams did her best to distract them from the hasty repair job.</p>
        
            <p>"I was winking and trying to pop my collar and doing everything I could to keep their eyes above the stain. I guess they liked my confidence."</p>

            <p>Williams, who was pre-selected as an international digital finalist for the contest, was already battling a foot injury before heading to Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"It was such a hectic day, I'd already started with a bit of a disaster because of my foot."</p>
        
            <p>While her distinctive circular hat, shoes and handbag will get another outing some day, Williams said her suit, which was custom-made by "very talented" Gisborne dressmaker Helen May, had probably run its last race.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be able to wear the blazer again, but I think the suit will have to be retired from outside wear. I might just have to hang on to the memory."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Kiwi competitor, Waikato florist Claudia Campbell, won third place in the Best Dressed section, which her younger sister Eleanor won in 2023.</p>
