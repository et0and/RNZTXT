            <p>Wairoa locals had been doubly affected by flooding as well as the deaths of three boaties and its effects would linger, Napier MP Katie Nimon said.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 200 homes were damaged by flooding after heavy rains and three fishermen died at sea during this week's storm.</p>
        
            <p>Nimon said locals were working hard to help each other even while many have damage in their own homes to address.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been awesome to see the community band together and help each other out."</p>
        
            <p>She would discuss with the Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey, what resources were available to support people's wellbeing, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell has already announced the government would contribute $300,000 to the Mayoral Relief Funds to help communities in Hastings, Wairoa and Tai Rāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>He would be going to appeal to Cabinet next week for extra funding to support the town's clean up and recovery.</p>

            <p>Nimon said the government was working with insurers and local council to understand the best way to assist people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important for us to see what's going to be covered by insurance, what's not.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers are working really hard to take a paper to Cabinet to get what we can to get the clean-up started, so council knows what can be done without having to worry about where it falls," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, roading contractors and damage assessors are working through Matariki weekend after severe flooding in Hawke's Bay and Tai Rāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency was in place for the settlement of Haumoana from Tuesday to Thursday, as high seas pounded the coastline and dozens of people were evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said there had been damage in the area which remained vulnerable after Cyclone Gabrielle 18 months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a lot of slips so everyone's working really hard, some of the work will be programmed for later on but looking after the immediate over the weekend."</p>
        
            <p>On the region's roads, Thursday's slip that partially blocked one lane of State Highway two between Gisborne and Napier has been cleared, and the road is open.</p>
