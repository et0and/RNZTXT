            <p>Heavy rain watches have been put in place for the northern half of the North Island from Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has warned of heavy rain with possible downpours and thunderstorms. The forecaster said some falls could be above normal warning levels.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings stretched from Northland to Auckland, Coromandel and down to Waitomo and Taupō. The warnings were from 5am to 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>Across the Bay of Plenty, MetService warned of the same from 8am Saturday until 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, there were low risks of thunderstorms on Friday in Northland, Auckland, Coromandel, Waikato, northern Waitomo, Stewart Island, Fiordland, southern Westland, eastern Bay of Plenty and northern Tai Rāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>"As the front passes over northern Otago and South Canterbury this afternoon and evening there is a low risk of thunderstorms for these regions."</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the upper North Island was hit by heavy rain overnight, especially in Auckland, Waikato and rural South Auckland. Waiuku, south of Auckland, received about 30mm of rain overnight.</p>
        
            <p>By Sunday the worst should have eased, with just showers left. By Monday, the risk of severe weather would be "minimal".</p>
        
            <p>There were no heavy swell or road snowfall warnings in place as of Friday morning.</p>
