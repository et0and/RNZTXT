            <p>Emergency crews in Auckland are battling a blaze at City Garden Lodge in the central suburb of Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>Images showed flames leaping high from the second floor through the roof, but an RNZ reporter at the scene said by 6:15pm the fire appeared more controlled.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ said people had been evacuated from the building, but could not say how many.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have yet been reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police say one person was arrested after they were called to a "disorder" at City Garden Lodge, in St George's Bay Road, just after 4.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>There are ten trucks working to bring the structure fire under control.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ is asking the public to avoid the area.</p>
