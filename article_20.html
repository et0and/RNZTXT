            <p>"It's just something that's always been a part of who I am and what I do, and it was very clear to me after I finished my piano studies in Canterbury that the collaborative path was the one I was most interested in pursuing... that's what took me overseas to [the Julliard School in] New York to study a Masters and a Doctorate of Music."</p>
        
            <p>"I can't imagine my life without that aspect. Music is to be shared, and the most enjoyment I've always received has been making music with other people."</p>
