            <p>Hannah Neman is Orchestra Wellington's Marketing & Engagement Manager. She talks with RNZ Concert's Bryan Crump about what her job involves.</p>
        
            <p>"Our normal home for six concerts a year is the Michael Fowler Centre - that's our subscription series concerts."</p>
        
            <p>"But the majority of what we do throughout the year is actually out in the community. And so that's the reason that we've set up the role that I'm in now, which is marketing and engagement... to highlight the fact that most of what we do is outside of the concert hall."</p>
        
            <p>"We make an effort to get in to all of [the Greater Wellington] communities and find ways of tailoring what we do in those spaces to add maximum value for those communities."</p>
