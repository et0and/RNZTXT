            <p>Prepare to close out Te Marama Puoro o Aotearoa (New Zealand Music Month) in style - the 2024 Aotearoa Music Awards are almost here. Here's everything you can expect on the night.</p>
        
            <p>The clue is in the name: the Aotearoa Music Awards (AMA) is an annual showcase event for the music industry, celebrating the artists and music of Aotearoa. The awards are organised by Recorded Music NZ and have been presented annually since 1965.</p>
        
            <p>The awards recognise the biggest musical successes of the year, promote emerging artists and highlight the mahi of those who work behind-the-scenes.</p>
        
            <p>The acronym AMA should rhyme with drama or llama - it's also the same as the te reo Māori word 'ama', which is the outrigger of a waka (canoe).</p>
        
            <p>Some of the biggest names in New Zealand music will be gracing the red carpet this year.</p>
        
            <p>Artists Stan Walker, Aaradhna, Marlon Williams, Home Brew, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, L.A.B, and The Beths are some of the finalists who will be there. Broadcasters Kara Rickard and Jesse Mulligan will be hosting the awards ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Many sports stars, politicians and media personalities have been known to attend the awards too. Past AMA attendees include the likes of MMA fighter Israel Adesanya and former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>There are no tickets available to the general public for this event - but you can still view the full ceremony online.</p>
        
            <p>The Aotearoa Music Awards will be livestreamed via RNZ and available on rnz.co.nz and the RNZ Music YouTube and Facebook channels.</p>
        
            <p>The broadcast will begin at 6pm on Thursday, 30 May - live from Viaduct Events Centre, Auckland.</p>

            <p>There's no shortage of musical talent in Aotearoa, from household names like Stan Walker and Marlon Williams, to stars on the rise like Jordyn with a Why. The likes of teo glacier (RnB), Amamelia (electronic), Kaylee Bell (country), and Coterie (roots) continue reflect the strength and diversity of New Zealand's musical landscape.</p>

            <p>Album and Single of the Year, Best Group and Best Solo Artist are judged by the AMA Judging Academy, which is made up of a wide-ranging group of more than 300 artists and industry practitioners.</p>
        
            <p>Smaller specialist panels vote on genre, artisan, and the best Māori and Mana Reo categories. Breakthrough and other winners have been selected by an in-person panel, and the Radio Airplay and Highest Selling awards are determined by data.</p>
        
            <p>AMA award winners receive the honour of holding a handmade Tūī trophy (this year, made of totara) and the title of AMA award winner.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the Breakthrough Artist award is being presented by Radio BurgerFuel and the winner will receive free BurgerFuel for the rest of 2024.</p>
