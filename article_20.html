            <p>Prepare to be swept away by the heartfelt melodies of Novak’s dramatic one-movement ballade, written when he was simultaneously gazing back in time to traditional Czech folk melodies, yet also looking ahead to tonal modernism. Swiss-American composer Ernest Bloch’s evocative Three Nocturnes showcase his Jewish heritage with staggering impressionistic beauty, before Frank Martin takes us on a rambunctious journey through popular Irish melodies that will be sure to awaken your inner dancer. We return to the sounds of Aotearoa with an exciting new work by celebrated NZ composer Ross Harris, before we embark upon the joy and nostalgia of Dvorak’s famous “Dumky” Trio, overflowing with a wealth of village songs and Czech country dances. - NZTrio programme notes.</p>
