            <p>You know the phrase "many strings to their bow"?</p>
        
            <p>Tristan Carter is the living embodiment of it.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington violinist, composer and teacher has taken on more projects that most cats have lives.</p>
        
            <p>Just back from a performance at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the UK, Carter spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump about his upcoming gigs with the Moth String Quartet, of which he is a member along with Kiwi composer Salina Fisher.</p>
        
            <p>One this Saturday 28 September is with another composer, Briar Prastiti, to help launch her album  Twinn Ethyr, followed by a Moth-only event on 3 October at The Pyramid Club, Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The quartet released an album, scree scrub mountain sky, earlier this year. The Moths recorded it in a yurt in Ohakune, as a musical response to the wilds of Tongariro National Park.</p>
        
            <p>But that's not the half of it. Carter is also part of the anarchic big jazz band, The Troubles, an Indian/Jazz crossover enterprise, Shades of Shakti, and the Balkan band Bazurka.</p>
        
            <p>His recent trip to Edinburgh was part of an ongoing collaboration with the Java Dance Theatre, directed by Sacha Copland. It was his third trip to the Fringe Festival.</p>
        
            <p>And did we mention when he's not performing, Carter teaches Wellington schoolkids the basics of being in a rock and roll band?</p>
        
            <p>For a violinist of variety, Tristan Carter's career is only just getting started.</p>
