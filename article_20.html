            <p>Her time at The Spinoff has seen some eventful stories from her attempt to cycle an Onzo bike from Auckland to Hamilton to her definitive ranking of chip flavours which became one of The Spinoff’s biggest stories. </p>
        
            <p>In 2019 she won two Voyager Media Awards (Opinion Writing/Humour Satire and Best Single News Story/Scoop) and in 2021 she took over as editor.  </p>
        
            <p>Madeleine co-wrote the autobiography of New Zealand professional basketball player Steven Adams, and in 2020 a biography of the then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern.
