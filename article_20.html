        <h2>Illmatic - one of the greatest hip hop albums ever recorded. </h2>

            <p>Released on 19 April 1994, Nas' Illmatic is often considered as the greatest LP in hip hop, a sparkling microcosm of the culture itself.</p>

            <p>It marked-out the sights, sounds and stories of street-life within New York's Queensbridge housing projects with the observational insight of an investigative journalist and the literary wordplay of a prodigious poet.</p>
        
            <p>Even more remarkable, Nas was only 20 at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Rounding out proceedings was the inclusion of some of the most respected producers in New York at the peak of their powers.</p>
        
            <p>The ensemble of DJ Premier, Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip and an up-and-comer from Queensbridge named L.E.S. provided the young emcee with music that was both as rigid as a concrete block and as serene as memories of playing with friends in the park.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Nas and DJ Premier marked the 30th anniversary by releasing 'Define my Name' to tease a forthcoming collaborative project later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, New York State Senator Jamaal T. Bailey formally commemorated Illmatic inside the Senate Chamber.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in college, we were finding who we were, Nasir Jones was making the greatest hip hop album of all time, Illmatic.</p>
        
            <p>"1994 was the soundtrack to my youth.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have a top five without Nas in it, you shouldn't listen to rap music Mr President."</p>
        
            <p>Thirty years after the fact, artists and industry leaders in New Zealand have also paid tribute.</p>
        
            <p>Industry veteran Phil Bell aka DJ Sir-Vere was one of the few in the country fortunate enough to hear Illmatic prior to its official release.</p>
        
            <p>It is now considered his favourite hip hop album of all time, followed by the Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die - another transformative debut offering from New York which emerged later that year. </p>
        
            <p>At the time, Bell was presenting the True School Hip Hop Show on 95bFM which he had co-founded a year prior, where he was being constantly fed promotional material by record company representatives.</p>
        
            <p>Nas' name was already familiar to hip hop insiders following showstopping appearances on Main Source's 1991 track 'Live at the Barbecue' and MC Serch's single 'Back to the Grill' a year later.</p>
        
            <p>His debut single 'Halftime' produced by Large Professor had also been out for more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>In early-1994, Bell was given a cassette.</p>

            <p>"I remember vividly because it was a clear cassette with a red label on it and it had 'Nas Illmatic'.</p>
        
            <p>"I only knew Nas from his verse on the MC Serch record and the single had been out.</p>
        
            <p>"But then I got the cassette and I literally couldn't believe what I was hearing."</p>
        
            <p>Bell proceeded to thrash the living daylights out of the cassette to the point where it snapped a couple of weeks before the album was released to the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I was mortified because I'd played it so much in my car," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everywhere I went I was playing this cassette…I've still got it actually and it's still broken.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just astounded by [Illmatic] on all levels, it was just a watershed moment for me."</p>
        
            <p>An avid record collector, Bell revealed he has more than a dozen different pressings of Illmatic from all around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"Hip hop is primarily about storytelling and the storytelling on this record is impeccable...the ability to paint pictures."</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, Bell has had the opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the legends who worked on Illmatic including Nas himself.</p>
        
            <p>He is friends with Premier who produced three tracks on the record 'N.Y. State of Mind', Memory Lane' and 'Represent'.</p>
        
            <p>"I went to his house once when I was in New York which was a pretty crazy situation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>One of Bell's fondest memories is when he opened for the New Zealand leg of Nas' 20th anniversary Illmatic tour in early-2015.</p>
        
            <p>"Me being such a big fanboy of that record I was very blessed to have that moment.</p>
        
            <p>"On the opening night I was there with my two deejaying buddies and my son Ethan.</p>
        
            <p>"Ethan was wearing a Run the Jewels t-shirt and then Nas referenced an N.W.A song I played during my set.</p>
        
            <p>"At that moment he looked upstairs and my son was wearing a Run the Jewels t-shirt and he said to him 'I love new school rap like Run the Jewels.'</p>
        
            <p>"It was this beautiful full 360 moment for me."</p>

            <p>Tom Scott shares some common ground with Nas. </p>
        
            <p>Even the modestly spoken rapper of Home Brew and Avantdale Bowling Club can acknowledge this.</p>
        
            <p>Both came from jazz origins via their respective fathers.</p>
        
            <p>Nas' father Olu Dara played a trumpet solo on the backend of 'Life's a B*tch' and Scott's father Peter is a jazz bass player.</p>
        
            <p>It was the storytelling clout of early Nas that informed the West Auckland rapper's pen game.</p>
        
            <p>"It's stupid to even say because he's like a god and I'm just a little rapper in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Studying the way, he was like an observer, or a griot or a reporter for the village.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I tell the tales of my neighbourhood which is primarily Avondale, or West Auckland, or this little set of islands we live on.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm the storyteller for my neighbourhood like he was for Queensbridge."</p>
        
            <p>The lucid pictures of Illmatic also served as creative sway for Scott who would go on to win the Taite Music Prize in 2019 for Avantdale Bowling Club's eponymous debut.</p>
        
            <p>"One thing he does so well is that he'll paint a picture in your head…'sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket lining'.</p>
        
            <p>"There's four different things to picture almost, the prison, the prison on the island, the type of machine gun and this army jacket he's sneaking in.</p>
        
            <p>"Bro that's one line and he's painted so many visuals for you."</p>

            <p>Nas was gifted an all-star cast on Illmatic.</p>
        
            <p>So often had rappers relied on a sole beatmaking partner, this record broke the mould by thrusting multiple producers into the mix, establishing a semi-competitive atmosphere throughout sessions.</p>
        
            <p>DJ Premier previously revealed he retooled his beat for 'Represent' in the lead up after he heard Q-Tip's pause tape masterclass on 'One Love'.</p>
        
            <p>The result was some of the best jazz-laced instrumentals of the era from beatmakers already admired courtesy of work with their respective groups (Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest, Main Source, Pete Rock & CL Smooth).</p>
        
            <p>Brent Park aka Parks, the producer and songwriting ally of award-winning artist Ladi 6, describes Illmatic as "the perfect storm".</p>
        
            <p>"It's all those ground-breaking producers were really in their prime," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the perfect combination of all those producers and Nas peaking at the exact same time.</p>
        
            <p>"Pairing producers with rappers is so crucial and surprisingly hard to get right and it has to happen organically."</p>
        
            <p>Parks came up through Christchurch's small hip hop faction in the 90s and would join performing arts collective Pacific Underground, an outfit which would include a young emcee from the eastern suburbs named Scribe.</p>
        
            <p>Scribe himself has spoken of the influence of Illmatic over the years, and the album was seen as a reference point during the making of The Crusader, a monumental emcee alongside a lineup of producers.</p>
        
            <p>"I can definitely say Malo (Scribe) at that time was definitely influenced by what Nas was doing," Park said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a portrait of living in Queensbridge at a time where there as a lot of violence and a lot of poverty and Malo was doing something quite similar."</p>

            <p>Blessing and a curse?</p>
        
            <p>It's often debated whether Illmatic was so good that left an unreachable yardstick for the artist in the ensuing years.</p>
        
            <p>Fans of later albums such as It Was Written, God's Son, or even Stillmatic where he scorched Jay-Z during their iconic early-00's rivalry are usually outspoken about this school of thought.</p>
        
            <p>Ex-Real Groove editor and former RNZ senior music producer Sam Wicks falls into the former camp.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it remains impeccable and a perfect album.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that this debutant was able to get a Michael Jackson sample across the line is ridiculous.</p>
        
            <p>"It also remains an unachievable watermark for Nas, he is forever chasing that dragon.</p>
        
            <p> "Every beat on that album is bespoke and brings everything to life."</p>
        
            <p>Wicks has previously spoken to both Nas and DJ Premier, their respective dispositions could best be described as poles apart - Preemo the enthusiastic "super fan" of the culture and Nas the softly spoken introvert.</p>
        
            <p>"There's very few Nas interviews - and as an interviewee - where he is not introverted.</p>
        
            <p>"He comes to life on the mic."</p>
