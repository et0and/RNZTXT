        <h2>Tonight: Concert for Animals</h2>
        <p>
On Guy Fawkes night RNZ Concert offers a radio show of music specially chosen to be gentle for pets and their people during fireworks, in collaboration with the SPCA.
</p>
        
            <p>Concert for Animals will be broadcast nationwide on Tuesday 5 November to comfort and entertain companion animals and their humans from 6pm until midnight on Guy Fawkes night.</p>
        
            <p>
Sophie (pictured) and I miaowssively appreciate and look forward to your Guy Fawkes sonic sanctuary of calm. Thank you for the great idea to counter the world's madness out there. We love RNZ Concert. Kindest, Sophie & Alta.

            <p>In collaboration with SPCA, RNZ Concert is offering a radio show of music chosen to be gentle for pets during fireworks. </p>
        
            <p>Both organisations are keen to help improve the wellbeing of their communities. We know music is a positive part of many people’s lives, and we know many RNZ Concert listeners have beloved pets. Now we’re completing that circle with the SPCA’s expertise to provide an enjoyable listening experience for people and their furry friends on a night we know can be challenging for both.</p>
        
            <p>We hope thousands of New Zealanders – fur and skin – will settle down and tune in to RNZ Concert on Guy Fawkes night!</p>
        
            <p>See a gallery of some of our fluffy listeners below.</p>

"My mum and dad and human sister Nina think the concert for animals is the best thing since sliced turkey. Even Nana Lola is going to be listening as the fireworks make us all anxious. Thanks very much for the lovely music - Pixie xx"

Napoleon Bunaparte and Sophie doe Bundorset are very partial to snuggling up to some soothing Chopin nocturnes, so will definitely be ears-up for Concert for Animals! Ngā mihi nui, Jo and the bunnies.

Alfie is hoping RNZ can add to this self-made sanctuary he created the other night. He spends a LOT of time listening to RNZ Concert (especially when mum, Deborah, is out), so he probably likes most works (except the birds before the news in the mornings).
