            <p>US musician and producer Steve Albini, who was known for his work with acts including Nirvana, The Pixies and PJ Harvey, has died at the age of 61.</p>
        
            <p>Albini was an instrumental and uncompromising figure in the US indie scene in the 1980s and '90s, leading bands including Big Black and Shellac.</p>
        
            <p>His influence was also heard on the several thousand albums he produced and engineered.</p>
        
            <p>They included The Pixies' seminal LP Surfer Rosa and Nirvana's In Utero.</p>

            <p>Kurt Cobain recruited Albini to record the 1993 follow-up to their hugely successful Nevermind after being impressed by his work with Big Black, The Pixies and The Breeders.</p>
        
            <p>However, Albini was originally no fan of Nirvana, believing them to be an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound.</p>
        
            <p>He reportedly agreed to work with them because he felt sorry for them, believing they were at the mercy of their major record label, and wanted to give them a more abrasive sound.</p>
        
            <p>The album's resulting raw feel did not impress the Geffen label, which insisted the singles 'Heart-Shaped Box' and 'All Apologies' were remixed.</p>
        
            <p>In Utero went on to sell five million copies in the US alone, and Albini remarked: "I like it far more than I thought I was going to."</p>
        
            <p>In general, he disliked the title of producer, telling the Guardian last year he preferred to be credited as an engineer because he saw his role as recording a band and not shaping its sound.</p>
        
            <p>He also declined to take royalties, charging only a flat fee because he considered it unethical to make money from an artist's work indefinitely.</p>
        
            <p>He ran his own studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago, and had been preparing for the release of Shellac's To All Trains, their first album since 2014, on 17 May.</p>
