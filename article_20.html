            <p>He aroha nou e Ihu
    Tenei ra i kitea ai
    Tiakina hoki matou
    I te roa o tenei po.
    Atawhaitia mai e koe
    Mau ano ka ora ai.

    Tenei matou he manene
    Noho waenga i te he,
    Nei ra tiakina iho,
    I o matou hoa whawhai
    Tino awhitia e koe,
    Ki ou ringa atawhai

    Ka pahure enei wahi
    Me nga ra e ora ai
    A ka tata ki te mate
    Whakakahangia e koe
    Tangohia ki te rangi
    Okioki  atu ai.
    Amine.</p>
        
            <p>It is your love Lord Jesus!
    that we witness as you,
    watch over us,
    through this long night.
    Take care of us, for
    you are our Saviour.

    We are mere pilgrims
    who live in the midst of sin.
    Watch over us,
    from our enemies.
    Embrace us fully
    In your loving arms

    When time has passed
    And the days numbered,
    Nearing the time of death,
    Grant us strength,
    To be taken to heaven,
    For a complete rest.
    Amen.</p>

            <p>Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
the holy one, is here;
Come bow before him now
with reverence and fear:
In him no sin is found
we stand on holy ground.
Be still, for the presence of the Lord,
the holy one, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around;
He burns with holy fire,
with splendour he is crowned:
How awesome is the sight
our radiant king of light!
Be still, for the glory of the Lord
is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place;
He comes to cleanse and heal,
to minister his grace
No work too hard for him
In faith receive from him
Be still, for the power of the Lord
is moving in this place.</p>

            <p>Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
in light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might:
thy justice, like mountains high soaring above;
thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all, life thou givest, to both great and small.
In all life thou livest, the true life of all.
We blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree,
then wither and perish; but naught changeth thee.

Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render: O help us to see
‘Tis only the splendour of light hideth thee.</p>

            <p>Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
Christ, the true, the only light,
Sun of righteousness, arise,
Triumph o’er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Day star, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by thee;
Joyless is the day’s return
Till thy mercy’s beams I see;
Till they inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

Visit then this soul of mine,
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, radiancy divine,
Scatter all my unbelief;
More and more thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day.</p>

            <p>Chorus:
All over the world ev’rywhere,
people are learning to love and to share.
Amidst the threat of death and doom,
in each heart there is some room,
for a seed of life to grow.

Seeds they grow, silently, slowly,
waiting for water, sunlight… and so,
little ones too, so trusting in hope,
depend on our loving to blossom and grow.
Chorus:

Children too, daily have needs,
growing each day to flowers from seeds.
Water of caring, sunshine of touch;
the loving of parents is never too much.
Chorus:

Here we are, mothers and fathers,
brothers and sisters, neighbours and friends.
Sharing our love, our wisdom and praise,
will help all our little one, through all their days.
Chorus:</p>

            <p>Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
he whose word cannot be broken
formed thee for his own abode;
on the rock of ages founded,
what can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

See! the streams of living waters,
springing form eternal love,
well supply thy sons and daughters
and all fear of want remove.
Who can faint, when such a river
ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
never fails from age to age.

Round each habitation hov'ring,
see the cloud and fire appear
for a glory and a cov'ring,
showing that the Lord is near.
Thus deriving from their banner
light by night and shade by day,
safe they feed upon the manna
which he gives them on their way.

Saviour, if of Zion's city,
I through grace a member am,
let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in thy name.
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
all his boasted pomp and show;
solid joys and lasting treasure
none but Zion's children know.</p>
        
            <p>Artist: St Michael’s Singers of Coventry Cathedral
Words/Music: Newton/Trad
Recording: Kingsway KMCD 599</p>
        
            <p>Amazing grace! how sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved:
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thurs far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace.

When I've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
I've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when I first begun.</p>

            <p>O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace! [last line x 4]

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro' all the earth abroad
the honours of thy name. [last line x 4]

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease,
that bids our sorrows cease,
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life and health and peace. [last line x 4]

Hear Him, ye deaf, His praise, ye dumb
your loosened tongues employ,
your loosened tongues employ
ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
and leap ye lame for joy! [last line x 4]

In Christ, your head, you then shall know,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
shall feel your sins forgiven,
Anticipate your heaven below
And own that love is heaven. [last line x 4]</p>
