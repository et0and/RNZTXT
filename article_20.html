            <p>Sterling Elliott would have preferred the violin, but he arrived too late.</p>
        
            <p>As the third-born child, his mother already had plans: he would join his family as the cellist in The Elliott Family String Quartet. Mum, his brother Brendon and sister Justine already had the other instruments sewn up.</p>
        
            <p>To the outsider, mother Dannielle's musical plans for her family might seem a little obsessive, but having come from a rough background herself and having had opportunities open up through her discovery of the violin, she was determined to give her own children something similar.</p>
        
            <p>Sterling Elliott's first public performance - on a baby cello - was at the age of three, proudly recorded by his mother.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one years on, Elliott will make his New Zealand debut as a Guest Artist in next month's AWE (At the Worldâ€™s Edge) Festival in the Queenstown Lakes.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of his arrival, Elliott spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump about growing up with The Elliott Family String Quartet, his favourite piece (Schumann's Cello Concerto) and how - as a digital native - he limits his time online to ensure he gets enough rest between performances.</p>

5-13 October
