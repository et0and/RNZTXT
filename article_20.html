            <p>O worship the King all-glorious above,
O gratefully sing his power and his love:
our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.

O tell of his might and sing of his grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space.
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm.

The earth with its store of wonders untold,
Almighty, thy power hath founded of old;
hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree,
and round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.

O measureless might! Ineffable love!
While angels delight to hymn thee above,
Thy humbler creation, though feeble their lays,
With true adoration shall all sing thy praise.</p>

            <p>Jesus, the joy of loving hearts,
true source of life, and light of men,
from the best bliss that earth imparts
we turn unfilled to you again.

Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
you rescue those that on you call;
to those that seek you, you are good,
to those that find you all in all.

We taste you the living bread,
and long to feast upon you still;
we drink from you, the fountainhead,
our thirsty souls from you to fill.

Our restless spirits long for you,
whichever way our lot is cast;
glad when your gracious smile we view,
blessed when our faith can hold you fast.

Jesus, forever with us stay,
make all our moments calm and bright;
chase the dark night of sin away,
spread through the world your holy light.</p>

            <p>Jesus bleibet meine Freude,
meines Herzens Trost und Saft,
Jesus wehret allem Leide,
er ist meines Lebens Kraft,

meiner Augen Lust und Sonne,
meiner Seele Schatz und Wonne;
darum laß' ich Jesum nicht
aus dem Herzen und Gesicht.</p>

            <p>My song is love unknown,
My saviour’s love to me;
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.
O who am I, that for my sake
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

He came from his blest throne
Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
The longed-for Christ would know:
But O! my friend, my friend indeed,
Who at my need his life did spend.

Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the way
Hosannas to their King:
Then “Crucify!” is all their breath,
And for His death they thirst and cry.

They rise and needs will have
my dear Lord made away;
a murderer they save;
the Prince of Life they slay.
yet cheerful he to suffering goes
that he his foes from thence might free.

Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King!
Never was grief like thine.
This is my friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.</p>

            <p>E Kino koe te ingoa nei
    To Ihu ingoa nui
    Pa rekareka ana mai
    Te panga ki ahau

    Te Ingoa ra e ngaro ai
    Nga he e pehi nei
    He mana ia e ora ai
    Te wairua hiakai

    Te ingoa pai, te Toka nui
    E piri ai ahau
    Te puna e pupu mai ai
    Nga atawhai katoa

    E Ihu toku Hepara
    Ariki Kingi nui
    Tenei ka tukua atu mou
    He rangi whakapai

    Hei kawe noa, hei tohe nui
    Matoke tonu ia
    Kia kitea atu ra ‘no koe
    Ko kona ngoto ai

    I tenei wa me whakahua
    Ko tou aroha nui
    Te wa e mate ai ahau
    Manaakitia e koe
    Amine.</p>
        
            <p>Do not slander this Name
    The precious Name of Jesus
    It is an enjoyment
    That has an effect on me.

    That Name banishes
    The sins that burden
    It has authority to enliven
    The searching spirit.

    The precious Name and great Rock
    That I cling to
    The spring from which gushes
    Grace for all.

    Jesus my Shepherd
    Lord and almighty King
    (I) present to you
    A song of worship.

    To carry and persevere
    In cold times
    Until you are seen
    That’s when it is deeply imbedded.

    At this time (I) proclaim
    Your precious love
    At my time of dying
    Bless and care for me.
    Amen.</p>

            <p>O Holy Spirit, hear us as we pray:
renew your people's faith day by day.
Free us from the chaos of night and deepness;
in our life and death cheer and keep us.
Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis.

Uproot and teach us by your restless love
to share with all what we are and have;
that with strong affection, in truth and doing,
we may love all life, peace pursuing.
Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis.

You plead our cause, and by your gift of peace
from fear of death our lives are released.
How we need your presence, O gift from heaven,
all our words and deeds to enliven.
Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis.
Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis, Kyrieleis.</p>

            <p>Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
in light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might:
thy justice, like mountains high soaring above;
thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all, life thou givest, to both great and small.
In all life thou livest, the true life of all.
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
then wither and perish; but naught changeth thee.

Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render: O help us to see
‘Tis only the splendour of light hideth thee.</p>

            <p>The Lord bless you and keep you:
The Lord make His face to shine upon you,
To shine upon you and be gracious, and be gracious unto you.

The Lord bless you and keep you:
The Lord make His face to shine upon you,
To shine upon you and be gracious, and be gracious unto you.

The Lord lift up the light
Of His countenance upon you,
The Lord lift up the light
Of His countenance upon you,
And give you peace,
And give you peace,
And give you peace,
And give you peace.
Amen.</p>
