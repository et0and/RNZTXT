            <p>Makatea Tairea:</p>
        
            <p>Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness, from that time on, forever.
The seal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.</p>
        
            <p>Father God, each day we must choose what god we will worship.
May we, as Joshua did, choose Jehovah God.
We want to serve you with all our heart and soul.
Please renew the desire in us on a daily basis.
We love you, Lord.
In Jesus’ name,
Amen.</p>

Kia ora te etene
Ma te ngati iuda
Amene alleluia.</p>

            <p>Let us pray.
In the name of Jesus Christ we come to you, Father God, praising your name in our hearts.

I te enua nei mei tei te ao;
Omai te kai e tau ia matou i teianei ra
Akakore mai ta matou ara mei ia matou,
I akakore i ta tei ara ia matou nei
Auraka matou kia timata ia mai,
Akaora ra ia matou i te kino
Noou oki te basileia
E te mana, e te kaka,
E tu a tau ua atu
Amene.</p>

            <p>Read in Cook Islands Māori by Makatea Tairea, then in English by Apii Leota</p>
        
            <p>Matthew 1:18-25
This is how Jesus Christ was born. A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David's family. But before they were married, she learned that she was going to have a baby by God's Holy Spirit. Joseph was a good man and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone. So he decided to quietly call off the wedding.</p>
        
            <p>While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit. Go ahead and marry her. Then after her baby is born, name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</p>
        
            <p>So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said, “A virgin will have a baby boy, and he will be called Immanuel,” which means “God is with us.”</p>
        
            <p>After Joseph woke up, he and Mary were soon married, just as the Lord's angel had told him to do. But they did not sleep together before her baby was born. Then Joseph named him Jesus.</p>

            <p>Makatea Tairea:</p>
        
            <p>Let us pray.
Father God, we do want to trust in you during all the various times of our lives. Help us to realise in good health you are our Shepherd, so that in bad times we can trust you to take care of us. You are such a wonderful guardian of all our lives. Our lives are like gardens, and with your care they bloom and blossom with the flowers of your blessings everywhere.</p>
        
            <p>Father God, we love you very much for loving us. We stand truly amazed at your love for us. When we consider the message that Jesus Christ, your loving son, was born into the world for the forgiveness of our sins, Father, we are breathless.</p>
        
            <p>But help us, O Lord, that we will not be breathless that we cannot give witness to each life for us.</p>
        
            <p>Help us, Lord that we will be responsive to your gifts of grace through our lives.</p>
        
            <p>Amen.</p>
