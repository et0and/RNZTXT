            <p>This year's Taite Music Prize-winning singer/songwriter Vera Ellen and her producer Ben Lemi pick the New Zealand music that influenced them and talk about the special artist/producer relationship behind Vera's latest album, Ideal Home Noise.</p>
        
            <p>Ellen said the award was "slowly sinking in".</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like ... [there's] something about the Taite Awards specifically, just being around all my amazing peers and community and people I'd been growing up with... just felt like such a big hug and so encouraging, and sweet.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so nice because... a lot of the time at events like that you feel out of your skin... and it's quite nerve-wracking."</p>
        
            <p>It helped that a lot of the attendees were close friends, said Lemi, such as Tiny Ruins, "the Joni Mitchell of West Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>They were planning to reinvest the $12,500 prize money "back in the well" for future projects as well as day-to-day living costs.</p>
        
            <p>"I appreciate it so much and need it desperately... It is very difficult [to make a living as a musician in New Zealand]. As a solo artist and with a six-piece band, I want to make sure everyone else is looked after before I pay myself... so that means investing a lot but not really getting anything back, monetarily at least."</p>

            <p>As NZ Music Month kicks off, Ryan asked them what were their earliest memories of Kiwi music.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Fraser went to the same intermediate school as Vera in Naenae. "That was the age when I was discovering I wanted to be a songwriter... I remember hearing her on the radio and just thought she was so cool, and [her album] What to Do with Daylight."</p>
        
            <p>Lemi recalls growing up with the Footrot Flats movie, and hearing Dave Dobbyn's soundtrack: "That's one of our NZ music legends."</p>
        
            <p>The Mermaidens - 'Dress for Success'</p>
        
            <p>"I love the riffs," says Vera. "It's just got a really amazing chord progression, it's really punchy, strong... I'm such a fan of theirs."</p>
        
            <p>A.U.R.A - 'Dr Simone'</p>
        
            <p>Lemi and Vera met after he worked with her elder brother Albert River.</p>
        
            <p>"He's an amazing songwriter, an amazing musician, amazing spirit, and he said, 'Hey you should check out my sister's music'.''</p>
        
            <p>There were strong similarities between the siblings' sound and lyrics - Albert and Vera's older sister Tali is also a musician, as well as being a poet and vocalist who "does a lot of screaming and spoken word poetry".</p>
        
            <p>Growing up with Tali's "punk, hardcore vibe and edge" and the great songwriters, such as Jeff Buckley and Joni Mitchell, that Albert introduced her to, gave her a solid musical grounding, says Vera.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lemi's stepbrother put a guitar in his hand when he was six and introduced him to Jim Hendrix.</p>
        
            <p>"Dr Simone" is a song produced by Ben with Albert, and references jazz great Nina Simone.</p>
        
            <p>Would Vera ever do a family band with Albert and Tali? "It could happen!"</p>
        
            <p>Lemi says he never set out to become a producer. He started co-producing albums with French for Rabbits and Vera and "took a real liking" to the process.</p>
        
            <p>"With Vera, we talk about the aural aesthetic ... and the intention behind the songs. For me, I [try] to ingest the energy of the demos... and turn that into recordings and a meaningful capturing of Vera's songs."</p>
        
            <p>CC(TV) - 'Kinnie'</p>
        
            <p>This song is by Vera's Flying Nun stablemate and colleague, Carla Camilleri.</p>
        
            <p>"I really love this song, it really reminds me of summer and ... captures her spirit so beautifully."</p>
        
            <p>Vera has worked in a record store and loves how it expands her musical tastes. "It's one of the best jobs - being surrounded by music... and immediate local releases. It's pulled me out of the 1960s and 90s... there's a lot of cool stuff happening now."</p>
        
            <p>Charlotte Ryan asked the duo for their thoughts on the future of the "full album".</p>
        
            <p>Lemi: "I really admire how Vera places a lot of importance on constructing an album from start to finish... really thinking about the order of the songs, and the album as a whole experience. That would be a real shame to miss out on that experience."</p>
        
            <p>Vera: "Artistically, I just like working that way. It just makes sense to my brain as a musician... though I can definitely understand economically why people might prefer just to put out singles or EPs."</p>
        
            <p>Vera has a new, "very emotional, very raw" EP coming out soon. "I just don't want to lose that part of who I am as a musician... "</p>
        
            <p>Jazmine Mary - 'You're Never Alone If You've Got Music'</p>
        
            <p>"It's just such a gorgeous ballad... It reminds me of Nick Cave... It feels very classic already."</p>
        
            <p>Vera admires so many of the influential artists on the Flying Nun back catalogue - and it was the only label she sent her music to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's grounded in the NZ community and music history and I feel like attaching or being a part of something that's outside of yourself - in an environment and industry that can feel very extremely isolating at times - has been very grounding and just a real privilege to be in that lineage."</p>
        
            <p>i.e crazy - 'As It Stands'</p>
        
            <p>This track comes from their album Country Justice.</p>
        
            <p>"I became a fan of theirs a few years ago. I love the way that they put different textures together. I love how they use audio tracks mixed in with music, and then how much gut is put into their songs and it just comes across so strong."</p>
        
            <p>Orchestra of Spheres - 'Hypercube'</p>
        
            <p>Lemi's partner plays the bass in this band, although its members are pursuing individual projects currently.</p>
        
            <p>Vera Ellen is touring with Voom and Reb Fountain, playing the James Hay Theatre, Christchurch on 30 May, Errick's, Dunedin on 31 May, the Great Hall, Wellington on 1 June and the Powerstation, Auckland on 2 June</p>
