            <p>Shimmy Jiyane was four when the Soweto uprising took place.</p>
        
            <p>He can just remember the school protests that broke out in the South African black township in 1976, and the Apartheid regime's oppression of them.</p>
        
            <p>In the years that followed, he remembers when the police came to take friends into custody, where they were sometimes beaten and tortured.</p>
        
            <p>He also remembers the gospel singing which gave the black people of Soweto courage and hope, even when there seemed to be none.</p>
        
            <p>Eventually South Africa's Apartheid regime of white-only rule did fall, and now the South African gospel style is the toast of the singing world.</p>
        
            <p>Next month, Aucklanders will get two chances to hear the 370-year-old tradition in full voice, when Jiyane leads the Soweto Gospel Choir in two concerts for the Auckland Arts Festival.</p>

            <p>Speaking to RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Jiyane says the choir gathers the best gospel singers from Soweto and beyond.</p>
        
            <p>Jiyane was with the choir when it formed in 2002, and these days he's its director as well as choreographer - dance is just as important as singing in the South African gospel tradition.</p>
        
            <p>Jiyane also told Crump about performing for the South African President Nelson Mandela not long after the choir won its first Grammy Award in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>Mandela arrived late as the choir was singing its first song, the celebratory Sesotho-language "Hlonolofatsa". The President asked the choir to stop and begin again, not because he disliked the performance, but so he could join in the singing himself.</p>

            <p>Jiyane says the gospel tradition remains strong in Soweto, with no shortage of young singers wanting to join.</p>
        
            <p>Audition sessions last the whole day "until eleven at night".</p>
        
            <p>For its concerts in Auckland, the choir will also perform music from beyond South Africa including songs by Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Sam Cooke.</p>
