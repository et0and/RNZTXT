Mohau te tino koroia.

[Holy Spirit embrace me
Holy Spirit from up above
encase me in the precious gifts
give to me your love.

This place of truth
teach me the things that are right
bathe me, cleanse me
to You goes the glory.]</p>

Nobody knows like my Jesus.
Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen,
Glory hallelujah

Sometimes I’m up, sometimes I’m down,
O yes, my Lord!
Sometimes I’m almost to the ground,
O yes, my Lord!</p>

            <p>Angel voices ever singing
round Thy throne of light,
angel harps, forever ringing,
rest not day nor night;
thousands only live to bless Thee
and confess thee Lord of might.</p>
        
            <p>Thou who art beyond the farthest
mortal eye can scan,
can it be that Thou regardest
songs of sinful man?
Can we know that Thou art near us
and wilt hear us? Yea, we can.

Yea, we know Thy love rejoices
o'er each work of Thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices
for Thy praise design;
craftsman's art and music's measure
for Thy pleasure all combine.

Honour, glory, might, and merit
Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
blessed Trinity:
of the best that Thou hast given
earth and heaven render Thee.</p>

            <p>Stand up and bless the Lord,
All people of His choice;
Stand up and bless the Lord your God
With heart and soul and voice.

Though high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear His holy name,
And laud and magnify?

Oh for the living flame
From His own altar brought,
To touch our lips our minds inspire,
And wing to heaven our thought!

God is our strength and song,
And His salvation ours;
Then be His love in Christ proclaimed
With all our ransomed powers.

Stand up and bless the Lord;
The Lord your God adore;
Stand up and bless His glorious name,
Henceforth forevermore.</p>

            <p>Hail to the Lord’s anointed, great David’s greater Son!
Hail in the time appointed, His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression, to set the captive free;
To take away transgression and rule in equity.

He comes in succor speedy to those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy, and bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing, their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying, were precious in His sight.

He shall come down like showers upon the fruitful earth;
love, joy, and hope, like flowers, spring in his path to birth.
Before him on the mountains, shall peace, the herald, go,
and righteousness, in fountains, from hill to valley flow.

To Him shall prayer unceasing and daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing, a kingdom without end:
The tide of time shall never His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever, His Name to us is Love.</p>

            <p>Lord Jesus Christ shall I stand still
And stare at You hung on the tree
Or shall I move to where You move
And die and live again for me
Shall I to sin and failure cling
Consorting with the guilt I hate
Or on Your shoulders shall I fling
The wrong I breed and contemplate.

Shall I Your story read and tell
To note Your mark on history
Or shall I make Your story mine
And live by faith and mystery
Shall I embrace the love You show
And covet this sweet holy thing
Or of that love shall my heart speak
My hands relate my being sing.

Shall I retreat from where You fall
And seek a safer path through life
Or shall I meet You in the world
Where peace is scarce injustice rife
Lord Jesus Christ the God who lives
To love and die and rise again
Make me the who and You the why
Your way the how and now the when.</p>

            <p>Where the road runs out and the signposts end,
where we come to the edge of today,
be the God of Abraham for us;
send us out upon our way.

Refrain
Lord, you were our beginning,
the faith that gave us birth.
We look to you, our ending,
our hope for heaven and earth.

When the coast is left and we journey on
to the rim of the sky and the sea,
be the sailor’s friend, be the dolphin Christ,
lead us on to eternity.
Refrain:

When the clouds are low and the wind is strong,
when tomorrow’s storm draws near,
be the spirit bird hov’ring overhead
who will take away our fear.
Refrain:</p>

            <p>This is my Father's world,
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas –
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world:
The birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world:
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King: let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let earth be glad!</p>
