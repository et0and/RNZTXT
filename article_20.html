            <p>Julian Raphael was a Wellington music phenomenon, and then he wasn't.</p>
        
            <p>When I returned to Wellington to work in 2005, I quickly became aware of the crowds Raphael was drawing to the central city's Wesley Methodist Church Hall every Wednesday evening, with the Wellington Community Choir.</p>
        
            <p>People were coming in their hundreds to sing gospel, folk, African songs - no music, no auditions - led by this larger-than-life character with the booming bass baritone, flowing dreadlocks and sometimes a guitar, or drums.</p>
        
            <p>There was a time, it is said, when (if you were in the know) you couldn't walk down a central Wellington street without bumping into someone who was part of this Raphael-led, grass-roots music revolution.</p>
        
            <p>I would've joined it myself, had it not been for my hours - working nights on RNZ National - but I kept an eye out and an ear on Raphael's musical ventures. Not just with the Community Choir, but also singing workshops and his male-voice chorus, MaleVocale.</p>
        
            <p>His all-embracing approach and enthusiasm was a model when I decided to set up my own choir, given my work hours precluded me from joining anyone else's.</p>
        
            <p>But then, a few years back, Raphael had gone.</p>
        
            <p>I wasn't sure where, until I bumped into him at the 2023 WOMAD Festival in New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>It turned out he and his partner had moved to Taranaki to do pretty much what they'd been doing in the capital city.</p>

            <p>This year, while at WOMAD Taranaki, I took time out from the festival to catch up with Raphael and find out more about his new life out west.</p>
        
            <p>Like me, he'd got to know New Plymouth through regular visits to its annual world festival of music and dance.</p>
        
            <p>He likes the fact that Taranaki is a little out of the way; "you have to make an effort" to get to it.</p>
        
            <p>Raphael also noticed New Plymouth didn't have an all-comers choir. The city was ripe for his choral credo: "if you can get in the door, you've passed the audition".</p>
        
            <p>Raphael's New Plymouth Community Choir is called the Taranaki Singing Venture, or TSB for short - not to be confused with another Taranaki-based financial institution.</p>
        
            <p>The venture is imbued with Raphael's approach to music: a love of people, a love of teaching, and belief that music is an activity for everyone, not just those who can really excel.</p>
        
            <p>He hasn't stopped with the TSB. Raphael's Taranaki adventures also include a new male choir, teaching drumming, "table singing" (we'll come to that in a moment), and teaching guitar.</p>
        
            <p>Raphael's Taranaki male choir is called the Taranaki Song Men</p>
        
            <p>He was keen to continue his love of male-voice singing, something which he really treasured during his time in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>What was it about male-voice choirs?</p>
        
            <p>"As a man you would probably would clock this, but there's something very special about the sound of men singing together in a harmonic and collaborative manner that is just really a very unique sound."</p>
        
            <p>"I like the fact that men can sing in a really strong way but they can also sing very gently. I'm a real fan of the [Australian group] Spooky Men's Chorale. I love the fact that there's a group of guys that in a sense, sings in a way that sort of shows them up, that's extremely funny and unique."</p>
        
            <p>"Well, smart men know the way to a woman's heart is to make her laugh," I suggest.</p>
        
            <p>"And to make some sounds that make her go gooey," Raphael adds.</p>
        
            <p>At the moment, Raphael's focusing on reviving old Kiwi work songs, from the bush, from the farm, from the sea.</p>
        
            <p>"'Cos here we are, a bunch of Taranaki guys and let's sing some songs about our country."</p>
        
            <p>As for the table singing, that's an idea that comes from Raphael's love ofÂ  Eastern European and Occitan acapella singing.</p>
        
            <p>Like me, Raphael was blown away at WOMAD 2023 by the Occitan group, San Salvador.</p>
        
            <p>Raphael went along to the group's workshop, and came away with a few ideas for a group of his own.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought, wouldn't it be great to have six or seven voices who are really flexible ... to do this sort of music. We got some trestle tables and we decked them out like a feast ... and we were drinking out of goblets. We rehearse around the table so we'll sing around a table, and it was just different. You don't have to stand up to sing."</p>
        
            <p>So will Taranaki be Raphael's last musical base?</p>
        
            <p>This is a man who's always travelled. He starting singing as a choir boy in Dunedin, moved to England with his parents, studied there, before moving to Wellington for the best part of a decade and a half.</p>
        
            <p>Will Raphael feel the pull of another musical venture?</p>
        
            <p>He can't rule out another move for him and his partner, but having just set up life in their own home he concluded "when I moved in, I thought, I'm not moving in again".</p>
        
            <p>We can think of worse places to be stuck, and Wellington's loss is Taranaki's gain.</p>
