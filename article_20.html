        <h2>The Score is Settled!</h2>
        <p>
As we look forward to Settling the Score 2024, RNZ Concert's classical countdown broadcast on Labour Day, here are some observations drawn from the public vote for New Zealand's favourite classical music for 2024.
</p>
        
            <p>Anticipation is high for the 25th anniversary of Settling the Score, RNZ Concert’s classic countdown, on the radio from 6am til 8pm this Labour Day Monday.</p>
        
            <p>All the music broadcast is lovingly curated by the RNZ Concert team from a public vote, and we'll count down our audience's Top 30 most-loved classical pieces from noon until 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>Join our hosts across the day for a delightful celebration of classical music in Aotearoa, the perfect soundtrack to your holiday Monday. Tune in to RNZ Concert on the radio, or stream us from rnz.co.nz, the RNZ App, SKY TV channel 422, or Freeview Channel 51.</p>
        
            <p>Here is an overview of the full voting results, followed by some interesting audience choices and comments which may not make it to air. No spoilers! Listen to RNZ Concert on Monday to find out more.</p>
        
            <p>In this year's Settling the Score 687 different pieces of music were voted for, and the most popular composers are:</p>

            <p>This is determined by the number of points per composer divided by the number of their pieces voted for.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand composers made up 9.6 percent of Settling the Score voting this year, with 66 pieces contributed by 43 different local composers. Ten of those pieces feature in the top 100.</p>
        
            <p>Approximately 4.8% (33 pieces) were composed by women. Yes, we all have more work to do here, but there is a significant overlap between the New Zealand and non-male composers, so perhaps here in Aotearoa we are part of the solution?</p>
        
            <p>This is the most popular New Zealand composition for 2024. People who chose this piece said:</p>
        
            <p>"It is so serene, pensive, humane and unearthly. An instant NZ classic." - Joanna, Pōneke</p>
        
            <p>"The piece is very simply written but the use of the falsetto range of the tenor voice brings a gentle tension and pathos. I also love the version in te reo Māori sung by Anika Moa. The music supports the poem well, letting the words speak." - Deborah, Kapiti</p>
        
            <p>"Deeply emotional, makes me hold my breath, sway, shed a tear.  And fills my heart with pride for our kiwi composers and poets." - Ashley, Auckland</p>

            <p>Supporters said: "I was at the launch of this piece played by Somi Kim and loved it.", "Just released this year and is written by a local composer. I feel we should strive to support and encourage local musicians." says Richard, "So evocative", and "Wonderful collaboration." are other voter comments.</p>
        
            <p>"We were privileged to hear this piece performed at the Michael Fowler Centre by the National Youth Orchestra. Jessie is the 2024 composer in residence. The piece is exciting and engaging, evoking colour and movement. It takes the listener on a wonderful journey. - Jenny of Nelson</p>
        
            <p>"I love this piece because it's very engaging and rhythmically interesting. It really reminds me of Reich's Music for 18 Musicians but with its own unique flavour. I really love the orchestral colours and the transitions of the entire piece." - Joshua, Papatoetoe </p>

            <p>Settling The Score attracts many audience suggestions for music not usually heard on RNZ Concert, which is always interesting. Here is a selection from this year which we probably won't have time to play on Settling the Score day:</p>
        
            <p>"It is a short piece with a discordant melody and great feeling amidst a soundtrack album. A beautiful piece of wave like piano music. Loved it since the first listen and play it regularly. Very much like a modern Rachmaninov variation." - Ken, Hawkes Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"An introduction to classical music and the lives of 6 composers in only 3 minutes (Bach, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Mozart + Paganini) Best with video but fun anyway" suggests Joy of Norsewood</p>
        
            <p>This is either the perfect melding of K-Pop and classical music into a new genre "popsical", or the work of a talented Australian comedy duo. You decide: </p>
        
            <p>A couple of more serious takes on classical / popular music crossovers now.</p>
        
            <p>Four cellists and a singer take on the Britney Spears pop hit in this art song meets pop song reimagining. "Just a great rendition" says nominator Bruce from Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Conductor Graham Ross, Arranged for Violin and string orchestra. Serene and exquisite arrangement of Sigur Ros classic. We were very excited to hear the newer Thomas Gould choral arrangement on RNZ recently, which would be our next choice! - Rob of Tauranga</p>
        
            <p>There is some commonality between classical music and prog / rock, which these next suggestions well demonstrate:</p>
        
            <p>James of Waimakariri chose Genesis: 'Horizons' from the album Foxtrot as his prog/classical cross-over of choice:</p>
        
            <p>Chris from Tararua punts up this guitar piece, saying "OK I admit it’s not really classical, but it’s an instrumental and it’s gorgeous. And my wife of 34 years played this in the morning after the night we first stayed together. The 2nd half gets rocky but the first half is pure gold. And it’s our song!"</p>
        
            <p>A.R. Branson of Porirua tells us: "It plays all the time in my head - but not often enough on radio." </p>
        
            <p>Josephine of Otahuhu notes the generational aspect of NZ's healing in this classic New Zealand movie theme.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking of film scores, this year features suggestions including: </p>
        
            <p>This soundtrack motivated several people to volunteer it as one of their favourites this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I love a slow burn sci-fi." - Petal Tauranga</p>
        
            <p>"A great score conjuring up an out of this world experience!" - John Tasman</p>
        
            <p>"It has a mystical, ethereal quality." - Rob Auckland</p>
        
            <p>Other music from the movies suggested by the RNZ Concert audience this year incudes John Powell's How to Train Your Dragon, Howard Shore with Lord of the Rings, and 'Gabriel's Oboe' from The Mission - always a popular option but this year we also saw another piece from the same composer pop up:</p>
        
            <p>"Morricone has composed some excellent soundtracks; I think this one is special." - Keith from Hamilton</p>
        
            <p>It's also a firm favourite of Janene in Auckland, who says "The pathos of this piece is like no other, makes one cry and yet feel uplifted all at once and the weaving of the melody through the orchestral rise and fall is breathtaking."</p>
        
            <p>Likewise, John WIlliams is a regular fixture on the Settling the Score list with Shindler's List and Star Wars very popular scores. This year Richard of Porirua has offered:</p>
        
            <p>"Of all John Williams' music, this is one of the most iconic, recognizable and uplifting pieces he has ever composed. It has been used many times in different media, since it first appeared in 1978. No other piece of Williams' music, except maybe the Imperial March, has captured the essence of its subject: in this case the heroism of Superman. While you have included some of Williams' work, I feel that this is very deserving of inclusion. Many thanks."  </p>
        
            <p>Liz of Kingston brings us a piece from the most widely listened to genre of music in the (Western) world today: Game scores. </p>
        
            <p>"This symphonic reimagining of the groundbreaking 'Journey' video game soundtrack does so much with texture and sound, and finale 'I Was Born for This' is one of those rare moments that buoys the soul. Please do check out the London Symphony Orchestra recording, it truly is a breathtaking work.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of outlier audience suggestions this year are a Chris Knox song called 'Liberal Backlash Angst (The Excuse)', which comes with a language warning, and this suggestion of a heartland NZ tune.</p>
        
            <p>"I dream of being there too. Where? There's a place… Haarty Naarty" - says April of New Lynn</p>
        
            <p></p>
