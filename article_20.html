            <p>Once it was the gateway instrument for many young musicians before falling out of favour. But maybe the recorder is about to make a comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Simon Borutzki certainly hopes so. The director of the Berlin Recorder Orchestra has been in Aotearoa taking workshops with some of this country's up-and-coming recorder players, ahead of a solo recital as part of the Wellington Cathedral of St Paul's weekly Thank God it's Friday lunchtime concerts on 18 October.</p>
        
            <p>Borutzki spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump about his love of the recorder, and how recorder orchestras are growing in number across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
        
            <p>He puts that down to the modern sub-contrabass which gives a recorder ensemble that extra 'oomph' down low.</p>
        
            <p>Recorders have always come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but Borutzki believes the invention of the sub-contrabass changed everything.</p>
        
            <p>He told Bryan Crump the lower notes open up a new repertoire of modern music to recorder groups, who might previously have stuck to works written no later than 1750. </p>
        
            <p>Borutzki says without those sub-contras, a lot of recorder orchestra arrangements of modern music sound like they're being played at double speed.</p>
        
            <p>To that end, as well as diving into reviving renaissance and baroque recorder music, Borutzki arranges pieces by 20th century and even living composers, such as Karl Jenkins.</p>
        
            <p>You might like to pump up the bass on your own listening device to make the most of them.</p>
