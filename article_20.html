        <h2>New Horizons: The Beths Bethroned</h2>
        <p>
This year's APRA Silver Scrolls are done and dusted. William Dart, having spent the last few weeks tributing musicians no longer with us or valiantly soldiering on in their 80s, now sits back to be charmed by 2023's Scroll monarchs, The Beths. Audio

            <p>William says:</p>
        
            <p>"I quickly found that listening to The Beths' music was a little like falling under the spell of a new and strangely powerful artwork. From a distance, your eye might be caught by its broad visual sweep, but, move in closer, and you’re suddenly immersed in a new world of sculptural brushstrokes and/or intricate narrative detail. Casually encountering a Beths song, it might be its sheer energy and momentum that draws you in, but again ... listen more intently, and there’s all kinds of subtleties to be heard, the band’s bubbling backing vocals being just one. And the musical setting of the lyrics is special too, with the sometimes melancholic, self-deprecating words and images of Liz Stokes delivered with the bold, extrovert energy that you might expect from a guitar band."</p>
