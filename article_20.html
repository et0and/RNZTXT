            <p>Ju Percussion Group, Taiwan’s first professional percussion ensemble, was founded in 1986 by Tzong-Ching Ju, who still leads the group today.</p>
        
            <p>The ensemble is in New Zealand for the first time - it'll be the 35th country they've performed in.</p>
        
            <p>Their Auckland Arts Festival concert will include Kyoto, a work written by New Zealand composer John Psathas for the group’s 25th anniversary back in 2011.</p>

            <p>John Psathas and two senior members of Ju Ensemble, Pei-Ching Wu and Kuen-Yean Hwang, came in to the RNZ Auckland studio to talk with RNZ Concert’s David Morriss ahead of the concert.</p>

            <p>John says, "It's actually quite a big deal to write for a group that has composers in it, and very, very good composers. In some ways, it lifts the challenge higher, composing for such a group."</p>
        
            <p>"Something that’s very striking about Ju Percussion is the intensity with which they play everything. They bring everything to every note, and so it’s an incredible spectacle and musical experience."</p>
        
            <p>"I would call it a ‘powerhouse group’ - there’s something very special about it.”</p>
        
            <p>Ju Percussion Group performs at the Auckland Town Hall at 8pm on Saturday 15 March, as part of the Auckland Arts Festival.</p>
