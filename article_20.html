            <p>Most folk do it the other way around, but Marcus Norman left a circus to come home.</p>
        
            <p>Norman, who was also an Auckland-based RNZ Concert host, gave up his job as a circus manager to return to his hometown Christchurch to manage its arts and music venue, The Piano.</p>
        
            <p>The venue, which rose up out of the rubble of the Christchurch earthquakes, is looking forward to its 2025 season.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Norman says he's been amazed at how much the city of his birth has changed - in a good way.</p>
        
            <p>Norman spoke to Crump about the role The Piano plays in Christchurch's music and arts scene, as well as some of the great concerts coming up over the next 12 months. </p>
