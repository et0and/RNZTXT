            <p>Te Rito is a respected singer and songwriter from Te-Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington, who describes her work Māreikura as a journey through her perspectives, relationships, and feelings around four Atua Wāhine Māori goddesses. Hine-tītama: the dawn, the first woman, who changed into Hine-Nui-Te-Pō, the goddess of death, when she discovered that her husband Tane was also her father; Hine Raukatauri, the goddess of all flute music and the pūtōrino; and Mahuika, goddess of fire.</p>
        
            <p>Māreikura is an exciting new work that blends jazz and Te Reo Māori, and draws extensively on Te Ao Māori.</p>
