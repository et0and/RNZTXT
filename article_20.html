            <p>The pieces on the album were written between 2019 and early 2023, and include three suites. One of these - 'When it was quiet, still we sang' - found its inspiration during a Covid-19 lockdown in late 2021 when the sound of birdsong became much more noticeable.</p>
        
            <p>Paine made recordings of tui and other birds he heard in his backyard, and used these melodies as a starting point for the movements of the suite.</p>
        
            <p>The album is dedicated to the memory of his mother, Frances Rosalind Paine, and the cover and accompanying booklet include a selection of her artwork.</p>
