            <p>This Christian service traditionally occurs on Christmas Eve. Its advent marked carols being brought inside the church for the first time, in part to lure people away from the taverns. Carols and hymns are interspersed with bible readings appropriate to the season. You can read and sing along with the words of the service here: </p>

</p>
        
            <p>Music director Michael Stewart constructed a programme around Poulenc’s Four Motets for Christmas Time. Written in the middle of the twentieth century, each motet is set in a different scene from the nativity: In the manger surrounded by farm animals, in the fields with shepherds speaking to angels, the three magi rejoicing as they follow the star, and of course, the joy in heaven at Christ’s birth.</p>
        
            <p>Each of these motets sets ancient Latin texts that composers have used throughout the centuries, and we’ll hear their versions paired with Poulenc’s modern settings. Compositions from Palestrina, de Lassus, Victoria and Sweelinck are also joined by modern composers including Berg, Distler, and Howells.</p>
        
            <p>There is even an opportunity to for the audience sing along with the choir in some well-known carols.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>8 pm Music Alive: Auckland Philharmonia - Celebrate Christmas 2024 </p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Philharmonia presents its traditional end-of-the-year celebration in Holy Trinity Cathedral with the usual mix of the joyous and the contemplative. There’s music by, among others, Bach, Poulenc, Rutter, Delius along with a new carol by popular Auckland composer Chris Artley getting its Aotearoa premiere. This year the orchestra is conducted by the much-respected Stephen Layton from the UK, and as well as their regular partners for this event the Graduate Choir New Zealand, they are joined by the young tenor whose star is very much on the rise, Emmanuel Fonoti-Fuimaono.</p>

            <p>8 pm Music Alive: NZSO & Signature Choir - Mana Moana live at Spark Arena </p>
        
            <p>Mana Moana celebrates the Pacific Islands through music. The Auckland concert features the Signature Choir from Wellington. But this time they are joined by their Auckland friends to swell the ranks of the choir to eighty voices. They sing with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra under conductor Brent Stewart. Together they make a huge sound that fills the Spark Arena in Auckland. (2023)</p>
        
            <p>8 pm Music Alive: NZSO Arias </p>

            <p>"Here’s one for the opera lovers! In this concert, we celebrate some of the most iconic music ever written for Italian opera houses. Verdi’s Overture from La forza del destino is a typical example of Italian heart-stirring drama – though Kiwi audiences may better remember its main theme from a certain beer commercial! Mascagni’s “Intermezzo” from Cavelleria rusticana remains one of the most performed works from Mascagni’s body of work, thanks to its irresistibly singable melodies.</p>
        
            <p>"Puccini arguably provides the best introduction to the world of opera, thanks to the emotional intensity and directness of his music. So both new and longtime opera fans will delight in our selection of the most memorable arias and scenes from his repertoire. “Mi chiamano Mimi” and “O soave Fanciulla” from La bohème, “O mio babbino caro” from Gianni Schicchi, and “Nessun dorma” from Turandot are sure to raise the roof – and fill the heart." - NZSO (2024)</p>

            <p>8 pm Music Alive: The NZSO & The Phoenix Foundation - Celebrate! </p>
        
            <p>Top New Zealand composers and arrangers Gareth Farr, Claire Cowan, Chris Gendall and Hamish Oliver worked with The Phoenix Foundation and NZSO conductor Hamish McKeich to create orchestral versions of the band’s much-loved works.</p>
        
            <p>“There is no sound on earth quite like a real symphony orchestra,” says The Phoenix Foundation’s Samuel Scott. “This is still 100 per cent The Phoenix Foundation - just with over 60 musicians and the skills of the conductor and arranger turning it up to 11.” (2018)</p>
        
            <p>6 am – 8 pm Setting the Score encore 

8 pm Music Alive: Auckland Philharmonia: Viennese Feast</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Philharmonia presents an evening of music from and inspired by the city of Vienna, that Austro-Hungarian powerhouse of 18th and 19th century composition, with their guests violinist Amalia Hall and conductor Christoph Altstaedt.</p>

            <p>The overgrown jungle of a garden is where NZ’s ‘father of classical music composition’ Douglas Lilburn liked to spend time growing vegetables and listening to the Tūī. Enjoy the stories of a house and its inhabitants, their search for identity and a place to call home. (2022)</p>
        
            <p>These Hopeful Machines</p>
        
            <p>A six-part series in which James Gardner traces a personal path through the evolving world of electronic music and interviews some of the pioneers who made it happen. Over 100 years of recording techniques, electronic instruments and gizmos ... their use in popular music, art music and their position in Western culture. (2013)</p>
        
            <p>WATCH: 12.000 Miles</p>
        
            <p>This documentary follows the four Kiwi pipe bands that travelled to the 2023 World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow—Auckland and District, Canterbury Caledonian Society, Manawatu Scottish, and St Andrew's College—from the very start of their campaigns right through to the competition at Glasgow Green. Showcasing the true antipodean flavour of New Zealand pipe-banding, Kiwis from all walks of life show what it takes to travel the 12,000 Miles (18,000 km) each year to pit themselves against the best in the business.</p>
