Beethoven’s famous opening 'da-da-da-dah' motif has found its way into pop songs, Morse code and even Doctor Who. By using this within his fifth symphony in a cyclic, rather than linear, way he revolutionised symphonic form. Video, Audio

            <p>Beethoven’s 'Symphony No 5' has perhaps the most famous opening of any piece of classical music. Its 'da-da-da-dah' rhythmic motif has found its way into pop songs, Morse code and even Doctor Who. But its ubiquity hides its genius: using this distinctive motif as a common thread throughout all four movements, Beethoven wrote a symphony whose form was cyclic, rather than linear, and thus revolutionised symphonic form.</p>
        
            <p>The Fifth Symphony was originally to be part of the NZSO's 2020 Podium Series Emperor tour as part of celebrations of the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth. </p>
