        <h2>Karl-Heinz Steffens: from clarinet to conducting</h2>
        <p>
In 2008, Karl-Heinz Steffens gave up his plum job as principal clarinet with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra - he's never looked back.  Video, Audio

            <p>Karl-Heinz Steffens always knew clarinet wouldn't be enough for him.</p>
        
            <p>Despite being one of Europe's finest players and eventually becoming section principal of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Steffens always wanted to conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Since moving out of the orchestra pit and onto the podium, Steffens has carved out a successful career directing orchestras around the world, including becoming principal conductor of Sweden's Norrköping Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's Bryan Crump spoke with Steffens ahead of his second concert directing the Auckland Philharmonia later this week. </p>

            <p>Last year, he jumped in at short notice to direct the Philharmonia in Bruckner's monumental 9th Symphony when illness forced the conductor initially assigned the job to cancel.</p>
        
            <p>It seems Auckland made a great impression on the Berlin-based musician, who told RNZ he loved its combination of urban lifestyle and closeness to nature.</p>
        
            <p>In this trip, he's already made a visit to Waiheke Island - maybe it'll be the Waitakere Ranges next.</p>

A great place for a conductor from Berlin to visit.
