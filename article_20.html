            <p>The 2024 Lilburn Lecture at the National Library of New Zealand is by music critic and commentator, Elizabeth Kerr. Elizabeth speaks about the role of music critic in the Aotearoa arts ecosystem. She talks about composer Douglas Lilburn's experiences under the harsh pen of critics, recalls feisty New Zealand music writers from last century, outlines her own journey in a media landscape where arts coverage is demonstrably shrinking, and concludes by offering some ideas for restoration of a species in danger of extinction.</p>
