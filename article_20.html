            <p>Just two days to go before the event of the New Zealand brass band community begins: the 2024 national championships.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the contest (one of the world's oldest music competitions) is back in Auckland for the first time in 13 years, taking place in Manukau. And its reach has extended outside New Zealand to become the Pacific Festival of Brass, with participants from Australia to Tonga and even Japan.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's David Morriss spoke with two of the organisers, Owen Melhuish and William Kingi, about the new direction the contest is taking.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully this festival will mark a turning point," says William, whose role is Festival Coordinator/Community Outreach. "And who knows - maybe we'll see more Pacific composers, more Pacific repertoire being played in brass banding community."</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first step towards something really interesting and exciting."</p>
