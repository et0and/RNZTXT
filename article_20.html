            <p>For most high school students, the holidays are for putting your feet up. But for members of the national secondary schools' orchestra, this week has been about putting the foot to the floor.</p>
        
            <p>Ninety-seven of the country's best young musicians gathered in Ōtautahi/Christchurch ahead of two concerts in the Garden City by the New Zealand Secondary Students' Symphony Orchestra, or NZSSSO for short.</p>

            <p>Under the direction of conductor Vincent Hardaker, they'll perform music by Russian Romantic Borodin, the Finn Rautavaara, and local composers Douglas Lilburn and Christopher Marshall.</p>
        
            <p>The orchestra's Coordinator and Course Director, Nicky Fogden-Smith, says this weekend's concert  is the culmination of a week of intensive music-making and tuition.</p>

            <p>As well as the full orchestra rehearsals, members of the NZSSSO split into smaller groups for tuition and training from Christchurch teachers, including members of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.</p>

            <p>Speaking with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Fogden-Smith says it's a joy to watch the young musicians develop confidence and come out of their shells through the week.</p>
        
            <p>It's her job to lead the process of whittling down the more than 150 players who auditioned to the 97 that made up this week's ensemble, with performance standards getting better with every year.</p>

            <p>For many of them, it will be the most intense musical experience of their lives so far, and Fogden-Smith says they can't get enough of it despite working a full eight-hour day.</p>
        
            <p>"I suspect that they've probably never done as many hours playing, yet they come away from a rehearsal for a break and they're still tootling away."</p>

            <p>Fogden-Smith, herself a veteran of the NZSSSO from the 1980s, says the social side of the orchestra is also important.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not on their devices, they're thoroughly enjoying just connecting and being part of something bigger than themselves."</p>
        
            <p>"You should see the table tennis tournaments - it's quite hilarious."</p>

            <p>Will Fogden-Smith be sad when it's all over?</p>
        
            <p>"The students ... there are a few tears on the last night when they're saying goodbye..."</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest I'll be quite happy to go on holiday, I'm looking to just put my feet up for a bit, it's a very full week..."</p>
        
            <p>"I will cope. There's always next year."</p>
