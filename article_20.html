        <h2>Hymns on Sunday, 10 November 2024</h2>
        <p>
We're featuring evening hymns this week, there's a setting of Psalm 23 (probably the most frequently set of all the psalm), and a hymn that nearly ended up in little pieces in the rubbish bin. Audio

            <p>Te Karakia O Te Atua
(The Lord’s Prayer)
E tō mātou Matua i te rangi
(Our Parent in the spirit world)
Kia tapu tou Ingoa
(Sacred is your Name)
Kia tae mai tou rangatira-tanga.
(Bring us Your Chiefly rule);
Kia meatia tau e pai ai
(May it happen in the way that is to You, good)
ki runga i te whenua,
(may it happen on earth)
kia rite ano ki to te rangi.
(In the same way as in spirit world).
Homai ki a mātou aianei
(Give us now)
he taro mā mātou mo tēnei ra.
(The food we need this day).
Murua o mātou hara
(Strip us of our sins);
Me mātou hoki e muru nei
(Give us back what we have lost);
i o te hunga e hara ana ki a mātou.
(So that we, the slaves of sin, may be with you again).
Aua hoki mātou e kawea kia whaka-waia;
(Do not lead us into temptation);
Engari whaka-orangia mātou, i te kino:
(May we be whole, away from things evil);
Nou hoki te rangatira-tanga,
(Through your chiefly position, is)
te kaha,
(the power)
me te kororia,
(and the glory).
Ake, ake, ake.
(Forever and ever)
Āmine.
(Amen)</p>

            <p>The Lord's my shepherd; I'll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God's house forevermore
And in God's house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be.</p>

            <p>Saviour, again to Thy dear Name we raise
With one accord our parting hymn of praise;
Guard thou the lips from sin, the hears from shame,
That in this house have called upon thy name.

Grant us thy peace, Lord, through the coming night;
Turn thou for us its darkness into light;
From harm and danger keep thy children free,
For dark and light are both alike to thee.

Grant us thy peace throughout our earthly life,
Peace to thy church from error and from strife;
Peace to our land, the fruit of truth and love;
Peace in each heart, thy Spirit from above.

Thy peace in life, the balm of every pain;
Thy peace in death, the hope to rise again;
Then, when thy voice shall bid our conflict cease,
Call us, O Lord, to thy eternal peace.</p>

            <p>The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended,
The darkness falls at Thy behest;
To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
Thy praise shall hallow now our rest.

We thank Thee that Thy Church unsleeping,
While earth rolls onward into light,
Through all the world her watch is keeping,
And rests not now by day or night.

As o'er each continent and island
The dawn leads on another day,
The voice of prayer is never silent,
Nor dies the strain of praise away.

The sun, that bids us rest, is waking
Our brethren 'neath the western sky,
And hour by hour fresh lips are making
Thy wondrous doings heard on high.

So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
Like earth's proud empires, pass away:
But stand, and rule, and grow for ever,
Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.</p>

            <p>God, that madest earth and heaven,
darkness and night,
who the day for toil has given,
for rest the night;
may thine angel-guards defend us,
slumber sweet thy mercy send us,
holy dreams and hope attend us,
this livelong night.

Guard us waking, guard us sleeping;
and, when we die,
may we in thy mighty keeping
all peaceful lie;
when the last dread call shall wake us,
do not thou our God forsake us,
but to reign in glory take us
with thee on high.</p>

            <p>Lord God of morning and of night,
We thank Thee for Thy gift of light;
As in the dawn the shadows fly,
We seem to find Thee now more nigh.

Yet, whilst Thy will we would pursue
Oft what we would we cannot do
The sun may stand in zenith skies
But on the soul thick midnight lies

O Lord of lights, ‘tis Thou alone
Canst make our darkened hearts Thine own;
O then be with us, Lord, that we
In Thy great day may wake to Thee.

Praise God our Maker and our Friend;
Praise Him through time, till time shall end;
Till psalm and song His name adore
Through heavens great day of evermore.</p>

            <p>I am the bread of life.
they who come to me shall not hunger;
they who believe in me shall not thirst.
No one can come to me
unless the Father draw him.

Refrain:
And I will raise them up,
and I will raise them up,
and I will raise them up on the last day.

The bread that I will give
is my flesh for the life of the world,
and they who eat of this bread,
they shall live for ever,
they shall live for ever.
Refrain:

I am the resurrection,
I am the life.
They who believe in me
even if they die,
they shall live for ever.
Refrain:

Yes, Lord, we believe
that you are the Christ,
the Son of God,
who has come
into the world.

            <p>O My Soul, arise and bless your maker,
For He is your Master and your Friend.
Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy;
Worship the Saviour, Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>King of grace, His love is overwhelming;
Bread of Life, He’s all I’ll ever need,
For His blood has purchased me forever:
Bought at the cross of Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>And I will sing for all my days
Of heaven’s love come down.
Each breath I take will speak His praise
Until He calls me home.</p>
        
            <p>When I wake, I know that He is with me;
When I’m weak, I know that He is strong.
Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on:
Safe on the Rock of Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Stir in me the songs that You are singing;
Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen.
Give me faith to move in works of power,
Making me more like Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>Then one day I’ll see Him as He sees me,
Face to face, the Lover and the loved;
No more words, the longing will be over:
There with my precious Jesus.</p>
