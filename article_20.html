Event producer, musician and artist Daniel Belton looks forward to being part of two multi-media shows in one night at this year's Dunedin Arts Festival. Video, Audio

            <p>Two shows, one night - but how to describe them?</p>
        
            <p>Daniel Belton is one of the principal brains behind Pōtaka Nautilus and Pepe; two dance films, which are also concerts for four of Aotearoa's finest exponents of taonga pūoro, and also come with a light show.</p>
        
            <p>Oh, and the venue itself is also one of the performers, according to Belton.</p>
        
            <p>Belton spoke with RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump ahead of the performances in Dunedin's Glen Roy Auditorium on Saturday 29 March.</p>
        
            <p>As a film projects a video of the two dances into the auditorium - Pepe (Te Reo for moth) and Pōtaka Nautilus (inspired by native NZ land snails) - a taonga pūoro quartet of Ariana Tikao, Dr Ruby Solly, Mahina-Ina Kingi-Kaui and Alistair Fraser will perform live over the top of an electronic sound bed.</p>

            <p>The two shows require a cast of about 30, gathered together by the production outfit Good Company Arts which Belton founded and runs with his partner in life and art, Donnine Harrison.</p>
        
            <p>The pair specialises in putting on multimedia shows in all sorts of venues around the world, from factory walls to art galleries.</p>
        
            <p>Belton says each venue is part of the artwork in itself, and the "wonderful" Glen Roy space is no exception.</p>
        
            <p>Does that mean the performance is a one off?</p>
        
            <p>"Yes and no," says Belton. While a different venue will make for a different show, Pepe and Pōtaka Nautilus could be just as effective in an old warehouse, or the side of a factory wall.</p>
