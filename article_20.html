Ain'a that good news!
I've a crown up in the Kingdom,
Ain'a that good news!
I'm a-goin' to lay down this world,
Goin' to shoulder up my cross,
Goin' to take it home to Jesus,
Ain'a that good news!

I've a harp up in the Kingdom,
Ain’a that good news!
I've a harp up in the Kingdom,
Ain't that good news!
I'm a-goin' to lay down this world,
Goin' to shoulder up my cross,
Goin' to take it home to Jesus,
Ain'a that good news!

I've a robe up in the Kingdom,
Ain'a that good news!
I've a robe up in the Kingdom,
Ain'a that good news!

I've a Saviour in the Kingdom,
Ain'a that good news!

            <p>O clap your hands together, all ye peoples:
O sing unto God with the voice of melody.
For the Lord most high is to be feared:
he is the great King over all the earth.
He subdued the peoples under us,
and the nations under our feet.
He chose our heritage for us,
even the glorious land of Jacob whom he loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise,
and the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God:
O sing praises, sing praises unto our King.
For God is the King of all the earth:
sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the nations:
God sitteth upon his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together
with the people of the God of Abraham:
For the rulers of the earth belong unto God;
he is the very highly exalted.</p>

            <p>Give to our God immortal praise:
mercy and truth are all his ways;
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.

Give to the Lord of lords renown;
the King of kings with glory crown:
his mercies ever shall endure,
when lords and kings are known no more.

He built the earth, he spread the sky,
and fixed the starry lights on high:
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.

He sent His Son with power to save
from guilt and darkness and the grave;
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat his mercies in your song.</p>

            <p>In the Lord is my joy and salvation
He gives light to all his creation.
In the Lord is my joy and salvation,
He gives peace and true consolation.</p>

            <p>Through all the changing scenes of life,
in trouble and in joy,
the praises of my God shall still
my heart and tongue employ.

O magnify the Lord with me,
with me exalt his name;
when in distress to him I called,
he to my rescue came.

The hosts of God encamp around
the dwellings of the just;
deliverance he affords to all
who on his succour trust.

O make but trial of his love;
experience will decide
how blest are they, and only they
who in his truth confide.

Fear him, ye saints, and you will then
have nothing else to fear;
make you his service your delight;
your wants shall be his care.

To Father, Son and Holy Ghost
The God whom we adore
Be glory, as it was, is now
And shall be evermore.</p>

            <p>Lord Jesus Christ shall I stand still
And stare at You hung on the tree
Or shall I move to where You move
And die and live again for me
Shall I to sin and failure cling
Consorting with the guilt I hate
Or on Your shoulders shall I fling
The wrong I breed and contemplate.

Shall I Your story read and tell
To note Your mark on history
Or shall I make Your story mine
And live by faith and mystery
Shall I embrace the love You show
And covet this sweet holy thing
Or of that love shall my heart speak
My hands relate my being sing.

Shall I retreat from where You fall
And seek a safer path through life
Or shall I meet You in the world
Where peace is scarce injustice rife
Lord Jesus Christ the God who lives
To love and die and rise again
Make me the who and You the why
Your way the how and now the when.</p>

            <p>Where the road runs out and the signposts end,
where we come to the edge of today,
be the God of Abraham for us;
send us out upon our way.

Refrain
Lord, you were our beginning,
the faith that gave us birth.
We look to you, our ending,
our hope for heaven and earth.

When the coast is left and we journey on
to the rim of the sky and the sea,
be the sailor’s friend, be the dolphin Christ,
lead us on to eternity.
Refrain:

When the clouds are low and the wind is strong,
when tomorrow’s storm draws near,
be the spirit bird hov’ring overhead
who will take away our fear.
Refrain:</p>

            <p>O for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that always feels Thy blood
So freely shed for me.

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer’s throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

A humble, lowly, contrite, heart,
Believing, true and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
From Christ who dwells within.

A heart in every thought renewed
And full of love divine,
Perfect and right and pure and good,
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love.</p>
