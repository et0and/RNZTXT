            <p>Jazz musician Mike Nock is in his 80s, but he's not looking to stop performing and composing any time soon.</p>
        
            <p>"That's just what I do, it's just my language ... You can call it my work, you can call it my play, you can call it my interest."</p>
        
            <p>"And you try to do it with as many good musicians as you can, and you hope that a lot of people hear the stuff."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's Bryan Crump caught up with Mike Nock to congratulate him on his upcoming induction into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame at this year's APRA Silver Scroll Awards on 8 October.</p>
