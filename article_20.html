            <p>Christ is alive, and the universe must celebrate,
and the stars and the suns shout on this Easter Day!
Christ is alive, and his family must celebrate
in a great alleluia,
a great alleluia
to praise the power that made the stone roll away.

Here is our hope: in the mystery of suffering
is the heartbeat of Love, Love that will not let go,
here is our hope, that in God we are not separate,
and we sing alleluia,
we sing alleluia
to praise the power that made the stone roll away.

Christ Spirit, dance through the dullness of humanity
to the music of God, God who has set us free!
You are the pulse of the new creation's energy;
with a great alleluia,
a great alleluia
to praise the power that made the stone roll away.</p>

            <p>Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son;
endless is the victory, thou o'er death hast won;
angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
kept the folded grave clothes where thy body lay.

Refrain:
Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,
Endless is the vict'ry, thou o'er death hast won.

Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
Lovingly he greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing;
for her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.
Refrain:

No more we doubt thee, glorious prince of life;
life is naught without thee; aid us in our strife;
make us more than conquerors, through thy deathless love:
bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above.
Refrain:</p>

            <p>The day of resurrection!
Earth, tell it out abroad;
the Passover of gladness,
the Passover of God.
From death to life eternal,
from earth unto the sky,
our God hath brought us over,
with hymns of victory.

Our hearts be pure from evil,
that we may see aright
the Lord in rays eternal
of resurrection light;
and listening to his accents,
may hear so calm and plain
his own "All hail!" and, hearing,
may raise the victor strain.

Now let the heavens be joyful!
Let earth her song begin!
The round world keep high triumph,
and all that is therein!
Let all things seen and unseen
their notes in gladness blend,
for Christ the Lord is risen,
our joy that hath no end.</p>

            <p>Low in the grave He lay
Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day
Jesus my Lord!

Refrain:
Up from the grave He arose,
With a mighty triumph o’er His foes
He arose a victor from the dark domain,
And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
He arose! He arose!
Hallelujah! Christ arose!</p>
        
            <p>
Vainly they watch His bed
Jesus, my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead
Jesus my Lord!</p>
        
            <p>Refrain:

Death cannot keep his prey
Jesus, my Saviour!
He tore the bars away
Jesus my Lord!
Refrain:</p>

            <p>The Lord is ris'n indeed:
Now is His work performed;
Now is the mighty captive freed,
And death's strong castle stormed.

The Lord is ris'n indeed:
Then hell has lost his prey;
With Him is ris'n the ransomed seed
To reign in endless day.

The Lord is ris'n indeed:
He lives, to die no more;
He lives, the sinner's cause to plead,
Whose curse and shame He bore.</p>

            <p>Where the light of Easter Day
shines through our life, then faith can say,
Christ is living, Christ is moving,
Christ is changing all the world.
Here is God's good kingdom!

Where the yeast of love will rise,
bubbling with God's new enterprise,
Christ is living, Christ is moving
Christ is working through the world.
Here is God's good kingdom!

Where the harvests ripen in peace,
where all the sounds of gunfire cease,
Christ is living, Christ is moving,
Christ is healing in the world.
Here is God's good kingdom!

Where the Spirit's flame burns bright,
where there is health and truth and light,
Christ is living, Christ is moving,
Christ will resurrect the world.
Here is God's good kingdom!</p>

            <p>Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!
our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!
who did once upon the cross, Alleluia!
suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia!

Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia!
unto Christ, our heavenly King, Alleluia!
who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia!
sinners to redeem and save. Alleluia!

But the pains which he endured, Alleluia!
our salvation have procured. Alleluia!
Now above the sky he's King, Alleluia!
where the angels ever sing. Alleluia!</p>

            <p>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain,
and hath redeemed us to God by his blood,
to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength,
and honour, and glory, and blessing.
Blessing and honour, glory and power,
be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>
