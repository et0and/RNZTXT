            <p>For Monique, leaving the quartet is a bittersweet time.</p>
        
            <p>"String quartet is such a beautiful, beautiful relationship family. You tour day in, day out, rehearse day in, day out, having many deep conversations about music and life."</p>
        
            <p>"[NZSQ members] Rolf, Gillian and Helene, they are some of the most inspiring and humane people that I've ever had the opportunity to make music with."</p>
        
            <p>"It is like moving out of home, but I'm still going to be there cheering them on. And with Pete coming in, I know it's going to be an exciting new chapter as well for the quartet."</p>
