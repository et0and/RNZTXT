            <p>All people that on earth do dwell,
sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell.
Come ye before him and rejoice.

Know that the Lord is God indeed;
without our aid he did us make;
we are his folk; he doth us feed,
and for his sheep he doth us take.

O enter then his gates with praise;
approach with joy his courts unto;
praise, laud, and bless his name always,
for it is seemly so to do.

For why? The Lord our God is good;
his mercy is forever sure;
his truth at all times firmly stood,
and shall from age to age endure.

To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
The God whom Heaven and earth adore,
From men and from the angel host
Be praise and glory evermore.
Amen.</p>

            <p>Come, ye thankful people, come,
raise the song of harvest home;
All be safely gathered in,
ere the winter storms begin.
God our maker doth provide
for our wants to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple, come,
raise the song of harvest home.

All the world is God’s own field,
fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown
unto joy or sorrow grown.
First the blade and then the ear,
then the full corn shall appear;
Lord of harvest, grant that we
wholesome grain and pure may be.

Then, thou Church triumphant come,
raise the song of harvest home;
all be safely gathered in,
free from sorrow, free from sin,
there, forever purified
in God’s garner to abide;
come, ten thousand angels, come,
raise the glorious harvest home.</p>

Words/Music: Psalm 111/Martin Neary
I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart
secretly among the faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great
sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
His work is worthy to be praised, and had in honour
and his righteousness endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works
that they ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him
he shall ever be mindful of his covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works
that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement
all his commandments are true.
They stand fast for ever and ever
and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people
he hath commanded his covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.</p>

            <p>We plough the fields and scatter
the good seed on the land,
but it is fed and watered
by God's almighty hand,
He sends the snow in winter,
the warmth to swell the grain,
the breezes and the sunshine,
and soft refreshing rain.

Refrain:
All good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above
then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord
for all His love.

He only is the maker
of all things near and far.
He paints the wayside flower,
He lights the evening star.
The wind and waves obey Him,
by Him the birds are fed;
much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.
Refrain:

We thank Thee, then, O Father,
for all things bright and good,
the seed-time and the harvest,
our life, our health, our food.
No gifts have we to offer
for all Thy love imparts,
but that which Thou desirest,
our humble, thankful hearts.

            <p>For the beauty of the earth,
For the beauty of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
over and around us lies:
Refrain:
Lord of all, to thee we raise
This our joyful hymn of praise.

For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,
Sun and moon and stars of light:
Refrain:

For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above,
For all gentle thoughts and mild:
Refrain:

For each perfect gift of thine
To our race so freely given,
Graces human and divine,
flow'rs of earth and buds of heav'n:

            <p>He leadeth me: O blessed thought!
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

Refrain:
He leadeth me, he leadeth me;
by his own hand he leadeth me:
his faithful follower I would be,
for by his hand he leadeth me.

Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
sometimes where Eden's flowers bloom,
by waters calm, o'er troubled sea,
still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.
Refrain

Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,
nor ever murmur nor repine;
content, whatever lot I see,
since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

            <p>O my Spirit, arise
    Listen carefully,
    To Jesus' question:
    Do you have love?

    I have brought you
    out of captivity,
    I give you life:
    Do you have love?

    Great is my compassion
    instilled within me –
    He says, “Be like me”
    Do you have love?

    There is a throne for you
    and boundless glory;
    He keeps asking,
    Do you have love?

    It was the Lord
    Who died for me,
    Teach me Lord
    To love honestly
    Amen</p>

            <p>Now thank we all our God
with heart and hands and voices,
who wondrous things has done,
in whom his world rejoices;
who from our mothers' arms
has blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love,
and still is ours today.

O may this bounteous God
through all our life be near us,
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us,
to keep us in his grace,
and guide us when perplexed,
and free us from all ills
of this world in the next.

All praise and thanks to God
the Father now be given,
the Son and Spirit blest,
who reign in highest heaven
the one eternal God,
whom heaven and earth adore;
for thus it was, is now,
and shall be evermore.</p>
