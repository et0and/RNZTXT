            <p>New Zealand composer Salina Fisher can thank the radio for her latest big break.</p>
        
            <p>The choreographer, Jessica Lang, was listening to a classical station in her car when Fisher's music came on.</p>
        
            <p>Lang, always on the lookout for new music to dance to, was hooked.</p>
        
            <p>The next thing, she's asking Fisher if she can use not one, but three of her pieces for her next work, "Black Wave", which had its premiere in Seattle with the Pacific Northwest Ballet last Friday 20 September.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from Seattle to RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Fisher was still buzzing after seeing her music become a ballet.</p>
        
            <p>For "Black Wave", choreographer Lang chose three of Fisher's existing works: "Kintsugi" for piano trio, "Heal" for string quartet, and her orchestral work "Rainphase".</p>
        
            <p>Fisher told Crump it was overwhelming to hear and see her music "interpreted and embodied by these incredible dancers".</p>
        
            <p>Crump asked her when she planned to write music specifically for a ballet.</p>
        
            <p>A bit too soon to say, Fisher replies, but the experience of seeing dancers moving to her work has certainly inspired her.</p>
