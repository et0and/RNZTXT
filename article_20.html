            <p>A heartfelt tribute to a "southwestern gentleman" has earned singer-songwriter Holly Arrowsmith the 2024 APRA Best Country Music Song award.</p>
        
            <p>The South Island musician's alt-country ballad 'Desert Dove' was inspired by the loss of her grandfather, who owned an antiques shop in Sante Fe, New Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>He was once invited to Elvis Presley's house to trade belt buckles and had a home filled with "amazing things", like a sabre-tooth tiger skull, Arrowsmith told Music101.</p>
        
            <p>"He was really just like a true cowboy, you know, in my mind as a child. I looked at him like this kind of larger-than-life figure that embodied this country Americana folklore kind of style."</p>
        
            <p> This audio is not downloadable due to copyright restrictions. </p>
        
            <p>Arrowsmith's grandparents' house was an "anchor point" for her during her childhood, as she moved multiple times, including from the United States to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Whenever she stayed there, she would hear a dove cry out every morning, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the sound I would wake up to. I would get up and my grandma would be making breakfast and my grandpa would be outside feeding these beautiful birds.</p>
        
            <p>"Years later, when he passed away, I heard the same dove in New Zealand, and every time I hear it - and I hear it everywhere, I've heard it all over the world, this same bird - I get hit with a memory which is almost a memory of a feeling."</p>
        
            <p>The song was further inspired by a 12th-century poem about hearing a dove cry out and being reminded of sadness.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just blown away to find this poem that was speaking about the same bird and the same feeling that this bird evoked 900 years ago."</p>
        
            <p>The song will be featured on an upcoming album produced by Tom Healy.</p>
        
            <p>Arrowsmith said it was a "real honour" to be recognised at the music awards.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second time she was given the award for best country music song, following her win in 2019 for Slow Train Creek. </p>
