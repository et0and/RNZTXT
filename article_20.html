            <p>Breony Bearman first wanted to become a singer when as a girl. She saw a woman in a beautiful blue dress wow an audience with her voice.</p>
        
            <p>But a few years into her tertiary study she gave it away, depressed and disillusioned. Not so much with music, but with what she felt her voice couldn't do.</p>
        
            <p>Now the Waikato-based soprano is back on stage again, taking top place in this year's Lockwood New Zealand Aria competition held in Rotorua earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Speakling to RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump, Bearman says her success is confirmation of her decision to return to singing after ten years spent raising thee children, with a bit of livestock breeding on the side.</p>
        
            <p>She says motherhood helped break down her perfectionist streak, which got in the way of her enjoying her singing.</p>
        
            <p>Bearman decided to return to music after the death of a nephew, whose funeral brought home to her not just the importance of music, but that she had a gift which helped lift the spirits of others.</p>
        
            <p>She overcame her nerves and enrolled in post-graduate study at Waikato University with teacher (and fellow soprano) Anna Leese, where her skills and confidence continue to grow, although she still has to deal with a bit of 'imposter syndrome'.</p>
        
            <p>Crump asked Bearman if she wore blue when she won the NZ Aria Competition.</p>
        
            <p>No, green is her favourite colour, and these days it's less about being that woman in blue taking the limelight but - through her voice - being part of something bigger than herself.</p>
