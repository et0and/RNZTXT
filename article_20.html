        <h2>C. Zukey: On creating music from grief</h2>
        <p>
Auckland musician C. Zukey wrote the album Stonefruut after his wife sustained a serious brain injury during childbirth.  Audio
</p>
        
            <p>C. Zukey’s new album Stonefruut was inspired by a family tragedy when the birth of his son led to his wife sustaining a severe brain injury. </p>
        
            <p>Zukey is a Canadian-born New Zealand alternative musician from Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>His son Bastian was born five years ago, he tells Charlotte Ryan.</p>

            <p>“Bastian was a big baby, he was also a bit late and because of that, Lydia was induced.</p>
        
            <p>“From the start of labour, it was really quite intense for hours. And then once Bastian was born, Lydia suffered just catastrophic haemorrhaging.”</p>
        
            <p>The blood loss was so serious Lydia was unable to get the oxygen to her brain, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“So that caused severe global brain damage. It's been five years now and I feel like now we're in a pretty good place. Lydia is doing pretty well, she's home now finally, after staying at a brain injury rehab centre for many years.”</p>
        
            <p>He poured the intense grief he experienced into Stonefruut, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“I had a bit of a writer's block for a long time. And then, after Lydia's injury, I suddenly had just this huge well of inspiration. And because of that, I just wanted to write it all down.</p>
        
            <p>“And so, I just kept writing, and I just wrote so many songs. And I'm really, really proud and really happy with what I've created.”</p>
        
            <p>While Lydia is home now, she is non-verbal and non-mobile, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“She is able to interact, and she is able to smile and laugh and understand jokes and listen to music and cry.”</p>
        
            <p>Stonefruut captures the gamut of emotions he experienced following Lydia’s injury, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“There are songs that are depressing, there are songs that are angry and there are songs that are a little bit bargaining, or in denial a little bit.</p>
        
            <p>“And then there are songs that are more in the acceptance stage.”</p>
        
            <p>He didn't set out to make a “depressing” album, he said.</p>
        
            <p>“I wanted to make sure that there was still hope, that you could still hear the hope in the songs. So even the more depressing songs on the album, there's always a little glimmer of hope.”</p>
        
            <p>The hope comes from accepting the darkness, Zukey said.</p>
        
            <p>“Sometimes you have to let the darkness in. Once you let yourself experience that darkness and that grief. That's the first step to recovery.” </p>
