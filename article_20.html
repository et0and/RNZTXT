            <p>It was set up in 2014 to help breath life into the Christchurch brass band scene - at least in the city's northwest - and it's still going strong.</p>
        
            <p>Nor'west Brass is celebrating its tenth anniversary at a concert in Christchurch's Transitional Cathedral on 23 March.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the gig, RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump spoke with Bill Vail, who helped set up the band, and current musical director, Nic Scott.</p>

            <p>Nor'west Brass is actually four bands in one, depending on player ability.</p>
        
            <p>If you can "play six notes" on an instrument, you qualify for the entry-level group the Bright & Breezy Beginner Brass (aka the 4Bs). Next level up is the Cyclones - with all that youthful enthusiasm, bound to be the most raucous of the ensembles. Then there's the Zephyrs, and finally the Nor'west main band. </p>
        
            <p>From small beginnings, the bands now have over 70 members.</p>
        
            <p>For Vail, it was important the band provided opportunities for people new to brass bands as well as confident players, and he's been pleased not just with the number of children, but adults starting up with the group.</p>
        
            <p>However, after ten years, Vail is more than happy to hand over the role of Musical Director to Nic Scott, who - when not leading Nor'west's top band - plays tuba in the New Zealand Army Band.</p>
        
            <p>It was the full-time Army Band job that lured Australian Scott to Christchurch, but it's the city's rich music scene that's kept him here. </p>
        
            <p>He's amazed a city of Christchurch's size can sustain a full-time symphony orchestra, something his previous home  Newcastle in New South Wales couldn't.</p>
        
            <p>And thanks to the efforts of groups like Nor'west Brass, Christchurch's musical outlook remains lively, especially in the brass section.</p>
