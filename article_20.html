            <p>Jumping over the channel - to continental Europe - where you would likely hear this omnipresent albums in every cafe and boutique was Air’s Moon Safari. Yadana took a step back, inviting listeners to discover the roots of this sound in Air's earlier work, particularly their EP Premier Symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>Air - Le Soleil est pres de moi </p>
        
            <p>Kid Loco is another exponent of this particular sound. A Grand Love Story probably sat alongside this album, a few DJ-Kicks comps, some Ninja Tune releases and Ibiza/balearic/Cafe del Mar releases. His contribution to this style helped carve out a space where eastern musical influences and ambient textures could coexist.</p>
        
            <p>Kid Loco - Love Me Sweet</p>
        
            <p>Next up on Yadana's playlist is a local compilation.  It "occasionally drifts into my brain so I’m super thrilled to play a track of this".</p>
        
            <p>Superfoot -Tough in the Sky</p>
        
            <p>"I just absolutely could not omit the ears and talent of Andy Morton AKA Submariner - one of my fave local producers whose tunes just do not age!".</p>
        
            <p>Nia Archives - So Tell Me</p>
        
            <p>Wrapping up the session, Yadana shared a more contemporary track that has been on repeat throughout her summer road trips: Nia Archives' So Tell Me With its roots in jungle and a nod to classic UK rave culture, Nia’s sound represents a forward-thinking fusion of electronic and reggae influences.</p>
        
            <p>"If we had time I’d play Doin’ Time" by Lana Del Ray "instead here’s Nia Archives which has been on repeat on the summer road trip car stereo". </p>
        
            <p>More tracks Yadana recommends: </p>
        
            <p>Dimmer - Drop You Off</p>
        
            <p>Yonderboi-Riders of the Storm</p>
        
            <p>K&D sessions - Useless</p>
        
            <p>Portishead- Mystereons</p>
