        <h2>The Mixtape - Martin Kwok: behind the sound in Beatles ‘Get Back’ and ‘Dune: Part Two’</h2>
        <p>
As Dune: Part Two opens in cinemas this week one pair of ears will be tuning in more than most - those of Wellington based, Emmy award winning sound editor Martin Kwok. Audio
Martin was the sound editor on the film, and prior to that he worked on Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary Get Back, supervising the careful restoration of audio from the original album recording. Audio
Martin gives Maggie Tweedie a glimpse of what goes on behind the sound in blockbuster films, and as a DJ and record collector, he picks some fine tunes for the Mixtape this week.  Audio
