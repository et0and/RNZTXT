            <p>Stan Walker has a message for Māori in his new new single, 'Māori Ki Te Ao': "This is to say, ‘man, you're incredible. You're amazing. Our reo is amazing. So spread it wide, and far’.”</p>
        
            <p>The song, which premiered on RNZ earlier this week, celebrates his identity as a "passionate" Tūhoe man, Walker tells Charlotte Ryan on Music 101.</p>
        
            <p>“This song is paying homage but [is] also my love letter to my Tūhoe side, to my Tūhoetanga, where I come from."</p>
        
            <p>Walker wrote the song with his uncle, Donny Te Kanapu Anasta, and called on three generations of Tūhoe whanau, including his uncle Tāme Iti, to help create the song and film the video in Ruatoki.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a project that doesn't belong to me,” Walker says.</p>
        
            <p>“It belongs to everybody that was involved. Uncle Tāme, my nephews, my uncle, my cousins, my mates that made this come to life. Having them in the video was incredible."</p>
