            <p>One of the most exciting developments in the New Zealand choral scene in the past few years has been the rise of the Pasifika ensemble the Signature Choir, led by Helen Tupai.</p>
        
            <p>The choir’s performances of songs from around the Pacific, accompanied by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, have blown audiences away in Wellington and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Now Helen Tupai is one of the organisers of a competition set up to foster new Pasifika choral talent beyond the Wellington-based Signature ensemble.</p>
        
            <p>It’s called the Musika Moana Choir Competition, it’s open to Pasifika choirs from across Aotearoa, there's a prize pool of $100,000 and registration has just opened.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Tupai spoke with RNZ Concert’s Bryan Crump.</p>
