            <p>The Auckland Philharmonia and Auckland Stardome are combining forces for a new musical and astronomy show: "Strings under the Stars".</p>
        
            <p>The Philharmonia provides the music, while Stardome's Planetarium provides the visual action, in a twelve-show season which begins tomorrow night (19 September).</p>
        
            <p>The orchestra's Assistant Concertmaster, violinist Miranda Adams, is one quarter of the musical forces along with her daughter Charmian Keay (also on violin). Viola player Ben Harrison and cellist Ashley Brown make up the rest of the group.</p>
        
            <p>Adams told RNZ Concert host Bryan Crump that they'll play string quartet arrangements of three movements from Holst's "Planets Suite" along with a work specially written for the event by New Zealander Kirsten Strom.</p>
        
            <p>She also told Crump about her own family connections to astronomy through her uncle (and amateur comet hunter) Ken Adams, and - among other things - why she believes there's life out there. </p>
