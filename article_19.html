        <h2>Albanese follows Ardern down the aisle</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Analysis: When Jacinda Ardern wed long-term partner and fishing enthusiast Clarke Gayford last month, at a picture perfect vineyard in New Zealand's windswept Hawke's Bay region, the nuptials made global headlines.</p>
        
            <p>The marriage of the photogenic couple had been delayed by the Omicron variant of Covid-19, and Ardern was no longer Kiwi prime minister when she tied the knot.</p>
        
            <p>Anthony Albanese's future union is unlikely to feature as prominently, given the veneration of Ardern by the world's press.</p>
        
            <p>And the fact she was the bride.</p>
        
            <p>But there is novelty in his decision to pop the question after a romantic Valentine's Day dinner, getting down on bended knee (one imagines) on the balcony of the prime minister's official Canberra residence.</p>
        
            <p>In the middle of a parliamentary sitting week, no less, with first pooch Toto likely loitering nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Albanese is the first Australian prime minister to become engaged while in the top job, and only the third to take office without being married.</p>
        
            <p>He had separated from Carmel Tebbutt, a former New South Wales state politician, in January 2019 - before he became Labor leader in the wake of the party's 2019 election loss.</p>
        
            <p>Julia Gillard was unwed when she became PM in 2010, moving into The Lodge with then-partner Tim Mathieson and repeatedly brushing off questions about a potential union.</p>
        
            <p>John "Black Jack" McEwen was a widower when he was sworn in as Australia's 18th prime minister in December 1967, after the disappearance of Harold Holt - his wife Annie having passed away 10 months prior.</p>

            <p>While a prime ministerial wedding might be a unique event, Albanese and Haydon aren't alone in formalising their partnership.</p>
        
            <p>There were 127,161 marriages in Australia in 2022, according to the Bureau of Statistics - figures for 2023 aren't public yet.</p>
        
            <p>Haydon has been a fixture alongside Albanese throughout his time as Labor leader, and as prime minister, prompting speculation about their future.</p>
        
            <p>She took to the stage at the Canterbury-Hurlstone Park RSL Club with Albanese's son Nathan, as the now prime minister declared victory in the 2022 election.</p>
        
            <p>And as he charged a glass to the ties between the United States and Australia during a state dinner at the White House last October, Albanese gave a nod to Haydon's presence.</p>
        
            <p>"I only have one regret about tonight, which is I'm not quite sure how I top this for date night with Jodie at anytime, anywhere in the future," he quipped.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps a ceremony and reception in the grounds of The Lodge might hit the mark?</p>
        
            <p>The role of Australian prime ministerial spouse may not be as a high profile as, say, those who occupy the White House.</p>
        
            <p>But many prime ministers have made a point of citing their partner's support while holding the top job.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Morrison, for example, regularly referenced the sage advice of his wife, Jenny, during his term of office - sometimes copping criticism for doing so.</p>
        
            <p>Just last month, the prime minister was being grilled by Sydney radio jock Kyle Sandilands about when he would be "putting a ring on that missus".</p>
        
            <p>"What I am not doing is discussing my relationship on Kyle and Jackie O," he replied.</p>
        
            <p>"These things are all private, I'm entitled to a private life."</p>
        
            <p>Well, private until you publish it on social media and invite crews to The Lodge to show off the ring (which the PM helped to design, with the expertise of a jeweller in his electorate).</p>
        
            <p>Even as the engagement well-wishes flow in the first few hours since the prime minister's announcement on social media, the obvious next question is when the wedding might happen - asked of many freshly betrothed couples.</p>
        
            <p>Could it be a pre-election celebration, with a poll bounce on the prime minister's gift registry?</p>
        
            <p>Or would Albanese wait until after polling day, to ensure the marriage doesn't clash with politics?</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have those discussions, between us ... but we just want to live in the moment at this point," the prime minister said in response to questions on the date.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only been 24 hours!" Haydon laughed.</p>
        
            <p>Whatever the plan, it's probably a little early to be sending out "save the date" cards.</p>
