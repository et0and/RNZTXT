            <p>Ravyn Lenae, a neo-soul artist from Chicago, first caught attention as a teenager with her 2015 EP Moon Shoes. Her early collaborations with artists like Steve Lacy and Noname helped cement her place in the alternative R&B scene.</p>
        
            <p>Lenae's distinct falsetto and eclectic mix of R&B and pop have captivated fans, and her latest record, Bird's Eye, offers an intimate exploration of her personal relationships.</p>
        
            <p>The album opens with 'Genius', a melodic synth-pop track that sets an upbeat tone while delving into themes of lost love.</p>
        
            <p>In 'One Wish', Lenae teams up with Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) for a track that, rather than being a traditional love song, reflects on her relationship with her father and a missed 10th birthday party.</p>
        
            <p>DJ Dahi's production work introduces a reggae-like rhythm to the album, evident in tracks like 'Candy'.</p>
        
            <p>Known for his work with Kendrick Lamar and SZA, DJ Dahi brings a fresh, synth-driven sound to Lenae's music.</p>
        
            <p>Another highlight is her collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, which features a track that seamlessly blends pop and R&B.</p>
        
            <p>'Dream Girl' stands out with its experimental percussion, creating an ethereal, floating sensation.</p>
        
            <p>While Bird's Eye is a delightful listen, it occasionally feels like it plays it safe.</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless, Ravyn Lenae's boundless soprano and the album's experimental beats create an engaging experience that is sure to leave listeners satisfied.</p>
