            <p>For a growing number of young people, home ownership seems like an out of reach dream.</p>
        
            <p>But at just 19 years old, Taylor Henderson bucked the trend by buying his own house - and he renovated it himself as well.</p>
        
            <p>The once-rundown character cottage that used to sit in Lower Hutt is now in Featherston.</p>
        
            <p>The now 22-year-old told Checkpoint the do-up had been a labour of love and he used his years of savings to buy the cottage mortgage-free.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a funny one, just driving past on my way to work on the way home and there's some furniture on the side of the road. I ended up picking it up and I noticed the garage was open.</p>
        
            <p>"I decided to have a look and see who's here and ended up chatting to the owner and they wanted to get rid of the house."</p>
        
            <p>He said he originally wanted to buy and move only the garage, as it would have been an easier project, but he became interested in buying the cottage instead.</p>
        
            <p>
There has been speculation that the house is the oldest house in Lower Hutt.

            <p>Moving the cottage involved more than he thought initially, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a complete rebuild pretty much, 30 years of neglect and no one living in it for a long period of time, it had rot."</p>
        
            <p>He said due to him relocating the house out of the district, he had to build the house as a new build.</p>
        
            <p>"In the end it turned out well, so another 200 years."</p>

The cottage was completely rebuilt, he said.

</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not need to take out a mortgage on the house as he had saved enough to buy it outright.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been working for as long as I can remember, just doing little things for pocket money and I've had good strong parents who've helped me save my pocket money.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long time in the pipeline just saving money, I was three years in my building apprenticeship when I bought the house, I had money from working as well."</p>
        
            <p>He found the cottage in Lower Hutt and decided to relocate the cottage due to his choice of lifestyle, Henderson said.</p>

            <p>"It was in my best interest really to move it out of the district just due to the nature of Lower Hutt, there's no culture or character in the houses, so I moved it into a quieter sort of country town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sort of back in its era, back in its place, in my opinion, back in the lifestyle block. I've got sheep and chickens roaming around."</p>
        
            <p>He said he chose to relocate the cottage to Featherston due to being close to Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>"It just seemed right to be a little bit closer to the city where you know there's a lot of my work."</p>
        
            <p>Henderson said his parents have been very supportive.</p>
        
            <p>"They said it was a great idea, they gave me a lot of advice and guidance and physical help on the house, it was an A-Team effort.</p>

Doing up the cottage was a labour of love.

</p>
        
            <p>"It's been three years of my free time and my weekends, rebuilding this cottage and so that was alongside my full-time job.</p>
        
            <p>"Somehow you manage, if you're driven enough. Obviously I care so much about this house and the history of it."</p>
        
            <p>He said there has been speculation that the house is the oldest house in Lower Hutt, and was built by one of the first settlers in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand really isn't that old. It only has 200 years of history. So it's quite hard because they didn't really document a lot of history."</p>
        
            <p>He said although he could not find much history on the cottage, he has had help.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been in touch with a historian who's guided me along the way, dating the house. I've tried my best to keep it as historically accurate as I can."</p>
        
            <p>He said his parents have inherited some heirloom pieces of furniture to go inside the cottage.</p>
        
            <p>"I've also just come across pieces online on Facebook and TradeMe and I just pick and choose what looks right and what fits."</p>
        
            <p>His friends like the house, but it is different to what they are used to, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they love it. It's definitely not the norm, so it's probably a bit different to them.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an old off-the-grid sort of lifestyle, so it's not by any means easy, but that's sort of what makes it interesting."</p>

Taylor Henderson spent months working on the house.
