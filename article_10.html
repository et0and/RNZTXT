            <p>Young actors Joyena Sun and Sepi To'a are making their feature debut in Grafted.</p>
        
            <p>They tell Jesse Mulligan the film explores the sometimes-dangerous need for social acceptance amongst a culturally diverse group of young New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>In Grafted, Sun plays Wei - a Chinese student newly arrived in Auckland after her father's death and struggling hard to fit in.</p>
        
            <p>Without a role model and afflicted with facial disfigurement, Wei takes her desire for social acceptance "to extreme lengths and extreme heights", Sun said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite some gore, the film delivers laughs with a lot of jokes Kiwi audiences will enjoy, she said.</p>
        
            <p>If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, Sun reckons you'll be really into Grafted.</p>
        
            <p>"It deals a lot with humanity and human nature and what happens when you're faced with a really difficult situation, what that forces us to do out of survival instincts."</p>

            <p>When it came to character-building, Sun and To'a say that Sasha Rainbow - the LA-based Kiwi director of Grafted - gave them many opportunities to contribute.</p>
        
            <p>After their very first meeting, To'a said Rainbow asked her for tips on the Polynesian slang her character Jasmine would use and also the Polynesian food she would eat.</p>
        
            <p>"I said she'd probably say 'sis' more. Then when I got the audition she had changed exactly what I told her. She put in 'sis' at the end of the lines and she had panikeke [Samoan banana pancakes] as, like, her main dish. I was like 'Wow, she actually listened'."</p>
        
            <p>Jasmine, like Wei, deals with her own cultural and religious expectations, To'a said.</p>
        
            <p>"You get to see her dealing with racism, just having different-coloured skin and hair, looking differently. She can see how Wei is feeling, being the new girl, the immigrant of the country."</p>
        
            <p>To'a, who "bounces" between Australia and New Zealand for work, was struck by how much happened in her personal life during the year-long development of Grafted.</p>
        
            <p>"You grow as a person and then you come back and you watch your 18-year-old self having her first shot at this big acting thing. You can't be mad at yourself. You're looking at it like 'Wow, so proud'. So much growth has happened."</p>
        
            <p>Worked with a female director for the first time and seeing a woman in a position of power on set was really inspiring, To'a said.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought 'Wow, I don't just have to be an actor. I can be behind screens and writing these words and helping girls grow as actors'."</p>
