            <p>Ngāti Tūwharetoa / Te Arawa powerhouse Anna Coddington's bilingual waiata 'Kātuarehe' has taken out the top Silver Scroll award this year.</p>
        
            <p>The awards were hosted by Lisa Tomlins and Bret McKenzie at Wellington's St James Theatre on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Translated as "to be outstanding, marvellous", the single was co-written by Noema Te Hau III, Ruth Smith, Kawiti Waetford.</p>
        
            <p>The track was born through Reo Māori Song Hubs, a camp for musicians to advance the use of te reo Māori, and is included on Coddington's new album Te Whakamiha.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a song that lifts spirits and confidence, and clearly resonated with the Aotearoa APRA membership who voted it to be the winning song."</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old has been in the top 20 Silver Scroll shortlist four times since 2010, and was among the top five finalists in 2013 for 'Bird In Hand'.</p>

            <p>In another Reo Māori Song Hubs success, Jordyn with a Why's 'He Rei Niho' took home the Maioha Award. The song was created at the music camp by Ruth Smith, Kawiti Waetford, Jordyn Rapana, and Dan Martin.</p>
        
            <p>Descending from Whāingaroa, Mulifanua Lalovi, Falelatai and Vaimoso, Rapana's song is a reflection of her journey to reconnect with her roots. Inspired by Lizzo and Bruno Mars, it is a celebration of tāera Māori, or 'Māori style'.</p>
        
            <p>Composer Nathaniel Otley was awarded the SOUNZ Contemporary Award for his exploration of the movement of the waters surrounding Aotearoa in 'the convergence of oceans'.</p>
        
            <p>Otley created the piece as part of his 2023 composer in residence position with the NZSO National Youth Orchestra, which he felt suited the ocean theme.</p>

            <p>Multi-award-winning composer Karl Sölve Steven dominated the screen awards section, winning Best Original Music in a Feature Film Award and Best Original Music in a Series Award, alongside two composition collaborators.</p>
        
            <p>His work with Rob Thorne on local true crime series Black Coast Vanishings - a true crime series delving into the ongoing mysteries surrounding the disappearance of six people in the west coast community of Piha - took the music series award.</p>
        
            <p>Steven's compositions alongside Jason Smith on feature documentary Never Look Away were awarded the best music in a feature film award.
