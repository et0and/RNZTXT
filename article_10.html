        <h2>Kiwis turn their backs on turkey and choose chicken for Christmas</h2>
        <p>
New Zealanders will be 'laying it on chick' this Christmas Day, according to a new survey. Audio

Chicken will be the most popular protein for Christmas 2024, says Toby Hillium from the meal-planning startup Appetise.

            <p>For many Kiwi families, it will not be a "traditional roast chook" on the table, though, says Toby Hillium, cofounder of the meal-planning app Appetise.</p>
        
            <p>To make the Christmas meal pop, many chefs will add Asian flavours to their chicken centrepiece, he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"People are finding new ways to jazz [chicken] up and make it a bit more special, like bringing in new flavour sensations and some inspiration from around the globe."</p>
        
            <p>At about $25 for four people, a chicken main is "a pretty cheap way to feed a lot of people," Hillium said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're looking at a turkey, you could be looking anywhere around that kind of $50 range so it can be quite a substantial difference to feed a large group."</p>
        
            <p>With less than seven weeks until Christmas Day, Appetise Insights quizzed its 55,000 members on their festive grocery plans.</p>
        
            <p>Looking back at three years of data on food spending, it found that this year New Zealanders were spending less on food service and a bit more on groceries for cooking at home.</p>
        
            <p>Many Kiwis have now left behind the "typical meat and three veg" idea of meals, Hillium said, and the most popular recipes on Appetise were Mexican, Japanese and Korean-inspired.</p>
        
            <p>Fusion dishes - in which people "mash together some of their favourite cuisines" are very popular with the addition of Asian flavours the most popular way to go.</p>
        
            <p>He recommended the addition of a swicy (sweet + spicy) sauce like the "amazing" Korean condiment gochujang (고추장).</p>
        
            <p>Staying home to cook your own favourite 'fakeaways' - "basically recreating your favourite takeaway at home" - is a great affordable dinner option, Hillium said.</p>
        
            <p>Two very popular and easy-to-make recipes on its app are Butter Chicken Lasagna and Big Mac Smash Tacos.</p>

Butter Chicken Lasagne is a popular recipe from the Christchurch-based meal planning service Appetise.

            <p>Rather than getting down about having a limited budget this Christmas, many Kiwis were inspired by the challenge of making a special meal that did not cost the Earth, Hillium said.</p>
        
            <p>While some Christmas hosts can spend up to $75 on a high-end three-course meal that included salmon and premium cuts of meat, he said many Christmas cooks will manage to serve up a special meal for much less.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing some pretty amazing innovation and craft from some of our more budget-conscious families who are able to get a per head cost of $18 to $22 for appetiser, main and dessert."</p>
        
            <p>Many Kiwi home chefs kick off their Christmas meal planning after Halloween, Hillium said, and this was a wise move.</p>
        
            <p>"Start early. Be prepared. Look for great deals and enjoy. Food is supposed to be delicious, fun, exciting and shared with friends so whatever you put out on the table, be proud of it."</p>
