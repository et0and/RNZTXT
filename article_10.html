        <h2>I thought it was the worst' - How an old-school tattoo style made a comeback</h2>
        <p>
A style of tattoo, popular in the 1970s and 1980s, has re-emerged as a major trend for tattoo artists. Audio

            <p>When Stefan 'Spider' Sinclair, the founder of Auckland's Two Hands Tattoos, first saw the style of fine-line tattoos that uses a single needle, he didn't like it.</p>
        
            <p>"When I first got into the industry in the late 90s, early 2000, a lot of the older guys I worked with were still working in that style, I honestly hated it. I thought it was the worst," Sinclair told Culture 101's Perlina Lau.</p>
        
            <p>He associated the sketch-like tattoos that utilised fine shading and grey scaling with the baby boomer generation.</p>
        
            <p>The more popular tattoos of the 1990s and 2000s favoured bold lines and colours. However, about a decade ago he started seeing the single-needle style in a new light and started experimenting.</p>
        
            <p>Sinclair, who splits his time between LA and Auckland, is now known for his single-needle, fine-line tattoo work with clients coming from around the world to have his designs inked on them.</p>
        
            <p>The style he is known for features prominently, as Two Hands Tattoos celebrated its 20th anniversary through two events: a retrospective exhibition that runs until February 20 and a tattoo convention this weekend with 40 tattoo artists coming from around the world. Both events are at Studio One Tu Toi in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Typically, tattoos were created with seven, nine or 11 needles, leading to the bold look that pops on the skin.</p>
        
            <p>However, needles were not available to inmates in California prisons where fine-lined tattoos first appeared. They used a sharpened guitar string instead and the lines were thin by default.</p>
        
            <p>"It created a very very fine line and very soft shading..." Sinclair said.</p>

            <p>The technique was first commercialised by a tattoo artist called Jack Rudy who set up shop in LA in the 1970s.</p>
        
            <p>Rudy was asked to replicate the look people were seeing on former inmates so he created a single-needle machine.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason I started doing it was because it was very much a lost art form. It had fallen very much out of fashion," Sinclair said.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it looks very nostalgic. To us it looks very California in the 1970s, 80s kinda feel."</p>
        
            <p>Swapping styles wasn't the only change Sinclair had experienced in his 20-plus-year career.</p>
        
            <p>The stigma associated with tattoos had almost completely dissolved, which created good and bad ripple effects.</p>

            <p>"The main change is that the taboos associated with being tattooed has really disappeared, so I think as it became less and less of a barrier to employment, less and less your mum telling you off for getting a tattoo, I think more and more people have gotten tattooed to a point where it is very mainstream culture now."</p>
        
            <p>"I would say there is not a lot of an obvious tattoo community now as there once was... it was a bit more of a tribe back in the day."</p>
        
            <p>"...these days, people from all walks of life, every industry, everyone in whatever political mindset or whatever have tattoos."</p>
        
            <p>Social media had also opened up the work of tattoo artists who no longer had to rely on images stuck to their shop's front window to show their portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>This had fuelled different trends in what clients were after. At the moment, fine-line tattoos were one of the more popular styles.</p>
        
            <p>"There are multiple clear trends that tend to get more popular and then slightly less popular over time but it takes a very long time," Sinclair said, adding that tattoo trends were far slower than, say fashion trends.</p>
        
            <p>"The trends tend to last for a very long time and they don't disappear completely."</p>
