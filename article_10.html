            <p>Run out of stuff to watch? Join us as we dig deep into the streamers' catalogues for shows worth your time. This week's watch: Scream Queens.</p>
        
            <p>Scream Queens is a satirical, high-camp slasher series where the most traumatic elements of the horror genre are made the butt of the joke. Set at the fictional college campus of Wallace University, season 1 follows members of an elite sorority as they're terrorised by a serial killer disguised as the school's Red Devil Mascot. In similar premises, the threat of death would be a terrifying prospect. But creator Ryan Murphy's commitment to satire never makes it more than a comical inconvenience - like in episode 1, for example, where a ditzy one-off character played by Ariana Grande live-tweets her murder as it's happening.</p>

            <p>The show is fronted by a triad of bitchy sorority girls - Chanel Oberlin (Emma Roberts), the self-professed 'Queen of Kappa Kappa Tau' is the worst of the lot. As president of the sisterhood, what she says goes, and her minions - referred to only as Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) and Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) - have no choice but to comply. Their quest to make Kappa a house of glamour, beauty and evil is thwarted by a colourful cast of characters, including the whip-smart Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis), dopey frat boy Chad Radwell (Glen Powell), and incompetent security guard Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash).</p>
        
            <p>Scream Queens' strength lies in its punchy humour and killer dialogue. Often, characters are put in ridiculous situations, where they face death by deep fryer or lawn mower, all as a commitment to the gag. It's a perfect stress-reliever show. Of course, the jokes might not be for everyone (it can get crass and problematic), but you might find yourself bursting into laughter anyway, even if you feel guilty about it later. If you're in the mood for something dark, camp, and funny as hell, Scream Queens could be the one for you.</p>

            <p>American Horror Story: An anthology series taking place at several haunted locations, where the living and the dead interact. Horror, but with plenty of theatrical eccentricity.</p>
        
            <p>Glee: An optimistic high school teacher ropes in the school's outcasts to form a glee club. Full of music, drama, comedy and cringe.</p>
