        <h2>What 40+ men need to know about their health</h2>
        <p>
From the age of 40, men are wise to start keeping an eye out for two big yet "preventable" health issues - cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer, says Dr Nick Oscroft. Audio

            <p>From the age of 40, men are wise to start keeping an eye out for two big yet "preventable" health issues - cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer, says Dr Nick Oscroft.</p>
        
            <p>"We're often nabbing blokes [for check-ups] when they come in with their injuries or things that are perhaps a little bit more safe to talk about.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important that guys are a little bit vulnerable and a little bit real and that doesn't mean pulling out tiny little violins but just being human," the Wellington community GP tells RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Oscroft sees himself as a family doctor - a role he says is "under significant threat" these days.</p>
        
            <p>"As a sector, it's hard for us to be available as we'd like to be. You do build these things over time, and ideally, you're catching a person when their father is passing away or they're having their first kids and you're growing old with them.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a little bit of a romantic ideal but there's hard evidence that it's tremendously beneficial. We really know that having a relationship with a GP leads to a longer life. There's good research on that. If you want to boil it down to dollars, $1 invested in primary care saves $14 in downstream costs."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Oscroft said around 40 percent of the ill health he sees in men over 60 - including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and vascular dementia - is due to cardiovascular disease.</p>
        
            <p>"People often don't realise that the clogging up of your arteries is one of the major avoidable causes of memory loss and dementia."</p>
        
            <p>Cardiovascular disorders definitely impact sexual function, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"One, you've got to get fuel through to the penis, and so if your blood vessels are blocking off that doesn't help … Also there's some stress in times of life. We can't talk about sexual function without talking about stress … The ancestors who stopped for a shag were selected against. They were killed from the gene pool."</p>
        
            <p>For Pākeha men, 40 is a good time to start checking heart health - via a blood test with your GP, cholesterol and sugar level and blood pressure checks.</p>
        
            <p>Māori, Pasifika and Indian men, who have a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular issues, do well to start getting these check- ups earlier - in their 30s.</p>
        
            <p>As we age, blood pressure climbs yet isn't symptomatic until it becomes dangerously high so it's good to check on this annually, Dr Oscroft said.</p>
        
            <p>"That doesn't have to be necessarily a structured, formal check. There's plenty of opportunities. If you're in the pharmacy you can get your blood pressure checked. [There's also checking at the] Heart Foundation and sometimes out at supermarkets or community events."</p>
        
            <p>When blood pressure is too high, medication offers "risk mitigation", he says, but lifestyle also plays big a big role.</p>
        
            <p>"Salt intake has got a big impact on your blood pressure so limiting that, eating healthy food, exercise, limiting alcohol intake and smoking - all those boring things that the GP talks about all the time. I don't think it's particularly cutting-edge or sexy but it's a real thing."</p>
        
            <p>Alongside heart health, hearing loss and loneliness are also important to watch out for with dementia prevention, Dr Oscroft says.</p>
        
            <p>To guard against hearing loss, although it may sound obvious, he recommends avoiding loud noises and keeping yourself active and engaged in listening and hearing.</p>
        
            <p>"The brain needs input to calibrate all its various different functions, and that input is auditory and also social. So if you're isolated, loneliness is a factor on its own. Understandably, hearing loss contributes to loneliness. You get the double whammy there."</p>
        
            <p>From the age of 45, Dr Oscroft encourages men to get a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer.</p>
        
            <p>PSA is a protein from prostate tissue that all men have in their bloodstream, he says, and in the absence of prostate cancer symptoms - such as reduced or strained urine flow and blood in your urine - a normal level is "reasonably reassuring".</p>
        
            <p>Unlike cervical screening and breast screening, though, there are some definite pitfalls to prostate screening, Dr Oscroft says, which can show elevated PSA levels after recent exertion.</p>
        
            <p>Despite these, he personally believes it's a useful screening tool.</p>
        
            <p>"You can cause a bit of harm if it's falsely elevated definitely but if guys have got symptoms of their prostate functioning abnormally it's worth getting there and checking in on that."</p>
