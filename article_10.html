            <p>A humble food truck at the bottom of the country has taken out the top spot in the Burger Nation competition.</p>
        
            <p>Peake's Kitchen is run by a husband-wife duo, Tom and Nicole Peake, in the tiny coastal town of Papatowai in the Catlins.</p>
        
            <p>Their winning burger features hand-ground Hereford steak patties, house-made Peake relish, and pinot noir-pickled beetroot.</p>
        
            <p>The team were ecstatic when they heard the news, Nicole told RNZ's Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just been a really great vibe all around today, that's for sure."</p>
        
            <p>The burger is a classic American-New Zealand hybrid to reflect Kiwi Tom and Nicole's heritage, Tom said.</p>
        
            <p>"We start with a buttermilk bun that we get specially made for us. We have a hand-ground patty that we use two types of beef, we use a couple of different techniques to get it right the consistency."</p>
        
            <p>The burger has American and New Zealand cheese, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we have our two types of cheese. We use an American cheese and New Zealand cheese to sort of bring Nicole and my heritage together."</p>
        
            <p>The burger is finished with Pinot Noir pickled beetroot they make themselves, McClure's pickles and "a few of our own secret sauces".</p>
        
            <p>The two met in working hospo in Dunedin and came to Papatowai, population 40, to take on contract work.</p>
        
            <p>They fell in love with the place, Tom said.</p>
        
            <p>"And end up falling in love with the place. We end up buying a little house here, and just starting our own business and our dream."</p>
        
            <p>The burger has resonated because it's a classic done well, Nicole said.</p>
        
            <p>"What this burger really captures, is the craftsmanship, the technique, the passion and dedication that goes into every single component to make this burger what it is. It's just a really delicious, juicy cheeseburger."</p>
