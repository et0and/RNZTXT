            <p>We're used to superheroes saving the day. But who rushes to rescue them in their hour of need? It's a question Disney has been wrestling with ever since Avengers: Endgame triumphantly wrapped up the decade-long box office dominance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Endgame didn't just represent the conclusion of the MCU's ambitious and revolutionary 10-year, three-phase storyline. The film also acted as the endpoint of the wider public's interest in spandex-clad superbeings. It may be the second-highest-grossing film of all time but every Marvel movie since has been a box office disappointment or a bonafide flop.</p>
        
            <p>One exception to the cinematic downward spiral of Marvel's superheroes has been the two Deadpool flicks which came out in 2016 and 2018 and are the epitome of popcorn-munching, big-screen entertainment. These two movies were everything Marvel Studios' bubble-wrapped MCU weren't.</p>
        
            <p>They were violently chaotic, foul-mouthed adventures, dripping in irony and meta-awareness. Nothing was off limits. Not even nudity. The films were slapped with R-16 ratings, but that only increased their appeal. Especially when compared to the tepid PG-13 ratings of the MCU.</p>
        
            <p>Producer and star Ryan Reynolds was able to get away with all this because Disney couldn't make Deadpool movies, despite owning Marvel. The movie rights to the character had been sold to rival studio 20th Century Fox in 2000. Even if Disney wanted to make Deadpool they couldn't.</p>
        
            <p>This all changed in March 2019, after Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, obtaining the rights back. A month later, Avengers: Endgame took over the world. Riding high, Marvel seemed in no rush to use them.</p>
        
            <p>How times have changed. With fortunes flailing, superhero interest at an all-time low and Reynolds' persistent social media campaigning to bring Deadpool into the MCU, Marvel decided to swing for the fences and began writing cheques. It's the second-most expensive Marvel film of the post-pandemic era and is rumoured to be the most expensive R-rated movie ever made.</p>
        
            <p>On opening day it looks promising. Reynolds is a master of hype and has been hitting every promo opp going. Thinking outside the box he generated worldwide headlines when he revealed the name of his and wife Blake Lively's new baby, Olin, at the film's premiere in New York last week.</p>
        
            <p>For her part, Lively turned up at the premiere in a daring, Deadpool-red catsuit that saw everyone from gossipmongers like E! Online right through to stuffy old Hello! running photos and stories promoting the film.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Social media is also abuzz, especially over fan favourite Hugh Jackman being lured out of superhero retirement to once again suit up as the gruff hero Wolverine and with photos of Lively and her bestie, supermodel Gigi Hadid, in their striking, hero-coloured outfits at the premiere.</p>
        
            <p>Advance critic response has been mixed, with the film being equally praised and derided for its barrage of endless in-jokes, gory hyper-violence and constant mocking humour.</p>
        
            <p>For its part, the movie is well aware of the expectations lumbered upon it and does its best to subvert them, with Deadpool even quipping that he is 'Marvel Jesus', here to save the MCU. A joke that's funny because it's true.</p>

            <p>But it looks like he might just be able to pull it off. People aren't just talking about the new Marvel film, they're talking about going to see the new Marvel film. That kind of excitement hasn't been seen in a long time. The movie's opening weekend is projected to be massive. There's even talk of box office records being broken.</p>
        
            <p>The billion-dollar question is whether it is the cure for superhero fatigue, or if it's merely a band-aid on a bigger wound. Marvel has brought out the big guns. They need Deadpool & Wolverine to hit.</p>
        
            <p>* Deadpool & Wolverine is in cinemas now.</p>
