            <p>You can trace much of the Christensen family's 144-year-old farming history through the items on display at the Mount Bruce Pioneer Museum located in the heart of their dairy property.</p>
        
            <p>It started with milking machines, which dairy farmer Henry Christensen started collecting in the 1980s. </p>
        
            <p>Among other items like washing machines, a telephone exchange, old record player, and commercial butter-maker, the machines would go on to form the backbone of the museum in 1986.</p>
        
            <p>It took him over 50 years to bring together the collection, thought to number in the tens of thousands.</p>
        
            <p>It's grown over the years, with Henry being gifted items from estate sales or purchasing them off other local collectors.</p>
        
            <p>"It keeps going alright," Henry told Country Life on a tour of the museum.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the oldest items would be over 100 years old."</p>

            <p>Not afraid to leave his own mark on history, Henry was also an early adopter of new technology such as the rotary shed and he built the first in Wairarapa.</p>
        
            <p>Told it wouldn't last more than a month, 50 years later it's still used for milking - though the deck is admittedly "pretty thin in some places".</p>
        
            <p>That pioneering spirit lives on in Henry's son Jason, who now runs the family farm which was first purchased in1879. Jason is the fifth-generation in charge.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah it's pretty special," Jason told Country Life. "It was one of those earlier blocks that was divvied up in the 1800s. We've stayed here ever since."</p>

            <p>Fernhill, a 562-hectare farm nestled in the foothills of the Tararua Range, runs just under 300 Jersey cows for milking.</p>
        
            <p>Before taking on the farm, Jason spent over a decade working as a ranger for the Department of Conservation, primarily on Mana Island off the Kāpiti Coast and later out of Waikanae.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyday was different, it's a bit like farming. One day you could be greeting visitors, the next day you could be head down, bum up doing a whole lot of maintenance."</p>
        
            <p>As the job changed to become more "officebound" and Henry started thinking about retiring, Jason made a return to the family farm.</p>
        
            <p>"I came home for the quiet life," he says, adding it was one of the best decisions he has ever made.</p>
        
            <p>His time spent in the bush proved influential in his approach to running the farm, continuing much of the conservation efforts started by Henry.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad started early on, fencing off the river and bits of pieces. We've exceeded that to date and [are] trying to beat any regulations.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose a lot of that conservation side is pretty much ingrained in me, or indoctrinated in me, as we used to call it."</p>

            <p>Fernhill recently won two of this year's Greater Wellington Ballance Farm Environment Awards in recognition of the family's conservation efforts.</p>
        
            <p>The farm has a swathe of riparian plantings on its hills and alongside its fenced off waterways. There are also seven blocks of QEII land.</p>
        
            <p>They've used Manuka plantings to help "purify" the water and take more nutrients out. Redwoods and Douglas Fir trees have been planted along waterways to provide shade.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of our catchment group we've discovered heat is one of the biggest issues for our catchment," Jason says.</p>
        
            <p>There are no straight lines, with the plantings designed to replicate nature.</p>

            <p>Many are planted in old Mana Island bait stations - made from novacoil pipes - to protect them from pests species like rabbits, pūkeko and hares.</p>
        
            <p>"It also gives them a good head start because even on these drier summer days, when you do get a bit of dew in the morning it just runs down the side."</p>
        
            <p>Just down the road from Pūkaha National Wildlife Centre in Mt Bruce, which is visible from the farm, Fernhill gets its share of birdlife including passing kākā .</p>
        
            <p>Jason knows such efforts take time though. They've planted about 4000 to 5000 trees each year for the past decade.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everything can happen overnight. You've got to be profitable to be able to afford that green component."</p>
        
            <p>The plantings help offset greenhouse gases generated by the dairy farm.</p>

            <p>"We're just guardians of the land," Jason says.</p>
        
            <p>He thinks, his great-great-grandad who started the farm would be proud to see it's still in the family, though would likely be surprised by the many technological advances.</p>
        
            <p>"Technology has advanced really 10-fold in the last hundred years. The advancements in technology and information gathering in Dad's era has just advanced so much from back then even - early cars and things like that."</p>
        
            <p>All the more reason to keep the Mount Bruce Pioneer Museum running.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be here for some time."</p>
