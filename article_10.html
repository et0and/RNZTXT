        <h2>Movie review: The Strangers - Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
Director Renny Harlin brings nothing new to this first part of his remake of a 2008 Liv Tyler horror, says Simon Morris. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>The Strangers: Chapter 1 is the first part of an extended remake of a 2008 Liv Tyler horror film, directed by the notorious Renny Harlin.</p>
        
            <p>Far from relying on the studio to fund any follow-ups to The Strangers on the strength of its performance at the box office, director Renny Harlin made all three films at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>Harlin is some sort of phenomenon. Of the 40 or so movies he's made, a mere handful are what anyone would call any good - Die Hard 2, Nightmare On Elm Street 4, that sort of thing.</p>
        
            <p>And yet he keeps on being employed, often on projects like this. Despite the title,The Strangers Chapter 1 isn't the first crack at this story.</p>
        
            <p>The original Strangers was a pretty effective horror film, starring Liv Tyler. I don't remember if I even saw it, it was so generic.</p>
        
            <p>But judging from the trailer, it featured pretty much everything Harlin offers in Chapter 1.</p>
        
            <p>Young couple Maya and Ryan drive into town on their way to meet friends somewhere in Oregon.</p>
        
            <p>As always with big city folk in the rural badlands, they find themselves eyed up suspiciously by the locals, who clearly don't cotton to strangers in these parts.</p>
        
            <p>To the surprise of nobody who's ever seen a horror movie, their car's broken down. While they wait for it to be fixed, they'll have to stay the night in a lonely old shack way outside of town.</p>
        
            <p>Miles away from anyone… A stranger? In the middle of the night?</p>
        
            <p>For some reason, neither Ryan nor Maya seem particularly concerned, despite the moody lighting, the sinister background music and the fact they're stuck in the middle of nowhere without transport.</p>
        
            <p>Have they never seen a scary movie? Didn't they think to ask why the only source of music is a turntable and a bunch of scratchy old LPs? What year is this?</p>
        
            <p>And what's that dripping on the table? I thought you asked them to hold the ketchup…</p>
        
            <p>Next thing you know there are sinister figures silently prowling around outside Casa Del Creepy, and occasionally letting themselves in so they can silently prowl around inside too.</p>
        
            <p>There are three prowlers, helpfully named in the credits Scarecrow, Dollface and Pinup. Possibly their true identities will be revealed in Chapter Two or Three.</p>
        
            <p>Given that the plot is basically two people being chased round a shack in the woods by three people in masks, the plot manages to stretch this skimpy material very efficiently.</p>
        
            <p>Every time you think the bad guys have caught Maya and Ryan, they get away.</p>
        
            <p>And every time you think Maya and Ryan have finally escaped, the bad guys catch up with them.</p>
        
            <p>What makes the film so chilling is that there's no reason behind it. Why are they doing this, asks the victim couple in both versions of The Strangers?</p>
        
            <p>But that doesn't explain how Renny Harlin managed to extend this material beyond that first chapter. He's made two more and he's bringing them to your out-of-town cinema shortly.</p>
        
            <p>But just because he's bringing them doesn't mean we have to see them. I think I might take that second option. Next time I won't be here.</p>
