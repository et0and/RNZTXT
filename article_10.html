            <p>Before Dawn is an ambitious, low-budget World War I film made in Western Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Before Dawn opens on a young chap in a trench - The Somme, 1916 - waiting for a dawn attack.</p>
        
            <p>Jim is about 19. He joined up, looking for adventure, leaving his dad back on the farm.</p>
        
            <p>He and his two mates Don and Legs don't want to miss anything. After all, everyone agrees the War'll probably be over by Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Incidentally, don't get too attached to Legs or Don - or indeed most of the people we run into in the course of Before Dawn. We all know what it was like on the Western Front.</p>
        
            <p>Or do we? As the film trots through what we're all too familiar with in a World War One movie - mud, barbed wire, slaughter in No Man's Land, rats, nervous breakdowns and the rest - we wonder why this is being sold as somehow new material.</p>
        
            <p>Have the filmmakers not seen 1917, All Quiet on the Western Front, Gallipoli or even Blackadder Goes Forth? Possibly not. The writer-director, one Jordan Prince-Wright, is in his early 20s, though he's anxious to keep Before Dawn as close to reality as he can.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the material comes directly from diaries kept by the troops at the time.</p>
        
            <p>But as I say, we've been here before. And after decades of more brutal and less sentimental accounts over the years - including Sir Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old - we tend to be sceptical of old-fashioned, Boys Own Paper heroics.</p>
        
            <p>Which is essentially what Before Dawn is selling.</p>
        
            <p>Another problem - one shared with most war films, particularly those set during World War One - is how similar most of the characters look.</p>
        
            <p>They're all young, short-haired, Australian males - and dependent on audiences knowing the actors, maybe.</p>
        
            <p>You may remember star Levi Miller playing Peter Pan a few years ago. But the rest were mostly new to me, and once covered in mud, it was initially hard to tell Archie from Don or Legs.</p>
        
            <p>The exception was the older Myles Pollard playing, as far as I could tell, every sergeant in every war movie ever made.</p>
        
            <p>The performances and direction are generally pretty good within the limits of a routine war-story format.</p>
        
            <p>The best moments though are the details that don't quite fit that format, obviously plucked from real-life diggers' diaries.</p>
        
            <p>Jim's dad's pipe - "take care of it". The nurse refuses to treat a wounded soldier because she's busy with people she can help. The strange anti-climax at the end of the War.</p>
        
            <p>Those are always the details that stick with you in a war story, not the noble heroics. And it's to the credit of Before Dawn that there are enough of these to keep us mildly interested.</p>
