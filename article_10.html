            <p>It's mid-afternoon on a hot autumn day, and I'm on my way to meet Tom Wright at his shop. A New Zealander living in the Big Apple, he cold presses fresh fruit for thirsty New Yorkers every morning.</p>
        
            <p>Tom's journey began humbly on the back of his bike, peddling his product during the pandemic and dropping orders door to door. Now, his juice has become a popular staple in the East Village.</p>

            <p>Located at 75 East Fourth Street, Tom's Juice sits amidst an eclectic neighbourhood rich in pop culture significance - it's home to iconic bagel connoisseurs Russ & Daughters and the setting for Gossip Girl.</p>
        
            <p>Initially making juice at home, Wright had the good fortune of using a friend's spare commercial kitchen, securing seven months of free rent in the West Village - a lifeline for any young entrepreneur.</p>
        
            <p>When the pandemic slowed business and empty storefronts became commonplace, he saw an opportunity in a former ice cream shop in the East Village.</p>
        
            <p>The space came with an unexpected bonus: a walk-in freezer, which he converted into a fridge for the juice.</p>
        
            <p>Inside, the shop's walls are lined with merchandise, a nod to Wright's past as the founder of streetwear brands Shark Week and Loop in New Zealand.</p>

Popular options include watermelon, cantaloupe (rockmelon), pineapple, and pure celery.

            <p>"I've learned so much from those worlds, and it's all very much come back around to Tom's juice," he says.</p>
        
            <p>By the time we reach the fridge, it's later in the day, and his morning rush has passed. We're greeted by a colourful rainbow of juices - each one promising a refreshing burst of flavour.</p>
        
            <p>From a green blend of apple, cucumber, kale, and lemon to pure shots of ginger and lime, Wright's range is as vibrant as it is delicious. Other popular options include watermelon, cantaloupe (rockmelon), pineapple, and pure celery.</p>
        
            <p>His 8-ounce (226g) glass bottles are sleek and simple, catching the eye of fashion houses, restaurants, and producers in New York. He supplies juice to film sets, photo shoots, and musicians - rumour has it, Andr√© 3000 is a fan of Wright's beetroot juice.</p>
        
            <p>"As you know," he reflects, "the characters in New York are something else. It's like a mini movie every day."</p>
        
            <p>In the early days of his business, Wright pedalled an estimated 40km daily, hand-delivering juices. He still bikes every morning to deliver to customers, while others order via rideshare services.</p>

            <p>Over the past year, Tom's Juice has expanded its distribution, introducing fresh ginger-lime shots to 350 delis and supermarkets across New York. Getting these shots on shelves was no small feat. Wright spent over a year figuring out how to get fresh product to market without it expiring in just a few days.</p>
        
            <p>While we chat, he sorts glass bottles for his customers. He prefers glass because it preserves the juice's flavour and because it's part of his recycling initiative. He offers 50 cents for each bottle returned, a game-changer for customers and businesses that Wright supplies.</p>
        
            <p>"If I don't get the bottles back, I find that most people use them around the house."</p>
