            <p>On this episode of Postcards, we venture to the historical mecca of Athens with Vasileios Vrakas - a Greek producer and composer based in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Vasileios takes us on a journey back to his early life growing up in the ancient city exploring the streets with music from discos, electronica, classical and avant-garde.</p>

            <p>My first track, from Irene Papas, was produced by Vangelis and featured on a double album called Odes reimagining traditional Greek and Byzantine music.  </p>
        
            <p>I remember when my dad first played it I immediately recognised the lyrics and melodies but in a universal way.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time I felt a connection with those songs – I had always heard them in church or in a religious celebration, but it was only then that I connected with them.</p>

            <p>I was watching one of our three television channels in the 1980s, and I experienced something incredible when one of the arts shows came on. It was Lena!</p>
        
            <p>Lena Plantanos is a musician, poet and electronic music maker – perhaps even Greece's first female electronic artist.</p>
        
            <p>Back then Athens especially was dominated by discos playing the Greek equivalent of disco known as bouzouki, so hearing her was a revelation.   </p>
        
            <p>At that moment society was on the verge of breaking from the past and the patriarchy.</p>
        
            <p>To have someone like her talking about certain subjects and breaking from societal norms really affect me. It made me think about art and how we see ourselves in the world – plus, to come from a woman's perspective, it elevated me even more.</p>
        
            <p>At the time Athens was undergoing a renaissance. You saw places open where you could go to be part of the post-punk, new wave and avant-garde scenes.</p>

            <p>Fast-forward a few years and Athens was booming, just like most of the world in the 1990s.  </p>
        
            <p>The underground scene was boiling. I remember going to one of the first – and now most iconic – venues, which was called Tessera. It was just around the corner from the house I grew up in.</p>
        
            <p>The club was an X-rated movie cinema transformed into an X-rated playground for all of us serving the gods of rave culture.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, this amazing duo Stereo Nova gave us our first taste of electronica, including lyrics that none of us thought possible at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Continuing in the footsteps of Lena they spoke about everything we were experiencing at that time as suppressed youths, but with a romanticism that only K Beta can.</p>
        
            <p>Around the same time, I saw them live at Tessera, which was before they became big. This time period marked a true beginning – with so many venues, places, and artists simultaneously making and creating.</p>

            <p>A few years later Athens was experiencing another magical era.</p>
        
            <p>We were at the zenith of modern culture and my best friends were hosting a party in Manchester on Fridays and Saturdays and a club called Avant Garde.</p>
        
            <p>It was a legendary venue accommodating the hedonism of the time. It attracted the latest bands, musicians, and DJs where we hosted them as guests among friends, after playing their gigs elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Not long after, my friend started a record label and started releasing electronic music.  </p>
        
            <p>Electroware is an electronic producer who combines electronica with traditional rhythms from one of our Greek beautiful islands.</p>

            <p>After moving to London from New Zealand I came across a new band – made up of the duo of Jim White from Dirty Three on drums alongside legendary Cretan musician Giorgos Xylouris.</p>
        
            <p>Xylouris is from a family of Cretan musicians including his father Psarantonis and late uncle Nikos.</p>
        
            <p>Nikos's voice especially is embedded in the Greek national psyche, with his charisma as a singer and after becoming a voice for the youth alongside students who stood against and died in Athens during the dictatorship.</p>

            <p>This brings me back to my beloved Athens when on a family holiday, I was at The Odeon of Herodes Atticus, one of the oldest theatres in the world – and located under the Acropolis and the Temple of Parthenon.</p>
        
            <p>It is next to the neighbourhood where I grew up and I watched to see Psarantonis' family celebrating Nikos Xylouris’ passing.  </p>
        
            <p>Psarantonis, the head of the family, was accompanied by his three children, Giorgos Xylouris, and his siblings.  </p>
        
            <p>There are no words that carry enough substance to express how important Psarantonis is to me and to the world. Even Nick Cave fell in awe with this man.</p>
        
            <p>When I saw him live with his kids in the oldest venue in Athens under the Acropolis I felt he connected the past and present of this city.</p>
        
            <p>It reaffirmed to me how lucky I have been to know this city which is one of the greatest places ever.</p>
