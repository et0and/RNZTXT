            <p>How many times have you heard the high-pitched whistle notes of Mariah Carey this month? Be honest.</p>
        
            <p>Don't even get me started on Wham!</p>
        
            <p>Christmas music gets a bad rap for being repetitive and annoying - some of it by design - but it doesn't have to be this way.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some festive tunes that will breathe some fresh air into your Christmas playlist.</p>
        
            <p>You're the house that turns on the stereo first thing on Christmas morning, you're also the first house to get a noise complaint from the neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>The Pogues ft. Kirsty MacColl - Fairytale of New York</p>
        
            <p>When we asked around the office for the BEST Christmas song, this Irish folk-inspired tune far outstripped the rest.</p>
        
            <p>Have some of the lyrics aged badly? Yes, but if you're in need of a good cathartic cry, just check out friends and family dancing to the song at the funeral of recently deceased frontman Shane MacGowan.</p>
        
            <p>The Flaming Lips - Christmas at the Zoo</p>
        
            <p>This jingly, crunchy song from The Flaming Lips is perfect counter-Christmas listening. Really, what's more festive than a song about jailbreaking animals out of the zoo?</p>
        
            <p>Look, Christmas isn't always happy - your trifle didn't turn out, your cat toppled the tree - whatever the case, sometimes you just need a good Christmas cry. That's where these tunes step in.</p>
        
            <p>Julia Jacklin - Baby Jesus is Nobody's Baby Now</p>
        
            <p>Shout out to Aussie singer Jacklin for creating such a profoundly sad Christmas song with nothing but a few chords and her beautiful voice.</p>
        
            <p>Sufjan Stevens - Sister Winter</p>
        
            <p>No matter the situation, Stevens WILL bring the soft sad feels. Christmas is no exception.</p>
        
            <p>LCD Soundsystem - Christmas Will Break Your Heart</p>
        
            <p>Even LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy called this a "depressing Christmas song". Enjoy!</p>
        
            <p>No, a break-up Christmas is NOT the same as a sad Christmas. These songs are for people who got their hearts crushed before they even got to exchange presents.</p>
        
            <p>Fall Out Boy - Yule Shoot Your Eye Out</p>
        
            <p>This song is BITTER and sometimes that's what you need when you spent a lot on your partner's new Fitbit and they got you the candle that's been sitting in the cupboard all year.</p>
        
            <p>Sabrina Carpenter - Cindy Lou Who</p>
        
            <p>If you've been cheated on around Christmas time, Carpenter feels your pain. Cindy Lou Who is the perfect mix of self-pity and acrid hate. The best lyric?</p>
        
            <p>"The snows gonna fall and the tree's gonna glisten/And I'm gonna puke at the thought of you kissing"</p>
        
            <p>You said it, girl.</p>
        
            <p>Christmas is about loving AND laughing. Chuck these tunes on for a few festive yuks.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Colbert - Another Christmas Song</p>
        
            <p>Do you think all Christmas songs are repetitive, boring and money-grabbing rubbish? Then this jazzy tune from comedian Colbert's 2008 Christmas special is for you. 'Cause if you're gonna be a hater, at least make it catchy.</p>
        
            <p>Horatio Sanz, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Kattan and Tracy Morgan - I Wish It Was Christmas Today</p>
        
            <p>If you haven't watched this video of SNL greats shimmying yet, now is your chance.</p>
        
            <p>Adam Sandler - The Chanukah Song</p>
        
            <p>Yeah sure, technically this is a Hanukkah song but the festive season is a time for all faiths to come together and this Sandler tune is an absolute bop that everyone can get behind.</p>
        
            <p>Sometime you wanna turn on the classics, but the classics have been played so many times it makes you want to stuff your ears with rum balls. Here are some fresh takes on old faves.</p>
        
            <p>Mac Demarco - It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas</p>
        
            <p>Loveable goof Demarco put out a whole EP of Christmas covers back in 2021 but this 8-bit take on the 1951 classic is particularly adorable.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny's Child ft. Solange - Little Drummer Boy</p>
        
            <p>Did you know that Destiny's Child's second last record was a Christmas album? The mix of carols and smooth early 2000s R'n'B shouldn't work, but it just does.</p>
        
            <p>Bright Eyes - Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</p>
        
            <p>There are a million and one covers of this tune. This one from Nebraska cutie Bright Eyes is soft and swept with subtle strings.</p>
        
            <p>Perfect to fall asleep to on Christmas eve.</p>
        
            <p>Shrek: Home for the Holidays </p>
        
            <p>Sometimes, Christmas music is about very, very specific happy memories. Here's one from ABC News' own Dannielle Maguire:</p>
        
            <p>"This was a promotional CD that was given out way back in 2001 when the first Shrek movie was released on VHS.</p>
        
            <p>The origin story of how my family ended up with a copy is disputed amongst siblings - but what matters is that it's been an integral part of our family's Christmases for more than 20 years. It only has four songs and the whole thing goes for less than 10 minutes, but that's part of its charm. </p>
        
            <p>The best song is undeniably the Shrek-ified Twelve Days of Christmas, which I've heard so many times I no longer know the original lyrics. It may be jarring at first, but after several replays, the shrill festive sounds have drilled their way into your brain and you surrender yourself to the Christmas chaos."</p>
        
            <p>Merry Christmas, and happy listening!</p>
