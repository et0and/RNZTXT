            <p>The kina are out of control. As many as 40 urchins crowd into a single square metre of rock, devoid of other life.</p>
        
            <p>A kina barren is a symptom of an ecosystem out of balance. Could we eat our way to a solution?</p>
        
            <p>Kina numbers have exploded as we've eaten too many of their predators – like big snapper and crayfish – that usually keep them in check.</p>
        
            <p>The urchins munch through kelp and seaweed, leaving bare rock and little else. The kina themselves end up suffering too – they persist in these zones as zombies, eating little and barely producing any roe.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily, these barrens can be reversed and kelp forests restored when the kina are removed.</p>
        
            <p>Kina-nomics involves taking starving kina off reefs, fattening them up and selling them to an East Asian market.</p>
        
            <p>But how can the kina be made more consistently tasty? And can economic and conservation goals really align? </p>
        
            <p>Listen to the episode to dive under the water with a kina harvester, taste some kina, and untangle whether a commercial harvest of these spiky taonga can really fix kina barrens.</p>
