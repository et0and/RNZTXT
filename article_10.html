            <p>Feast your eyes on this - New Zealand's best architecture for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Architectural Designers New Zealand (ADNZ) announced the winners of its national design awards in Rotorua on Friday night. A Waikato house known as 'Chodge' won the Supreme Award, impressing the judges for its walls and ceilings described as "translucent skin".</p>
        
            <p>There were 10 winning architects with projects ranging from small to large homes and townhouses to commercial interiors.</p>
        
            <p>The chief executive of ADNZ, Keryn Davis, described the supreme winner's design from architect Darryl Church as "glowing and glorious".</p>
        
            <p>The design is reminiscent of a woodshed, but instead of the typical harsh corrugated iron shell, its translucent skin allows for a light-filled space during the day. At night, this is reversed with the interior lighting of the 'Chodge' becoming a diffused glow within the dark landscape.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the idea being somewhat tent-like, the holiday home was designed with the energy-saving Passive Haus principles. Large commercial roller doors create an even stronger connecting between outside and inside.</p>

            <p>The National Award for New Home over 300m² went to an off-grid design by Darren O'Neil in Canterbury. Judges called the design "jaw-dropping".</p>
        
            <p>"Considering sustainability at every step from materials selection to their application demonstrates the home's commitment to environmental responsibility without compromising on aesthetics."</p>

            <p>McAlpine's brief was to create a relaxed vibe while also providing room for the client's extended family, which can reach almost 30 people during the summer.</p>
