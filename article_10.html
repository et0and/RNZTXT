            <p>Last month, Tom Robinson announced he was quitting professional rugby saying a series of concussions had left him living in fear - to the point that he would feign injury in order not to be selected.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson spent eight years as a professional rugby player in New Zealand and Japan. He's a former Blues captain, he played for Northland and most recently Toyota Verblitz.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson recently returned to Aotearoa to embark on a life after rugby, with a newfound love of yoga and meditation which he wants to share with others.</p>
        
            <p>The fear of getting concussed built and built in his mind, he told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>"I was afraid to admit that I had this problem, and that this voice in my head was getting the better of me."</p>
        
            <p>The anxiety increased, he said, every time he got a head knock in training or on the field.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd go, 'No Tom, you're fine, it's just in your head.' But there'd always be that voice that would go, 'What if? What if you're not okay?'"</p>
        
            <p>It all became overwhelming, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I got back to Japan, and at this stage, I've just become so sensitive. I was playing, and all I was trying to do was not get any hits to the head. I didn't want to be playing, and the same was happening at training."</p>
        
            <p>Eventually at training he got a "decent hit to the head".</p>
        
            <p>"Not concussed, no symptoms, but I just again, that voice sparked up, the uncertainty. I couldn't take it, and I just walked off."</p>
        
            <p>He went to see the doctor to report a concussion.</p>
        
            <p>"Because that would remove the uncertainty and would mean I wouldn't have to play. I could go through the return-to-play protocols."</p>
        
            <p>The anxiety gradually building in him worsened the situation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember getting to training a couple of days later, and this little voice popped up. I had this thought of, I couldn't actually recall - visualise - myself brushing my teeth.</p>
        
            <p>"And suddenly my mind went, 'Oh, I can't remember if I brushed my teeth, I'm getting memory loss'."</p>
        
            <p>And things just "started to spiral", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because I was so anxious I wasn't sleeping well, and then my mind went, 'Sleep is a symptom of concussion, I'm concussed, getting early onset,' it was just so identified with that voice inside my head."</p>
        
            <p>He hit the wall driving back from a game where he had been watching his teammates play.</p>
        
            <p>"I was having that battle in my mind of, 'Am I getting a headache? No, Tom, you're not. It's just in your mind'.</p>
        
            <p>"And my awning fell off my camper on the highway, and I was picking it up, I remember holding up traffic, and I just got in my van, and I just bawled my eyes out.</p>
        
            <p>"I just called up my family and I said, 'I can't do this anymore'."</p>
        
            <p>He long had an interest in - and had practised, meditation - and this helped him overcome his fears. He has embarked on a programme of yoga teacher training and has gained a sense of peace, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A sense of peace that I've never experienced in life before. I had the dream of becoming an All Black, but I know that nothing in life has ever given me a permanent state of happiness, and nothing in life will until I just learn to make peace with the present moment, with whatever it brings in life."</p>
