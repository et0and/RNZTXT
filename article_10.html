            <p>Review: The Lord of the Rings - A Musical Tale was more than a show, it was a full immersion into Middle-earth. The production captured J R R Tolkien's vast, sweeping narrative in a three-hour spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>The show began with an ingenious prelude that dissolved the boundary between audience and stage. Hobbits roamed through the audience, making us feel like we too were one of the hobbits in the Shire. A game of ring toss between audience hobbits and stage hobbits ensued, with laughter and cheering filling the air. A hobbit playfully bantered with my neighbour, joking over transport methods. Apparently he parked his giant eagle somewhere on Queen Street.</p>
        
            <p>The transition to the show's opening act was seamless, with the ensemble bursting into song and the audience following along singing Happy Birthday to Bilbo Baggins. As we celebrated his "Eleventy one" (111) years of age, the journey began.</p>
        
            <p>We are introduced to hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, and follow them on their mission across Middle-earth to destroy the one ring in the fiery depths of Mount Doom.</p>

            <p>The first act was a feast for the senses with moving performances (by intermission, I had cried four times). The actors' ability to sing, dance, and play instruments, all without missing a beat or showing the slightest vocal tremor, was nothing short of phenomenal.</p>
        
            <p>Visually, the revolving stage was a masterpiece, but it was the scenes set in the Elvish cities that were most enchanting. The sets, illuminated by soft mystical lighting transported the audience straight to Rivendell and Lothlórien. The sound design amplified the immersion with ambient noise that filled the theatre. The design was so captivating that I felt as if I'd crossed a threshold into Tolkien's universe.</p>
        
            <p>While most of the time I was leaning forward, captivated, a scene introducing the Nazgûl had the opposite effect. As smoky tendrils crept ominously across the stage and into the audience, the terrifying Ringwraiths materialised out of the mist. Their jarring movements were chilling and Shelob was pure nightmare fuel.</p>
        
            <p>The second half cranked up the intensity with the introduction of Gollum, portrayed by Tony Bozzuto, who was simultaneously hilarious and haunting. Seeing Gollum sing and dance was bizarrely unsettling but added a unique twist that even longtime fans of the films and books wouldn't have expected. Gollum's guttural melodies in the musical made him even more unnerving and sinister than the film version.</p>
        
            <p>The action scenes were choreographed with electrifying energy, with dramatic slow-motion sequences that seemed to freeze actors midstride under brilliant lighting. Well-timed crescendos rung out as the battles reached a peak.</p>
        
            <p>
Gandalf famously said, "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us". I'm glad I chose to spend mine at this unforgettable show.

            <p>The audience were silent as Sam's infamous act of devotion was portrayed on stage. "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!" he exclaimed as he hoisted Frodo on his back for the final stretch of their journey to Mount Doom.</p>
        
            <p>The final act swept us all into the triumph of Middle-earth's victory. Watching the cast's genuine camaraderie felt like witnessing the bonds of the Fellowship itself.</p>
        
            <p>This cast proved that they know exactly how to bring Tolkien's epic tales to life in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. The actors' dedication, the breathtaking sets, the original musical scores, and the powerful performances combined to create an absolute masterpiece. The only thing I missed was Legolas' long, luscious, flowing blonde hair (something that defined Orlando Bloom's movie portrayal). But in the grand scheme of things, that was a small detail in an otherwise flawless production.</p>

            <p>The Lord of the Rings - A Musical Tale is on at The Civic, Auckland, until 1 December.</p>
