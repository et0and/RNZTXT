        <p>

Under the pen name 'Otto Moon', the filmmaker has penned Sing in the Shower, It's Your Superpower - a self-help book about the emotional benefits of shower singing and why it sounds so good.

            <p>Under the pen name 'Otto Moon', the filmmaker has penned Sing in the Shower, It's Your Superpower - a self-help book about the emotional benefits of shower singing and why it sounds so good.</p>
        
            <p>When his late father Frank became ill a couple of years ago, Florian Habicht moved from Auckland to Northland.</p>
        
            <p>With his "life hack" of singing his heart out in a private karaoke room for a couple of hours now off the table, the filmmaker got back into his teenage habit of singing in the shower.</p>
        
            <p>For someone who fancied themselves a good singer, Habicht rediscovered, shower singing was no less than "a gift from God".</p>
        
            <p>Wondering if anyone had ever written a book about this fun, creative, judgement-free activity, he did some careful research and found they had not.</p>
        
            <p>"I started exploring it deeper and realised why water is such an amazing, magical thing."</p>

            <p>To make the process of writing and illustrating his first book more fun and not so intimidating, Habicht used a pen name. The author of Sing in the Shower, It's Your Superpower: Mindfulness Made Fun for Adult Humans (A Practical Guide) is officially Otto Moon.</p>
        
            <p>In the past, Habicht said, his spirit had been crushed by "often heartbreaking" feedback from friends and colleagues about rough cuts of films he had worked on for years.</p>
        
            <p>"With [the 2003 film] Woodenheads, a friend of mine told me 'Florian, don't put any more time into this'.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had good ones too but most of the time it's really harsh feedback and my world sort of crumbles down."</p>
        
            <p>His first book - which may also be the first book about singing in the shower - was a kind of self-help book, he said, with a bunch of great stories about the magic of water and why, acoustically, shower singing sounded so good.</p>
        
            <p>While a solo session with a karaoke system made him feel like "he can take on the world", their sound quality did not always stack up to the bathroom anyway, Habicht said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the shower, you're guaranteed to sound amazing."</p>
