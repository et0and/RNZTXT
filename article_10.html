            <p>A best selling author in New Zealand and overseas has clinched the ultimate prize at the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults.</p>
        
            <p>Stacey Gregg won the 2024 Margaret Mahy Book of the Year Award on Wednesday night for her novel Nine Girls. The book - set in the tumultuous 1970s and 1980s - draws from Gregg's own childhood in Ngāruawāhia. It follows main character Titch on her search for buried treasure that doubles as a journey into Maori heritage.</p>
        
            <p>Nine Girls knits together history and fantasy with a dose of comedy. It is a change for Gregg, who is known for weaving her love of horses into her writing - including the Pony Club Secrets series, which has sold millions of copies worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>Judges for the awards called Nine Girls "a taonga from a masterful storyteller".</p>
        
            <p>"Vivid and well-developed characters populate a fast-paced, eventful narrative as we follow the young protagonist's journey to discovering her Māori identity," the judges said in a joint statement. "Te ao Pākehā and te ao Māori are equally uplifted as the text explores our bicultural history."</p>
        
            <p>In a RNZ review of Nine Girls following its March, Joanna Ludbrook from Chicken and Frog Bookshop, called the novel a "New Zealand classic that should be in every home, classroom and library".</p>
