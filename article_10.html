            <p>James Mangold's new Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown opens in New Zealand cinemas on 23 January.</p>
        
            <p>In the lead-up, the ABC's Angus Truskett revisits the great musician's 50-year cinematic footprint.</p>
        
            <p>D.A. Pennebaker's landmark fly-on-the-wall documentary doesn't just hold the distinction of being the first-ever "rockumentary" - it was also considered the "only good" one by Kurt Cobain.</p>
        
            <p>Shot intimately on black-and-white 16mm film, Pennebaker chronicles Bob Dylan's seismic 1965 England tour, capturing the pivotal moment when he transitioned from a "voice of a generation" folk hero to a pop-cultural icon.</p>
        
            <p>It's hard to overstate how much Don't Look Back became the blueprint for music documentaries; without it, we wouldn't have Get Back, The Last Waltz or see the genre lampooned in This Is Spinal Tap or Walk Hard. </p>
        
            <p>Come for Dylan's cagey and witty philosophical sparring with journalists, and moments spent with Joan Baez and Donovan, stay for the bizarrely hilarious freakout over a broken glass.</p>
        
            <p>Bob Dylan's greatest trick has been maintaining his status as a cultural icon for more than six decades while remaining an incredibly enigmatic figures. A feat achieved, in part, by rarely granting interviews and spreading deliberate misinformation whenever he did.</p>
        
            <p>This makes Martin Scorsese's relatively straightforward 3.5-hour documentary - chronicling Dylan's arrival in New York City in 1961 through to his controversial, career-pausing motorcycle accident in 1966 - a small miracle.</p>
        
            <p>Scorsese weaves revealing interviews with key figures from Dylan's early days, including with a rare relaxed and unguarded Dylan, with amazing archival footage ranging from the star's high school rock band to the infamous 1966 "Judas!" performance of 'Like A Rolling Stone'.</p>
        
            <p>It's the perfect 101 for anyone intrigued by Dylan but overwhelmed at the thought of diving into his vast and complex legacy.</p>
        
            <p>While not directly about Bob Dylan, the Coen Brothers' melancholic black comedy takes place in the very scene that birthed him: the coffeehouses of Greenwich Village in 1961.</p>
        
            <p>Inside Llewyn Davis follows a week in the life of a struggling, fictitious folk singer, the titular Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac in a career-best performance), reportedly inspired by early Dylan contemporary Dave Van Ronk.</p>
        
            <p>The Coens conjure a dark and brooding mood as we follow the broke, aloof and ever-unlucky Davis on his hopeless odyssey for success in the music world, with almost-always dire results.</p>
        
            <p>Like all of the Coens' works, the film boasts an amazing ensemble, including Carey Mulligan, Adam Driver, John Goodman and one of the greatest on-screen cats of all time: Ulysses.</p>
        
            <p>The second Scorsese-helmed feature on this list, Rolling Thunder Revue differs from its relatively straightforward predecessor by leaning into the self-mythologising and false narratives that Dylan was renowned for.</p>
        
            <p>Part documentary, part fiction, Scorsese chronicles 1975's Rolling Thunder Revue - a tour that saw Dylan and a slew of collaborators travel across North America, playing intimate shows in small venues in smaller towns.</p>
        
            <p>While the documentary initially seems relatively "normal", featuring interviews with Dylan and the folk who toured with him, things take a truly bizarre turn when interviews with people (real or otherwise) who weren't involved with the Revue at all - such as Sharon Stone - are woven in.</p>
        
            <p>The live performances are truly electric (no pun intended), particularly a rousing rendition of 'Isis', which has since become its definitive version.</p>
        
            <p>Best remembered for its Dylan-penned soundtrack, which spawned the legendary 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door', Sam Peckinpah's revisionist Western was a critical bomb upon its release, due to studio interference and re-editing that removed more than 20 minutes from his intended cut.</p>
        
            <p>It has since been restored and reappraised, now regarded as one of the definitive works of the genre.</p>
        
            <p>Dylan makes his on-screen acting debut as a store owner who eventually joins Billy the Kid's (Kris Kristofferson) gang, known only as Alias.</p>
        
            <p>How do you make a movie about Bob Dylan's sprawling, multi-faceted life and do justice to the decade-spanning, often contradictory artist?</p>
        
            <p>Alexander Payne takes a novel and literal approach by having multiple actors portray Dylan surrogates in the collage-like I'm Not There.</p>
        
            <p>The result is like hitting shuffle on a Dylan playlist, as Payne weaves together multiple eras, faces and scenes, creating a tonal poem of Dylan's life and works.</p>
        
            <p>The film evokes and recreates iconic imagery from Dylan's life, featuring the likes of Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and a scene-stealing, twitchy Cate Blanchett.</p>
        
            <p>The result is more admirable than successful, but a worthy experiment in translating Dylan to the screen.</p>
        
            <p>Easily the worst of the films associated with Dylan - including the maligned, nearly four-hour, Dylan-directed Renaldo and Clara - this trashy, campy riff on A Star Is Born is a total 80s nightmare with immense straight-to-video vibes, directed by the late Richard Marquand (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi).</p>
        
            <p>Supposedly created as a vehicle for Dylan, who was suffering perhaps the worst critical reception of his career, he plays washed up rock star Billy Parker, who befriends a young, budding rocker, Fiona, after seeing her cover one of his songs in a dive bar.</p>
        
            <p>The film is odd, incomprehensible and often uncomfortable, but it's worth it just to see the leather-clad, ear-pierced, and most definitely indifferent Dylan incorrectly predict that he won't be "one of those rock singers that wins any Nobel Prize".</p>
        
            <p>The biggest curio on this list, Masked and Anonymous had its inception as a slapstick comedy series inspired by Jerry Lewis, originally pitched to HBO.</p>
        
            <p>Written by director Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Borat) and Dylan himself, the script is allegedly based on a series of scrap notes Dylan had accumulated over the years, made up of lines of dialogue and character names. And it shows.</p>
        
            <p>Set in the not-so-distant future, iconic rock musician Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) is asked to play a benefit concert for a politically divided North America, now under dictator rule.</p>
        
            <p>Bob essentially plays Bob, to no one's surprise, but so does everyone else.</p>
        
            <p>The stacked cast (Penélope Cruz, Val Kilmer, Jeff Bridges) all act or speak like characters from Dylan songs, with each line of dialogue coming off like Dylan-penned verses. Despite all of this, the film, while truly strange, might just be the most honest representation of Dylan on screen.</p>
        
            <p>At the very least it's responsible for this iconic look Dylan debuted at the Masked and Anonymous premiere at Sundance - then replicated by Timothée Chalamet at A Complete Unknown's New York City premiere.</p>
