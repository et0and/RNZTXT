        <h2>Do possums really deserve to be despised?</h2>
        <p>
Kiwis love to hate possums but the introduced marsupials don't deserve cruel treatment just for existing, says a Christchurch academic. Audio

            <p>New Zealand conservationists love to hate possums for killing native birds and spreading disease.</p>
        
            <p>But the introduced marsupials do not deserve cruel treatment just for existing, says Christchurch academic and conservationist Dr Emily Major.</p>
        
            <p>"Possums are here because of colonisation but they're also victims of colonisation too. It's not their fault they were brought here, so why can't we treat them with some compassion?"</p>

            <p>Major's research is founded on speciesism - the biases we have towards non-human animals and how this affects our relationships with them.</p>
        
            <p>Moving to Aotearoa from Canada - where the native Virginia opossum is "kind of revered" for its help in reducing Lyme disease - she was stunned by how harshly Kiwis view the ubiquitous brushtail possum.</p>
        
            <p>For her PhD thesis Possums are as Kiwi as fish and chips, Major interviewed 25 people from various backgrounds about their concepts of possums.</p>
        
            <p>The title - a quote from one of Major's interviewees - references the fact that since being introduced in the 19th century, for better or worse, possums have become part of New Zealand society.</p>
        
            <p>The Predator Free 2050 campaign sends a message that to protect New Zealand's native environment every Kiwi needs to believe "possums are bad", Major says.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to find more compassionate and kind ways of going about [controlling possums] rather than killing en masse and in some ways celebrating and rewarding certain acts of cruelty.</p>
        
            <p>"Not to say that every person that participates in any sort of pest control is cruel. That's not what I'm saying. But as a society, we need to consider what 'humane means' and how that can really become a part of conservation.'</p>
        
            <p>Major finds it "concerning" how children are encouraged to view and treat possums at events like Paparoa Primary School's annual Possum Purge.</p>
        
            <p>"The first time I heard about that was kind of like 'Huh?' … I thought it was so fascinating, in a bad way.</p>
        
            <p>She says she's not criticising children who participate in pest control or the parents but more what is being encouraged on a societal level.</p>
        
            <p>"We're banding together to try to get rid of possums in a way that - in my PhD participants' opinions and in the research that I've done - is not necessarily the healthiest way for [children] to develop their empathy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important that conservation, particularly conservation education and programmes, are thought of and curated really carefully, especially when they include children.  I think just we need an education overhaul, really."</p>
        
            <p>While it's easy to scapegoat possums as 'public enemy number one', human behaviour is the primary reason Aotearoa's native environment is struggling, Major says.</p>
        
            <p>"What really came through in the research was that a lot of the environmental destruction we're facing in New Zealand has to do with anthropogenic or human causes.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that we frame possums in society is 'us versus them'. The possum is the enemy, the human is the hero. This framing is a way for us to cope with the reality of what's happening in the environment."</p>
