        <h2>Vote now for Settling the Score 2024</h2>
        <p>
Tell us about the classical music you love, and why, here.
Then listen to the radio on Labour Day as RNZ Concert celebrates New Zealand's most-loved classical music for 2024.
</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert's classic countdown is a fun way for you to share the classical music you love with our radio audience, and for new listeners to find out a bit more about both the music and the radio station. There is more information about Settling the Score 2024 below the voting form.</p>
        
            <p>On the voting form your first three selections are made from a drop-down list compiled from previous popular STS music choices.</p>
        
            <p>The 'short list' helps more people join in by prompting them with the names of composers and pieces. It also helps us to deliver a day of guaranteed audience favourites. Without a list, we end up with thousands of different pieces each with only a small number of votes.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a 'free choice' where you can type in a favourite piece that is not on the short list. These pieces make up the selection broadcast between 6 - 8pm on Labour Day, can be included in next year's short list, and are considered for further broadcast on RNZ Concert.</p>
        
            <p>While you are voting, you can choose to enter the draw for a double pass to a 2025 concert courtesy of our friends at NZ Trio, New Zealand String Quartet or the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra 
There are also RNZ Concert drink bottles up for grabs - a limited-edition collector's item for the discerning fan!
(Please note: Tickets are for entry to a qualifying performance only. Any related costs such as travel are the responsibility of the ticket holder.) </p>
