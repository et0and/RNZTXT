        <h2>At The Movies: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,</h2>
        <p>
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the prequel to the popular series, sees the young Coriolanus Snow fall in love with a Tribute - one of the contestants in the lethal Games. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>The Hunger Games prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is set 60 years before the events of the first four movies. </p>
        
            <p>Which means, of course, that the familiar characters of the mostly teenage franchise weren’t born yet. All but one – Donald Sutherland’s evil President, Coriolanus Snow.  </p>
        
            <p>Right now Snow’s a callow youth, and the Hunger Games themselves are also a mere shadow of what they’ll become.  </p>

            <p>It’s all a bit low-rent in the Arena. Unlike the casting of the Games creators – Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage chewing the scenery as the lethal event’s showrunners.</p>
        
            <p>It’s a bit depressing watching two hitherto favourite actors stooping to over-salted ham, which both Davis and Dinklage do mercilessly here. </p>
        
            <p>Mind you, what else can you do when your character names are, respectively, Doctor Volumnia Gaul and Dean Casca Highbottom?</p>
        
            <p>Young Snow comes from poor and hungry stock. He’s clearly a scholarship boy – like Napoleon – and has wangled a role mentoring a couple of Tributes – kids who drew the short straw and were drafted into the Hunger Games.</p>
        
            <p>Since the Games – a fight to the death between 24 kids from 12 districts – are a Roman-style bloody spectacle, you’d think that Mentors would be a bit redundant. </p>
        
            <p>But you clearly haven’t seen enough Survivor-type TV contests. And Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is as much about the birth of a hit TV show as it is about Snow turning bad.</p>
        
            <p>This year, it’s decided to give the jaded audiences someone to root for. </p>
        
            <p>From now on just as much time will be spent building a fan base for the contestants – in particular star performer Lucy Grey Baird, played by West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler.</p>
        
            <p>Zegler’s superior musical chops mean she can lean into the music that always underpinned The Hunger Games.   </p>
        
            <p>Unlike Jennifer Lawrence who famously was terrified of singing – though it did give her rendition of “The Hanging Tree” rather a touching quality – Zegler sings like a songbird.</p>
        
            <p>Snow is played by English actor Tom Blyth, who wrestles with two conflicting roles – young lover and villain in waiting.</p>
        
            <p>The first Hunger Games had the benefit of one simple plot.  24 kids are chucked into a giant arena.  Only one can survive.</p>
        
            <p>But this one is saddled with confusing extra elements. Aside from the ‘Lessons in Showbiz’ aspect, there’s the odd-couple pairing of Snow and Lucy Grey, and the added question, should we care?</p>
        
            <p>Do we want an appealing singer-songwriter to get tangled up with the Man Who Will Be Coriolanus Snow?</p>
        
            <p>The best thing in the film is the music – Zegler, of course, but also some crack acoustic musicians, including the great Molly Tuttle on guitar – but it’s no substitute for Katniss Everdeen’s appealing grit and decency.</p>
        
            <p>The basic idea here - watching Snow slowly turning into unsavoury slush – was never going to carry a two-and-a half hour movie, particularly to an audience hungry for the original Hunger Games.</p>
