            <p>Kensington Palace has released a new photograph of Prince George to mark his 11th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>The photo was taken by his mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales, this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Wishing Prince George a very happy 11th birthday today," the Palace's social media account posted alongside the image.</p>
        
            <p>The prince was last seen in public accompanying his father, the Prince of Wales, in Berlin for the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain.</p>
        
            <p>Catherine regularly takes photographs of her family, sharing them on social media to mark birthdays and special occasions.</p>
        
            <p>This year's photo of the prince, displayed in black and white, contrasts with the more casual image shared on his 10th birthday where he was seen sitting on steps, sleeves rolled back.</p>
        
            <p>In the latest photo, he can be seen wearing a friendship bracelet - not dissimilar to the one worn by his sister, Princess Charlotte, during the Wimbledon men's final earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Prince George - who is second in line to the throne - celebrated his grandfather King Charles III's birthday, appearing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with other members of the Royal Family.</p>
        
            <p>The event was Catherine's first public appearance since she announced her cancer diagnosis earlier this year.</p>
