            <p>Karolin van Onna had been talking about horse trekking the length of the South Island for years and last summer she finally did it.</p>
        
            <p>She and her friend Nicole Kumpfmueller spent three and a half months at the beginning of 2023 riding more than 1500km from Bluff to Picton on back-country trails.</p>
        
            <p>Her horses, Moose, Rasta and Alex, were experienced and vet-checked thoroughly for the journey, van Onna told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>"We found it amazing how willing they were to keep going every day."</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Germany, Van Onna has lived in New Zealand for more than eight years. </p>
        
            <p>She runs a horse trekking business in Cromwell so the horses were used to journeys - but nothing as long as this.</p>
        
            <p>At the beginning, the horses sometimes tried to turn around as if to say "time to go home now", she said. </p>
        
            <p>"But after a while, I think they realised, 'Oh no, there's no turning back'."</p>

            <p>While planning the journey, the women spoke to farmers and people who had done a lot of back-country horse riding - but learning to read the topographical maps was a baptism of fire.</p>
        
            <p>A chance meeting with a local prevented them from getting stuck in a rugged mountain range - the elevation not immediately clear with their basic map-reading skills.</p>
        
            <p>There were also quite a few big river crossings, which tested their skills.</p>
        
            <p>"It was like pure adrenaline when you have to ride through a deep river and you're not quite sure how deep it's going to be and you're just trying to make it to the other side."</p>

            <p>On the other hand, small creeks foxed her horse Moose.</p>
        
            <p>"He just hated them and it would take so long every time to convince him to to get over.</p>
        
            <p>"I would get off and try to pull him over and he just refused for like 10 minutes, and then suddenly he would jump on top of me!"</p>
        
            <p>On top of map reading and planning where they would pitch their tent each day, up to 10 hours a day in the saddle was tiring, van Onna said.</p>
        
            <p>They would hop off after about six hours and walk beside the horses.</p>
        
            <p>"It does get exhausting ... not only physically, but mentally as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It was always looking at maps and [discussing] 'Where do we have to go next, and where does the track go and we're going to turn right soon' and you don't ever stop thinking about what's coming next."</p>
        
            <p>They had a support vehicle, which they met up with every so often so they could replenish supplies, including hard feed for the horses.</p>

            <p>Ensuring the horses' wellbeing was paramount and van Onna worried most about one of them getting injured in the middle of the back country.</p>
        
            <p>"I love my horses with all my heart. I would never want anything to happen to them and that would have been the worst."</p>
        
            <p>Apart from a scary moment or two such as Rasta falling upside down into some prickly matagouri bushes, there were no major injuries, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from the willingness of the horses, the majestic scenery and the adventure, van Onna said it was the people they met along the way - who let them camp or stay, cooked food for them and gave directions - which made the journey.</p>
        
            <p>"We couldn't have done it without the help of all those people."</p>
