            <p>A bumper lineup of international and local acts has been revealed for next year's Electric Avenue festival with two top-drawer names heading up proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>The Prodigy and Chase & Status will both deliver headlining sets at Christchurch's Hagley Park in February 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement comes less than a month after organisers confirmed the country's biggest one-day music festival will expand to two days.</p>
        
            <p>Several of the international artists booked will make exclusive New Zealand appearances, according to promoters.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, Empire of the Sun, Wilkinson, The Kooks, Rudimental, DJ Shadow, Khruangbin, Maribou State, Real Estate and Tash Sultana are the big drawcards of the international contingent.</p>
        
            <p>Returning again to Hagley are several prominent local acts including L.A.B, Fat Freddy's Drop and Shapeshifter, the latter joined by prior collaborators the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra and Ladi6.</p>
        
            <p>More than 50 artists will perform across four stages on 21-22 February.</p>

            <p>The Prodigy - now comprising of keyboardist and producer Liam Howlett and vocalist Maxim Reality - will make their first visit to Aotearoa in six years after the Essex icons played Auckland's Trusts Arena in early 2019.</p>
        
            <p>That show would ultimately be the final performance for founding member, dancer and vocalist Keith Flint, who died a month later.</p>
        
            <p>The controversial outfit, who trailblazed their way our of their underground rave beginnings at the turn of the 90s, hit a commercial zenith with their third studio album The Fat of the Land in 1997.</p>
        
            <p>The album - that has sold more than 10 million copies - is bolstered by the singles 'Firestarter', 'Breathe' and 'Smack My B*tch Up', a high watermark for a group considered one of the most successful and influential dance music acts of all time.</p>
        
            <p>London duo Chase & Status could be considered descendants of their fellow headliners, and have cemented themselves as one of the major-league festival favourites for purveyors of low-end sub-bass.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of the ferocious high energy of the headliners, Empire of the Sun, out of Sydney, and Texan trio Khurangbin will offer fans a more nuanced, multihued dancefloor sensibility.</p>
        
            <p>Californian hip hop instrumentalist DJ Shadow (aka Josh Davis) is also a legendary figure among crate digging mavens, cementing his stature almost immediately with his classic 1996 debut Endtroducing,,,..</p>
        
            <p>Festival director Callam Mitchell said people have already registered for more than 25,000 tickets, with 90 percent wanting full weekend passes.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell predicted both days would sell out.</p>
        
            <p>"We're stoked by the level of interest - it's amazing to have a lineup of this calibre to celebrate our 10th birthday and we can't wait to party with you all.</p>
        
            <p>"For anyone travelling from outside Christchurch we do encourage you to snap up your accommodation nice and early - generally around 60 percent of our audience travel from around the country to attend."</p>
