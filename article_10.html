        <h2> Choir excitement at perfect fever pitch as The Big Sing begins</h2>
        <p>
Twenty-four high school choirs are set to compete at Aotearoa's biggest choral event - including a team of first-timers from Auckland's Avondale College.
</p>
        
            <p>They've spent hours practicing, singing, and selling sausages to raise funds. Now, for the first time, Avondale College's Gospel Choir is heading for Aotearoa's largest choral event in Wellington this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-member group is one of 24 secondary school choirs who will be battling it out in The Big Sing, a four-day singing extravaganza held at the Michael Fowler Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Only six of the Avondale College students, who range from year 9 to 13, have sung in a choir before. And for some of them, it will be their first time on a plane.</p>
        
            <p>Year 13 student and soloist Sylvia Tagaloa-Leniu says she's "really excited" to head down for the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"It's our first time going to Wellington for the Big Sing finale, it's very rare for myself and the rest of the choir to experience this opportunity... I've been in the choir since year 9, going five years strong, it's my last year in the choir so it's really emotional just thinking about it, such a journey."</p>
        
            <p>The competing schools, chosen from 250 entries from around New Zealand, will be performing a total of five pieces across two recitals. The Avondale College Gospel Choir has incorporated a wide range of genres into their performances, including elements of classical, jazz, waiata, pop, gospel, world music, and Pasifika music.</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa-Leniu is especially lucky as she prepares for Saturday - her uncle, Seumanu Seuoti Simon Mat훮fai, is the choir's co-director, pianist, and vocal trainer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very easy and very helpful, if I'm ever struggling with a song, I can just go home, ask for help, and of course he'll just help me out," Tagaloa-Leniu says.</p>
        
            <p>Mat훮fai was a previous deputy head boy at Avondale College and a board of trustees student representative. In 2003, he came back to tutor the school's award-winning Samoan Group and in 2018 established the Avondale College Gospel Choir, in association with Auckland Gospel Choir. Earlier this year, his Auckland Gospel Choir group won gold at the 2024 World Choir Games.</p>
        
            <p>"It's as if I never left," Mat훮fai says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long time, about 22 years of association with the school. I'm a local and was involved in local politics in the area, still involved with some of the community initiatives and I love this area of Avondale... if Polyfest is the cultural platform, the Big Sing is the choral platform, so for our school to make it is a huge honour."</p>
        
            <p>Since finding out they'd made the finale back in June, Avondale College has held several fundraising events, including "jam-packed" community concerts and sausage sizzles, to help fund the trip.</p>
        
            <p>"As we say in our Pasifika language, it really takes a village to raise and equip a child for the future. I believe our village has been our parents, our local churches, and our community groups."</p>
        
            <p>Mat훮fai says the trip will be eye-opening for the students for another reason - the choir has been invited to sing in the gallery at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of them, first time on a plane, so for them, not only to achieve travelling, but for them to see where our decision-makers are, the Beehive, the parliament, those steps going up, the house of representatives, I think it'll be one of those life-changing moments... that enables them to widen their worldview and cultivate that willingness to pursue more and succeed more."</p>
        
            <p>Music teacher Fredda Sorensen, who has been with Avondale College since 2013,</p>
        
            <p>says some of the students are feeling nervous about the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall they're really bubbling and getting excited, they're knocking at your door every five minutes, 'Miss! Miss!', something or other to do with the trip, they're really enthusiastic."</p>

            <p>Year 13 student and lead vocalist Allegra D'Souza joined the choir in 2023, after teachers had been "bugging her to join" for years.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like, 'Okay, I'll finally do it'. It's good to go out with a bang... Cantate Domino, one of our choral pieces is really fast and upbeat, I'm excited to perform that."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow lead vocalist Gideon Vaopunimatagi has been singing his whole life, as part of various church groups and later in the Avondale Intermediate choir, but says the Big Sing is a nerve-wracking prospect.</p>
        
            <p>He's especially excited to perform Stan Walker's 'Whakamoemiti'.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really powerful song, if you hear it from us... it can change your life. The Gospel Choir are my friends, my second family... I'd be honoured to win with them, representing the school, our families, each other, it would be really great, I would have no words."</p>
        
            <p>The Big Sing finale is on from Thursday 29 August - Saturday 31 August. There will be eight competitive sessions over the three days, all open to the public via door sales. The competition will close with an evening gala concert on Saturday night, hosted by RNZ Concert's Nick Tipping.</p>
