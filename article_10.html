        <h2>Crypto king buys banana art for $10.5m, says he'll eat it</h2>
        <p>
Justin Sun, who reportedly brought the piece using crypto,Â will apparently get his own banana, duct tape, a certificate of authenticity and instructions on how to install the work.

            <p>A banana fixed to a wall with duct tape artwork has been auctioned off for about US$6.2 million (NZ$10.5m), about four times the initial estimate, at Sotheby's in New York.</p>
        
            <p>Seven bidders competed on Wednesday (New York time) to seize Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan's latest edition of his Comedian artwork, which was estimated to sell for up to US$1.5m.</p>

            <p>That was already above and beyond the selling point of previous editions, which went for between US$120,000 and US$150,000, according to Perrotin gallery.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON Justin Sun acquired the piece by placing his bid over the phone, which ArtNet reported was paid for using cryptocurrency.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not just an artwork; it represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community," Sun said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe this piece will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history.</p>
        
            <p>"I am honored to be the proud owner of this iconic work and look forward to it sparking further inspiration and impact for art enthusiasts around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honouring its place in both art history and popular culture."</p>
        
            <p>The Guardian previously reported the successful bidder would receive their own banana (not the ones exhibited), a roll of duct tape, a certificate of authenticity and instructions on how to install the work.</p>

            <p>The piece first caused an uproar five years ago, when it debuted as an edition of three fruits at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair, attracting such a big crowd that it reportedly had to be removed from the site.</p>
        
            <p>Comedian has toured the world - with various bananas being used to exhibit the work - and was gobbled up twice so far. Once, at the time of its launch at Art Basel by a performance artist, in an intervention which he called 'Hungry Artist', and in 2023 at Leeum Museum of Art by a student who claimed he was simply hungry.</p>
        
            <p>Although Comedian has divided opinion, Auckland-based art dealer Charles Ninow believed it was meant to do just that - confronting viewers with questions about how we define and place value on art.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole thing about this work is that is that it falls into a tradition or an understanding called the ready-made where it's all about the idea, the actual object doesn't mean anything.</p>
        
            <p>"The other thing is it leaves you questioning, right? It doesn't tell you everything. And I think that's one of the important things about it. You have to ask your own questions."</p>
        
            <p>Sotheby's Americas head of contemporary art David Galperin described it as "one of the most brilliant ideas in the history of conceptual art".</p>
        
            <p>Some of Cattelan's other well-known works include America, consisting of a solid gold toilet, and La Nona Hora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John II lying on the ground after being struck by a meteorite.</p>
        
            <p>In a press release prior to the auction, Sotheby's called Cattelan's works "revolutionary", saying they "shared in a spirit of iconoclastic pranksterism that provoked audiences to question the meaning of art".</p>
        
            <p>"To me, Comedian was not a joke; it was a sincere commentary and a reflection on what we value," he told The Art Newspaper. "At art fairs, speed and business reign, so I saw it like this: if I had to be at a fair, I could sell a banana like others sell their paintings. I could play within the system, but with my rules.</p>
        
            <p>"When art makes us feel something and puts us in a position of discomfort, that's when it has an impact."</p>
