            <p>It's been quite a ride since Benee released her break-out single 'Soaked' in 2019 and followed it with the international smash 'Superlonely'.</p>
        
            <p>Now the Grey Lynn-raised singer-songwriter is based in LA and is loving Californian life, she told RNZ's Jesse Mulligan.</p>
        
            <p>"LA is beautiful. I'm sitting in my car right now. I have been at a session so I'm going to go back to that after this.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's great for work, there are so many musicians here, so it's awesome."</p>
        
            <p>Now into her second year in LA, she said, the ecosystem of creatives there was inspiring.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like there's never a dull moment. And there's never something that you don't see here, which can be a blessing and a curse.</p>
        
            <p>"But I'm a sponge and I'm just like, absorbing all these weird juices. So, it's pretty awesome."</p>

            <p>She has been stretching creatively recently and has just made her acting debut in the film Head South by Jonathan Ogilvie.</p>
        
            <p>A semi-autobiographical film set in Christchurch at the end of the '70s, early '80s.</p>
        
            <p>"It's set in the post-punk scene and we basically start a band and it's quite funny. Ed is just hilarious throughout the whole film, and we're basically like these teenagers who are just trying to trying to make a band.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's innocent … it's a really sweet story. And it was a lot of fun to film."</p>
        
            <p>She's now working on a new album, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm itching to get something out. It's been so long, it's kind of crazy."</p>
        
            <p>And has a tour of Australia lined up with Olivia Rodrigo.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot wait, it's insane, I'm so excited. I have never met her, but I have only heard good things and I follow her on socials and her shows look insane."</p>
        
            <p>Head South premiers at the Whānau Mārama: New Zealand International Film Festival.</p>
