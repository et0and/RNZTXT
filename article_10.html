            <p>As well as being an award-winning and critically acclaimed novelist and short story writer, Witi Ihimaera is also chair of Te Kaituhi Māori, the Māori writers' organisation within the New Zealand Society of Authors.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kaituhi Māori have just opened applications for its 2025 Kupu Kaitiaki and Kaituhi Māori programmes, fostering emerging and developing Māori writers.</p>
        
            <p>It's a "mighty mentor programme," Ihimaera told RNZ's Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past people like Paula Morris, people like Emma Hislop, Steph Matuku and Tanya Roxborogh have been the mentors.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, whoever goes in for this Māori mentor programme, they get the best teaching, and we hope will become the best in the next 20 years."</p>
        
            <p>Such mentor programmes didn't exist when Ihimaera was himself a young writer, but that may have helped him find his voice, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to begin my career from a Māori perspective, and a Māori point of view.</p>
        
            <p>"Had I possibly had help from Pākehā institutions, then I possibly could have started to write in Pākehā ways and according to Pākehā frameworks."</p>
        
            <p>The Kaituhi Māori mentorship programme happened for the first time in 2024. When Ihimaera read through the work produced it brought him great joy, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so incredibly awesome that, there are times when I almost wept with excitement and with joy, because I'm an old writer, I'm now 81 and to be able to see that there was a cohort of new rangatahi writers, fresh voices, refreshing ideas of who we were and people you know were mentoring them with so much generosity. It was just, an incredible experience."</p>
