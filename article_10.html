            <p>Kai Trump turned heads when she made a speech about her grandfather, former US President Donald Trump, at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. Here's everything you need to know about her.</p>
        
            <p>Kai Trump is the daughter of Donald Trump Jr and his ex-wife Vanessa Trump. At 17 years old, she is the eldest of Donald Trump's 10 grandchildren.</p>
        
            <p>Kai Trump entered the spotlight this week after delivering a short but personal testament about her grandfather at the Republican National Convention. She was moved to speak following the assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on 13 July. Addressing the delegates, and a national TV audience, she said her grandfather had been put through hell.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm speaking today to share the side of my grandpa that people don't see often. To me, he's just a normal grandpa; he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking, he always wants to know how we're doing in school. When I made the high honour roll, he presented it out to his friends how proud he was of me.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell and he's still standing. Grandpa, you are such an inspiration and I love you. The media makes my grandpa seem like a different person, but I know him for who he is," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very caring and loving."</p>
        
            <p>Kai Trump is occasionally seen at family events and on social media posts by her parents. During the Trump's term as president, she attended events such as his inauguration and the White House Easter Egg Roll.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager is also an avid golfer, like her grandfather. Earlier this year she announced she'd won the ladies club championship at Trump's golf course in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>"Very proud of my game and where it's heading, but there's always room for improvement," she wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
        
            <p>Kai is the oldest of Trump's 10 grandchildren and her four-year-old cousin Carolina is the youngest. Trump himself has five children: Donald Jr, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Barron.</p>
        
            <p>Donald Jr is father to Kai, Tristan, Spencer, Chloe, and Donald John III. Ivanka shares three children with her husband Jared Kushner; Arabella, Joseph and Theodore. Eric has two children with his wife Lara - Carolina and Eric Trump.</p>
