        <h2>At The Movies: IF</h2>
        <p>
IF is about a girl who discovers a world of Imaginary Friends of children who've outgrown them. Can she find them new homes, and can they get her through some personal traumas? Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>The new family comedy IF – it stands for “Imaginary Friend”, by the way, nothing to do with Lindsay Anderson’s riotous 60s public school satire – is advertised as coming “from the mind of John Krasinski”, which may be a bit premature.</p>
        
            <p>Krasinski is a likable actor – notably in the American version of The Office – and director – the sci-fi thriller series A Quiet Place with his wife Emily Blunt. But that doesn’t make him a genius auteur quite yet.</p>

            <p>IF attempts that deceptively tricky task – a kids story with something for the whole family.   This is the land of The Wizard of Oz and Roald Dahl, of Pixar animation and early Walt Disney. </p>
        
            <p>It opens on a 12-year-old girl called Bee, who’s having a bad time.</p>
        
            <p>Bee’s mother has recently died. Her father is in hospital waiting for serious surgery.  She’s staying with her worried grandma in a spooky old house….   Wait, I thought this was going to be sunny escapism featuring cute, wacky cartoon characters?</p>
        
            <p>Clearly the publicity department of IF had the same concerns, since most of the trailers brush all this stuff under the carpet in favour of wild and crazy Ryan Reynolds.</p>
        
            <p>He plays Cal, a sort of middle-man between our heroine Bee and the wonderful world of Imaginary Friends. IFs like Blue, who’s actually purple.</p>
        
            <p>Bee is uniquely able to see all these displaced IFs – the imaginary friends of children who’ve outgrown them, and who now have nowhere to go.</p>
        
            <p>There’s some irony in this, since there’s a strong suspicion this is the case with the story of IF too, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, the plot commutes between Bee’s visits to the hospital and her lovable dad – played by Krasinski himself – and her life in the fantasy world of IFs. But the IFs eventually start taking over.</p>
        
            <p>This despite the fact that IF is a little unclear what to do with a bunch of out-of-work fantasy characters.  Do you assign them to new kids, or do you find the child within their former owners?</p>
        
            <p>Still, it can’t be denied they’re an overpowering mob. The voice-cast list alone is astonishing, reflecting the fact that voice-over work on a big-budget animation film is a pretty easy gig.    Remember Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?  </p>
        
            <p>Aside from Steve Carell as Blue, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a ballet dancer called Blossom, the voices include Matt Damon, Bradley Cooper, Maya Randolph, Sam Rockwell and John Stewart - not mention the wives of Reynolds and Krasinski, Blake Lively and Emily Blunt.</p>
        
            <p>And – again like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – it’s a total waste since none of them are remotely recognizable.</p>
        
            <p>Still, it’s clear that everyone’s having a wonderful time telling, they think, a tale of ‘Pure Imagination’, as they say.  </p>
        
            <p>But as I say, these things aren’t as easy to pull off as would-be Hollywood storytellers like to think. Fairytales famously take years to shake down into something that makes sense.</p>
        
            <p>For all the hard work put in by writer-director Krasinski, and Ryan Reynolds, Fiona Shaw as Bee’s grandmother - and particularly young Cailey Fleming as Bee, who’s utterly charming - IF is only so-so.  </p>
        
            <p>A live-action Pixar film may be the intention. But Pixar isn’t just cute pictures. At the centre of the Toy Story series, of Monsters Inc and Inside Out – all of which plough the same ground as IF - is a rock-solid structure.  </p>
        
            <p>We know who the characters are, we know what they want, we’re surprised and delighted by the ending.</p>
        
            <p>IF is chock-full of colourful design, attractive performances, some good ideas and the best will in the world.  </p>
        
            <p>But its faults are also baked into the premise – these are imaginary friends with nowhere much to go. All these wonderful bits needed to be matched to a good movie.</p>
