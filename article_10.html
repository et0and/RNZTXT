        <h2>What does it take to be the best content creator in New Zealand?</h2>
        <p>
"How should I start today's argument - should I start with 'I told you so'? Or should I start with 'you should have listened to me'?" Lisa Perese-Cullen asks her followers.

            <p>Lisa Perese-Cullen has been making short, sharp videos about her everyday life and sharing them on the internet since 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The hugely popular micro-vlogs regularly feature her husband of 15 years, scaffolder, Brandon, her mum, granddad and her two young kids.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the short videos are accompanied with a dry, witty, and very relatable voiceover. There's the one where she "draws on a jaw line" and goes out to town in a hot pink suit that she's grabbed from H&M at the last minute. Or the one that pieces together the unbalanced preparation that goes into a child's birthday party. In another, she asks her followers for a steer in how to kick off a row with "hubby" over some "big mother...... ferns".</p>
        
            <p>"How should I start today's argument - should I start with 'I told you so'? Or should I start with 'you should have listened to me'? Like, what's my opening sentence?" she ponders sitting on her deck, digging in gardening gloves.</p>
        
            <p>In just two years she's amassed nearly 600,000 followers on TikTok and 473,000 fans on Instagram, and this week the Māori-Samoan content creator and 'Mumtok' star was crowned New Zealand Creator of the Year at the 2024 TikTok Awards in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>She beat out beloved Kiwi creators Nicola 'Nix' Adams, Torrell Tafa, Oliver Mills, and the well-known How To Dad's Jordan Watson for the title.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still just letting the shock wear off. It genuinely was a massive surprise for me that night, so I'm still kind of buzzing about it," she told RNZ following her win.</p>
        
            <p>"All I started doing was just vlogging my every day kind of mum life, kids, house. You would look at it and you'd think it would be quite boring, but I guess what made it entertaining was just putting a bit of comedy in the voiceovers, just giving it that real dry Kiwi sense of humour."</p>
        
            <p>Perese-Cullen's TikTok journey kicked off kind of by accident. She started a business - lingerie brand Harper James - and knew she needed to get on the app to get the word out. She made her own account and found she enjoyed the process.</p>
        
            <p>"I think what was really funny was, when I first started, I was vlogging kind of like everybody else, like very happy and positive and almost putting on a different voice, and then that persona was actually quite hard to upkeep.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't have a big following back then so it didn't bother me. I was like, 'Oh, I'll just do it how I'd normally talk in my own head, maybe with my friends and my family' ... I definitely leaned into that authentic self, and that's when it kind of took off."</p>

            <p>Being able to show up authentically online, and having that resonate with people, has been the biggest gift, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"People stop me in the street, new mums, people that can relate to your everyday content. Just being able to connect with people, I think that's where social media has done so much good."</p>
        
            <p>But not everyone is kind when you give so much of yourself to an audience on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"There are people that are gonna form opinions about you based on a 30-second piece of content, so you really need to develop a thick skin and just roll with the punches, and set your boundaries about what you're gonna post online, and that took a little bit of time figuring out as well."</p>
        
            <p>Perese-Cullen didn't set out to become a content creator, but now, vlogging her everyday life has become second nature.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I think my 10-year-old can use a phone better than I can. It started off very basic and then as time went on, I picked up a skill here and there ... obviously vlogging and editing takes a bit of energy, but now I think we've really just worked it into our lifestyle.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the time it doesn't really feel I'm working, I'm just kind of making something for the fun of it."</p>
        
            <p>In the US, content creators have access to the TikTok Creator Fund, which enables users to monetise their content's views and engagement.</p>
        
            <p>While this feature isn't available for TikTok New Zealand, Perese-Cullen has managed to forge a lucrative path for herself by collaborating with brands she loves on the platform. Some of these sponsored posts have fetched well over 1 million views.</p>
        
            <p>For anyone wanting to pursue a career in content creation, she has some simple advice.</p>
        
            <p>"Just be yourself. Your very, very authentic self. Sometimes you can polish it up a bit, I put my best foot forward when it comes to social media. But also from a technical standpoint, I think the biggest thing is consistency and just building that very authentic audience."</p>
