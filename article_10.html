            <p>Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood has returned to New Zealand for a new adventure comedy.</p>
        
            <p>Bookworm follows 11-year-old Mildred, played by Nell Fisher, and her estranged father Strawn Wise, played by Wood, on their quest to find a mythological beast known as the Canterbury panther.</p>
        
            <p>Ant Timpson wrote the character of the hapless Strawn with Wood in mind, having previously worked together on the dark comedy Come to Daddy. </p>
        
            <p>Prior to the shoot, Wood had no inkling about the Canterbury panther, he told RNZ's Nine to Noon.</p>
        
            <p>"We spent nearly two months shooting the film last year, we heard direct stories from people who had had sightings of this particular panther, which is kind of amazing.</p>
        
            <p>"Reading the script, I just thought it was something that Toby and Ant made up, and I was proven wrong."</p>
        
            <p>Wood and Timpson are close friends, and he enjoys Timpson's deadpan Kiwi humour, he said.</p>

            <p>"I'm dear friends with Ant Timpson. We made a movie together called Come to Daddy that Toby Harvard co-wrote, so the cadence, the language, the atmosphere of this film felt very familiar to me and enjoyable."</p>
        
            <p>Timpson and his collaborator Harvard funnelled their insecurities as parents into the project, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This all stemmed from Toby and I being parents, and we sort of wanted to make a wilderness film, we've been talking about doing it for a long, long time.</p>
        
            <p>"The genesis of Bookworm was really not stepping up in a time of crisis as a parent, and basically pooing the bed in front of your kids."</p>

            <p>The film rests on Mildred, played by Nell Fisher, he said, who "smashes" the role out of the park.</p>
        
            <p>"Toby has written some just gorgeous dialogue, which is a lot for an 11-year-old to get their chops around. But she was just a complete natural in terms of inhabiting this character from word go."</p>
        
            <p>Wood was equally impressed.</p>
        
            <p>"She is an absolute delight, super professional, came so prepared. And so, we just had a blast. I mean, the reality is in most of this film, 85 to 90 percent of it is outside with very few interior scenes.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, it was really Nell and I, for the duration of this experience in the wilderness of New Zealand, tromping around together, and it was a total delight."</p>
