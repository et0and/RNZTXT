            <p>A small pie shop in Canterbury may have just set a record for the country's most expensive pie.</p>
        
            <p>A gourmet crayfish pie, created by PJ's Pies in Hanmer Springs, will set you back $50.</p>
        
            <p>The first batch sold out, co-owner Jim Bratschi told Nights.</p>
        
            <p>PJ's Pies supply supermarkets out of Hanmer Springs all over the South Island, but Bratschi and his partner, both Swiss-trained chefs, wanted to create something a little different.</p>
        
            <p>So what goes in this gourmet pie? Kaikōura-sourced cray, Bratschi said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we take very fresh crayfish out of the sea from Kaikōura and transport it to Hanmer Springs.</p>
        
            <p>"If I filled that pie just with crayfish, it probably [would] have to have double the price tag."</p>
        
            <p>Creamy mashed potato and leek was used as a base, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And we turn the shells into a bisque - a crayfish sauce with cognac and white wine and herbs and spices."</p>
        
            <p>The crays were cooked layered in the pie topped with "obnoxiously crispy pastry," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The price tag was seemingly no deterrent to his Hanmer Springs regulars.</p>
        
            <p>"We could have sold another 10 to 20 pies. We had to take orders for people to come back, which is a good and a bad thing. I would have liked to sell more than I did, but tomorrow morning [Saturday] the first people that show up at the shop will be lucky."</p>
        
            <p>Inspired by the success of the crayfish pie, Bratschi is already cooking up new ideas.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to do something with white truffle, and maybe have a slow-cooked wagyu beef with white truffle, and some 100-year-old port infused onion relish to top it off with."</p>
