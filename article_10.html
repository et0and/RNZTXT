        <p>
Finding that first mushroom of the season is a thrill for a forager - but you've got to know your stuff.

            <p>Turning fruit blossoms into syrups, adding wilted dandelions to salads, sourcing and drying out seaweed and finding that very first mushroom of the season - thrills for an avid forager like Peter Langlands.</p>
        
            <p>Langlands is a well known photographer, researcher and writer who specialises in freshwater and marine issues. He's also an expert wild foods forager, a skill he has been cultivating since he was a kid. He shares his tips with RNZ's Thrift podcast.</p>

            <p>Damp areas can yield good foraging, like river edges and springs and creeks, and look for spots where there is diverse plant life.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's nice and damp around the tree, the tree creates its own sort of micro climate," Langlands explains.</p>
        
            <p>Cultural diversity also brings a range of foods to forage - where there's a variety of different things people may have planted in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"It is also worth checking out places where people have settled in the past, areas where you might have had gold miners, loggers, different types of farming. Where there's been a diversity of people in the landscape, is where we'll find a lot of good foraging," he says.</p>
        
            <p>However, if you're not certain of how the land was used historically, it's best to avoid potential pollution.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of flat areas of ground could possibly be historic landfill sites, also avoiding anywhere close to industrial areas where landfill may have been dumped.</p>
        
            <p>"[And] busy road margins in areas where there's lots of regular spraying are probably best avoided."</p>
        
            <p>And don't go onto private property unless you have permission. Any fruit hanging over a fence into a public space still belongs to the tree's owner.</p>
        
            <p>It's crucial to be schooled up in what's edible and what is not. It's a good idea to go with someone who's experienced as you build your foraging skills. Learn two or three different plants a week and your knowledge will build, Langlands suggests.</p>
        
            <p>Learn what different plants look like in different stages of growth, so you can distinguish between them and other similar plants. Also learn where a particular plant grows - if you think you found it outside that habitat it could be a red flag that the plant is not what you think it is.</p>
        
            <p>If you aren't sure what you've found there are some useful online resources. Langlands recommends iNaturalist - a crowd sourced system for identifying things. But if you're in any doubt about something and you haven't been able to absolutely verify it, leave it behind.</p>
        
            <p>When you head out foraging, bring some storage containers and pack a chilly bin in the car with an ice pack to keep your finds fresh. But only take as much as you need, share the bounty with others.</p>
        
            <p>"Just keeping it sensible, really, to what you're going to use in the near future," Langlands explains.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of foraging groups try to stick to a rule of thirds - take a third for yourself, leave another third for others and leave the remainder so the tree or plant can regenerate.</p>
