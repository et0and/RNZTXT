            <p>A big part of understanding the present is understanding the past.</p>
        
            <p>News does not happen in a vacuum - there is context and history, cause and effect.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some of the best stories and interviews RNZ had to offer on historical topics in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>An archaeological site was brought to life at the Kaikōura Playcentre, after ancient hangi pits were uncovered during a building demolition five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The playcentre was already in the process of moving into some old classrooms and decided to incorporate the site's heritage into its landscaping.</p>
        
            <p>Now two whare for tamariki to play in and a firepit are on site, with a mural painted on the wall.</p>
        
            <p>This year's Rugby World Cup saw a rematch of the classic 1995 final between the All Blacks and South Africa - the first major sporting event in the country since the end of apartheid.</p>
        
            <p>And much like in 2023, things didn't go as planned for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Rugby legend Laurie Mains, who was coaching that side, spoke to Afternoons' Jesse Mulligan in April.</p>
        
            <p>Work on the new Dunedin Hospital site was underway in May, archaeologists working to preserve any artefacts they found amongst the rubble.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora delivery of infrastructure and investment group director Monique Fouwler said a foundry, chocolate factory and sawmills were located on the inpatient building site in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"The outpatient site sits above a section of town that was densely occupied by cottages and residential dwellings, whereas the inpatient building site was used for more industrial purposes."</p>
        
            <p>A report documenting the archaeologists' work and its contribution to the understanding of the history of Aotearoa was to be submitted to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga.</p>
        
            <p>A collection of wartime footage capturing military life in New Zealand during World War II was made available to the public for the first time in June.</p>
        
            <p>It was shot between 1942 and 1943 by Academy Award-winning US Marines cinematographer Norman T Hatch, but much of it had not been seen since.</p>
        
            <p>It was retrieved and archived by Ngā Taonga following a joint effort by filmmaker Steve La Hood and the Kapiti United States Marine Trust.</p>
        
            <p>Richard Benge, chair of the Kapiti US Marine Trust spoke to Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>The world knows Anne Frank as a precocious teenager who never gave up hope as she hid from the Nazis during the Holocaust in a secret apartment in Amsterdam.</p>
        
            <p>Hannah Pick-Goslar knew her as the girl next door and co-conspirator in the pranks they pulled on the adults before the war. The two would both end up in the same concentration camp.</p>
        
            <p>Hannah survived, and just before she died, she worked on a book about her time with Anne before the diary with journalist Dina Kraft. Kraft's family survived the war by fleeing to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The book is called My Friend Anne Frank: The Inspiring and Heartbreaking True Story of Best Friends Torn Apart and Reunited Against All Odds.</p>

            <p>A precious taonga stolen from a museum dedicated to the memory of the legendary 28th Māori Battalion was recovered in November, just five days after the brazen theft sparked outrage among the soldiers' descendants.</p>
        
            <p>The large piece of polished kauri gum, a symbol of the 'Gum Diggers' of the Battalion's A Company, formed part of a font in Te Rau Aroha at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rau Aroha, or the Museum of the Price of Citizenship, is dedicated to all Māori who fought for New Zealand, but especially members of the 28th Māori Battalion.</p>
        
            <p>One Saturday in October was Te Pūtake o te Riri, the national day of commemoration for the New Zealand Wars.</p>
        
            <p>But experts said the commemorations were at risk of passing by unnoticed outside of Māori circles.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Wars saw nearly three decades of conflict over land and sovereignty from the 1840s, between British forces and some iwi.</p>
        
            <p>Professor of Māori education at Victoria University Joanna Kidman told RNZ there were still a lot of people unsure of what the kaupapa was all about.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rā - the only known customary Māori sail in existence - returned to New Zealand for a short time in September.</p>
        
            <p>The piece is usually stored at the British Museum in London, and toured here - first at the Christchurch Art Gallery then at Tāmaki Paenga Hira, the Auckland War Memorial Museum.</p>
        
            <p>It will be returned to the UK in May.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Museum curator Dr Kahutoi Te Kanawa spoke to Morning Report's Ingrid Hipkiss about its importance.</p>
        
            <p>13 September marked a significant milestone in our political history - on this day 90 years ago, our first female MP was elected into Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Elizabeth McCombs won a by-election in the seat of Lyttelton after the death of her husband James McCombs, who had held the seat since 1913.</p>
        
            <p>Former Prime Minister Helen Clark spoke to Nights' Mark Leishman about McCombs' legacy and how being a woman in Parliament has changed over the past 90 years.</p>
        
            <p>During World War II the New Zealand Government commissioned three top-secret military tunnels to be built - Fort Stony Batter on Waiheke, Whangaparaoa Peninsula and Wrights Hill in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Heritage and Archaeological manager Timothy Moon spoke to Afternoons about the tunnels.</p>
        
            <p>One of New Zealand's most intriguing cricket mysteries is how Rodney Redmond scored a test hundred on debut and never played for his country again.</p>
        
            <p>The now-78-year-old's brief international career finished 50 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint's Jimmy Ellingham had the story.</p>
        
            <p>Laura Trevelyan knew she came from a prominent British family with generational wealth going back centuries. But when the BBC newsreader recently discovered her family had owned more than 1000 slaves on a sugar plantation in the Caribbean, she knew there had to be a reckoning.</p>
        
            <p>She apologised to the people of Grenada, organised a fund for reparations and quit her job with the BBC.</p>
        
            <p>She is now the co-founder of a group called Heirs of Slavery and works with other families whose ancestors profited from owning other human beings.</p>
        
            <p>She spoke to Afternoons in May.</p>

            <p>Crown Lynn, A Māori Story is a riveting slice of New Zealand history telling the iconic story of Crown Lynn pottery and the generations of Māori families that worked there.</p>
        
            <p>For almost 50 years Crown Lynn was the biggest ceramics factory in the Southern Hemisphere. Situated in West Auckland, it was a melting pot of rich culture in a post war era when hundreds of Māori migrated to the city to find work.</p>
        
            <p>The story has been told in a new documentary. Susan Leonard, producer and director spoke to Afternoons in April.</p>
        
            <p>Anne Perry, formerly known as Juliet Hulme - who served jail time along with Pauline Parker for the notorious murder of Parker's mother in Christchurch's Port Hills - died in April, aged 84.</p>
        
            <p>Perry was 15 and Parker 16 when they lured Parker's mother to Victoria Park, where they murdered her with a brick to prevent their separation.</p>
        
            <p>Hulme subsequently changed her name to Anne Perry, before moving to the UK where she forged a career as the prolific writer of best-selling crime novels.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand writer Joanne Drayton wrote a biography on Perry. She spoke to Morning Report's Corin Dann.</p>
