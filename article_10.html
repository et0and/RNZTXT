        <h2>At The Movies: Bad Behaviour</h2>
        <p>
Bad Behaviour, the debut feature by New Zealand writer-director Alice Englert, explores the mother-daughter relationship of a movie stunt woman and a former actress in search of enlightenment. Video, Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Bad Behaviour is star-studded but arty, reflecting its auteur’s pedigree. Alice Eglert is Dame Jane Campion’s daughter.</p>

            <p>Eglert plays Dylan, a stunt performer on a cheesy sci-fi film being shot in the middle of Central Otago. </p>
        
            <p>She has a prickly relationship with mother Lucy, played with all the stops out by Jennifer Connolly.    </p>
        
            <p>I had to be told later that Lucy’s a “former child actor”, it certainly doesn’t come up in the movie. Right now she’s off to something called a “semi-silent retreat” in deepest Oregon.</p>
        
            <p>I now have several questions.  Why Oregon? I mean, it looks very similar to Central Otago to me anyway, so why not set it there?</p>
        
            <p>And what’s a “semi-silent retreat”?  Is it the same as The Piano’s “elective mute”?</p>
        
            <p>Getting back to “why Oregon?” there do seem to be an awful lot of Kiwis there, including a Samoan chap, Ana Scotney from Cousins and the omnipresent Tom Sainsbury – not to mention a Russian model called Dasha Nekrasova and the retreat’s English guru Elon, played by Ben Wishaw.</p>
        
            <p>Wishaw certainly classes up Bad Behaviour a bit, but it does beg another question. Are hippie retreats where you try and find yourself still a thing?  </p>
        
            <p>You know, publicly beating yourselves up about your traumas, role-playing yourselves as babies, missing out on breakfast if you happen to sleep in?</p>
        
            <p>Since we have no clue what Lucy actually does these days, and what she wants out of this retreat - at least this time everyone keeps their clothes on - all we can do is follow her behaviour, which is pretty awful.  </p>
        
            <p>She seems to have issues with her late mother, culminating in a violent tantrum when she blames everyone else for… well, everything.</p>
        
            <p>We don’t see much of this in the cunningly expert trailer for Bad Behaviour, but stunt-woman Dylan has her own rather vague issues, often linked to her own mother.  </p>
        
            <p>Presumably this is to indicate a consistent plot or theme. You know, mothers and daughters, what are you going to do?</p>
        
            <p>At the end mother and daughter leave Oregon and Central Otago, and end up bonding in - why not? – San Francisco. Although it looks quite a lot like Central Otago to me.  </p>
        
            <p>I only have one more question.  When the considerable amount of New Zealand public money was spent on Bad Behaviour – stars like Ben Wishaw and Jennifer Connolly don’t come cheap, after all – did anyone ask who might want to see this? And if not, why not?</p>
