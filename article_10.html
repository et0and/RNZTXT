Whakarongo ki tēnei īnoi i runga i tōu ingoa.

            <p>Son of God, Child of Mary, 
born in the stable at Bethlehem, 
be born again in us this day 
that through us the world may know 
the wonder of your love. 
Hear this prayer for your name’s sake. 
Amen. </p>

            <p>A reading from the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 9, verses 2, 6 and 7</p>
        
            <p>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;  
those who lived in a land of deep darkness – on them light has shone. 
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us;  
authority rests upon his shoulders;  
and he is named Wonderful Counsellor,  
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
His authority shall grow continually, 
and there shall be endless peace for the throne of David and his kingdom.  
He will establish and uphold it with justice  
and with righteousness from this time onward and forevermore.  
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. </p>

            <p>Come to this Christmas singing! (Shirley Murray / Colin Gibson)</p>
        
            <p>Come to this Christmas singing!
Come to a birthday, bringing
gifts from our country’s treasure,
beauty of shell and stone:
wisdom the old have taught us,
laughter the young have brought us,
love to surround a manger,
making this Child our own.

Here where the sheep are grazing,
where summer sun is blazing
harvests for others ripen -
food for the world can grow:
Christ of a cold December,
quicken us to remember
poverty in a stable,
need, like the sting of snow.

Wealth of our land and water,
riches of race and culture -
these be our gold and incense
offered for Christmas Day:
where we make peace, declare it,
where we have much, let’s share it,
aroha warm our hearts, and
aroha be our way.</p>

            <p>Darren Ayling, Elliot Rice, Sarah Rice</p>
        
            <p>Today’s reading from the Gospel according to Luke tells the story of the birth of Jesus.</p>
        
            <p>It's read in three sections, with each reader reflecting on what it means. A carol is sung between each section. </p>
        
            <p>Darren Ayling</p>
        
            <p>In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. Joseph went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child.</p>
        
            <p>While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>

            <p>Silent Night (Joseph Mohr / Franz Gruber) </p>
        
            <p>Marie te po, tapu te po
Marino, marama
Ko te Whaea, me te Tama
Tama tino tapu ra
Moe mai i te aio
Moe mai i te aio.

Silent night, holy night:
all is calm, all is bright.
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild;
sleep in heavenly peace,
sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight.
Glories stream from heaven afar,
heav'nly hosts sing, “Alleluia!
Christ the Saviour is born!
Christ the Saviour is born!”</p>
        
            <p>Elliot Rice</p>
        
            <p>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</p>
        
            <p>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for see--I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger."</p>
        
            <p>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favours!"</p>
        
            <p>Angels from the realms of glory (/Trad French)</p>
        
            <p>Angels from the realms of glory,
wing your flight o'er all the earth;
ye who sang creation's story
now proclaim Messiah's birth:
Refrain:
Come and worship Christ the newborn King,
come and worship, worship Christ, the newborn King.

Shepherds, in the field abiding,
watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing;
yonder shines the infant light:
Refrain:</p>

            <p>Sarah Rice</p>
        
            <p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us."</p>
        
            <p>So the shepherds went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart.</p>
        
            <p>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. </p>
        
            <p>Come now, Lord Jesus</p>
        
            <p>Come now, Lord Jesus,
enter our Christmas,
be to us no stranger
in this new-made manger.

Come, small and human,
born of a woman,
yet a Son much greater
of our own Creator.

Come, cold and crying,
comfort denying,
no place to receive you,
few yet to believe you.

Come, poor and simple,
our flesh your temple,
in your body feeling
hurt as well as healing.

Come, gift and token,
bread to be broken -
star and sign still point you,
myrrh will yet anoint you.</p>

            <p>Let us pray for our world. Kia īnoi tātou.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, this Christmas day we remember the baby in Bethlehem,
And we pray for all newborn babies and their families, here in Aotearoa and around the world.
May there be room for them, and shelter,
Loving hands to hold them
Wise people to teach them
Safe places for them to play and grow and thrive.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, our shelter and home, tō tātou ūkaipō
This Christmas Day hear our prayer.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, this Christmas Day we remember the shepherds listening to a promise of peace
And we pray for all who long to hear that promise
in places where drones circle and bombs fall,
where homes and hospitals and schools are being destroyed.
We pray for ourselves and those we know
when we are estranged from each other and hostile to our neighbours.
Bring peace to our families and communities and the nations.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, our shelter and home, tō tātou ūkaipō
This Christmas Day hear our prayer.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, this Christmas Day we remember that wise people brought gifts.
We pray that we may recognise wisdom in ourselves and in each other.
As we perhaps feel despair or anger and fear for our children and grandchildren.
Some people are shouting out boldly, with courage
some people are working with passion and skill.
Help each of us to be willing and determined
to think and act and to work to care for each other and all creation.</p>
        
            <p>Our God, our shelter and home, tō tātou ūkaipō
This Christmas Day hear our prayer.</p>
        
            <p>We pray in the name of Jesus, our friend and brother.
Amen</p>

            <p>The Lord’s Prayer is first read in Mandarin, which is one of the languages represented in the congregation of Wellington Central Baptist Church, then in English.</p>
        
            <p>Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial
and deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
Amen.</p>

            <p>Many traditions have a custom of passing the peace as part of their worship. On Christmas Day it’s fitting to pass joy as well.</p>
        
            <p>Here’s a piece of music called ‘Dona Nobis Pacem’ which means ‘give us peace’. As it’s played, wherever you are today, look around at the people you’re with and offer them peace and joy.</p>
        
            <p>Remember people who are absent and hold them too in peace.</p>
        
            <p>And think of places and people where you long to see peace and joy. </p>

            <p>Hark! the herald angels sing (Charles Wesley / Felix Mendelssohn)</p>
        
            <p>Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King:
peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
with th'angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"</p>
        
            <p>Refrain:
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
late in time behold him come,
offspring of the Virgin's womb:
veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
hail th'incarnate Deity,
pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.
Refrain:

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
risen with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
born that we no more may die,
born to raise us from the earth,
born to give us second birth.
Refrain:</p>

And the power of the Holy Spirit
