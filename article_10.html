            <p>Marlborough man Ross Brownson is one of New Zealand's most skilled taxidermists.</p>
        
            <p>He specialises in fish taxidermy and his creations can be seen at Te Papa, in museums, boardrooms and lodges all around the world.</p>
        
            <p>His house in Havelock is known for its colourful variety of sea creatures, most notably a 12-foot (3.65m) shark. Now that house is up for sale, and the sea creatures are too.</p>
        
            <p>Completely self-taught, Brownson developed an innovative method using plaster casts and fibreglass which has allowed him to take on work of all different types and sizes world-wide.</p>
        
            <p>"We were getting work from as far away as Scotland," he told RNZ's Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>"They were emailing us photos and measurements of trout and because I had an extensive range of moulds, which was sort of a step up from the plaster casts.</p>
        
            <p>"I could produce pretty much any size of trout. We were doing a lot for Scotland and doing a lot for Australia."</p>

            <p>Catch and release fishers who want a keepsake also sought him out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They would weigh the fish, get a quick measurement of the length and girth, put the fish back into the water and email me the photo."</p>
        
            <p>The 12-foot shark, one of many big fish on display in the Brownson's home, was "a bit of a mission," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a little one-and-a half-ton digger that I used to lift big fish, tuna and that sort of thing.</p>
        
            <p>"But it wouldn't lift that. It was lifting the tracks off the ground."</p>
        
            <p>He had to wait for a week for the shark, which was blast-frozen, to thaw.</p>
        
            <p>"It would have been the biggest job I ever took on. So quite a mission, that one."</p>

            <p>While Brownson's skills have stood him in good stead, now it's time for him and his wife Janet to enjoy retirement.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we're clicking on the 70 mark, we thought it was time to let somebody else look after the building and enjoy it as much as what we have."</p>
        
            <p>The building, an old post office, has been serving as a maritime museum and an iSite. Both the building and its contents are for sale, as he has nowhere to store the collection.</p>
        
            <p>Even so, his business will continue.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a young guy in Timaru and another one in Christchurch that have got all the moulds, so they will be carrying on.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm heading down to Christchurch to do a bit of tutoring, and I've been to Timaru and tutored the young guy down there. Hopefully they can carry the whole thing on. That's what I'd like to see."</p>
