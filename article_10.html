            <p>A start-up in Marlborough is busy repurposing damaged vineyard posts into sustainable posts for farm fencing.</p>
        
            <p>Repost is the brainchild of Tasman sheep and beef farmer, Greg Coppell. </p>
        
            <p>He had "a hell of a lot of fencing" to do after buying the 500-hectare property in St Arnaud.</p>
        
            <p>To keep costs down, he turned a pile of broken vineyard posts once used to hold up the canopy into a set of fence posts for the farm.</p>
        
            <p>Recycling the timber was tedious work with hand tools though.</p>
        
            <p>"I got sick of pulling out nails and grinding off nails. So I started building a machine to do it and it just sort of grew from there," he said. </p>
        
            <p>He teamed up with Blenheim viticulturist, Stuart Dudley, to do so. Without him, "there's just no way" it would have come together Coppell said.</p>
        
            <p>After three and a half years the business has come a long way.</p>
        
            <p>A crew of nine work at vineyards across the top of the the South Island using the machinery developed by Coppell and Dudley, which is fixed onto custom made trailers. </p>
        
            <p>There are also crews helping with the Cyclone Gabrielle recovery in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>
On a clean site the crew can process up to 1000 posts in a day

            <p>Once the nails are pulled out, the posts are docked to 1.8 or 1.6-metre lengths and trucked to farms around the country for about half the price of new posts.</p>
        
            <p>"They've all got homes before they've been processed because they're cheap. It comes down to dollars." </p>
        
            <p>The wineries pay Repost to process the broken or old posts, so they don't have to send them to landfill.</p>
        
            <p>Pernod Ricard Winemakers is one of his vineyard clients, with a team working on a huge pile of broken posts at their Triplebank vineyard near Seddon.</p>
        
            <p>"We've probably done about 10 or 15,000 in here at least," Coppell estimated, with another 20,000 posts still to be processed at the site. </p>
        
            <p>
All the nails, plastic clips and tek screws need to be removed before the posts are cut to size

            <p>Tracey Marshall is Pernod Ricard's New Zealand sustainability manager. She said they had been stockpiling the posts, many damaged by  tractors and harvesters driving between the rows of vines, for a "very, very long time."</p>
        
            <p>"Over any given year, you can see up to four percent breakage in some vineyards. And when you look at the size of the industry and Marlborough, that's a lot of posts. We're talking millions of posts out there." </p>
