"It's about putting care into the process, and people really appreciate that."

            <p>Unna Burch has always loved op-shopping, so when her family did a thrift gift challenge last Christmas, the mother of two decided to share her tips with more than 17,000 followers on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"When you curate a thoughtful package tailored to the recipient's interests or collections, it becomes so much more meaningful than a standard gift," says Burch, a full-time traveller originally from Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about putting care into the process, and people really appreciate that."</p>
        
            <p>Sustainability is a hot topic over the festive season, when New Zealanders generate 30 percent more waste each year, according to WasteMINZ's estimates.</p>

            <p>Burch tries to buy items that are already in mint condition but if she finds something that needs a little work, she'll go the extra mile.</p>
        
            <p>"Almost everything else gets a good clean - either by hand, a run through the dishwasher or washing machine - depending on the material."</p>
        
            <p>For example, she scrubs wicker baskets and dries them out in the sun; she might prime and spray-paint candle holders and photo frames for an updated look; and she'll use scrunched up tin foil to rub off tough marks from silver and follow it up with a polishing agent.</p>
        
            <p>You can put together a gift set based on a theme, colour or overall feeling, Burch suggests.</p>
        
            <p>"For instance, you could start with one standout item - a candle holder, a book, or a piece of d√©cor - and then select complementary items to pair with it. It's fun to mix and match until the pieces feel cohesive as a set."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to wrapping, try getting baskets from op shops and filling the bottom with shredded tissue paper, Burch says. You can also use scarves as a reusable and multi-purpose wrap - perhaps the Japanese furoshiki style will suit your present.</p>
        
            <p>"To make the gift feel extra special, I like adding consumable items such as home-made sauces, biscuits, jams, or sweet treats. Fancy pantry staples like olive oil, flavoured salts, a bottle of wine, beeswax candles, or artisanal soap are also great additions to round out the gift."</p>

            <p>Children love books and you can probably find some hardcover ones for just $1 at op shops, she says. Alternatively, opt for classics you can typically find in thrift shops like wooden toys, Lego or Duplo, or freshen up a soft toy by soaking and machine washing.</p>
        
            <p>If you want to get kids' clothing, look for high-quality pieces that can still be enjoyed by other children.</p>
        
            <p>Second hand children's toys (for children under 36 months) sold in trade need to comply with the Product Safety Standards (Children's Toys) Regulations 2005, according to the Ministry of Business and Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) Consumer Protection.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ product test writer Nick Gelling recommends avoiding second-hand private sales and trying certified refurbished tech from retailers, which he says is less risky and provides you with protection under Consumer Guarantees Act.</p>
        
            <p>"That means if something does go wrong, you have the same protection under the 'acceptable quality' clause that you'd get when buying new."</p>
        
            <p>Not all refurbished tech is faulty; some are on sale because they were traded in for newer models, for example by a company with bulk supply, or may have been store display models or had their box damaged but not been used, Gelling says.</p>

            <p>If you don't mind a few signs of wear and tear on a device, you might opt for something on the lower side of the grading system, although the lowest (grade 4, D, or average) can be hard to find as sometimes shops will recycle or strip them for parts.</p>
        
            <p>If you're buying it for children to do school work you'll want to consider several factors such as the operating system, hard drive, and what their needs are, he says. A primary school kid might be more suited for a tablet than a laptop, whereas a senior high school or university student might need a more recent model of a device to ensure it can perform at the capacity they need it to.</p>
        
            <p>Gelling suggests sticking with local retailers for refurbished tech as it's easier to follow up with them if anything goes wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Burch sticks to shopping in person at op shops so she can consider the quality and whether something is beyond repair. She also suggests steering clear of overpriced items which can be found brand new and marked down at retail shops.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the biggest issues you might face with refurbished tech might be dying batteries and software support ending for security patch updates, which makes buying a phone or tablet more than two years old a bit of a gamble, Gelling says.</p>
        
            <p>"The existential threat to a device comes when those security updates end. Once that happens, we recommend you stop using the product altogether, lest you open yourself up to privacy leaks or malicious attacks."</p>
        
            <p>For batteries, check with the retailer about its condition - if a replacement is required you might need to factor that into your budget.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep in mind that, if the model is more than three or four years old or from an obscure brand, it might be hard to find a technician to do the replacement for you. And you're out of luck if you want to replace the batteries in many wireless earbuds, including Apple's AirPods, as they're designed to be unrepairable."</p>
        
            <p>MBIE business specialist Ian Caplin says being aware of potential safety concerns caused by wear and tear is especially important when buying some tech products or specifically for children.</p>
        
            <p>"When buying second hand products for children, you should check the items thoroughly for safety hazards, this can include things like loose screws and rough edges, or any small parts or loose strings which could cause choking.</p>
        
            <p>"You should also ensure that the product doesn't contain dangerous materials, such as small high powered magnets or button batteries."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency have safety information on their website regarding batteries and electronics.</p>
