            <p>But while its credited as changing the course of Bowie's Career and the perception of modern-day pop, it's a record that divides his fans. Jettisoning his trusted group of long-serving musicians and producers and teaming up with Disco legend Nile Rodgers, Bowie made a calculated decision to create a completely different sound to his previous albums - and challenged preconceptions with a far more accessible public image.</p>
