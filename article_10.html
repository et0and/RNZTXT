            <p>Australian actor-comedian Felicity Ward has stepped into the high heels of Hannah Howard - as boss in the latest incarnation of The Office.</p>
        
            <p>The hit TV show has had an Australian remake and sees a woman at the helm of Sydney-based box company Flinley Craddick.</p>
        
            <p>The British version of show, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, first aired in 2001. Four years later Steve Carell took over at the helm of the US version - which ran for nine seasons.</p>
        
            <p>This new version is very Australasian in flavour, with a number of Kiwis in the cast including Josh Thomson and Edith Poor.</p>
        
            <p>Jackie Van Beek is also one of the main writers.</p>
        
            <p>The character of Hannah Howard, Ward tells RNZ's Nine to Noon, is something of "a riddle, swallowed by an idiot and s**t out by a moron."</p>
        
            <p>"...She's a loving, compulsive liar."</p>
        
            <p>"Hannah is a really good-natured character, but she's so manipulative, and she'll just say anything to get out of a difficult situation. I describe her as a baby goat on ice.</p>
        
            <p>"She's constantly trying to find her legs, because she's such a slippery character, a loveable but slippery character with no self-awareness and delusionally optimistic."</p>
        
            <p>When Ward's agent called to tell her she'd got the role in The Office, there were tears.</p>
        
            <p>"You know what I cried about? Having a job for 10 weeks in a row. What a dream. What an absolute dream."</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't until later the history behind the legendary character sank in, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"A couple of weeks later, I'm going, oh my God, these are big boots to fill."</p>
        
            <p>As soon as she saw the script, she knew she could inhabit the character of Hannah, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The character has essentially every annoying personality trait that I already have.</p>
        
            <p>"She is me, but with no self-awareness, which sounds like an absolutely liberating way to live. Imagine not knowing what other people thought of you or even thinking about it? Heaven, heaven."</p>
        
            <p>Hannah was so well fleshed-out on the page, it was a sound basis to improvise from, she said.</p>

            <p>"I didn't think about how am I going to play it, or how am I going to do it differently? I just did what was on the page. And because it was so well written and well formed, it was easy then to adlib and improvise from a place of that character - without sounding too pretentious."</p>
        
            <p>Ward is aware that there will be many opinions on her character and the Australian version of the much-loved comedy in general.</p>
        
            <p>"I live by the mantra, specifically this show, that other people's opinions are none of my business, so I let everyone have their own opinion."</p>
        
            <p>The Office premieres on Prime on 18 October.</p>
