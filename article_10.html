            <p>If you missed out on seeing Oof Tatata play at Auckland's Tuning Fork in August, you're in luck - Jason Momoa's heavy rock band is playing three more shows across the North Island this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The band is promising a plethora of punk, rock and roll and heavy rock classics for their Aotearoa 2024 tour, which kicks off at Auckland's Powerstation on Friday 25 October before moving down to the Coroglen Traven in the Coromandel Peninsula on Sunday 27 October.</p>
        
            <p>The tour will close with a final show at Rotorua's Energy Events Centre on Saturday 2 November.</p>

            <p>Oof Tatata is the brainchild of old friends Mike Hayes (guitar and lead vocals), Kenny Dale (drums), and Aquaman star Jason Momoa (bass).</p>
        
            <p>In August, the band played their first New Zealand show to a small crowd at the Tuning Fork to celebrate the launch of Momoa's spirit brand Meili Vodka.</p>
        
            <p>That show featured heavy rock covers, plenty of showmanship, and even a guest appearance from Momoa's Baywatch Hawaii costar Charles Brumbley on the harmonica.</p>
        
            <p>The band says the upcoming Aotearoa 2024 tour will also have "a few unlikely surprises" for "a rock n roll night you will not want to miss".</p>
        
            <p>Tickets are available now via Ticketmaster.</p>
