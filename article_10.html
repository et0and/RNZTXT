            <p>A Southland woman fed up with possums attacking her roses has assumed the role of pest controller at a council reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Joan Scarlet of Winton caught her 109th possum - her diary helps her keep count.</p>
        
            <p>The 80-year-old pensioner lives at a property which backs onto Ivy Russell Reserve and has been plagued by the pests for 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>"They're eating my roses. Anybody that's a gardener knows if you've got possums around, they'll decimate them in a night. They just like the flavour," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm trying to protect my garden."</p>
        
            <p>Scarlet is armed with a trap she purchased from regional council Environment Southland and has noticed that numbers spike in warmer weather.</p>
        
            <p>With 20 already netted in 2024, she has eclipsed last year's total of 19 with more than a month to spare.</p>

            <p>It has come at a cost though, with Scarlet forced to not only purchase traps but also bait at around $50 a tube.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm on a pension, and I'm buying stuff to catch their (the council's) possums."</p>
        
            <p>Her concerns were raised on the back of Environment Southland announcing Predator Free Southland was on hold until further notice due to funding issues.</p>
        
            <p>The programme targeted a range of species in the region, including possums.</p>
        
            <p>Still, the octogenarian remains cheerful amid a steady stream of trips over her back fence to check the trap.</p>
        
            <p>She is expecting a visit from the International Heritage Rose Conference in December, and there's no time to sulk.</p>
        
            <p>"It's generational," she says of her gardening habit.</p>

            <p>In response to questions, Environment Southland biosecurity and biodiversity operations manager Ali Meade said possum control was the responsibility of landowners.</p>
        
            <p>The council was providing support to the community, and a successful funding application had been made by a group of volunteers, students and businesses, Meade said.</p>
        
            <p>That project would work with pest plants and animals and include native plantings to improve the reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Southland District Council was approached for comment but did not respond.</p>
