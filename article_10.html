        <h2>Molly Mabel: a kids clothing label that's "rural and rustic"</h2>

            <p>Five-year-old Molly Mabel, sitting on a shelf amid pint-sized winter woollies, is among three generations of women helping warm up the desire for wool.</p>
        
            <p>The photo of Molly, taken perhaps a century ago, is propped up proudly in the corner of her grand-daughter Kelsey Smith's shop in Hunterville.</p>
        
            <p>The township is in the middle of Rangitikei sheep country where, if you're not careful, you might bump into life-size statues of sheep on the main street as you amble up to Kelsey's store.</p>

            <p>Nine years ago Kelsey decided to honour her grandmother by putting Molly's name on her children's clothing label, which features pure New Zealand wool.</p>
        
            <p>Molly was a great cook but it was Molly's daughter, Renae Rutherford, who had the secret talent, Kelsey told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>She knew her mother was a very good seamstress and knitter and when Renae retired from her previous job, Kelsey said "Have I got something for you to do!"</p>
        
            <p>And so the knitting and sewing began, with Renae crafting little dresses from vintage patterns and knitting tiny old-style brownish-coloured jumpers in natural wool, with Molly's name attached on a label.</p>
        
            <p>"Invoking memories of days gone by."</p>
        
            <p>The label's size range has grown as babies of the first buyers have grown older. Kelsey has taken on another knitter to keep up with demand.</p>

            <p>While wool off the sheep's back is going through tough times price-wise, Kelsey is among many trying to keep interest in the fibre alive.</p>
        
            <p>Her shop, Hunterville Village Bookshop, also hosts a Stitch and Yarn group when people, from 10-year-olds to those in their 80s, gather in the evening to knit and crochet.</p>
        
            <p>"People have learned a new skill ... they might have been able to share some yarn or some patterns or a good old-fashioned talking yarn.</p>
        
            <p>"It's brought a really different group of people together that perhaps wouldn't have connected otherwise."</p>
        
            <p>Kelsey says her clothing brand is all about supporting farmers, the wool coming off the land and local people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's based on being rural and rustic and totally exploiting my mother's talents."</p>
        
            <p>She hopes her grandmother, Molly Mabel, would have been very proud.</p>
