            <p>A 40-litres-of-milk-a-day Friesian called Evie has been Supreme Champion Holstein at the New Zealand A&P Agricultural Show for two years in a row. Cosmo Kentish-Barnes meets the farmer behind the cow.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a born and bred dairy farmer," says Oliva Cahill who milks 180 cows on the North Canterbury farm her parents bought when she was seven.</p>
        
            <p>She farms there with her dad, Peter Sherriff, who is a third generation dairy farmer.</p>
        
            <p>"I do all the morning milkings and he does all the evenings and we're both on the farm throughout the day," she says.</p>

            <p>You'll only find one breed of cow on the 152-hectare Ohoka property - big, beautiful, black-and-white Holsteins.</p>
        
            <p>"We use mainly North American genetics, they're all pedigree cows and we're producing about 8000 litres of milk every second day at the moment."  </p>
        
            <p>Olivia also runs the Sherraine Holstein Stud on the farm. She's continuing a long-standing family tradition.  </p>
        
            <p>"It's about 100 years of breeding. My grandfather started breeding Holsteins back in 1923."</p>

            <p>Six-year-old Sherraine Solomon Evie is a prime example of the high-performing herd's genetic calibre.</p>
        
            <p>"She's calm, she's got great bone, she milks well, she's calved every year and she produces a lot of milk."</p>
        
            <p>When Olivia approaches Evie in a paddock she's the last cow to get up.</p>
        
            <p>They've developed a kinship after spending many hours together preparing for shows.</p>
        
            <p>Show cows like Evie are usually taken out of the main herd five or six weeks before a major competition.</p>
        
            <p>"We get them used to being tied up, break them in if they've never been on a halter before, we put them on hay and a show-mix meal, so just getting them into a routine."</p>
        
            <p>Even though the New Zealand Agricultural Show in Christchurch will be cancelled this year, Evie will still get the opportunity to make it a three-peat.</p>
        
            <p>Livestock judging and competitions would still be held, without the public crowds, as was the case in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic.</p>
