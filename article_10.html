        <h2>Glastonbury 2024 in pictures: Sunshine and secret sets</h2>
        <p>
Over five days in blazing sunshine, thousands of fans flocked to hear some of music's biggest names play at the 2024 Glastonbury Fesival.
</p>
        
            <p>The last day of Glastonbury, in southwest England, saw thousands of fans flock to hear some of music's biggest names, including Shania Twain, SZA and Coldplay.</p>
        
            <p>Parasols and umbrellas were dotted around in front of the Pyramid Stage as festival-goers watched acts including Cyndi Lauper, Ayra Starr, the Last Dinner Party and Avril Lavigne.</p>
        
            <p>The festival, now in its 54th year, saw Coldplay take to the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, the band's fifth headline appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Actor Michael J Fox appeared on screen with the band to play 'Fix You'.</p>
        
            <p>Martin told the audience that the star's 1985 film Back To The Future was "the main reason why we're in a band".</p>
        
            <p>Chefs serving up Sunday roasts to hungry festival-goers sold out in just 55 minutes, and on Monday weary revellers will make their way back home, and the mass clean-up operation will begin.</p>
