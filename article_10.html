            <p>ACT Party leader and former Dancing with the Stars contestant David Seymour has revealed he is a "massive fan" of Australian breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn.</p>
        
            <p>The Olympic athlete went viral around the world for her performance at the Paris Games last month when she failed to get a single point.</p>
        
            <p>She faced backlash she described as "devastating".</p>
        
            <p>"I really appreciate the positivity, and I'm glad I was able to bring some joy into your lives. That's what I hoped," Raygun said in an Instagram post.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't realise that that would also open the door to so much hate which has, frankly, been pretty devastating."</p>
        
            <p>But she has the support of Seymour who told RNZ he admired her courage.</p>

            <p>"Look, I'm a massive fan of Raygun, she's got the courage to be herself and I think it's actually a bit of a social commentary that we're so quick, or at least some people, are so quick to rip people down for being different and giving it a go.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a secret admirer of Raygun and her dancing style, she's a dancer after my own heart.</p>
        
            <p>"But I would say to her when it comes to being the best in the world, I think she's already her own best. I don't know if she will be the best in the world, people ask me 'have I carried on dancing?' I say 'mate, I never started'. Sometimes you do need to know your limits from a competitive point-of-view but from a self-expression point-of-view, I'm right behind her."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour brought the art of twerking back when he appeared on the New Zealand version of Dancing with the Stars in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>According to Newshub, Seymour came in at the bottom of the scoreboard every week.</p>
        
            <p>But the Kiwi public continued to vote for him and keep him in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>By the time it got to the semi-final, Seymour landed in the bottom two and was ousted from the competition.</p>
