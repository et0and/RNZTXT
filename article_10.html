        <h2>The pricing model that has left Oasis fans fuming</h2>
        <p>
The Cure's Robert Smith might call it "a greedy scam" but the in-demand ticket pricing putting Oasis fans in a huff is here to stay, says Consumer NZ. Audio

            <p>In-demand ticket pricing might be putting Oasis fans in a huff but it is here to stay, says Chris Schulz of Consumer NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Fans were fuming over the massive hiked prices they paid for Oasis concert tickets after waiting hours in an online queue, It's a "nightmare situation" for fans, Schulz told RNZ's Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"You sit in these digital waiting rooms, which apparently for this show some people were in them for up to six hours.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you get through the waiting room, if you're lucky, you get into the queue, and you get given a number, and that number, I saw one that said they were 148,000th in the queue"</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile for the avid Oasis fan, anxiety was building and building - and this was good for business, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While you're sitting there, you're just thinking about all these other people who are snapping up tickets that you're not going to get.</p>
        
            <p>"And then if you're lucky enough to get through and there are tickets that are left, you might be faced with buying these in-demand tickets because they're more expensive, they're often the last ones to go."</p>
        
            <p>While dynamic pricing was commonplace in industries such as tourism, it is a relatively new to ticket pricing, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really only been in the last couple of years, post-Covid, that these in-demand tickets have been happening.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, people aren't used to it. I'm guessing, for a lot of people in the UK, it might have been the first ticket concert ticket they had bought in a long time."</p>
        
            <p>And before finger-pointing at ticketing behemoths such as Ticketmaster, it's a decision that lies with the artist, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some pretty major acts who've spoken out against it. The Cure's Robert Smith called a 'greedy scam' Neil Young, as well, is up in arms about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Others are more accepting of it; Bruce Springsteen uses it. Some of his tickets were going for about $5,000 through in-demand pricing."</p>
        
            <p>There was nevertheless something inherently unfair about it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll give you an example, for SZA earlier this year, I got a general admission ticket for $250 but the in-demand pricing for that show had those tickets at $550; same ticket, same spot in the show, same view, $300 more for that ticket.</p>
        
            <p>"And the other thing that can happen too, is that if a show sells out and the artist and then announces another show, and fans have bought these in-demand tickets because they're desperate to go and they don't know there's going to be another show, suddenly there they're kind of not worth as much."</p>
        
            <p>For Oasis fans it was a case of suck it up or miss out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know if they'll ever tour again. They may have another fight on stage and call it all off. This could be a once in a lifetime opportunity."</p>
