            <p>The government on Sunday launched a new tourism campaign aimed at getting Australians to visit New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christoper Luxon, appearing with Tourism Minister Louise Upston, said his first job was in the tourism industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Tourism is really important to our economy," he said, saying the sector had not bounced back since the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said there was "spare capacity" in airlines and hotels that could be filled.</p>
        
            <p>"Our job… is to make sure we get New Zealand to the top of the bucket list" for Australians, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"My message to Australians is it's time to swap thongs for jandals. It's time to swap the Hunter Valley for the Hawke's Bay and get the bloody hell over here."</p>
        
            <p>Upston said 2025 was set to be a growth year for the tourism sector.</p>
        
            <p>"We always love to see our Australian friends holidaying here… soaking up the great Kiwi experiences."</p>
        
            <p>She said visitor numbers from Australia were 88 percent of what they were in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian campaign, dubbed 'Everyone must go', would cost taxpayers $500,000, she said, and would be followed by more campaigns targeting other places.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said with contributions from the private sector, the campaign will run through March and April.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of what we're doing is working with the airlines and the hotels," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>"By focusing on Australia, it's then saying, 'Right, well how do we all come together and maximise the impact?' and that's what's really exciting about it."</p>
        
            <p>She said the government did not have to do the work on its own.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really complimenting the work that the industry was already doing, in some cases is now doing more, because we're leading by example.</p>

            <p>Hospitality NZ welcomed the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's announcement that renewed effort will be placed on attracting more visitors from Australia is a positive step in returning New Zealand to pre-Covid visitation levels," chief executive Steve Armitage said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pleasing to see further recognition that tourism and hospitality will play a pivotal role in supporting the government's economic growth agenda.</p>
        
            <p>"This campaign is a good step forward but we are keen to see further investment from the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy to drive business into our hospitality operators and communities throughout New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Armitage said Australians alone would not make up the gap between current tourism levels and pre-Covid levels.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism NZ chief executive René de Monchy said it was fantastic to see the Government focused on growing tourism.</p>
        
            <p>"We really want to people to visit now," he said. "Book now, that's why the campaign is very much about 'everyone must go', which is about urgency."</p>
        
            <p>Australia was the only short-haul market for the country, de Monchy said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic to see the focus, I think, from the government as well on how do we accelerate and grow tourism,</p>
        
            <p>"Tourism was our number one export earner previously, our number one employer, and it's vitally important - it also connects us to the world."</p>
