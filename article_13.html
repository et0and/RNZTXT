            <p>There has been an outpouring of grief and appreciation for the life of one of the founding fathers of Papua New Guinea - Sir Julius Chan.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Julius, 85, passed away in his home province of New Ireland just after midday on Thursday, marking an end to a long political career spanning half a century. Papua New Guineans dubbed him the "Last Man Standing," as he as last of the founding members of parliament from the Independence era.</p>
        
            <p>Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape informed members of cabinet of Sir Julius Chan's passing.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of the Last Man Standing. While Sir Michael Somare was the father of our country, the late Sir Julius was the father of our modern economy. He conceived the Kina and Toea. He was our country's first finance minister and our second Prime Minister."</p>
        
            <p>Marape has declared a week of national mourning to honour the life and legacy Sir Julius Chan, and announced plans for a state funeral and low key celebrations for the country's 50th independence anniversary in September.</p>
        
            <p>In the annals of Papua New Guinea's political history, few figures loom as large - or as controversially - as Sir Julius Chan. A statesman whose career spans five decades, his legacy is etched with bold decisions that sparked both admiration and outrage.</p>
        
            <p>From deploying troops to a Pacific neighbour to facing global criticism for being the Prime Minister who hired foreign mercenaries in a bid to end a civil war, his leadership tested the boundaries of convention and reshaped the nation's trajectory.</p>

            <p>He entered politics in the twilight of colonial rule. He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1968. By 1976, as PNG's first finance minister, he navigated the economic turbulence of independence, advocating for foreign investment and resource development.</p>
        
            <p>Within PNG politics, Sir Julius was seen as a tactician, weaving through the complexities of tribal and national politics and seizing opportunities when available.</p>
        
            <p>In 1980, he initiated the first-ever vote of no confidence motion against close friend and Prime Minister Michael Somare, ousting him on the floor of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>His first term as prime minister from 1980 to 1982, solidified his reputation as a pragmatist.</p>
        
            <p>Facing fiscal strain, he championed austerity, infrastructure projects and devalued the PNG currency.</p>
        
            <p>But it was a foreign policy move that drew regional attention.</p>
        
            <p>In 1980, he authorised the deployment of PNG troops on its first international deployment: Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>The mission was aimed at quelling a rebellion against Vanuatu's newly independent government.</p>
        
            <p>In parliament, he argued that the deployment was necessary for regional stability and stamped PNG's role as an important player in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Critics called it overreach as PNG was not even past its first decade as an independent country. However, the deployment earned PNG the respect from Vanuatu and its Pacific neighbours - for the first time in a young nation's budding history, that standing up for a Pacific brother when no one else would, was enough for a new regional respect for PNG.</p>
        
            <p>The operation ended swiftly, but the precedent set by PNG's military would reverberate for decades.</p>
        
            <p>His second term as prime minister from 1994 to 1997, collided with PNG's most protracted conflict: the Bougainville Civil War.</p>
        
            <p>By 1996, the crisis had claimed 20,000 lives, crippled the economy, and exposed the PNG Defence Force's limitations.</p>
        
            <p>Desperate to break the stalemate, his government signed a secretive $36 million contract with Sandline International, a UK-based private mercenary group, to crush the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA).</p>
        
            <p>When the deal leaked in 1997, public fury erupted.</p>
        
            <p>The PNGDF, led by Brigadier General Jerry Singirok, arrested the mercenaries and demanded Chan's resignation.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Julius stood defiant. Critics, however, saw betrayal with many saying hiring outsiders was an affront to sovereignty.</p>
        
            <p>Under pressure, he stepped aside pending an inquiry. Though exonerated of corruption, his political capital evaporated. The Sandline Affair became a cautionary tale of desperation and overreach.</p>
        
            <p>His career, however, refused to end in scandal. After a decade in the political wilderness, he returned as New Ireland Governor in 2007, championing provincial autonomy and education reforms.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, he published his memoir, confronting the Sandline chapter head-on.</p>
        
            <p>His peers acknowledged his tenacity with founding Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, before his passing, pointing out how both men had separated politics from their personal friendship for over 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>Despite rising to political leadership at the national level, and having a strong hand in the formation of our country's economic and financial stability, and using its young military force to nurture Pacific solidarity, Sir Julius will always be remembered for his respect of culture and tradition.</p>
        
            <p>His elevation and acknowledgment of the MaiMai, New Ireland's Chieftan System as a recognised decision-making body within the New Ireland Provincial Government and the Provincial Assembly, was testament to Sir Julius' own devotion and respect for traditional New Ireland culture.</p>
        
            <p>His creation of a pension for the wisened population of his home province, not only assured him continuous support from New Ireland's older population at every election, but it set an example of the importance of traditional systems of governance and decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>To the world, he was a new country's financial whiz kid, growing up in an environment rooted in traditional culture, and navigating a young Papua New Guinea as a mixed race leader saw him become one of PNG's finest leaders.</p>
        
            <p>To the country, he will always be remembered as the 'Last Man Standing'.</p>
        
            <p>But to his people of New Ireland, he will, over the coming weeks, be accorded the highest of traditional and customary acknowledgements that only the people of New Ireland will be able to bestow on such a Great Man. A Great Chief. A Great Leader.</p>
        
            <p>They will say for one last time: 'Lapun i go nau. Wok bilong em i pinis.' (The old man has left, his work here is done).</p>
