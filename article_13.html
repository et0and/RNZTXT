            <p>Tonga's National Disaster Risk Management Office says there have been no reports of damage in the kingdom after a magnitude 7 earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>The quake hit 79 kilometres south-southeast of Pangai, which is in the Ha'apai group of islands in Tonga, about 1.20am this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The quake is reported to be the biggest felt in Tonga in 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>People in Tonga had earlier been told to move to higher ground or further inland after a tsunami threat was issued.</p>
        
            <p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre says the tsunami threat for Tongan and Niue coastal areas from a magnitude 7 quake has passed.</p>
        
            <p>Aftershocks are continuing centred in the same area - one measuring at 6.1.</p>
        
            <p>Tonga's National Disaster Risk Management Office director Mafua Maka said there had been no reports of damage yet from the outer islands and the main island of Tongatapu.</p>
        
            <p>He said the quake was felt all over Tongatapu, the Ha'apai group, 'Eua, the Vava'u group of islands, and the two Niuas, the northern most islands which were not part of the warnings from the Tsunami Warning Centre.</p>
        
            <p>He said most people had returned home after the tsunami warnings were lifted.</p>
        
            <p>"The first responders, police, armed forces, fire and emergency services are still directing people to ensure they return home safely," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A Kiwi working in Veitongo, Tonga, Ben Maloney, has told RNZ he woke up to his bed shaking and the windows rattling.</p>
        
            <p>He said the whole house was shaking quite badly.</p>
