        <h2>Son of couple who gifted Begonia House questions $20m repair bill</h2>
        <p>
"It needs some glass and a new heating system. That does not cost $20 million,' Wayne Norwood, the son of Sir Charles and Lady Rosina Norwood says.

            <p>A man whose parents gifted the iconic Begonia House to Wellington's Botanic Gardens has launched a fundraiser to save the tourist attraction.</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Norwood's parents Sir Charles and Lady Rosina Norwood gifted the glass house in 1960.</p>
        
            <p>The rose garden in front of it is named after Lady Rosina.</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Norwood told Morning Report it is full of exotic and very rare plants not seen anywhere else in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It provided not only an educational purpose but people used it as a venue for weddings and celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>"People have memories, very fond memories of Begonia House - if it's sound, why pull it down?"</p>

            <p>Norwood said while he's started a fighting fund, the council have a role in fixing Begonia House.</p>
        
            <p>"It was donated under the understanding that the council would maintain it. Now because of lack of maintenance they want to pull it down," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need this council to understand that some of us do believe in heritage and that things of this nature are worth saving.</p>
        
            <p>"Goodness gracious, it's the second most visited venue in Wellington from people from outside of Wellington - it's important."</p>
        
            <p>The council thinks it may cost $20 million to fix but Norwood said the building itself was sounds and strengthened a few years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"It needs some glass and a new heating system. That does not cost $20 million. So we have no idea where that figure comes from and what they're including in that figure."</p>
        
            <p>In late November, Wellington councillors gave Begonia House a lifeline through an amendment that states the future of the building will be assessed after a review of it next year.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief operating officer James Roberts previously said much of Begonia House was at the end of its life, and needed replacing rather than being "patched up".</p>
        
            <p>1913: The Begonia House started in a potting shed in the nursery area, up behind what is now the visitor centre.</p>
        
            <p>1924: The Begonia House was extended to cater for the crowds. One newspaper photo showed hundreds of people queuing up.</p>
        
            <p>1933: A local men's tennis team named itself Begonia House. It is thought they were probably a group of gardeners or nearby residents who played on the garden's tennis courts.</p>
        
            <p>1939: Lady Norwood offered 200 pounds - the equivalent of $20,000 to improve Begonia House but war put that on hold.</p>
        
            <p>1960: The Norwoods put a further 20,000 pounds ($1.2 million in today's money) to build a new Begonia House. The winter garden and a tea house opened on 22 December 1960 by mayor Francis Kitts and Prime Minister Keith Holyoake.</p>
        
            <p>1989: The Begonia house was extended to include a lily pond.</p>
        
            <p>1994: The current tearooms, now Picnic Cafe, was built.</p>
