            <p>Indian New Zealanders have expressed frustration that they are missing out on a chance to participate in the world's largest democratic exercise as India begins voting in the 2024 general election.</p>
        
            <p>Spanning six weeks from 19 April to 1 June, nearly 968 million Indians are expected to head to polling booths nationwide in seven phases.</p>
        
            <p>However, countless Indians residing in New Zealand are unable to vote due to electoral laws stating they had to be in India to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are vying for a third successive term, while opposition parties argue that the continuation of his tenure could jeopardise many freedoms.</p>
        
            <p>"I do miss the buzz of Indian elections," Philips Augustine, who moved to Auckland from southern India in 2017, said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bummer I can't participate (in the Indian election) from New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Unlike New Zealand, India does not have a system whereby citizens living abroad can vote in the general election.</p>
        
            <p>But Augustine acknowledged the challenges involved in establishing such a system for a vast country such as India.</p>
        
            <p>"BJP sure has some serious backing in India but, I have to admit, I've got some serious concerns if Modi bags that third term."</p>
        
            <p>He said more recently some Indian voters had tended to prioritise religious and political ideologies over assessing the government's performance.</p>
        
            <p>Augustine underscored the challenges posed by the intertwining of religion and politics, expressing particular concern for minority communities.</p>
        
            <p>"I appreciate Modi's efforts to elevate India's global standing and enhance diplomatic relations, but I believe there's ample room for improvement."</p>
        
            <p>He added that the Modi administration had not effectively addressed issues such as those in Manipur or safeguarded press freedom in India in a manner that would sway his vote in favour of the BJP, if given the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Aravind Narayan migrated to New Zealand in 2019 and lives in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>He also missed the vibrant energy of Indian elections, especially the media coverage.</p>
        
            <p>"In India, the media plays a significant role during the election, especially when they engage with communities, allowing everyone to voice their opinions," Narayan said.</p>
        
            <p>He thought Modi would return for a third term.</p>
        
            <p>"The opposition seems weak, and Modi's administration has implemented several commendable policies."</p>
        
            <p>Narayan said policies such as Make in India had transformed India into a manufacturing hub attracting gigantic companies like Apple and Tesla.</p>
        
            <p>"The shift from 'Made in China' to 'Made in India' on everyday products is a significant achievement."</p>
        
            <p>Narayan also highlighted Modi's push for a cashless economy that had positioned India as a leader in digital transactions, with innovations such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI) setting global benchmarks.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everything is perfect, but I believe Modi's government has achieved enough to resonate with Indian voters when they head to the polling booths.:</p>
        
            <p>Aswathi Surendran shifted from India to Wellington in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>She never voted while in India, but is still an Indian citizen.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Modi has a good chance, at least that's what [the] vast majority of my community thinks," Surendran said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm troubled by certain policies of the Modi government that seem to suggest authoritarian tendencies but on the flip side I admire how India has grown in the world stage under his term."</p>
        
            <p>Ashley Abraham has spent most of his life outside of India but maintains a keen interest in India and its political landscape.</p>
        
            <p>He moved to Wellington seven years ago after working for several years in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>"I was only able to participate in the elections twice in my life and I do miss being part of it," Abraham said.</p>
        
            <p>He viewed elections as integral but believed it was high time radical ideologies were phased out from the political arena.</p>
        
            <p>"I draw inspiration from leaders like the former president of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who prioritised advancements in science and technology regardless of his political affiliations."</p>
        
            <p>Abraham believed Modi stood a good chance of winning the election, owing to a robust leadership that had propelled India to become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, he added a note of caution.</p>
        
            <p>"Modi's government has several areas that warrant improvement, including addressing religious disparities, combating corruption and raising social standards."</p>
