            <p>A South Auckland community is left reeling after the town centre's seating area and playground, fixtures for years, were fenced off and dismantled to deter antisocial behaviour and public drinking, despite the local area's liquor ban.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria Hearn is a volunteer and trustee of the Ōtara Gambling and Alcohol Action Group (OGAAG), an advocacy group that has been addressing alcohol harm and gambling concerns in the Ōtara Papatoetoe community for 20 years. She was caught off guard on Wednesday afternoon and saw the playground in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit shocked. There was no warning. I literally like I just took a couple of photos there this morning when I got into work early. Because when you come in early and there's no one there, it's this beautiful space.</p>
        
            <p>"And then a couple of hours later, I come back, and it's just being demolished. And all that's going to happen is those guys are just going to pull out all those, you know, milk crates that they sit on.</p>
        
            <p>"And now they're just going to sit along the front of these shops. And people I know just don't come into those shops because of the drinkers that are sitting there."</p>
        
            <p>She is disappointed over the removal of the playground and benches under the trees, feeling gutted that while the root issue - alcohol consumption and antisocial behaviour outside the Ōtara TAB - remains unaddressed, the community has lost valuable public space.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of our community has been advocating for it to be removed because of the drinking that happens next to it and at that seating. But it's just the wrong way to go about it rather than getting rid of the drinkers."</p>
        
            <p>"It just feels like the drinkers have won. They've claimed that space as theirs. It's our kids that have lost out to a bunch of people drinking."</p>
        
            <p>Hearn laments the loss of the fenced-off area, which she considered "the only green space in the town centre", and believes it could have been transformed into a family-friendly area.</p>
        
            <p>Her concern is magnified as this was the only playground in the Ōtara town centre, which she highlighted in a Facebook video posted by the OGAAG.</p>

            <p>"It's been around for years, like already I've had people comment on Facebook saying, that playground's a place where they can bring their kids when they're down here doing their shopping and things like that. And I just think that we should be trying to put as much energy into getting rid of the liquor store and the TAB rather than the playground."</p>
        
            <p>Hearn lived in Ōtara for six years and says residents have indicated this has been a problem for over 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"There's also a really high number of our older Pasifika men and women who come there to socialise. You know, those social connections are really essential to their whole mental health and well-being. And without it, they sort of risk that sort of social isolation and loneliness.</p>
        
            <p>"And we know that there's a whole lot of people that come there and congregate there just to catch up with each other. And then you have this other group that are wrecked at all by drinking alcohol there. And it's 24-7."</p>
        
            <p>Local Democracy Reporting spoke to Ōtara residents Chloe and Joviani, who wish to remain anonymous and who questioned, "Why not get rid of the TAB?" after witnessing the playground's disassembly.</p>
        
            <p>"We just pulled up and I asked her, she said it was on the South side woke," of their surprise at the fenced area," Chloe says.</p>
        
            <p>"I've reported this so many times," referring to the alcohol and men congregating in the area. "And their comments towards most of the kids in that area. We walked into the meat shop one day and my son got scared," she said, highlighting the community's concerns despite the alcohol ban.</p>
        
            <p>Joviani said: "I think take it down, the TAB. Only because there are heaps of men around here and there's kids like solo mums around here."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if her children used the playground, Chloe replied, "Yeah, our kids do. Oh, they did, but not anymore, people piss in there. And that's disgusting."</p>
        
            <p>Joviani said the playground has been there longer than they have, adding, older than themselves, adding, "Yeah, probably all of us. Even our parents."</p>
        
            <p>She said, "I think it's like ... I think most people have heaps of memories here. And for it to get busted, it's really sad, eh?"</p>

            <p>Apulu Reece Autagavaia, chair of the Ōtara-Papatoetoe Local Board, said there were local concerns regarding the fencing around the playground and told Local Democracy Reporting in a statement: "We understand that many in our community have noticed and expressed concern about the fencing around the playground near Mr Meats and the seating area near Jasmine Nails and Spa, inside the Ōtara Town Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes have sparked a lot of discussion, and we genuinely hear and appreciate the passion behind those concerns. We've also received numerous queries and want to assure everyone that we are committed to keeping the community informed."</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed that dismantling the playground began on 29 January and is expected to be completed by the end of next week, weather permitting.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue of anti-social behaviour has been a significant and ongoing topic of discussion and concern for over two years," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"The current playground is being dismantled, with plans for a new, upgraded playground in a different location, incorporating input from local youth. The board is committed to ensuring the space reflects the community's needs and desires.</p>
        
            <p>"The project is part of a broader plan to promote inclusive play spaces and address anti-social behaviour through community engagement and activations."</p>
        
            <p>The town centre remains subject to a liquor ban, and anyone found breaching this ban will face consequences.</p>
