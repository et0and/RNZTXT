        <h2>Who is the most ill-disciplined All Black?</h2>

            <p>Discipline very nearly cost the All Blacks another test at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>With late cards to both Anton Lienert-Brown and Caleb Clarke, the door was left open for the Wallabies to storm a sensational comeback, and they very nearly snatched the win from New Zealand, going down 31-28.</p>
        
            <p>The lessons are clearly not being learned for the All Blacks, having just last year lost the Rugby World Cup final with 14 men. The All Blacks had two men sent off in the first 112 years of their official test history, with an further nine since 2017, three coming in 2023 alone.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ takes a look at the All Blacks discipline record.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks with the most cards:</p>
        
            <p>1. Scott Barrett, 5.</p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 3</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 2</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs South Africa, Twickenham 2023, lost 35-7.</p>
        
            <p>The current All Blacks skipper is the worst offender, the only player in All Black history to be shown red twice, first in 2019 against the Wallabies for a no arms tackle, and in the record defeat to the Springboks at Twickenham prior to the 2023 World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>He has also seen red at Super level for making shoulder contact to the jaw of Alex Hodgman in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>2. Sam Cane, 5. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 4</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 1</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs South Africa 2023, Stade de France, lost 12-11.</p>
        
            <p>Second on the list, Barrett's predecessor.</p>
        
            <p>Sent off in the 28th minute of the world cup final against the Boks, Cane has admitted his shoulder to the head of Jesse Kriel which prematurely ended his campaign, will haunt him forever.</p>
        
            <p>3. Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 4. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 3</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 1</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs Australia, 2020, Brisbane, lost 24-22.</p>
        
            <p>Prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi was the fifth All Black sent off in a test, after making high contact on Wallaby winger Tom Wright, swinging the test in favour of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>4. Jordie Barrett, 2. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 1</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 1*</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs Australia, 2021, Perth, won 38-21.</p>
        
            <p>*Barrett's red card for a front kick to the face of Marika Koroibete was later rescinded. </p>
        
            <p>While it looked dramatic, Jordie Barrett was ultimately acquitted after sending his sprigs into the mush of Marika Koroibete.</p>
        
            <p>However, his red card for the Hurricanes for a high shot on Jordan Petaia cost him several weeks on the sideline</p>
        
            <p>5. Ethan De Groot, 1. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 0</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 1</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs Namibia, 2023, Stadium Toulouse, won 71-3.</p>
        
            <p>With just eight minutes to go and well ahead on the scoreboard, Ethan De Groot took the gloss off the Namibian rout at the world cup, making contact with the head of Adriaan Booysen, and was subsequently banned for the final two pool games.</p>
        
            <p>6. Beauden Barrett, 4. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 4</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 0.</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs Australia 2014, Sydney, drew 12-all.</p>
        
            <p>Tied with Cane for the most yellow cards in the current squad, and one shy of another former skipper in Kieran Read with five, Barrett's</p>
        
            <p>68th minute yellow against the Wallabies for cynical play allowed Kurtley Beale to level the scores and ensure the stalemate.</p>
        
            <p>Another professional foul against the Waratahs in 2017 resulted in a second yellow and a first career red card.</p>
        
            <p>7. Codie Taylor, 3. </p>
        
            <p>Yellows - 3</p>
        
            <p>Reds - 0.</p>
        
            <p>Costliest card - vs Ireland 2023, Stade de France, won 28-24.</p>
        
            <p>With 17 minutes to go in a pressure cooker quarter-final, Taylor dragged down an Irish maul, Wayne BArnes giving him a breather while also awarding a penalty try to Ireland which brought them back within one.</p>
