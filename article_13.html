            <p>There is a need for an overhaul of Fiji's health and social systems to combat the drugs problem, the founder of the non-profit Drug-Free World Fiji says.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji police have seized three-and-a-half tonnes of methamphetamine, in what they say is one of the largest seizures seen in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in chaos," Kalesi Volatabu said of the impact of meth on the Fijian community.</p>
        
            <p>"So we need an overhaul of our social system, whether it be with health education, you know - community safety is impacted with this," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have a drug and alcohol rehab in the country. So that's first and foremost. The demand was initially the international market, whether it be New Zealand, Australia or any other country, but now we have a demand here locally.</p>
        
            <p>"The requests, from the families, from [an] individual looking for help, where do they go? There isn't a place where they can go."</p>
        
            <p>She believes "100 percent" the seized stash was headed for Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia, which gives those two countries a responsibility to help.</p>
        
            <p>"Without a doubt, they have to help this country," she said.</p>

            <p>Fiji Police acting commissioner Juki Fong Chew said via email "we are in the initial stage of the investigation".</p>
        
            <p>He did not respond to questions about the people involved, whether any arrests were made, or where the drugs originated and its destination.</p>
        
            <p>"As we proceed along, the questions you have raised may be answered," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Home Affairs minster Pio Tikoduadua told local journalists on Monday that people of interest have been questioned, including the involvement of local businesses and 'prominent figures and officials".</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from the Australian Federal Police also confirmed: "This is a Fiji Police Force operation."</p>
        
            <p>"All enquiries should be directed to the Fiji Police Force."</p>

            <p>Volatabua said Fiji is not in a position to address the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have anything to cater for what's happening here locally. We're so far behind with everything else," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said law enforcement needs to be strengthened, adding "but at the same time, the community is suffering".</p>
        
            <p>"Fiji is only a small country. When you look at it - 3.5 tonnes - if the cartels can actually bring this into the country, I am sure they've got enough money to buy people, buy government," Volatabu said.</p>
