            <p>The Automobile Association (AA) has revealed the peak days for people travelling.</p>
        
            <p>It said people traditionally return from their holidays on 2 and 3 January - the peak days for travelling.</p>
        
            <p>AA chief policy officer Simon Douglas said the biggest traffic hotspots were expected to be north and south of Auckland, as that was where there were "the biggest population centres".</p>
        
            <p>Douglas said there could also be some congestion around Wellington, although the opening of Transmission Gully had seen traffic flow improve "considerably" in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>"If you can leave before 10am in the morning or after 4pm in the afternoon, you'll avoid the worst of those peaks," Douglas advised.</p>
        
            <p>Douglas said a huge maintenance programme had also been rolled out by the government this summer, further affecting traffic.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had also been "quite a bit of variation" in the weather conditions over the Christmas period and there were heavy rain warnings ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're planning to drive through those events, please if you can avoid being on the road at the worst of times."</p>
        
            <p>If people did have to drive in adverse conditions, he advised that they allowed extra journey time and keep an adequate distance from the car in front of them.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said rain would be approaching the western part of the country from the later part of Thursday and into Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain watches were already in place for several parts of the South Island and Mount Taranaki in the North.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said more wind and rain watches could be added.</p>
        
            <p>Holiday road toll</p>
        
            <p>The Christmas holiday road toll has risen to seven following the death of a woman in a quad bike crash in Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Rauparaha Street in Marokopa late yesterday afternoon, after witnesses reported seeing her come off the bike.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, 21 people died on the roads over the Christmas-New Year holiday period.</p>
