            <p>Psychologist and media personality Nigel Latta - who was given a year to live - has announced his cancer is in remission and now expects to live for "years and years".</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Latta revealed in a Facebook video that a gastroenterologist had found a tumour at the base of his stomach, and given him between six and 12 months to live. The cancer was both inoperable and incurable, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But in a video posted on social media today, Latta said he had not posted in almost nine months because he had been busy healing.</p>
        
            <p>"I've responded really well to chemo, and that hasn't affected me as badly as it does some people."</p>
        
            <p>"And I can take a whole bunch of wonder drugs, and the wonder drugs are working.</p>
        
            <p>"The original stomach tumour has now pretty much gone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He was able to stay on the medication indefinitely, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So for me, I'm that guy ... who got given that terrible prognosis, but I'm going to be around for a long time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been an interesting time, I've learnt a lot, I wrote a book. I got bored at the three month mark of watching telly, so I wrote a book and that's going to be out in July this year.</p>
        
            <p>"And I'm back at work again."</p>
        
            <p>Latta is known for presenting the true crime series Beyond the Darklands and the Politically Incorrect parenting shows, as well as his books on the same topics. Most recently, he presented the TVNZ show You've Been Scammed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling sprightly. I'm feeling really good. I'm energetic.</p>
        
            <p>"Oncology is a miraculous thing, and there are some amazing drugs. And I'm kind of benefiting from all of that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to all of the people who have sent such lovely messages of support and caring over the last nine months.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very kind thing to do, and it's very humbling."</p>
