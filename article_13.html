            <p>A dramatic day three in Wellington has put the Black Caps in with a chance at an unlikely victory in the first test against Australia.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has been set 369 for victory, and after losing three early wickets, are 111/3, needing 258 runs with Rachin Ravindra unbeaten on 56 and Daryl Mitchell on 12.</p>
        
            <p>The Basin Reserve pitch offered plenty of turn for spinners, the Black Caps hero of day two coming to the party again, this time with the ball.</p>
        
            <p>Glenn Phillips bagged a five wicket haul which saw the tourists bowled out for 179.</p>
        
            <p>Backing up his fighting half century yesterday afternoon. Phillips claimed 5/45, among his scalps Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green, Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head and Alex Carey.</p>
        
            <p>Phillips told TVNZ it was a pretty surreal moment to take five wickets in Wellington, believing any chance he would have had would come in the subcontinent.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a dream come true. I've had a serious set of coaching staff help me over the years, and as a bowling unit we definitely stuck to the things we wanted to stick to, partnership bowling the whole way through."</p>
        
            <p>Phillips took off in a celebratory run as Cameron Green flicked him to Will Young at short leg.</p>
        
            <p>"Any celebration a six-year-old girl would do, that's me, the emotion, the way the crowd went up, it was just an unbelievable moment."</p>
        
            <p>The all-rounder said they are very much in this test match.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to combat the situations out there now, obviously there is a bit of tun how we got about facing (Nathan) Lyon is going to be a challenge. But we have the time on the board to hopefully be able to pull this off."</p>

            <p>Lyon would end up top scoring for Australia as nightwatchman with an innings of 42 to frustrate the Black Caps.</p>
        
            <p>It was not all smooth sailing in the field for the hosts, with two dropped catches coming from Phillips' bowling, first Scott Kuggeleijn and then substitute fielder Henry Nicolls.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps made a poor start to the chase as Tom Latham's lean run continued, lasting only 18 balls before Lyon had him caught behind for eight.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson was then caught at leg slip off Lyon for just nine.</p>
        
            <p>Next to go was Will Young, edging Travis Head to Steve Smith who took a one handed screamer at slip.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell came to the crease and looked well out of sorts, struggling with Lyon's line, meanwhile Rachin Ravindra was looking comfortable at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>Lyon almost had Mitchell stumped, frustrating the right hander into a charge down the pitch, however Alex Carey fumbled the chance.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra stayed busy compiling runs, taking Head for a late six, and bringing up a half century with a powerful pull through backward square.</p>
        
            <p>Day four gets underway at 11am tomorrow.</p>
