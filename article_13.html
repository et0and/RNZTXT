            <p>Australia has pushed New Zealand down a spot to become the 10th happiest country in the world, according to the latest World Happiness Report.</p>
        
            <p>The annual report, conducted in partnership with the United Nations, Gallup World Polls and the Oxford Well-being Research Centre, features experts using responses from people in more than 140 nations to rank the world's "happiest" countries.</p>
        
            <p>This year Australia has climbed up two spots to number 10, which was held by New Zealand last year.</p>
        
            <p>Finland is ranked number one for the seventh year in a row.</p>
        
            <p>When compiling the report, researchers take into account factors such as life expectancy, GDP, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruptions.</p>
        
            <p>So how are these countries fairing and how much happier is Australia than its neighbours across the ditch?</p>
        
            <p>Auckland-based economist Shamubeel Eaqub says the state of the economy in New Zealand could play a part in New Zealand's drop in ranking.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is in its second recession in 18 months after Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell to 0.1 percent in the December 2023 quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"Perception is right that it [New Zealand] is less prosperous. For example, GPD per capita is 30 percent lower [than in Australia]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But [in New Zealand], welfare provisions are more generous and there is perceived lower corruption."</p>
        
            <p>When rankings are broken into two age groups, both countries rank much lower for young people.</p>
        
            <p>For under thirties, Australia drops down to 19 and New Zealand is ranked 27.</p>
        
            <p>Over sixties are better off in both countries.</p>
        
            <p>Well-being is actually higher for over sixties in New Zealand at number 6, outranking Australia at number 9.</p>
        
            <p>Eaqub believes both countries' young people face similar economic challenges, making them less satisfied during the past decade.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that two key issues are front of mind for young people: housing and climate change" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea of progression - that is each generation being better off than the last, is increasingly seen as a false promise.</p>
        
            <p>"On some measures that is true: expected lifetime income from work was highest for those born before 1985 - up to which time each cohort was better off on average than the previous, but this is no longer true."</p>

            <p>He is surprised the gap between the countries isn't greater.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia is a much larger and richer country, but both countries face similar issues for young people, especially around housing, climate change and an uncertain life trajectory compared to previous generations."</p>
        
            <p>Associate professor Chris Wright is an expert Work and Organisational Studies at the University of Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>He said quality of working life plays a major role in how people measure their overall happiness.</p>
        
            <p>"I look at Nordic countries and see that happiness is so high. There is a high working-life quality because wages are fairer and more aligned with living costs, there's more flexibility," he said.</p>
        
            <p>
Workload, mental health, economic pressures and climate worries are among the issues young New Zealanders report weigh on them.

            <p>"To give the Aussie government credit, over the past 18 months a series of changes have been made to provide better security for people at work, providing people to with mechanisms to get better wages.</p>
        
            <p>"But New Zealand did put in laws to support people at work and before that came into effect a new government came in and took those laws away."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was room for improvement in both nations.</p>
        
            <p>"While Australia is doing better than New Zealand, both countries have to lift their game."</p>
        
            <p>Life expectancy, social bonds, personal freedom and corruption all influence respondents' self assessments of happiness too.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Tim Sharp is a psychologist and founder of Australia's Happiness Institute.</p>

            <p>"It's important to state they're not talking about happiness in the way we do on a day-to-day basis," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What these surveys are really measuring is a much broader and bigger and higher construct, which is things like access to education, transport, healthcare and freedom, security and safety."</p>
        
            <p>Happiness is subjective, he warned, but he believes both counties are doing quite well.</p>
        
            <p>"No one would dispute the fact Australia isn't perfect, but taking [that] into account it's pretty bloody good and most people realise that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people are doing it very hard, but we're talking about big, global, high level comparisons - we're a lot better off."</p>
        
            <p>He said while Australia might sit above New Zealand for happiness, the margin is quite small.</p>
        
            <p>"Ten and 11 is a difference - I would suggest is meaningless," he said.</p>
