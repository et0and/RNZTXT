            <p>The perception of time going faster seems to be a large part of what happens when a person gets older, an expert says.</p>
        
            <p>Today, 2 July, means we are officially half-way through 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But as we get older, Earth does not orbit the sun any faster - it is a phenomenon that takes place in our brains.</p>
        
            <p>Professor of Psychology at the Michigan Neuroscience Institute Cindy Lustig, a world expert in the brain's relationship with time, told RNZ's Afternoons she was half-way through her summer - and she knew time was only going to appear to go faster as the new school year approached.</p>
        
            <p>The "fascinating" thing about time was that it was a person's perception - and "really dependent" on experience and attention.</p>
        
            <p>Something that played a big role in this as a person got older was life circumstances changing as getting into more of a routine, Lustig said.</p>
        
            <p>She said a lot of people went through extremes during the Covid-19 when there was "Blursday", for example.</p>
        
            <p>While one year was considered a large part of a 5-year-old's life, making up 20 percent of it, it was only a small part of a 50-year-old's.</p>
        
            <p>But Lustig's advice?</p>
        
            <p>"Be as fully present as you can in the moment and make the most of the moments you have."</p>
