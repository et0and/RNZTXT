        <h2>A rare All Black political statement</h2>
        <p>
Analysis - There's plenty to talk about including TJ Perenara's statement during the haka, Jamie Wall writes.

            <p>Analysis - We can all probably agree that the less said about the All Blacks' turgid 29-11 win over Italy in Turin, the better. It is worth bringing up the value of even playing these fixtures at all, the last time these sides met in a match on Italian soil that can be described as interesting was when Jonah Lomu was playing, so hopefully next year the All Blacks are a bit more selective with their fixture list.</p>
        
            <p>The only other thing worth mentioning is the very rare All Black political statement made by TJ Perenara during the haka, this was always on the cards due to it being his last test. It was bookended by a number of his teammates posing for photos with a Tino Rangatiratanga flag post-match, which really did hammer home just how far reaching the recent events at home have been.</p>
        
            <p>Looking back at this tour the All Blacks end with four wins, one very close loss. If you'd offered that return before the end of year tour started, it would've certainly been accepted by most, but does this then make the last month acceptable?</p>

            <p>Well, maybe. It's important to consider that in the grand scheme of things, end of year tour tests are the least important of the year from an All Black point of view. There are no serious trophies on the line, everything is being done for the home sides' benefit in terms of scheduling, and we have to put up with annually tedious takes on the haka.</p>
        
            <p>Even still, there was plenty to take away from the tour.</p>

            <p>If Scott Robertson has learned anything this year, it's how fine the margins in test match rugby are. The win over England came down to a penalty goal that hit the post, the loss against France a knock on in the 77th minute.</p>

            <p>Despite being hyped to the moon, Wallace Sititi got even better in the last month, capping off his massive season by being nominated for World Rugby's breakthrough player of the year. Cam Roigard has returned from a potentially catastrophic knee injury somehow even better than before, outplaying Antoine Dupont in Paris and solidifying his case as starting halfback from now on.</p>
        
            <p>Something that's hamstrung the All Blacks in recent years, this season become their strength, with penalty counts in their favour in all of the tests. The scrum has been a massive part of that, winning important calls and field position at crucial times. There were only two yellow cards in the major tests, one each to Anton Lienert-Brown and Jordie Barrett, which were managed through by the remaining All Blacks in the wins over England and France. It was spoiled somewhat by a couple more in the Italy game, but it's not like they made any difference.</p>
        
            <p>This, more than anything, is the reason the All Blacks are coming home with a winning record - but also the reason it's not a flawless one.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie booted a sideline conversion to win at Twickenham and then nailed six penalties at the Aviva in Dublin, which was an excellent answer to the critique he's received this season. However, being instructed to knock over a couple of much easier shots in Paris didn't work out as well - while they pulled the All Blacks within one point of the lead, the decision sent the ball back into their own territory.</p>

            <p>As well as those already mentioned, Caleb Clarke now finds himself in the best form of his career and Mark Tele'a's return to form came at the absolute best possible time (although his injury was at the worst, as he missed the French test). Tamaiti Williams very much took the opportunity handed to him, while decision-making in Paris aside, Scott Barrett played his best rugby since taking over as captain. Peter Lakai showed that he's more than ready to step up to test rugby on a regular basis next season.</p>

            <p>Williams' gain came at the expense of Ethan de Groot, who must now be deeply regretting whatever it was that got him dropped. Cortez Ratima spent most of his time on the field trying to avoid the harassment of offside Irish and predatory French players, Samipeni Finau was set for a huge chance to prove that he can cut it at test level but was knocked out after only three minutes in Paris. In the same test Sevu Reece managed to get burned easily by his French opposite Louis Bielle-Biarrey for a crucial try, despite having a 10 metre head start.</p>

            <p>Rieko Ioane's much-anticipated time in Dublin didn't disappoint. He was dramatically revealed as the newest kaea of the All Black haka, and then put in an excellent defensive display in the 23-13 win. After some fiery build-up due to his online feud with Johnny Sexton positioning him front and centre on match day sent a strong message that the team was supporting not only Ioane's ideals, but the notion that they indeed have personalities outside of what is moulded by training and playing rugby.</p>
        
            <p>The openness of the players to show support for the Toitū Te Tiriti movement, both on social media and after the last game, is a serious sign that times are changing with the way All Blacks express themselves. NZ Rugby will know full well the genie probably can't get put back in the bottle in regard to this, however, it can be embraced while still holding true to the All Blacks' core values.</p>
