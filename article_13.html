        <h2>How a search for the perfect saddle led Sophia around the world</h2>
        <p>
Sophia Stratford is learning to make saddles through one of London's Worshipful Companies, and she's given up a lot to get there.

Sophia Stratford's quest to build a better saddle for the horse she loves has led her abroad to the UK, where she is training to become a saddler at Capel Manor College in England.

            <p>Riding a "funny shaped" horse as a teen has led a young Kiwi woman to the other side of the world to learn the ancient craft of saddlery.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-year-old Sophia Stratford is into her second year on a course steeped in history after raising funds including selling her beloved horse.</p>
        
            <p>The idea to study saddle-making struck her during the hours and hours she spent training and caring for Digger.</p>
        
            <p>"I found it really difficult to get a saddle for him and get it fitted, and one that fitted both of us and I just thought it would be so much easier if I could do it myself."</p>
        
            <p>But, aged 14 at the time, she felt learning to make saddles was an "unrealistic" dream, given the dearth of courses in New Zealand and the cost of studying abroad.</p>
        
            <p>Later, urged to investigate by her parents, she discovered a diploma in the craft, overseen by London's City and Guilds Institute and the grandly-named Worshipful Company of Cordwainers which dates back to 1272.</p>
        
            <p>Sophia's classrooms are at Capel Manor College in London where she spends hours surrounded by leather, cutting and hand-stitching and learning how to make the bridle bits and other metal fittings needed in the equestrian world.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really expensive. It is really hard. Then [I'm] so far away from all my friends and family and I did have to sell my horse to come here, which was really hard to come to terms with."</p>
        
            <p>Learning such a traditional craft as part of a centuries-old training scheme is quite special though, she told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be pretty surreal at times, because, you know, it's so old.</p>
        
            <p>"The Saddlers' Hall, for example, it is all very posh, and it's not necessarily similar at all to the horse world that we might be used to in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Horses come in many shapes and sizes, with only two weight-bearing muscles in their back, Sophia explained. Having the right saddle is important.</p>
        
            <p>"You get these pressure points that are only exacerbated by the weight of the rider, and it hurts. Yes, it's completely an animal welfare issue."</p>

            <p>With a swag of awards under her belt after her first year, including Best Overall Student from the Worshipful Company of Loriners, Sophia feels "reasonably confident" to call herself a saddler.</p>
        
            <p>"Not a very good one, but, you know, I can make saddles. I've made bridles, I've made saddles, I've made harnesses."</p>
        
            <p>She plans to return home for the four years' experience needed to be fully qualified.</p>
        
            <p>And what about being able to make that saddle for her beloved horse now?</p>
        
            <p>"Probably not as pretty as I would have liked it to be, but functional? Yeah, I think so!"</p>
