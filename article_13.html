            <p>There's some fear in the air in Tauranga as the country's fifth-largest city gets ready to vote in the council election on July 20.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City councillors were replaced with commissioners in 2020 after a tumultuous year. Now it's almost time for a mayor and councillors to return. </p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of apprehension out there from all circles that I've encountered, there's a bit of unease as to who's going to be elected," Bay of Plenty Times senior journalist Kiri Gillespie tells The Detail.</p>
        
            <p>"They're really concerned that history will repeat itself and we'll return to the same dysfunction as we had before the commissioners - we've got six of the former council running again."</p>
        
            <p>This comes after resident surveys show increased satisfaction with the council over the commissioners' term.</p>

            <p>"To be completely fair, most of the people I've encountered through all sorts of means, whether I'm going out on a job and I'm interviewing somebody my own social circles or things like that - the general consensus is that they're pleased with what the commissioners have done," Gillespie says.</p>
        
            <p>Many people have thrown their hats in the ring for a place at the council table - 85 candidates are vying for 10 seats, including 15 going for the mayoralty. These include Olympic gold-medal winning rower Mahé Drysdale and singer-songwriter Ria Hall. There are a few familiar faces with their hands up too, including a former mayor and former councillors. </p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately it's up to the voters, they all know who was there before and who the fresh faces are," Gillespie says.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's that fine balance of wanting to elect a council with experience and know-how but also fresh blood where you won't necessarily get the dysfunction that we had before, so it's a real unknown."</p>
        
            <p>The commissioners, led by former National MP Anne Tolley, wrote to Local Government minister Simeon Brown late last year, suggesting a new hybrid council model would be best for the city.</p>
        
            <p>This would consist of six elected councillors and four commissioners, with a commissioner as chair. But the idea was rejected.</p>
        
            <p>The Detail talks to Local Government New Zealand president and Selwyn district mayor Sam Broughton about whether this is a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>"Councils currently have hybrid models within them," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Audit and risk committees have appointed members sitting alongside elected members to bring in the right expertise. It's not something that's unfamiliar with local councils - but having the governing body having appointed members, that's quite another step and is something that I think the government and New Zealanders should be involved in," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Moving back to what we would expect for our country I think is the right thing to do at the moment, whether there's a future discussion about having mixed models of leadership or other models - that might be a future discussion - but that's not for Tauranga right now." </p>
        
            <p>This election won't put Tauranga forever out of step with local body elections in the rest of the country, as the council elected this month will serve a slightly longer term rather than facing re-election next year. </p>
