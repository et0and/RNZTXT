            <p>A fresh perspective? Or a frightening lack of experience? A mentor and her mentee talk about what they brought to politics at the age of 23. </p>

            <p>All around the world, newly elected politicians are pushing against the idea that wisdom only comes with age. </p>
        
            <p>In France, the country's youngest ever president has appointed its youngest ever prime minister. </p>
        
            <p>Add up their ages and they are still younger than the current US president, 81-year-old Joe Biden.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand now has its youngest MP in 170 years and its youngest ever female MP - Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke - at 21. </p>
        
            <p>New Green MP Tamatha Paul is 27 and National brought in Tom Rutherford, 26 on election day. </p>
        
            <p>Chlöe Swarbrick entered parliament at 23 - and is now 29, having last year won the Auckland Central electorate for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>Today The Detail speaks to her, and to a trailblazing MP who entered the House, also aged 23, in 1975 - Dame Marilyn Waring. </p>
        
            <p>They are the seventh- and eighth-youngest MPs in New Zealand history.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Marilyn says she didn't really want to be an MP, but 1975 was International Women's Year.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it would be a little feminist activity ... really I just threw my hat in," she says. </p>
        
            <p>"It's a house of representatives, my age group just weren't represented at all." </p>
        
            <p>The new National MP, elected in the safe seat of Raglan, got the odd bit of pushback, with people frequently telling her she needed more life experience.</p>
        
            <p>"I just as frequently responded that it was a house of representatives, and it might be nice to hear from other people occasionally." </p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick was the youngest MP since Dame Marilyn - just two months older when she hit Parliament in 2017.</p>

            <p>She had run for Auckland mayor at 22 and surprised everyone with the strength of her campaign. </p>
        
            <p>When it comes to pushback, Swarbrick says she "reflects on this pretty frequently".</p>
        
            <p>"It's no secret that I am regularly like 'what am I doing in politics?' and 'am I the right person to do this?'</p>
        
            <p>But she believes young people have an important voice.</p>
        
            <p>"All human beings have different perspectives and lives and lived experiences - things we've been exposed to and not been exposed to.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the inherent value of younger perspectives - as with middle aged and older perspectives - is that there is a different world view or a different type of experience that one has been exposed to.</p>
        
            <p>"This was the really interesting argument that came up time and again - particularly in that 2016 local body election - so I became pretty versed in it - most egregiously represented by this one woman who decided to troll me quite substantively throughout the campaign telling me that my brain wasn't fully developed until I was 25.</p>
        
            <p>"I still had access to the university library at that point in time and did some research and found, sure - your brain isn't fully developed 'til you're 25 but it starts actually degenerating from around 45 years old - the average age in Parliament at that point in time was 51, so as far as I was concerned, I was on the up.  </p>
        
            <p>"Life experience is not necessarily equivalent to wisdom. More days on earth does not necessarily immediately equate to more mystical ju-ju that makes you more or less capable of making decisions." </p>
        
            <p>Dame Marilyn says coming into Parliament at her age was "another world". </p>
        
            <p>"It was and still is a very rugged and combative place to work. It was incredibly inhospitable for families and relationships.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the same time always, sitting there right at the front of my mind was: 'you cannot fail, you cannot give up, if you fail or give up it will crucify any young women candidates for decades'." </p>
        
            <p>"One of the things I actually really loved about being young was not being 65 and having made up my mind about everything there is to know in life - that I was really open - I was open to new knowledge. Having a constituency was a far better tertiary education than I ever received anywhere else I ever studied."  </p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick gets mentoring advice from Dame Marilyn.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the pieces of advice Marilyn gave me when I was first coming in, she said something along the lines of 'just write something down, whether it's a letter to yourself' and for me it was my maiden speech, so that when you feel uncertain in that environment and institution that is not made for you  - that you have a kaupapa document or an intention document to go back to."</p>
