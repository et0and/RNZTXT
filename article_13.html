            <p>His career took him to the biggest heights in boxing, but now David Tua is swapping the spotlight for a subdued and simple island life.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa "is calling" the former heavyweight, who wants to spend the next chapter of his life cracking coconuts instead of jaws.</p>
        
            <p>Having moved to Auckland as a ten-year-old, Tua said it's time to go home, and will relocate to Samoa in November.</p>
        
            <p>With both he and his wife's parents now passed on, Tua said he floated the idea to his wife while visiting.</p>
        
            <p>"Me and my my beautiful wife, were in Samoa about three months ago, straight after her father passed, so we decided to take a week before she went back to work. And while I was enjoying the scenery, sun, and my training, I asked her, 'hey darling, would you like to move to Samoa to live?"'</p>
        
            <p>With his wife gleefully jumping at the idea, the couple made the call.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been the breadwinners for our families so respectfully, I believe it's time for us to do something for ourselves, but I believe it's more than that, I believe Samoa is calling. Three more weeks and we move. I can't wait. It's three weeks too long,"</p>
        
            <p>So will Tua be seeking out the next Samoan boxing superstar?</p>
        
            <p>"That's the last thing on my mind. I think for me, the simple things of life, training in the morning, maybe a cup of coffee, and then sleep."</p>
        
            <p>Once ranked as high as third in the world heavyweight rankings, the 'Tuaminator's' daily life is set to be a far cry from the whirlwind world of pro boxing.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe I'll look after some pigs and chickens, maybe grow some Kalo. That's the sort of life that I'm looking for, just scaling right back and keeping things simple."</p>
        
            <p>Before departing, Tua will be recognised for his contributions to boxing as the inaugural inductee into the Auckland Boxing Association's Hall of Fame.</p>
        
            <p>The ceremony will take place at ABA on Saturday evening alongside an amateur boxing showcase.</p>
        
            <p>Tua said he was honoured by the accolade.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess I can only hope that I've left the game better than when I first started."</p>
