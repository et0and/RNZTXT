        <h2>First peek inside Auckland's colossal Asian supermarket</h2>
        <p>
Roads leading to the Westgate emporium crawled to a halt as thousands turned out on the store's opening day.
</p>
        
            <p>Thousands descended on the opening of what has been described as New Zealand's largest Asian supermarket in Auckland on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Roads leading to Foodie in Westgate were clogged with visitors ahead of the 8:30am opening, with few car parks left in the more than 200 parking spaces.</p>
        
            <p>Queues at the checkout were equally chaotic, with one customer telling RNZ they had waited in line for more than an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Located near wholesale supermarket Costco, Foodie boasts an indoor floor space that spans 3800 square metres, managing director Tao Shi said.</p>
        
            <p>Shi said the store's size placed it among mainstream supermarkets in New Zealand, suggesting it would be the country's largest Asian outlet.</p>

            <p>Despite opening on a weekday, a seemingly endless stream of customers visited the store on Thursday to get a taste of what was on offer.</p>
        
            <p>Greenhithe resident Joy Zhu was pleased with the one-stop shopping experience Foodie provided.</p>
        
            <p>"It has all the food I need, so I don't have to visit other supermarkets," Zhu said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a butcher, a seafood store and a roast vendor. It's truly one-stop shopping."</p>
        
            <p>Living nearby, Zhu planned to visit the supermarket regularly.</p>

            <p>Zhuoqun Zhao praised the supermarket's cleanliness, adding that clear signage made it easier to find products.</p>
        
            <p>He made the most of the "opening specials", picking up 30 eggs for $9.99.</p>
        
            <p>"Other supermarkets sell the same number for more than $10," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Vegetables are also particularly cheap, so I bought a lot of them."</p>
        
            <p>His main concern was overcrowding, which ultimately resulted in an uncomfortable shopping experience.</p>

            <p>Zaixun Deng expressed similar concerns, saying it had been impossible to find a parking space Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Shi believed more than 3500 visitors would visit the store on Thursday, with significantly more expected over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Foodie joins a long list of supermarkets catering to New Zealand's Asian communities.</p>
        
            <p>Established operators such as Lim Chhour, Da Hua, Tai Ping and Golden Apple sell Asian food and household items in various parts of the country, particularly Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>These markets have become more than simple shopping destinations, turning into essential hubs where immigrants connect with one another and maintain ties to their cultural roots.</p>

            <p>Shi said Foodie would not aim to compete directly with other Asian supermarkets, adding it offered a unique shopping experience that allowed customers the opportunity to purchase daily essentials at one location instead of visiting multiple stores.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, I have to go to a Korean supermarket for barbecue ingredients and a Chinese supermarket for vegetables," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some stores don't carry everything, so I end up going to New World or Pak'n Save for milk, bread and other essentials.</p>
        
            <p>"I might need to visit four or five different stores to get everything. This is the current shopping experience for customers."</p>

            <p>Shi hoped Foodie could meet the grocery shopping needs of Auckland's diverse ethnic groups - as well as offering takeaway shops, bakeries and milk tea stands.</p>
        
            <p>"We currently offer a wide range of foods from China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore and other Asian countries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of products has surpassed 12,000."</p>

            <p>Foodie planned to expand by opening additional supermarkets on Auckland's North Shore and in East Auckland.</p>
