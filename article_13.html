            <p>The Phoenix Foundation are celebrating 20 years since the release of their first album 'Horse Power' with a nationwide tour.</p>
        
            <p>They will tour New Zealand this month, performing their album in its glorious entirety for the first time ever.</p>
        
            <p>To coincide, the album will also be released on vinyl - another first for The Phoenix Foundation.  </p>
        
            <p>The Phoenix Foundation performed four songs - 'Sister Risk'; 'This Charming Van'; 'Going Fishing' and 'Celebrate' - live on Music 101.</p>

            <p>Sam Flynn Scott told Music 101 that the album was influenced by an array of New Zealand's more underground musicians, like rock band Bress Creeting Cake.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone had to tell you about them. They weren't in the newspaper or on Juice TV or whatever. You had to kind of seek these things out," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"In New Zealand, it was things like Cassette, which I remember Sam and I going to see them and just feeling like, 'woah this band is not doing a macho-ey rock thing at all'," said fellow band member Luke Buda.</p>
        
            <p>"Because, before then, I pretty much remember seeing Head Like a Hole and Shihad and that was sort of the vibe... But then Cassette came out and they were playing this really mellow, heartbroken, I guess what you call alt-country."</p>
        
            <p>Buda said at the time Horse Power was first released, there was no one else in Wellington making that sort of music.</p>
        
            <p>"It was rock, dub or drum and bass," says Sam.</p>
        
            <p>Sam says he even worked in the "cool cafe" Fidels, where Luke says Sam was teased for playing guitar by the DJs there.</p>
        
            <p>"Things were more genre-defined at that point. People had their cliques of what they thought music should be."</p>
        
            <p>Over the years, The Phoenix Foundation have performed some songs from the album, but they have never played the album in its entirety, yet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a trip, going back," says Sam.</p>
