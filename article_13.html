            <p>New Zealand Football believes the country could sustain three professional clubs competing in the A-League.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland has been granted a licence to enter the competition next year with the club to be backed by American billionaire Bill Foley.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland side will join the Wellington Phoenix in the league and New Zealand Football chief executive Andrew Pragnell said the country can support numerous clubs.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually think we've got enough players for three clubs," Pragnell told RNZ's Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland is one of the largest cities in the world without a professional football club," he said.</p>

            <p>"We know we're producing the talent but it's often bypassing parts of Auckland and going straight into Australia or onwards.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely there is the talent and I think there is scope for a professional South Island team as well in due course."</p>
        
            <p>Pragnell said the competition between the Phoenix and the new Auckland club will drive improved performance from both sides.</p>
        
            <p>It's been 17 years since Auckland had a side in the Australian League, with the Football Kingz from 1999-2004 and the New Zealand Knights 2004-2007.</p>
        
            <p>Bill Foley is a sports fanatic.</p>
        
            <p>He owns Bournemouth in the EPL and in 2017 started the Las Vegas Black Knights, who won the Stanley Cup last year.</p>
        
            <p>Pragnell believes Foley's involvement gives the new club security.</p>
        
            <p>"Bill obviously has extreme wealth, but he also has experience in building teams.</p>
        
            <p>"He is a multi-club owner and has produced a title winning team in the NHL (National Hockey League).</p>
        
            <p>"He's already begun recruiting management and he's here to stay."</p>
