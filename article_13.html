            <p>The closure of the City Gallery building won't stop it from bringing art to the capital, its boss says.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Diana March is the chief executive of Experience Wellington, which oversees the gallery along with five other Wellington museums and cultural institutions.</p>
        
            <p>She told Culture 101 host Mark Amery that City Gallery would continue to present and celebrate art in Pōneke while it was closed for two years from 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>So far, two offsite exhibitions had been announced, which were due to be shown over the remainder of 2024. </p>

            <p>Generation X: 50 Artworks from the Chartwell Collection would be hosted by Te Papa from 27 July to 20 October.</p>
        
            <p>Derek Jarman: Delphinium Days, by United Kingdom artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman, would be held at The Dowse from 28 September to 26 January.</p>
        
            <p>"Our arts whānau have been amazing in supporting us," March said.</p>
        
            <p>"Wellington is really vibrant in terms of the way people support each other and work with each other, and there's lots happening."</p>

            <p>March said Experience Wellington was exploring its options for housing other exhibitions, both inside and outside galleries.</p>
        
            <p>However, its finances were stretched, meaning there would be limits to what it could achieve.</p>
        
            <p>The closure will coincide with the closing of the main accessway to Te Ngākau Civic Square until February 2025, while demolition work is completed on a former civic administration building. </p>
        
            <p>March said a crane would be operating in the square as part of that work, hampering access to the gallery, and there were questions around the possible impact of the demolition.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know what the works would have done to the paintings."</p>
        
            <p>Drill testing in the vicinity had been "impossibly noisy", she said, leaving the gallery with no option but to close.</p>
        
            <p>Following the demolition, the gallery will remain shut for a further year while it undergoes overdue refitting and alterations, mainly to the lift.</p>
        
            <p>"That lift is crucial because it brings in the art."</p>
        
            <p>The building will reopen mid-2026, after Te Matapihi, the new city library, opens.</p>
        
            <p>However, questions remain on the impact of a potential replacement of the city-to-sea bridge and continued work on the town hall as a national music centre, due to reopen 2027. </p>
