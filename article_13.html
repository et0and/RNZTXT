            <p>Japan has - for the first time - issued a warning about an increased risk of a "major earthquake" striking in the near future.</p>
        
            <p>The advisory was issued on Thursday night local time, telling people to be alert but not to evacuate. It also stressed that the warning did not mean a large earthquake was imminent, but that the probability was higher than usual.</p>
        
            <p>It came hours after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred off the southern island of Kyushu, which reportedly caused no major damage.</p>
        
            <p>But experts were put on heightened alert because of where the epicentre sat - at the edge of the Nankai Trough, an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast.</p>
        
            <p>The plate boundary sits between Suruga Bay in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the south.</p>
        
            <p>Previous Nankai Trough earthquakes have left thousands dead. These megaquakes have been recorded once every 90 to 200 years, with the last one occurring in 1946.</p>
        
            <p>Experts say there is a 70 percent to 80 percent chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake striking somewhere along the trough in the next 30 years, according to the Kyodo News agency. Worst-case estimates suggest more than 200,000 people could be killed in the earthquake and potential subsequent tsunami.</p>
        
            <p>However, at a press conference on Thursday, Japanese Meteorological Agency official Shinya Tsukada emphasised that while "there is a relatively higher chance of another major earthquake compared to normal times" they were not saying it would definitely happen "in a certain period of time".</p>
        
            <p>This current advisory - the lower of two types of alerts at officials' disposal - will be in place for a week.</p>
        
            <p>It asks residents to be on higher alert in the coming days, and for those who cannot evacuate quickly to consider doing so voluntarily, according to Japan's NHK broadcaster.</p>
        
            <p>Officials have also told people be cautious but carry on with their everyday lives, while checking evacuation routes where needed and that households have enough supplies.</p>
