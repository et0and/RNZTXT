            <p>You could describe Iwen Yong as an accidental artist. </p>
        
            <p>Malaysian-born, he moved to New Zealand with his family at the age of six. First settling in Wellington, they moved to the Hutt Valley where he attended primary and high school. </p>
        
            <p>When Yong was a teenager, his father was diagnosed with cancer. Speaking to Culture 101's Perlina Lau, Yong says it was a tough time for the family as a single-income household. Along with being a traditional Asian family, Iwen and his siblings knew there was an expectation to finish school, and graduate from university with degrees that would lead to stable jobs and income. </p>
        
            <p>“No one in my family, not even my relatives in Malaysia had any creative backgrounds,” says Yong. </p>
        
            <p>He studied commercial law and accounting at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University and admits he wasn’t particularly passionate about it, but knew he had to do something that would ensure a solid career.</p>
        
            <p>“Art was never a discussion as a career.”</p>
        
            <p>In fact, Yong didn’t grow up surrounded by any art: “we didn’t have paintings or anything on our walls - certainly not Western art.” </p>

            <p>He first became interested in drawings while looking at an old encyclopedia and seeing the images of birds and animals. But the first real turning point happened during his time working in accounting. While waiting for a meeting, Yong doodled a picture of his dog Gus on the whiteboard. A colleague and artist spotted the drawing and offered Yong her student-grade oil paints, telling him to buy brushes and canvases from art shop Gordon Harris. </p>
        
            <p>“That was the first time I was introduced to oil painting. At the time I was so ignorant, I didn’t even know what a canvas was.”</p>
        
            <p>Initially he painted landscapes he found in magazines or books but it was a hobby. He’d paint once every two months.</p>
        
            <p>A trip to Glenorchy in 2016 with his mum was a second turning point. Driving back to Queenstown, he spied a sign for ‘John Crump Gallery’. They went in, met the artist and it was then Yong realised Crump’s style of painting was exactly what he was interested in. He left that gallery with an invitation to accompany Crump on an outdoor painting excursion.</p>
        
            <p>Three months later, Yong packed his suitcase with his paints and easel and travelled to Glenorchy to paint with Crump for 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>“It was life changing. I describe it to my friends as getting bitten by the art bug. New Zealand is so diverse. If you travel to any part, there is a painting waiting to be painted. Every five minutes down south, you could paint the landscape.”</p>

            <p>But it wasn’t without its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>“It was really hard. I was still learning the fundamentals of painting; how to draw, how to mix the colours, how to apply the paint. Then you’re also dealing with changing light.”</p>
        
            <p>With the sun moving constantly, so too the shadows, landscapes and the light passages.</p>
        
            <p>“You have to work pretty fast or have a very good memory.”</p>
        
            <p>And then there were the insects.</p>
        
            <p>“If you’ve ever been to Paradise Valley or Rees Valley, you’ll know how bad the sandflies are. On my first trip, I nearly gave up.”</p>

            <p>It sounds like a painting boot camp.</p>
        
            <p>“You’re thrown in the deep end. Painting outdoors is one of the most difficult things. It was like - set up, start painting and I'll teach you. Good luck with the insects.”</p>
        
            <p>Yong realises the amazing opportunity he had, and says Crump was incredibly encouraging.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2016 and 2020, the two artists continued to paint together and Yong developed his skills. </p>

            <p>In 2020, Yong started contracting in his accounting work, which gave him half of the year to focus on his art. He moved from Wellington to Wairarapa, where he joined the ConArt group, where fellow artists suggested he showcase his paintings.</p>
        
            <p>“When you’re putting your paintings out there, you’re really putting yourself out there,” says Yong, expressing his fear of rejection at the time.</p>

            <p>He presented his work at a local community gallery and sold 22 paintings that month. </p>
        
            <p>“It was this lightbulb moment where I thought - oh, maybe I could do this as a job?”</p>
        
            <p>Yong has since sold hundreds of paintings. </p>
        
            <p>But for Yong, the decision to transition to become an artist full time was about happiness.</p>
        
            <p>“I just wanted to do something with my life that was more fulfilling. I think you should do a job you’re passionate about and enjoy. I’m just really privileged to be in this position to do this.”</p>
