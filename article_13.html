            <p>Inflation has held steady at a near four-year low, backing the prospect of a further hefty interest rate cut next month.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said the consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in the three months ended December, leaving the annual rate steady at 2.2 percent, the lowest since March 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest contributors to the quarterly result were higher rents, second hand cars, airfares, and accommodation, which offset cheaper fuel and food.</p>
        
            <p>"Prices are still rising, but not as much as previously recorded," senior manager of prices Nicola Growden said.</p>
        
            <p>For the final three months of the year international airfares rose 6.6 percent, and domestic fares rose 9.3 percent, to be the biggest single contributors to the overall CPI increase.</p>
        
            <p>However, there were also significant rises in second hand car prices (4.7 percent), games and toys (8.7 percent), and rents (0.8 percent).</p>
        
            <p>The main offsets were an 11.5 percent fall in vegetables, smaller falls for nuts and confectionary, petrol and diesel.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic prices - non-tradables - remained the backbone of inflation, rising 0.7 percent for the quarter, and 4.5 percent for the year, on the back of rising rates and rents.</p>
        
            <p>Local authority rates rose 12.2 percent on a year ago, rents were up 4.2 percent, and tobacco taxes up 7.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Annual rent inflation continues to rise at a consistent rate," Growden said.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, the price of imported goods and services - tradables - rose 0.3 percent for the quarter but were down 1.1 percent for the year.</p>
        
            <p>Falling petrol prices - down 9.2 percent for the year - and a near 15 percent drop in imported vegetable prices were the key influences.</p>
        
            <p>Growden said cheaper petrol had been keeping a lid on inflation over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"If petrol was excluded, the CPI would have increased 2.7 percent in the 12 months to December."</p>
        
            <p>The inflation numbers were in line with economists' expectations and the Reserve Bank's (RBNZ) November forecasts, and support the prospect of a 50 basis point cut in the official cash rate cut next month, as signalled by the central bank.</p>
