        <h2>What to do - and what not to do - in a power cut</h2>
        <p>
The East Coast, Northland and Coromandel have all been plunged into darkness recently. Here's what to do if it happens to you.

            <p>The torrential rain and flooding on the East Coast have cut power to thousands of homes this week.</p>
        
            <p>It came shortly after a fallen pylon plunged all of Northland into darkness and a storm knocked out the electricity to the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>With severe weather events increasing, power cuts could become more and more common.</p>
        
            <p>Here's how to stay safe, keep warm and protect your home and belongings when the power goes out.</p>
        
            <p>It's quite common for power cuts to last only a few minutes, so you may want to wait a while before making the call.</p>
        
            <p>However, if you're concerned about the length of the outage, give your lines company a ring.</p>
        
            <p>You can also check the supplier's website and social media to see if the outage was planned, or if there's an update on when power will be restored.</p>
        
            <p>Your wifi and cordless landline phone will likely be affected in a power cut, so it's best to use your mobile phone for this.</p>
        
            <p>If a power outage is putting your health at risk, call 111 or go to a hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In a power outage, the best torch is the one you have to hand.</p>
        
            <p>For many, this will mean your phone torch - but try not to use this long-term, as it will drain your battery, meaning you may not be able to call for help if you need it.</p>
        
            <p>It's a good idea to have an emergency kit to hand, containing a torch and spare batteries, among other items.</p>
        
            <p>Torches and battery-powered lanterns are safer to use in a power cut than candles.</p>

            <p>Vector advises that water pumps in rural areas may not work in a power cut - so you should make sure you have emergency water supplies for drinking and washing.</p>
        
            <p>A spare battery or mobile power pack for your phone, a camp stove or barbecue, and cooking fuel (such as gas) are also helpful items to have in the event of an extended power cut.</p>
        
            <p>Have a quick look around your house and move any items that could be easily tripped on, such as children's toys, from corridors, doorways and high-traffic areas.</p>
        
            <p>This will lessen the chances of you injuring yourself in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>Powershop recommends placing a camping lamp at the edge of the room by the wall to light your path, and says it's especially important that access to the bathroom and the emergency cupboard are clear.</p>
        
            <p>Power can surge when it's restored, possibly damaging sensitive electronics.</p>
        
            <p>Turn your TV, computer and stereo off at the wall or make sure you have surge protectors installed.</p>
        
            <p>Vector recommends turning off your stove elements and heaters, too - this will ensure they don't come back on without you noticing the electricity has been restored.</p>
        
            <p>The Electricity Authority recommends leaving an overhead light on so you can see when the power is back on.</p>

Food should stay cool in the fridge for several hours, but only if it's left unopened.

            <p>Opening the fridge or freezer will let warmer air in - and without electricity, it won't be able to cool down again.</p>
        
            <p>If left shut, the fridge will keep food cool for up to six hours, while a freezer will usually keep food frozen for up to 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>If there's food inside that you know you'll need in the short-term, consider removing it at the start of the power cut and storing it in a chilly bin or ice box. That way your snacking won't spoil the rest of your supplies.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries recommends eating food that will expire quickly, such as bread and meat, first, and eating canned food last.</p>
        
            <p>If any food is spoiled or rotting, throw it away so it doesn't spoil other food.</p>
        
            <p>If it's a cold day or night, you can keep warm by closing your doors and windows and pulling the curtains.</p>
        
            <p>Water can be boiled on a camp stove to fill hot water bottles. Remember never to operate a camp stove inside.</p>
        
            <p>Gel warming packs are also good items to have in your emergency kit, as they can keep chilled fingers and toes toasty.</p>
        
            <p>
An emergency kit should contain food, water and medical supplies for three days, as well as a torch and radio.

            <p>If it's safe to go outside, check on your neighbours. This is especially important if you have older or vulnerable people living around you.</p>
        
            <p>If it's not safe to go out, give them a call or a text.</p>
        
            <p>The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) advises that in times of crisis or civil defence emergency, a battery-powered radio or a car radio remain essential lifelines if power is out and other forms of communication are unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ is New Zealand's statutory civil defence lifeline radio broadcaster, providing vital information and updates as they come to hand. All frequencies can be found here.</p>
