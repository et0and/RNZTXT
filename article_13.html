            <p>The government's draft emissions reduction plan - out this week - puts New Zealand's ability to meet its climate targets in jeopardy. </p>
        
            <p>That was the key takeaway for RNZ's climate change correspondent Eloise Gibson, who pored over the document and gave it a two out of 10. </p>
        
            <p>"The government has delivered on its commitment to give us really clear numbers about the plan and say what it's going to do. </p>
        
            <p>"The issue is that when you add it all up, it's pretty clearly not enough."</p>
        
            <p>The coalition's plan includes more EV chargers, making emissions-cutting tools available to frames and investigating carbon capture and storage. </p>
        
            <p>It also wants to slash red tape for renewable energy consents, invest in public transport and improve organise waste and landfill gas capture. </p>

            <p>Climate Change Minister Simon Watts is unapologetic about doing things differently and says National is still committed to the country's emissions budgets. </p>
        
            <p>"We've been very clear around what we're starting, what we're stopping and the impact of that. A lot of the stuff we're stopping did not have a significant emissions reduction profile.</p>
        
            <p>"We're on track in terms of our first two stepping stones...and we're absolutely focused around making sure that we're set up for success in the future."</p>
        
            <p>In this week's Focus on Politics, Political Reporter Anneke Smith looks at why New Zealand's ability to meet its climate targets is on shaky ground.</p>
