            <p>New Zealand's biggest independent electricity retailer says it's no longer taking on customers because of wholesale energy prices.</p>
        
            <p>Electric Kiwi says wholesale energy prices are up 50 percent on six months ago and high futures prices - what it buys to protect against the volatile spot prices - mean every new customer the retailer takes on would be loss-making for the business.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Luke Blincoe says it's a market failure being overseen by the Electricity Authority and the Commerce Commission. He says smaller independent retailers like his are being squeezed while the big four generator-retailers - namely Mercury, Meridian Energy, Genesis Energy and Contact Energy - have the advantage of being able to insulate themselves from high spot pricing with their own generation.</p>
        
            <p>Electric Kiwi is New Zealand's biggest independent retailer - with more than 67,000 customers.</p>
