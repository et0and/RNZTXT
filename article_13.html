            <p>A National Union of Workers (NUW) official is hopeful Fiji Water employees who are entering their fourth day on strike will return to work shortly.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, a group of workers for Fiji Water went on strike over pay disputes at the multi-million dollar US-owned company's water bottling plant in Yaqara and the Naikabula depot in Lautoka.</p>
        
            <p>NUW's industrial relations officer Mererai Vatege said the parties were currently working on a resolution.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been some developments, the parties are currently talking," Vatege said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very hopeful and positive that this will be resolved soon."</p>
        
            <p>Vatege said the NUW met with Ministry of Labour officials on Thursday and are now awaiting a response from Fiji Water.</p>
        
            <p>However, she was unable to give a date when she expected the matters to be resolved by.</p>
        
            <p>The employees have continued with their strike, holding signs with messages calling for pay increases and working conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Talks broke down between Fiji Water and workers on 8 April.</p>
        
            <p>The workers claim the company has failed pay owed overtime and have not made income adjustments to inflation, along with other pay related issues.</p>

            <p>RNZ Pacific have requested comment from Fiji Water but have not had a response.</p>
        
            <p>However, in a statement Wednesday, a company spokesperson told Fijian media it was regrettable workers had engaged in a strike.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to strike is also unlawful because these issues have been submitted to the Ministry of Employment, which has not yet decided on the dispute," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Fiji Water takes great pride in being one of the best employers in Fiji and operating one of the most advanced and safest plants in the world."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the company provided some of the highest and best benefits in Fiji, including a 13.5 per cent wage increase in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>They said recent offers to the union equal an additional 17 percent pay increase for hourly-paid workers and a new roster pattern that would give workers 17 more days off each year.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead, the union has elected to engage in a strike that harms workers who will not receive wages while on strike."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the company would remain committed to resolving the contested issues with the union.</p>
        
            <p>Vatege said employees want to return to work but are united in strike action.</p>
        
            <p>She said they will only return once an agreement is signed between the union and the employer.</p>
