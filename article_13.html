            <p>The Bay of Islands will be transformed into a sea of sails this weekend as one of the highlights of Northland's boating calendar returns to the waters off Russell.</p>
        
            <p>The annual Tall Ships Regatta will see more than 80 mostly classic sailing boats race around the Bay in a variety of divisions, before contestants return to Russell for one of New Zealand's biggest hāngī and a night of revelry and swapping sea stories.</p>
        
            <p>The event, now in its 48th year, is hosted by Russell Boating Club.</p>
        
            <p>Club commodore Bruce Mitchinson said he expected entries to be roughly on a par with last year, when 86 vessels took part.</p>
        
            <p>The race would start at noon on Saturday off Russell wharf with the distance likely to be between 14 and 18 nautical miles, depending on conditions on the day.</p>
        
            <p>The tall ships division was open to vessels of two or more masts and more than 30 feet on deck, while the classic invitational was dedicated to historic vessels.</p>
        
            <p>In past years some boats had dated back to the late 1800s.</p>
        
            <p>A separate junk-rig division would be offered for just the second time, while an all-comers division was open to any sailing boat as long as it measured at least 22 feet on deck.</p>
        
            <p>
Last year's race was the first to have a division dedicated to junk-rigged vessels, including, from left, Shoestring, Gipsy Rose and Arcadian.

            <p>The only square-rigger expected this year - the kind of vessel people pictured when they heard the words "tall ship" - was the Northland-based R Tucker Thompson, a 60-foot gaff-rigged top sail schooner.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchinson said not much wind was forecast, especially at the start, so it was likely to be a sea breeze race.</p>
        
            <p>"But if we can get to a sea breeze of 15 knots, that's perfect."</p>
        
            <p>Most competitors would complete the course by about 4.30pm, in time for the 6pm prizegiving at the club's Matauwhi Bay headquarters.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchinson said the event was a celebration of sail and a chance for old sailing buddies to get together every summer as much as it was a race.</p>

Rat Bag, a 43-foot gaff-rigged topsail schooner, is also a regular participant in oil drilling protest flotillas.

            <p>It was also a chance to admire each other's lovingly restored boats.</p>
        
            <p>"Going around the course you see all kinds of boats and rigs. No two boats are the same. It's a great get-together, ideal for people who sail up to the Bay of Islands in summer and want something to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But that said, a lot of people do take it quite seriously. We have the same people coming back year after year trying to win the prize."</p>
        
            <p>The post-race festivities were as popular as the race itself.</p>

            <p>Up to 700 hungry sailors and spectators would feast on one of New Zealand's biggest hāngī - watching the crew uncover the cooking pit was a spectacle in itself - while two bands, one acoustic, the other playing rock covers, would keep the crowd entertained until well into the night.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchinson said the regatta was the club's biggest fundraiser of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all run by volunteers and everyone puts in a lot of hard work. All the long-standing members muscle in, and that makes it feel like a real family affair," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our little club is unique, and we enjoy having visitors come to see our little part of the world. It's quite magic."</p>
