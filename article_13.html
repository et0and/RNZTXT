            <p>New Zealand's rowers went on a medal rush last night at the Nautical Stadium just outside Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Three crews will bring medals home to New Zealand, one of each colour, after a one-hour flurry of great racing.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors started things off in golden fashion.</p>
        
            <p>About half an hour after that victory, the women's coxless four of Jackie Gowler, Phoebe Spoors, Kerri Williams, and Davina Waddy secured a bronze in their race, an event dominated by the Netherlands and Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand crew had to see off a surge from Romania at the line to ensure a second medal of the hour.</p>
        
            <p>And then the men's coxless four of Logan Ullrich, Ollie Maclean, Tom Murray, and Matt Macdonald completed the medal set with silver in their event, only beaten by an inspired American team in the final.</p>
