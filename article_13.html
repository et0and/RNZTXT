            <p>The Intrepid Museum's said Concorde, the fastest commercial aircraft in the world, has been a museum staple since its arrival to Pier 86 in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>"The months-long restoration project included removal of the aircraft's paint coating, sanding, and recoating, using the same colours and markings that made Concorde a true aviation legend," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Public tours of the jet will resume on 4 April, museum officials said.</p>
