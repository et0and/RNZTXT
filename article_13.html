            <p>Being made redundant from her job in the tech industry was the nudge Morgan Kane needed to get into market gardening.</p>
        
            <p>She and husband Aydan Mitchell enjoyed plunging their hands in the soil during the first pandemic lockdown, when they decamped to her parents' 1.6-hectare block of land on the outskirts of New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>It was autumn, a busy time on the farmlet, and Morgan wasn't able to be in Wellington where her job with a tech start-up was based, so they just went to work.</p>
        
            <p>"During Covid I fell in love with the garden," Morgan told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>She was eventually made redundant from the tech job, but with a growing interest in horticulture, she had done a course to gain extra knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting made redundant really pushed me to start the market garden."</p>
        
            <p>They moved into the converted garage adjacent to her parents' home in Brixton and she started her own food-growing venture on their land. </p>
        
            <p>"It's got beautiful soil. They call it the golden triangle."</p>
        
            <p>It's a warm day on the cusp of autumn four years later when Country Life visits. </p>
        
            <p>We weave our way through beds of newly planted brassicas, avocado trees and banana fronds, taking a whiff of the compost as a friendly chicken clucks and pecks its way behind us.</p>

Diversity and growing according to organic principles are key, Morgan says

            <p>Aydan and Morgan brim with enthusiasm as they point out new areas to be put into crops. The area is between the coast and the mountain and has its own microclimate, which the banana trees and other crops seem to love.</p>
        
            <p>Aydan harvests the produce after work, and he plans to become more involved - although at the moment he agrees he is the cash cow for the fledgling business.</p>

            <p>Under the brand Clarty Produce, they are growing a diverse range of fruit and vegetables, some experimental like the luffa (or loofah) plant which can be used as a scrubbing tool.</p>
        
            <p>The brand name is a nod to Morgan's Scottish heritage. Clarty means "dirty", especially in the sense of getting muddy.</p>
        
            <p>They use organic principles, although are not certified, and make their own compost and vermicast fertiliser, aiming for a closed loop system.</p>
        
            <p>"Having access to the land is the biggest thing... you put so much effort into the soil."</p>

Morgan loves selling at the Taranaki Farmers Market for its community vibe and flexibility

            <p>The produce is sold at the farmers' market and in subscription boxes over the summer. They hope to extend this to an all-year-round offering as they expand the farm.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always said self-sufficiency first and then sell the excess," Morgan said.</p>

            <p>Morgan's parents emigrated from Scotland 32 years ago, with the idea of becoming self-sufficient themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Her mother, Jane Allan, was a doctor working in mental health, and her father Steve Kane works in the oil and gas industry alongside maintenance jobs on the farmlet.</p>
        
            <p>They have been here now for eight years, managing a flock of chickens, a beehive, Dexter cattle, a kitchen garden and more recently the avocados.</p>
        
            <p>Having extra hands on the land is a bonus, Jane said, and intergenerational living works both ways.</p>
        
            <p>"It really works out for everyone."</p>

            <p>Losing her job amid a pandemic had a silver lining for Morgan, who does not hanker for her old lifestyle. In fact, Covid made her think about taking on a different, more physical role. </p>
        
            <p>"Being able to feed people, something that's necessary for survival."</p>
