            <p>A charity using recycled chip packets to make thermal blankets wants to ramp up production with predictions even more kiwi families will be in the cold come winter.</p>
        
            <p>The chip project uses cleaned and dried potato chippy packaging to make the light weight foil blankets - that are like the ones emergency services use.</p>
        
            <p>The charity estimates more than 250,000 of the blankets could be needed this year with many households struggling with the cost of living and heating options beyond their budgets.</p>
        
            <p>Chip Packet Project founder Terrena Griffiths said to increase the volume of blankets needed more manpower and machinery was also needed.</p>
        
            <p>"That piece of machinery would be an iron roller so we could change a component of making those blankets that currently takes 90 minutes, if I got an iron roller then I could ramp it up from 90 minutes to 12 - that would be a game changer to get them out the door."</p>
        
            <p>It was not only chip packets that could be used but other foil packaging such as that used for crackers and biscuits could be used, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we take 25 of those packets, they're nice and clean and washed and dry and we fuse them together with a bit of heat to make a blanket 1.2 by 2 metres rectangle."</p>
        
            <p>Mitre 10 then provides some pallet topper plastic which the blankets are encased in and when the roller is used, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It takes four hours to make every blanket and the work is all done by volunteers and by hand, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year we managed to make 500 blankets, that's just over 27,000 pieces of foil that have been diverted from landfill."</p>
        
            <p>Every piece of foil takes 80 years to decompose in landfill, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of living crisis has meant that many people are living in "energy poverty" and that looked set to increase, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The blankets are "really toasty" and reflect the heat towards you when it is cold, but also the heat away from you when it is very hot, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every piece of foil that we have has been donated by wonderful people in the community who are concerned for our environment, but also concerned for our Kiwis."</p>
        
            <p>People need to wash and dry their packets and there are then 29 collection points around the country where they can be picked up, she said.</p>
