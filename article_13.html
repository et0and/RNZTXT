            <p>Best known as a television journalist for Newshub, hosting radio solo will be a new experience for Gower.</p>
        
            <p>His one-off programme is set to feature an upbeat mix of the curious and the compelling, with the top stories of the morning, interviews with some prominent recipients of King's Birthday Honours, as well as lifestyle and human-interest interviews and some music from his own playlist.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a long-time listener, first time announcer when it comes to RNZ and I'm really excited to have the chance to host this holiday weekend show. I just hope someone shows me which buttons to push," Gower said.</p>

            <p>The former political editor of 3News has been hosting Paddy Gower Has Issues for the channel until recently.</p>
        
            <p>He has been in the spotlight this year over the closure of Newshub which will take effect on 5 July.</p>
        
            <p>When the possibility was first announced, Gower made an emotional tribute to his colleagues saying they deserved a lifeline.</p>
        
            <p>He was among seven senior Newshub journalists who pushed back against the company's proposal and put forward their own plan, which was ultimately rejected in favour of a proposal by Stuff which will launch a daily bulletin from July.</p>
        
            <p>King's Birthday Morning with Paddy will air from from 8am to midday.</p>
        
            <p>It will be followed by long running music show Matinee Idle from midday to 5pm.</p>
