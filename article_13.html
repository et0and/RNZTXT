            <p>A chook rescued from the floodwaters of Cyclone Gabrielle is now part of a project to hatch chicks destined for cyclone-impacted families.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative, Cyclone Chicks, was started by Hawke's Bay farmer and veterinarian Sally Newall to help bring a bit of light back to families who lost stock and pets during last year's storm.</p>

            <p>A keen animal lover, Newall already had plenty of chickens of her own before deciding to start rearing more to gift to those impacted by the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it would be a nice, practical way of bringing a little bit light into people's lives."</p>
        
            <p>An Orpington hen was the only one of her flock to survive the flooding during the cyclone. </p>
        
            <p>"That surviving Orpington is now hatching chicks to gift to other people affected by the cyclone. It's a really nice circle."</p>
        
            <p>About 160 birds have been rehomed so far, with another 30 or so chicks ready to go.</p>

            <p>Newall has been farming out fertile eggs, to be hatched by neighbours' chooks, like the Orpington, as well as rearing some of her own.</p>
        
            <p>She's also managed to source a number of end-of-lay chooks from commercial farms for the project.</p>
        
            <p>Along with the chicken, each family also receives a bag of layer pellets or chick crumb when they take their new feathered friends home.</p>
        
            <p>While chickens were "very far down the line in terms of priorities", those who had received them have already told Newall they had missed having the birds.</p>
        
            <p>"People are just really enjoying having some chooks back in their lives."</p>

            <p>It had been an "incredibly hard year" for friends who had "lost everything" in the floods, some of whom were still displaced from their homes.</p>
        
            <p>"For a lot of them, it's not getting any easier.</p>
        
            <p>"Some people are feeling a little forgotten about."</p>
        
            <p>She has been amazed by the community response to the initiative.</p>
        
            <p>"It's become a bit of a community endeavour really. I didn't realise how much other people would want to get involved. </p>
        
            <p>"Some of our biggest supporters are people who have been affected by the flood."</p>
        
            <p>With many families still displaced from their homes, or yet to find rental properties that allow animals, Newall is hoping to keep the project alive until next year.</p>
        
            <p>She has started a Givealittle page to help with costs. </p>
        
            <p>You can learn more about the project and how to get involved through their farming education webpage, Kiwi Country Kids.</p>
