            <p>As Wellington City Council mulls spending more than $11 million to prevent waterfront drownings, locals say it'll be tough to balance cost, safety and aesthetics.</p>
        
            <p>A coroner has urged it to install permanent waterfront balustrades, after finding 30-year-old Sandy Calkin might not have died if they were in place.</p>
        
            <p>Calkin accidentally drowned after falling off Queens Wharf in July 2021. He is one of seven people who have drowned in the capital's harbour since 2006 - including Isaac Levings who died in 2023, two years after Calkin.</p>
        
            <p>After Levings' death the council installed temporary fencing and improved lighting.</p>
        
            <p>It proposed spending $11.1m on permanent protection, pending a business case to be delivered in May, followed by public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Gavin Walker from Water Safety NZ said some protection was needed, but the council did not need barriers throughout the entire area.</p>
        
            <p>"Just those areas that are key high traffic areas, and in and around bars," he said.</p>
        
            <p>That had made a big difference in the risk of drowning near Auckland's Princes Wharf and the viaduct, said Walker.</p>

            <p>There had been 10 drownings between 2000 and 2010 - and four in the 14 years since, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"After a number of upgrades and improvements, the installation of barriers in some locations and changing pedestrian flows around those areas, improving lighting, the risk of drowning dramatically reduced."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from Auckland Council's development agency Eke Panuku said further measures were put in place since the death of Tim Rogers, who fell from a railing to a floating concrete pontoon in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>That included upgrading and adding balustrades and installing safety ladders, life rings, new signage and better lighting.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to note that the harbour's edge is vastly different in both cities, so what might work in one may not work in the other," they said.</p>

            <p>Local bar owner Jeremy Smith said it made sense to put barriers only in the highest risk areas, rather than altering the beauty of the entire waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>It was a balancing act, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, council has some responsibility, but they can't protect people from themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"In hospitality, there does need to be a degree of personal accountability."</p>
        
            <p>Robert Baldock owns a waterfront shop near Whairepo Lagoon, and lives on a boat moored near Fergs Kayaks.</p>
        
            <p>He said permanent waterfront protection was an "unnecessary expense".</p>
        
            <p>"Wellington needs other infrastructure before they need fencing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary fencing could be retained, but may not make a difference, considering the behaviour of people on the waterfront at night.</p>
        
            <p>"They do some really silly things at times ... jumping into the water from all sorts of crazy angles," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think if these people are going to be silly around water, it doesn't really matter where you put the fences."</p>
        
            <p>On the waterfront on Tuesday afternoon, most locals RNZ spoke to thought there should be some sort of protection, especially in the more dangerous areas where there is a bigger drop down to the water. Some, though, questioned the $11.1m price tag.</p>
        
            <p>Others said it was a matter of personal responsibility, and the council should not pay for it.</p>
