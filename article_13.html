            <p>A red alert remains in place for Vanuatu's Tafea province due to category 2 tropical cyclone Seru.</p>
        
            <p>However, Shefa has the all-clear after earlier being under a yellow alert.</p>
        
            <p>In its latest update at 9am Wednesday (local time), the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department said that as the system maintains a southwesterly direction, isolated heavy rainfall is expected over southern Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>There is also the possibility of flash flooding over low-lying areas, and areas close to river banks including coastal flooding.</p>
        
            <p>A marine strong wind warning is current for all coastal waters of Vanuatu, with a high seas warning for all open waters of the islands of Tafea province.</p>
        
            <p>Damaging gale-force winds of 75km/h and increasing to 105km/h are expected within 25 nautical miles from the centre of the system and may affect Tafea province in the next six to 12 hours (from 9am Vanuatu time).</p>
        
            <p>Destructive storm force winds of 110 km/h increasing to 160km/h are expected within 40 nautical miles from the centre of the system.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Tonga's Fua'amotu Tropical Cyclone Center is now de-activated with ex-cyclone Rae moving out of its waters.</p>
        
            <p>In Fiji, schools across most of the country are re-opening on Wednesday, except for those in the Lau Group.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Aseri Radrodro said schools in the Northern Division, Lomaiviti, Western, Central Divisions, and Rotuma will be open as scheduled.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we urge parents to use their discretion when deciding whether to send their children to school, particularly in areas impacted by flooding or other hazards," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Fiji Government said tropical cyclone Rae has caused significant damage to the infrastructure in the Lau Group, including roads, bridges, and crossings, impacting the ability of students and teachers to access their schools.</p>
