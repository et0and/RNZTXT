            <p>Weather woes, the health system and Māoridom hitting back at government policies that affected them dominated the headlines and also produced some memorable images of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But there were plenty of others that also lingered from the sudden deaths of Green MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins and Kiingi Tuheitia to the grounding of the Aratere and the sinking of HMNZS Manawanui.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a reflection on some of what RNZ captured during the year.</p>
