            <p>An estimated 13,000 people have been evacuated since Mt Ulawun in West New Britain in Papua New Guinea began erupting on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>The evacuees are from Nano, Ubili, Pandi and the Pata Painave areas.</p>
        
            <p>They have been moved to four care centres around Bialla to avoid the ashfall from the eruption.</p>
        
            <p>A disaster operating base has been established at Bialla.</p>
        
            <p>Local media report the Rabaul Volcano Observatory saying the eruption could continue indefinitely but the agency has revealed a key seismic station located near the base of Mt Ulawun has been lost with the eruption and this is impacting on their ability to assess the volcano's activity.</p>
        
            <p>Disaster officials at Ulamona have confirmed that the seismic station stopped transmitting after the eruptions commenced on Monday and may have been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>West New Britain disaster officials say the eruption has resulted in new vents being created on Mt Ulawun.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday the provincial police commander for West New Britain Chief Inspector Peter Barkie told the Post-Courier that evacuees were in dire need of relief supplies.</p>
        
            <p>NBC reports that the palm oil operators New Britain Palm Oil Ltd and Hargy Oil have been helping to dispatch relief supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Air flights into Hoskins Airport are on hold after the airport was shut because of the ashfall.</p>
