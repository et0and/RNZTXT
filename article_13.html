            <p>Commercial flights from Nouméa's international airport have resumed on Wednesday on a limited basis.</p>
        
            <p>The Nouméa-La Tontouta International Airport had been closed to the public since violent and destructive riots broke out in New Caledonia on 13 May.</p>
        
            <p>This was mainly due to the main road access between Nouméa and the airport being blocked by numerous barricades erected by groups of rioters.</p>
        
            <p>The highway is still unusable, but international carrier Air Calédonie International (AirCalin) introduced a new transfer system, relying on domestic airline Air Calédonie and its ATR-42 and ATR-72 planes from Nouméa's domestic Magenta airport.</p>
        
            <p>However, only a limited number of international flights will be operational, in what AirCalin terms as a "light" and "modified" schedule starting from 5 June.</p>
        
            <p>AirCalin said as part of this "gradual" reopening of international traffic, passengers on those "authorised" flights would only be allowed one suitcase, with a maximum weight of 23kg per person.</p>
        
            <p>Air transfers via Air Calédonie's ATRs can only carry a maximum of about 50 passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The first regional flights on the schedule are those from Papeete, French Polynesia, via Nadi, Fiji SB631, and to Brisbane, Australia SB150, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Since La Tontouta airport was closed to commercial flights on 13 May, a total of 185 flights had to be cancelled, thereby affecting some 20,000 passengers, AirCalin said.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic carrier Air Calédonie has also resumed internal flights on Wednesday, but on a limited "one flight per island per day" basis, from Nouméa Magenta to the Loyalty islands group (Maré, Lifou, Ouvéa) and the Isle of Pines.</p>
