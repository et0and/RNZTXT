            <p>A rare blood moon will be seen across all of New Zealand on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Stardome astronomer Josh Aoraki told RNZ a blood moon, or lunar eclipse, is when the moon passes through the earth's shadow, called the penumbra, creating a "red hue" - hence the name.</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki said the eclipse will reach totality between 8pm and 8:30pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He said it will be able to be seen with the naked eye, but if you have a camera, telescope or binoculars it would be worth bringing those along.</p>
        
            <p>The moon will rise in the east after sunset, so Aoraki's advice to see the moon is to look towards the eastern horizon, or head to a beach on the east coast.</p>
        
            <p>However, weather would play the biggest factor in whether you can see the blood moon.</p>
        
            <p>Luckily, MetService is forecasting a "mainly fine" Friday for most of the country, with isolated showers about Bay of Plenty and Coromandel. While the South Island, the West Coast is forecast to experience a few showers, turning to rain in Fiordland, and isolated showers in Otago and Southland, clearing later on.</p>
        
            <p>The last blood moon occurred in 2022, however, this year there will be two blood moons, so if you miss tomorrows lunar eclipse, you'll get another chance later this year.</p>
