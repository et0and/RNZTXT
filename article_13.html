            <p>Greenpeace says it's unbelieveable New Zealand is continuing to use a herbicide which is now banned in both Australia and the United States.</p>
        
            <p>In August the United States took an unprecedented move in banning Dacthal or DCPA herbicides, used for weed control in vegetable growing, citing possible irreversible damage to unborn children.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time in forty years the US EPA has done an emergency stop on the chemcials because of the potential harm they can do to foetal development.</p>
        
            <p>Now Australia is following the United States, completely banning the use of products containing chlorthal dimethyl.</p>
        
            <p>Following the US ban, New Zealand's Environmenal Protection Authority reviewed dacthal use and introduced stricter rules around application, but veered away from a ban.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman said the EPA should stop its use immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"It is outrageous that the New Zealand EPA is allowing these chemicals to be used. When you look at the conditions they're apparently imposing on the use of these chemicals you're somehow supposed to know whether you may or may not be pregnant if you're a farm worker, and then you've got to somehow avoid going onto a farm which in the previous five days has maybe used these chemicals.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think it's completely irresponsible to put farm workers in that position where they have to make those decisions around a chemical which everyone else is banning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Norman said he will write to the EPA to get dacthal use here banned but doubts he'll be successful.</p>
        
            <p>Chlorthal dimethyl is not widely used in New Zealand and Norman said because of that, a ban would have little effect and should be easy to do.</p>
        
            <p>He said in the United States DCPA is widely used and banning its use would have signficicant impacts for vegetable growers, but the US EPA still went ahead with the ban.</p>
        
            <p>The Environmental Protection Authority has been approached for comment.</p>
