            <p>One of the worst kept secrets in the NRL finally became public this week. Warriors prop Addin Fonua-Blake is set to make a return to the shores of Sydney for the 2025 NRL season, having secured a move to the Cronulla Sutherland Sharks on a contract rumoured to be around $1,000,000 a season. But in every crisis, there's an opportunity: Fonua-Blake's departure leaves a giant gap in the Warriors' salary cap.</p>
        
            <p>Fonua-Blake had sought a compassionate release from the final three years of his contract, leading to a confusing 24 hours last month when an agreement was subsequently reached, allowing him to extend his stay with the Warriors for the upcoming 2024 season.</p>
        
            <p>Despite finally finding serious form after a rocky couple of seasons and being a pivotal figure in the Warriors' red-hot charge to the NRL preliminary finals this year - winning the Dally M prop of the year honours as well as the VB Hard Earned player of the year award - 27-year-old Fonua-Blake expressed his desire to relocate to Sydney to be in closer proximity to his ageing parents. The Australian born Fonua-Blake initially joined the Warriors in the midst of their Covid stint in 2021, still being based in Australia which may have been a massive drawcard as it was to a lot of other Aussie players in the Warriors ranks during the time.</p>
        
            <p>Relocating from the Manly Sea Eagles, where he made his NRL debut in 2016, Fonua-Blake is renowned as a dominant prop who honed his skills terrorising Sydney's rugby league grades. Fonua-Blake 's connection to New Zealand emerged as he played for the Junior Kiwis in 2014 as well as a single Test for the Kiwis during the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, contributing to a resounding 74-6 victory over Scotland.</p>

            <p>He then pledged his allegiance to the Mate Ma'a Tonga team, achieving remarkable success with impactful performances that included wins against top-tier nations like England and Australia. Undoubtedly, Fonua-Blake stands as a pivotal figure in reshaping the history and sparking the resurgence of international rugby league.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors CEO Cameron George confirmed ongoing discussions with the Cronulla, resulting in a finalised deal for Fonua-Blake to join the Sharks starting from the 2025 season. George clarified that the arrangement did not involve a player swap, which leaves us to ponder - with $1 million in the bank - who should the Auckland based outfit chase? Do the Warriors redistribute the wealth, focusing on other positions and blood some young local front rowers in? Do they need to look to bringing kiwi talent under the age of 30 back home? God forbid, (shoutout to Sam Tomkins) do they bring an Englishman over?</p>
        
            <p>Here's a few names that could be on the Warriors' minds:</p>

            <p>The recipient of the 2023 Golden Boot Award for International League Player of the year and current Kiwis captain, bringing JFH back across the ditch is a no-brainer really. Have we ever seen anyone more committed to the Kiwis jersey in the modern game? Not to mention the three premierships over the past three years that he's helped bring to Penrith in the NRL. The pride he would bring to the team alone would be worth it.</p>

            <p>Another blockbusting Kiwi who's been tearing it up in not only the black and white of the Kiwis but also the lime green of Canberra, the Warriors could have a serious look at bringing Wellington born Joseph Tapine back home. With serious finals experience including a tight grand final loss and a nose for the try line, Tapine would find himself surrounded by fellow Kiwi teammates at the Warriors by slotting right into a second row that could use a little more potency on attack as well as being able to cover the front row and lock positions. A slight headache for Andrew Webster maybe, but a good one.</p>

            <p>Speaking of rock-solid Kiwis, Auckland born Moses Leota would almost be a like for like replacement of Fonua-Blake. Having notched up 149 first grade games for Penrith and seven tests (six for the Kiwis and one for Toa Samoa), Leota is a dominant force in the engine room in the middle of the park. His fearless carries are reminiscent of league days of old, seeing him running off the back fence of Mt Smart would be something.</p>

            <p>Many have dreamed of Waiheke Island-raised Brandon Smith returning home. He's old school, tough and an absolute character. His smarts for the game and the way he approaches it make him one of the most entertaining and enthralling players in the modern era. The Kiwis number one choice at hooker is also an absolute weapon playing at lock, somewhere the Warriors could really use the versatility. He suffered a rough start to his career as a Rooster but that's not all down to him and played a massive role in their late charge into the NRL finals series as well. Could we see the return of one of NZ league's favourite sons to Mt Smart in a Warriors jersey? One can only dream.</p>

            <p>Potentially a smokey here and while the Warriors should be shopping for someone who isn't in their 30s let alone mid-30s, just look at his rig. He was impressive when he lined up for the Roosters in the back end of the 2023 season and besides his obvious brain explosions, JWH has still got some ticker in him. He's someone who is feared by opponents, championed by team mates he plays the game hard and true and brings a total sense of mana and will to win about him - something the Warriors have recently found in themselves, but it wouldn't hurt bolstering up the stocks with a Kiwis legend.</p>
