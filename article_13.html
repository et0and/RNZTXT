        <h2>Best images from James Webb Telescope as it turns two</h2>
        <p>
From galaxies to stars to planets, the world's largest and most powerful telescope has captured the allure of outer space in vibrant colours.
</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, the world witnessed a Christmas miracle as NASA launched the largest and most powerful space telescope into the great abyss.</p>
        
            <p>The collective effort from people across thousands of countries dating back to the 1990s has led to the birth of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>
        
            <p>It has taken amazing pictures of the cosmos, but also lead to discoveries that, while amazing, were difficult to photograph - but did give us some impressive illustrations.</p>
        
            <p>In celebration of its monumental second year out in space, here are some of the best photos - and some illustrations, to honour that the JWST is more than just a camera - science has gifted us since.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The JWST is the only telescope capable of defining the characteristics of Earth-sized exoplanets such as this one.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from being similar in size, LHS 475 b differs from Earth in both temperature and time.</p>
        
            <p>Orbiting 41 light years away from us, it measures a few hundred degrees warmer and a year on the exoplanet is about two days.</p>

            <p>A captivating image of a star as it combusts into dust emerges in another NASA first.</p>
        
            <p>The rare and fleeting phase was captured as an explosion of purple hues that was once the star's outer layer.</p>

NASA published this image of Cassiopeia A, a supernova remnant, using data from Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument.

</p>
        
            <p>Dubbed as both "a science and an art", the remains of Cas A interpreted as this colourful cosmic dust was created using data from JSWT's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MRI).</p>
        
            <p>The MRI allowed for the image to be processed in incredible detail, presenting itself in everyday colours we recognise.</p>

NGC 346 is a dynamic star cluster that lies within a nebula 200,000 light years away.

            <p>Brewing in a neighbouring galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud - a nebula 210,000 light years away - is planet NGC 346.</p>
        
            <p>The microscopic grains of sand and dust coming close to a cluster of young stars signify the forming of a planet.</p>

The dusty debris disk surrounding the young star Fomalhaut encompasses three nested belts extending out to 23 billion kilometres from the star.

</p>
        
            <p>The three rings surrounding the young star extend out to 23 billion kilometres, which is 150 times the distance from Earth to the Sun.</p>
        
            <p>Known as "debris disks", the dusty belts are a product of ruins from collisions of bodies such as asteroids and comets.</p>
        
            <p>
This illustration of Comet 238P/Read shows the main belt comet sublimating — its water ice vaporising as its orbit approaches the Sun.

</p>
        
            <p>The discovery of water in the Solar System's main asteroid belt confirmed a longstanding theory NASA has had.</p>
        
            <p>It demonstrated that water ice could be preserved inside Jupiter's orbit, and could have been delivered to Earth - linking back to early origins of our water source.</p>

            <p>Some 390 light years away lies the nearest star-forming region to Earth.</p>
        
            <p>The Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex comprises about 50 young stars nestled among jets of molecular hydrogen in red and cosmic dust in bright greenish-yellow.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a video tour of the stars in the area.</p>

The new James Webb images of Messier 57 clearly show the main ring, surrounded by a faint halo and with many delicate structures.

            <p>The JWST has taken us through the various life phases of a star, and that includes one of Ring Nebula in its last stages of existence.</p>
        
            <p>Named after its distinct circular pattern, the star was first discovered in 1779 by French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix.</p>

The M51 galaxy is called the Whirlpool due to its distinct spiral arms.

</p>
        
            <p>This is the clearest image of the spiral galaxy in almost two decades.</p>
        
            <p>M51 is believed to get its swirling structure from the gravitational pull of a neighbouring galaxy.</p>

            <p>At no more than a few tens of thousands of years old, Herbig-Haro 211 has a mass of only 8 per cent of our Sun.</p>
        
            <p>But it's destined to grow into a similar size, giving us a glimpse of what our Sun may have once looked like in its premature days.</p>

            <p>Boasting a total of 11 rings across the inner and outer sets, Uranus shines through the JWST.</p>
        
            <p>The inner system encompasses nine dark grey rings while the outer rings are in red and blue.</p>
