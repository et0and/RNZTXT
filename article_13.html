        <p>
Rachin Ravindra's form in recent months has been outstanding and his knock in the opening T20 international against Australia is the latest example.

            <p>Rachin Ravindra can do little wrong at the moment and his knock in the opening T20 international against Australia in Wellington is the latest example.</p>
        
            <p>With the World Cup in mind, Ravindra was drafted into the Black Caps T20 side and he repaid the selectors by top scoring for the home side in their six wicket loss.</p>
        
            <p>Had Daryl Mitchell and Kane Williamson both been available for the series, Ravindra may have struggled to make the squad, but he is now one of those players that has to be considered for every format of the game.</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra's form in recent months has been outstanding.</p>
        
            <p>He was one of the stars at the 50-over World Cup last year scoring three centuries which resulted in him being named the ICC's Emerging Player of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>The 24 year old then scored a double century against South Africa in the test series last month.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington last night he hit 68 off 35 balls, including six sixes as New Zealand made 215 for three. Australia reached their target off the last ball.</p>
        
            <p>It was his best knock in the 20 T20I's he's played.</p>

            <p>Former Black Cap Peter McGlashan says Ravindra's reputation continues to flourish.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen repeatedly now off the back of some big tournaments him do well and now against Australia, one of the world's best in this format, he's stepped up," said McGlashan.</p>
        
            <p>"He was always a player, even as a young kid, who was talked about in the same realm as the Kane Williamsons and co, so it's great to see him take the step up to the big stage and do well.</p>
        
            <p>"It suggests he's got a very long career ahead of him both here in New Zealand also in all the other formats around the world where he'll get an opportunity to do very well for himself."</p>
        
            <p>Black Caps fast bowler Lockie Ferguson spoke for the team after the game and said Ravindra's development is impressive.</p>
        
            <p>"It says he's got a hell of a head on his shoulders," Ferguson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's had a great year in all formats, he was great for us at the World Cup it was amazing and batted well against South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>"Tonight is probably going to give him a lot of confidence. He probably hasn't had the best start to a T20 campaign, but we know the talent he has and you could see it tonight with the sixes he hit that he has a lovely swing of the bat and I'm sure he'll play a big part in the next few games."</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra said it was a special moment to perform in front of his home crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty surreal. I spent a lot of time here growing up, watched a lot of cricket here so first time playing for New Zealand in Wellington with an atmosphere like that was amazing."</p>
        
            <p>After looking scratchy early in his innings, Ravindra said Conway allowed him to get his eye in while keeping the runs coming at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>"Cricket is about partnerships and lucky enough we were able to feed off each other."</p>
        
            <p>Ravindra has played five tests with a double century and an average of 41.5</p>
        
            <p>He has a high score of 123 with an average of 41 in 25 ODI's and an average of 16.5 and a high score of 68 in 20 T20I's.</p>
        
            <p>Game two of the T20 series against Australia is at Eden Park on Friday night with the third game also in Auckland on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The two-test series starts at the Basin Reserve next Thursday.</p>
