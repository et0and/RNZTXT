            <p>Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa has confirmed the sacking of three Cabinet Ministers in a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>The three are:</p>
        
            <p>Fiame said she made the changes to her Cabinet as she needed a good Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>"The question put to the three now terminated - 'do you have faith in me' - when it comes to confidence, I need to know that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister is expected make a public announcement on Wednesday regarding the positions and the new Cabinet ministers who will step into the available posts.</p>
        
            <p>Local media reports had suggested members of the FAST party had called for her removal as prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>According to Fiame, "I have the role as prime minister to make the decision on the Parliament of Samoa; it is also the Parliament of Samoa who can make the decision on whether or not I stay as prime minister or step down."</p>
        
            <p>She said the decisions made by the party are their own decision, confirming they can remove her as leader of FAST but not as prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>On the removal of Laauli Leuatea Schmidt as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, she said there was advice given for him to step down and let the police handle the situation, but Laauli wanted to stay.</p>
        
            <p>"Laauli had been charged, and he needed to resign; I told my party to have faith. But now they turned against me.</p>
        
            <p>"I am doing my duty as prime minister."</p>
        
            <p>Fiame would not confirm how many have supported her or stand with Laauli.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's parliament will meet next Monday.</p>
        
            <p>La'auli, who is also chairman of the country's ruling FAST party, faces several criminal charges.</p>
