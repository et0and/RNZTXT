            <p>Singapore Airlines has become the latest international airline to ban the use of portable power banks while onboard its flights.</p>
        
            <p>The airline announced the change in a statement on Wednesday, saying the restriction will start 1 April.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what you need to know.</p>
        
            <p>Several airline companies are bringing in restrictions around using portable power banks on their flights.</p>
        
            <p>It means travellers will not be allowed to use the banks to charge their devices, nor charge the banks using onboard USB ports.</p>
        
            <p>Airlines that have announced these restrictions include:</p>
        
            <p>It's best to check directly with your airline before you fly, but here are the general rules.</p>
        
            <p>Any portable power banks you're taking with you must still be packed in your carry-on luggage, even if you can't use them while flying.</p>
        
            <p>They are not permitted in checked baggage.</p>
        
            <p>You can bring power banks with a capacity of up to 100Wh without having to notify the airline.</p>
        
            <p>But power banks between 100Wh and 160Wh will need special approval.</p>
        
            <p>Those above 160Wh are not allowed on flights.</p>
        
            <p>Airlines have been moving to take extra preventative measures around fire hazards.</p>
        
            <p>Power banks use lithium-ion batteries, which are known to be highly flammable and difficult to extinguish.</p>
        
            <p>In its statement announcing the change, Singapore Airlines said it "complies with the International Air Transport Association's Dangerous Goods Regulations" on power banks, which are classified as lithium-ion batteries.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is the United Nations agency that coordinated aviation regulations across the world, has banned lithium-ion batteries of any kind from the cargo holds of passenger planes.</p>
        
            <p>That's why you'll still be told to pack your power banks in carry-on luggage.</p>
        
            <p>But there's still no industry standard for whether they can be used while in the cabin.</p>
        
            <p>That means you may see some airlines deciding not to ban their use, and where there are restrictions, it might not be the same from company to company.</p>
