            <p>Former All Blacks hooker, advocate for troubled youth and Dancing with the Stars winner Norm Hewitt has died, aged 55.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from his family said Hewitt, who had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, died overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The combative rugby player was involved in some high-profile incidents involving alcohol off the field, but later became a mentor to troubled youth and advocated for a number of agencies and charities.</p>
        
            <p>"Although rugby dominated his early life, he established a thriving human relations consultancy after retirement, and his services were much in demand both nationally and internationally," his family said.</p>
        
            <p>"He walked confidently in both Māori and Pākehā worlds and was a particular role model for troubled youth, citing his own background, and offering inspirational teachings that one's present life need not be one's future."</p>
        
            <p>He was husband to Arlene and father to Elizabeth and Alexander.</p>
        
            <p>Hewitt played for the All Blacks from 1993 to 1998 in 14 matches, nine of which were tests.</p>
        
            <p>He was a stalwart of Hawke's Bay, Hurricanes and New Zealand Māori rugby, captaining all three, and also had a notable stint with Southland.</p>
        
            <p>He won the first season of Dancing with the Stars in 2005. He and dance partner Carol-Ann Hickmore were a crowd favourite from early on, and even included a version of the haka in their winning dance.</p>

            <p>He played initially during the Sean Fitzpatrick era of the All Blacks, which limited his number of appearances.</p>
        
            <p>In a post to social media, the All Blacks said they were "saddened by the loss of All Black #938 Norm Hewitt who passed away yesterday in Wellington".</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with Norm's family and loved ones at this time."</p>
        
            <p>A dynamic player on the field, he and England hooker Richard Cockerill memorably confronted each other face-to-face after the All Blacks haka before their 1997 test.</p>
        
            <p>But his off-field incidents included breaking into a Queenstown hotel room while drunk in 1999. He issued a tearful apology, and as a result began to deal with his drinking problem, which in turn led to him being a public speaker and mentor to youth.</p>
        
            <p>He was an anti-violence spokesperson and a leading figure in charity work, including being an ambassador for Outward Bound and an advocate for the SPCA.</p>
        
            <p>His biography Gladiator, written by Michael Laws, sold more than 35,000 copies.</p>
        
            <p>The family said Hewitt's funeral arrangements were private and they asked for privacy so they could properly grieve.</p>
