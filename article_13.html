            <p>New Zealand's whodunit show The Brokenwood Mysteries has marked 10 years on the silver screen.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of the longest running New Zealand TV dramas other than Shortland Street.</p>
        
            <p>The show stars Neill Rea as detective Mike Shepherd and Fern Sutherland as detective Kristin Sims.</p>
        
            <p>Police officer and fan of the show Bryan Ward works in the Rodney district.</p>
        
            <p>He said that placed him right between the Helensville Post Office, which doubles as the Brokenwood police station, and Warkworth, where the Brokenwood township is filmed.</p>
        
            <p>"If I lived in Brokenwood, I'd probably be a little bit alarmed at the amount of serious crime that's going on there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But Ward said some of the community policing depicted on the show was similar to real policing out on country roads and in small towns.</p>
        
            <p>"That thing of only sort of being two or three degrees of separation, that's quite common, especially up in the Rodney area where people know people," he said.</p>

            <p>Less realistic, he said, were some of the costuming choices.</p>
        
            <p>Something that stood out to him watching the show was the number of the uniformed police officers wearing jumpers under their body armor in summer.</p>
        
            <p>"Let me assure you, nobody wears their jumper under a body armor on a hot summer day. It's just way too hot."</p>
        
            <p>Ward had previously met Cristina Serban Ionda, who plays medical examiner Dr Gina Kadinsky on the show, at a police open day not long after Brokenwood had started. He also at the time had his own TV show Bryan and Bobby.</p>
        
            <p>"People were sort of laughing at the two of us together, trying to figure it out whether she was really part of the New Zealand police or not," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably one of the great strengths of that show is the storylines are that good, that people actually believe the characters are real."</p>

Dr Helen Poulsen says the toxicology in the show is "not far off the truth".

            <p>ESR forensic toxicologist Dr Helen Poulsen was also a fan of the show. She had watched every episode and had bought all the DVDs.</p>
        
            <p>Her job involved testing forensic samples for drugs and poisons in the lab.</p>
        
            <p>Poulsen said their work often came from the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>"So you know when Gina does her autopsy and take samples and sends them off to toxicology [...] we analyse those for drugs and poisons to see if they may have been the cause of death."</p>
        
            <p>Poulsen said there was a surprising amount of toxicology included in the show.</p>
        
            <p>"I could pick holes in it, but it's not far off the truth," she said. "Certainly, a lot more accurate than CSI."</p>
        
            <p>But she said one recent example of the science not stacking up was a poison being injected into solid chocolate, which she said would not work.</p>
        
            <p>The show also analysed some forensic evidence that was not possible in real life, she said, but she was keeping that information a secret so people would not know what they could get away with.</p>
