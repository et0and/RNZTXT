            <p>Many people are choosing - when they grow up - to revert back to their Chinese names after having changed them.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Times reporter Ke-Xin went through five names before coming back to her Chinese name.</p>
        
            <p>"My first English name was given to me at third grade when we started learning English. Our English teacher brought us a list of girl names and boy names for us to choose from.</p>
        
            <p>"And among the girl names, there is a Betty which sounds very similar to my Chinese nickname which means precious baby."</p>
        
            <p>Betty became her first English name, but there were more changes to come.</p>
        
            <p>Still living in China, she started an English tutorial class where there was another Betty, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In Chinese, we don't do Betty A, Betty B to distinguish people. So as the late-comer, I had to pick another English name. So, I chose Alice."</p>
        
            <p>Later a cousin, also named Alice, came to stay at Ke-Xin's family home.</p>
        
            <p>"My cousin came, she's older than me, and her name is also Alice. And as the younger of the cousins, I felt obliged to change my name and she can keep Alice, and I'll go for something else."</p>
        
            <p>Ke-Xin turned to her main source of English culture at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"A Chinese book called Disney Princesses, I was very into princesses and Barbies at that time, to look for English names that suit my style.</p>
        
            <p>"In Chinese, we don't call the Disney princesses by Belle or Ariel or Aurora. We call them Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty or the Little Mermaid, and the name I choose for myself, I had no idea what it means was Sleeping Beauty.</p>
        
            <p>"That was my name, and no one felt that was a weird name. I didn't know Sleeping Beauty's name is Aurora."</p>
        
            <p>Ke-Xin was Sleeping Beauty for a year and a half, until the family moved to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Both my parents and me realised how embarrassing Sleeping Beauty is as a name, like one of those rare, weird English logos that you see in China.</p>
        
            <p>"On my first day to school, my mum said, was sitting with me in the car, and she's told me so it's your first day to school, you need a proper English name."</p>
        
            <p>Her mother suggested Lina.</p>
        
            <p>"I was quite attached to Lina at the beginning. I remember when some of my classmates spelt Lina wrong, they spell it Lena instead of Lina, I was quite disappointed."</p>
        
            <p>As time went by, she became detached from the name, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In class activities we will share about the history of our names and my classmates would tell me their name is Bill because one of their grandparents is Bill.</p>
        
            <p>"They inherited that name ... and then my name was just the idea my mum came up with in the car, sounds quite disappointing and not interesting at all."</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, she started to re-engage with her Chinese culture, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the beginning, I think I tried to really learn the Kiwi way of living. But later on, I discovered my natural instinct, I really admire the Chinese arts and culture side of things.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, I started to learn more about the heritage, the meaning behind my name, I want to have a name that has a story to tell, that has a meaning, which is what my Chinese name is, it has a story behind it."</p>
        
            <p>After year 13, she made a fresh start, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I started teaching people to pronounce my Chinese name. That's how I started."</p>
        
            <p>People are generally keen to get the pronunciation correct, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My biggest challenge was getting comfortable with teaching and correcting people. I initially will say something along the lines of my name is Ke-Xin, but it's very hard to pronounce. So, you can do whatever way you want to do it, and then I'll answer it.</p>
        
            <p>"But slowly I learned, especially in New Zealand, I think we have such a diverse culture. People are very open to learning new sounds."</p>
        
            <p>Not so much ordering in Starbucks, however.</p>
        
            <p>"I had early regrets when I ordered Starbucks and people called me Kevin!"</p>
