            <p>Six years after throat surgery damaged his vocal cords, speaking doesn't come easy to New Zealand jazz icon Nathan Haines. </p>
        
            <p>These days Haines says his most effective instrument for "getting emotion across" is his beloved saxophone.</p>
        
            <p>"I put the horn in my mouth, it just blows out. It's like I've got a fountain of music coming out of the end of my horn," he tells Charlotte Ryan. </p>
        
            <p>At 52, Haines says he no longer makes music "from a place of ego" and the songs on his new album Notes are truthful and unfiltered.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not John Coltrane and I never will be. I can only be myself and I can only play my life and my story." </p>
        
            <p> This audio is not downloadable due to copyright restrictions. </p>
        
            <p>Notes - which is Haines' 11th album - was coproduced by his "very, very special" friend and collaborator Phil Asher, a British DJ and music producer who died in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He's amazed that DJs still play tracks from Sound Travels and Squire For Hire - the two pioneering jazz-fusion albums Haines made with Asher in London in the early 2000s.</p>
        
            <p>Back then, the pair wanted to make music that they felt was "timeless", Haines says, and many people have told him they succeeded.</p>
        
            <p>After Squire For Hire was completed in 2003, he and Asher stayed friends. In 2017, after Haines was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and had a large tumour removed from his throat, Asher called from London to check on him every day. </p>

            <p>In 2018, after multiple radiotherapy sessions and follow-up operations, Haines announced he was cancer-free.</p>
        
            <p>In the years that followed, he and Asher - "an incredible beat-maker" - started making music again with the goal of putting "a new slant" on their earlier sound.</p>
        
            <p>But before the album that became Notes was anywhere near finished, Asher died at 55 after suffering a heart attack in his sleep.</p>
        
            <p>At 52, despite the loss of his dear friend and some physical capacities, Haines feels like he's right now at the peak of his creative powers.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm playing and feeling better than I've ever felt my life. Seriously, I'm so in touch with my creativity and as a musician, There's no doubt in my mind… It's just very true for me. There's no filter."</p>
        
            <p>After years of performing, addiction and cancer treatment, he feels like a totally different person to the young man who released the hit debut album Shift Left in 1995 - and there's still more evolution to come.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a life and music and it just keeps on going. I'm just amazed I'm still here talking to you."</p>
