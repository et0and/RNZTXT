        <p>
Begin by taking a moment to think about if your item really needs to be washed or if it can be spot-cleaned instead.

            <p>While winter clothing items such as puffer jackets, Oodies, and ugg boots do a great job of keeping us warm, cleaning them is a little tricker than throwing into the washing machine.</p>
        
            <p>Often these clothing items are an investment, especially when made from natural insulators like down and sheepskin.</p>
        
            <p>To keep them looking good for many seasons to come, we've got some simple cleaning tips that don't involve a dry-cleaner.</p>
        
            <p>Take a moment to think about if your item really needs to be washed or if it can be spot-cleaned instead, Taylor Brydges from the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures said.</p>
        
            <p>The Canadian-born researcher - who is well-acquainted with winter clothing - looks at sustainable production and consumption in the fashion industry.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Brydges said many of us wash our clothes more than we need to, reducing their longevity by putting them through washing machines and dryers.</p>
        
            <p>"Does an item need to be put in the wash because it's got one little stain on it?"</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes our clothes just need a little refresh, Dr Brydges said, which depending on the fabric can be done with a hand-held steamer, or hanging in the sun on a windy day to air out and deodorise.</p>
        
            <p>It's important to check the label and follow the instructions if you want to have your jacket for years to come, Dr Brydges said.</p>
        
            <p>Some key things to remember for cleaning puffer jackets:</p>
        
            <p>If your jacket has down, there are a few extra things to know, including using a down-specific detergent (if you can) and skipping the spin cycle to avoid damage to the feathers.</p>
        
            <p>If all of this makes you nervous, you can hand-wash a puffer jacket in the sink or bathtub.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Brydges said most of the time we could get away with spot cleaning to avoid frequent machine washing.</p>
        
            <p>"The cuffs and around the neckâ€¦ you can get away with spot cleaning [those areas] during the season, and then doing that proper wash cycle at the end of the season before packing away."</p>
        
            <p>Air drying will take some time (up to two days depending on the climate) and many brands recommend either hanging the jacket on a coat hanger or laying it flat on a drying rack in a dry, cool space - and intermittently "fluffing" it up with your hands.</p>
        
            <p>If putting your jacket in the dryer, ensure to use a low setting, and add tennis balls to help restore the "puff".</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to cleaning ugg boots, those made with sheepskin can be temperamental.</p>
        
            <p>Washing them in the machine can knot the wool, discolour the suede, and remove the natural lanolin that keeps them soft.</p>
        
            <p>For that reason, spot cleaning is preferred for sheepskin uggs.</p>
        
            <p>Brands may have their own specific instructions, but some general tips include:</p>
        
            <p>And did you know you should not wear socks with your uggs? Dr Brydges said it stopped the sheepskin from "doing its thing", which was to regulate the temperature and stop your feet from sweating.</p>
        
            <p>"Wearing socks will inhibit that breathability and that will trap moisture - and that's when they start to smell," she said.</p>
        
            <p>If the slippers are cotton or a synthetic fibre, they are safe to be washed in your machine in cold water on a gentle cycle.</p>
        
            <p>Most dressing gowns, onesies, and Oodies and are safe to wash in your machine, but if they include natural fibres like wool or silk, you will want to use gentle detergents.</p>
        
            <p>For preserving "fluffiness", hand washing is best, and some brands recommend avoiding using a dryer.</p>

Drying heavy items in winter without a dryer can be tricky.

            <p>Drying heavy items in winter without a dryer can be tricky, but we've got some advice for that too.</p>
        
            <p>Again, spot washing is your best friend, Dr Brydges said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are only wearing it around home, you're probably not sweating in it a whole lot.</p>
        
            <p>"You might be spilling food, but you're not doing hard labour in these items."</p>
