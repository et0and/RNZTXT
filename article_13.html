        <h2>Wellington's mayor stakes job on new Golden Mile</h2>
        <p>
The council has released the final design, and Tory Whanau admits the project could end up costing her the mayoralty.
</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's mayor admits a controversial revamp of Courtenay Place could cost her the mayoralty, but says it's so important she's pushing on anyway.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington City Council has revealed the final design for the Golden Mile upgrade on Courtenay Place.</p>
        
            <p>But a contractor for the majority of the project is yet to be signed on.</p>
        
            <p>As RNZ reported earlier this week, the council confirmed construction would begin on the Courtenay Place element of it in April, with the work expected to take two years.</p>
        
            <p>The council also confirmed it would cost $116 million, which included funding from NZTA Waka Kotahi.</p>
        
            <p>It would see cars banned during from 7am to 7pm between Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place, along with widened footpaths and a cycle lane.</p>

            <p>Work would begin first at the intersection of Cambridge and Kent Terraces, with that work expected to take eight months before moving to Courtenay Place.</p>
        
            <p>While a contract had been signed with Brian Perry Civil for the intersection construction, negotiations were still ongoing for an agreement on the Courtenay Place works.</p>
        
            <p>The council could not say when they expected to reach a contract agreement for the rest of the project.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau was confident that while the negotiations were still underway, there would not be future delays.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we have got spades in the ground that basically gives it momentum for everything to keep going."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau noted that former Dunedin Mayor Aaron Hawkins was voted out of office after his council put forward similar changes to the city's George Street.</p>
        
            <p>She said the construction for the Golden Mile upgrade happening while local body elections were underway was a risk to her second bid for the mayorlty.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe in this project so much I will accept whatever happens at the election."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Whanau told RNZ she sympathised with businesses in the Golden Mile that would find the construction of it tough, particularly during difficult economic conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We are still working with them [businesses] to develop a business support package which could be access to grants, help with marketing, street signage to help bring people to their stores."</p>
        
            <p>She said the project will be rolled out section by section down Courtenay Place.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said they had looked at delaying it further due to the current economic climate, but they found that the move would end up costing more.</p>
        
            <p>She could not say whether businesses would shut down as a result of the project.</p>

            <p>The project will remove cars from Courtenay Place during the day, widen foot paths, create a cycle lane down the road and improve lighting.</p>
        
            <p>It will also see the street lined with new anti-slip pavement, new greenery, while also replacing any old water pipes that are sitting under the throughfare.</p>
        
            <p>The design of Golden Mile uprgade has been created in partnership with mana whenua and features ngā ūranga - interactive sculptures where people can sit, share food or use as a performance area.</p>
        
            <p>The Lambton Quay part of the project is not expected to start for at least three years, due to Courtenay Place being priortised by councillors.</p>

            <p>The Golden Mile upgrade was part of the Let's Get Wellington Moving transport plan, a joint intiative which started in 2016 between Wellington City Council, Greater Wellington Regional Council and NZTA Waka Kotahi.</p>
        
            <p>On 17 December 2023, the government and the two councils agreed to disestablish the plan.</p>
        
            <p>As part of this agreement, the central government would build and fund the Basin Reserve upgrade and second Mt Victoria tunnel while Wellington City Council brought the Golden Mile project in-house.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA would still fund 51 percent of the Golden Mile.</p>
        
            <p>The project had been controversial among some councillors, residents and some of the business community.</p>

            <p>There was strong opposition to the project by some when the project was voted into the council's latest long term plan.</p>
        
            <p>The government had also been unhappy at times with the council's handling of the project.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ revealed in April last year that the then-Transport and Infrastructure Ministers wrote a 'please explain' letter to the council raising concern about a lack of consultation with local businesses.</p>
