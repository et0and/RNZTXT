            <p>A Brisbane woman has been charged for allegedly facilitating a "black flight" loaded with 71.5 kilograms of methamphetamine from Papua New Guinea (PNG) to Australia in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>The woman, 41, the owner and director of a logistics company in PNG, appeared before the Brisbane Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>She was denied bail and will reappear in court on 1 March, the Australian Federal Police (AFP), New South Wales Police Force, Queensland Police Service, Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary said in a joint statement.</p>
        
            <p>AFP officers executed a search warrant at the woman's home on Tuesday, with officers seizing electronic devices and financial records.</p>
        
            <p>The woman has been charged with one count of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine and one count of dealing with proceeds of crime, money or property worth AU$10,000 or more.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the arrest of six men in Australia and eight people in Papua New Guinea last March, who are alleged to be members of a trans-national organised crime syndicate.</p>
        
            <p>The joint statement said arrests occurred after authorities intercepted the flight, destined for New South Wales, when it landed in rural Queensland to re-fuel after travelling from Bulolo, a district in Morobe Province in PNG.</p>
        
            <p>The plane allegedly concealed five duffle bags of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>The AFP allege the Brisbane woman "actively facilitated the drug importation".</p>
        
            <p>"This includes allegedly storing the methamphetamine prior to the importation, buying bags for its transportation, and paying for the fuel and runway in Bulolo used for the black flight."</p>
        
            <p>AFP Commander Investigations Eastern Command, Kate Ferry, said criminals go to great lengths to get drugs into Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Methamphetamine is an insidious drug that has ripple effects on the user, their loved ones and the wider community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This importation had an estimated street value of more than $15 million."</p>
        
            <p>Police executed a search warrant on the woman's Brisbane property in March 2023 after the arrests.</p>
        
            <p>The joint statement said enquiries revealed methamphetamine had been stored at a commercial premises operated by the woman in PNG prior to the flight.</p>
        
            <p>"The AFP will allege the woman, who is the owner and director of a logistics company in PNG, actively facilitated the drug importation.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes allegedly storing the methamphetamine prior to the importation, buying bags for its transportation, and paying for the fuel and runway in Bulolo used for the black flight."</p>
        
            <p>Investigations into how the drugs entered PNG remain ongoing.</p>
