            <p>To mark the anniversary of The Beatles NZ tour 60 years ago we are broadcasting a rare recording of John Lennon.  </p>
        
            <p>The interview was conducted by Professor Tony Taylor, who at the time had a huge interest in the phenomenon of Beatlemania. Tony’s first attempt to capture the Beatles didn’t record due to equipment failure, but miraculously he got a second chance, sitting down with John Lennon the day after their two Wellington performances. Despite Tony’s nerves, he managed to get candid chat and great insights. </p>
        
            <p>Special thanks to Tony’s family for their blessing to broadcast their father’s interview. Thanks also to Andy Neill and John Baker for facilitating the audio. </p>
