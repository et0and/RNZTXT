            <p>There were no illicit substances or methanol found in the ingredients and liquor samples taken from a suspected alcohol poisoning incident at a luxury resort in Fiji's Coral Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The country's Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister and deputy Prime Minister Viliame Gavoka revealed the findings of the toxicology test conducted by the Fiji Police Force on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people - six tourists and one local - had been drinking piña coladas at the 5-star Warwick Fiji before they fell ill and ended in hospital for critical care over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Gavoka said his ministry had been working closely with other stakeholders to determine the cause of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>He added all of the affected people have been discharged, have fully recovered, and have returned home.</p>
        
            <p>"No tourist wanted to end their holiday in illness and we are sorry that their holiday ended on such a note," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Gavoka said the findings, which ruled out alcohol poisoning, were reassuring and offered good news for Fiji which is heavily reliant on international tourism to drive its economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Fijians host the highest standards when it comes to food, beverages, and overall safety. The health and wellbeing of our visitors remain our top priority."</p>
        
            <p>He said the report also reassures the global community about the safety of the destination.</p>
        
            <p>Health Secretary Dr Jemesa Tudravu said investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>He said symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and neurological issues could be because of various factors, including infections.</p>
        
            <p>Tudravu said further investigations are ongoing to get the definitive cause.</p>
