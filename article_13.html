            <p>TVNZ broadcaster Hayley Holt has given birth to her second son, Kingston.</p>
        
            <p>The sports presenter shared pictures of Kingston Kawenata Tito-Holt being held by big brother Raven James on social media on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Our latest blessing," she wrote, tagging partner Josh Tito.</p>
        
            <p>Holt announced she and Tito were expecting their second child back in February. First born, Raven, turns two in July.</p>

            <p>In October the following year Holt host spoke to Capsule about the heartbreaking loss.</p>
        
            <p>During that interview she revealed she had also miscarried at the start of 2021: "That was hard. It triggered a lot of those feelings about Frankie but, in a weird way, it also got me past that stage of grief that I was stuck in."</p>
        
            <p>"It gave me another experience that was separate from Frankie; it made me realise that things do continue, they do go on. It gave me a slight separation from that experience with Frankie. It kick-started some more healing. But it was very hard at the time."</p>
        
            <p>Holt wrote about her experience with losing Frankie in her memoir Second Chances: Facing my demons and finding a better me, released in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The memoir also unpacked the star's off-air reliance on alcohol and journey to sobriety, revealing she had joined Alcoholics Anonymous at one point.</p>
