            <p>There is a silent breeze of confidence flowing through the Tonga XIII rugby league team camp.</p>
        
            <p>Fans who turned up outside the main Mount Smart Stadium on Wednesday were treated to a short show of that when young Siua Young took his tee shirt off and clad the Tongan flag on his chest.</p>
        
            <p>Head coach Kristian Woolf said the side, better known as Mate Ma'a Tonga, are ready to tackle the Kiwis in Saturday night's Pacific Cup decider.</p>
        
            <p>Woolf said he is happy with what he has seen, going into their first game against the Kangaroos, which they lost 18-0 and then getting ready for the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really happy with the group," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They came in fit, they came in hungry and trained really well, prepared really well.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought that way as well, although we didn't take some of our opportunities, I thought they showed in some of our efforts, they are proud to represent Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>"We've come the same way this week, they've trained well, they have some energy and we are in a good spot."</p>

            <p>Having watched the Kiwis against the Kangaroos last weekend, Woolf said he respects the home side and knows star playmaker Shaun Johnson will be a threat.</p>
        
            <p>But he is confident the Tongans will hold their own in the game.</p>
        
            <p>"They are a class side, we watched their game against Australia closely, obviously and they were right in the contest," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were physical and play with line speed. They have a great kicking game, and a great organiser in Shaun Johnson as well.</p>
        
            <p>"So there are some threats there that makes them a real dangerous side and we know we will have to do our best if we are to get the results we want.</p>
        
            <p>"As I said before we are confident that we can better our last performance."</p>
        
            <p>The longtime Tonga coach has named Young, the Roosters centre, as the only change in the team that went down to the Australians.</p>
        
            <p>Young said he was excited and looking forward to doing his bit.</p>
        
            <p>He also expressed confidence in the team, saying they just need to focus on what they have to do.</p>
        
            <p>"Very excited and every time I get to don the Mate Ma'a Tonga jersey it's always a great experience for me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm keen to get ripping again this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kiwis are obviously are a good side but the team we have this year have alot of experienced players and hopefully they get the same style they've played club level this year into Mate Ma'a Tonga."</p>

            <p>Kiwi playmaker Shaun Johnson said he knows the Tongans will be physical, and he is focusing on his own game and playing well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really good," he said of the team's preparation, a week out of losing to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously we had a tough game just a few days ago and recovered really well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a tough game for us. I know we have to front up but it is a challenge we are looking forward to."</p>
        
            <p>Tongan fans Pepe Sanft and Vaioleti Muller say they will be at Mount Smart Stadium on Saturday night to cheer for the side.</p>
        
            <p>They were part of the crowd at the fan event on Wedbesday.</p>
        
            <p>They said Mate Ma'a Tonga fans will support the Tonga XIII on Saturday, win or lose.</p>

            <p>"We are big fans of Tonga and we invite all Tongans to come and support our team," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank them for representing our country. Go Tonga, MMT baby."</p>
        
            <p>The two teams do battle at 8.05pm, in front of what is expected to be a sell-out Mount Smart Stadium crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Both teams will be looking for a win to join Australia in the final and also avoid the promotion-relegation series.</p>
        
            <p>The loser will meet the winner of the Pacific Bowls Championship, which is likely to be the PNG Kumuls.</p>
