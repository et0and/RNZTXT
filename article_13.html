            <p>Miramar residents who live close to the spot where a man was found unresponsive overnight Sunday say they heard car alarms going off that night.</p>
        
            <p>Police said on Tuesday the man, who was taken to hospital in a critical condition, had died.</p>
        
            <p>They are also investigating whether the man's death is linked to a home invasion that occurred nearby before the man was discovered.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday morning, police were again visiting residents in the area and taking accounts and details to piece together what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Residents told RNZ they had been woken by car alarms going off in the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>"All of us woke up twice from car alarms, we didn't think to much of it to be honest," Rosa Allison said.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't go outside for while but when I did I saw the the chalk and tape.</p>
        
            <p>"My first thoughts was that it was a film set."</p>

            <p>Another resident, who did not want to be named, said they were taking more caution after the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"We are freaked out that this has happened close by," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were talking to the neighbour about setting up joint CCTV.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Mirimar community member Ryan Street told RNZ that recent events had left residents "concerned about safety".</p>
        
            <p>Street claimed there had been an increase of crime in Miramar in the last few years, including burglaries and car theft.</p>
        
            <p>Police data covering early 2021 to the end of January 2025 shows no increase in reported crime in the suburb, appearing to indicate a slight downward trend.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted to bring agencies such as Wellington City Council and police together to meet with residents and provide support.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said it would be happy to attend the community-led meeting.</p>
        
            <p>It said it already works with the Miramar community regularly to address safety concerns, primarily in the shopping centre area.</p>
