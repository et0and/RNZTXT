            <p>A Taranaki woman has broken the world bench press record.</p>
        
            <p>At the weekend, Ashleigh Hoeta bench-pressed 317.5kg - the equivalent of 154 two-litre bottles of milk.</p>
        
            <p>She told First Up that her achievement still had not sunk in and she did not "know if it ever will".</p>
        
            <p>"It's still crazy to hear it out loud, to be honest... But we're just going to keep continuing to see how far we can push it."</p>
        
            <p>First Up presenter Nathan Rarere described the video, which showed her all set up for the attempt with someone yelling "right in [her] face".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't really hear any of that going on. I am so in zone with what I'm meant to be doing that it just feels like I'm doing it on my own and no one else is in the room.</p>
        
            <p>"But after I've done it and everyone's running up to me, it is a really incredible moment."</p>
        
            <p>The previous world record was 294.8kg. Hoeta said she only started to seriously consider the attempt around March, when she lifted 265kg.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought, 'I'm actually sixth in the world after four months of doing this for a bit of fun. I think I can actually become the first woman in the world to hit 300kg.</p>
        
            <p>"So whenever I set myself a goal in mind, I have to get it. It's a very good moment in my mind."</p>
        
            <p>Hoeta was also an arm-wrestling champion, and said the two disciplines were "sometimes" complementary.</p>
        
            <p>"Arm wrestling takes all the little tendons, and every little thing that you don't usually feel with just doing bench... Sometimes your arms are a bit sore but it yeah, it works!"</p>
        
            <p>Hoeta started power lifting in 2020 at her father's encouragement. "But I was like, no, because I feel like it's male-dominant, and women don't lift weights type of thing."</p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless, she decided to "give it a go" and when she won her first competition she saw her normally "very non-emotional" father "cry for the first time in my life".</p>
        
            <p>This inspired Hoeta to "take this to the top".</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, she became the top female power lifter in New Zealand. A year later, she became the female arm wrestling champion, before hitting her "all-time goal" this year.</p>
        
            <p>Hoeta had tried other weightlifting disciplines but had injured herself dead lifting 270kg in March so for now was going to focus on bench press.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe in the future I might wander off and see what other world records are out there."</p>
        
            <p>Hoeta was aiming to hit 350kg next May, before progressing to 400kg within two to three years.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged anyone interested in power lifting to find an experienced coach.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially if you're a woman, just know that everyone starts at a starting point. I started off three years ago at a 30kg bench and you know, to have increased it that much ... there's always just a starting point. Just give it a go and have fun!"</p>
