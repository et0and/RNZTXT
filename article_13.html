            <p>Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa could face another leadership challenge this week after a second motion of no confidence was submitted against her, just one week after she survived a no-confidence vote.</p>
        
            <p>Fiame defeated the no-confidence vote, 34-15, last Tuesday, which was moved by the Human Rights Protection Party leader Tuilaepa Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.</p>
        
            <p>The Samoan parliamentary office has confirmed to RNZ Pacific that the new no-confidence motion was submitted by the FAST Party chairman La'auli Leuatea Schmidt.</p>
        
            <p>La'auli, alongside several FAST ministers, was removed by Fiame from her Cabinet, creating a major split within the ruling party.</p>
        
            <p>This subsequently resulted in Fiame being expelled from FAST and forced to lead a minority government.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, La'auli and the FAST MPs voted alongside Fiame against Tuilaepa's motion.</p>
        
            <p>However, he now wants Fiame, Samoa's first female prime minister, ousted, saying there are other capable leaders who could take over the prime minister's role.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always a better man," he was quoted as saying by the Samoa Observer.</p>
        
            <p>"We might believe there are no qualified or experienced individuals to step into those top roles, but that's not the case. There's always someone more capable for the job-someone chosen by God."</p>
        
            <p>"We will not retreat simply because she is a woman or due to the respect we have for women," he said.</p>
        
            <p>La'auli told the newspaper that the 29 FAST MPs had voted with Fiame last week because there were important amendments to the Constitution and Electoral Act that needed to be passed.</p>
        
            <p>"The political landscape in Samoa remains uncertain as both sides brace for a critical showdown in parliament," the Samoa Observer said.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Speaker Papaliʻi Liʻo Oloipola Taeu Masipau delayed the no-confidence motion against Fiame until Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Papaliʻi said there was no need to go backward when discussing the motion.</p>
        
            <p>However, Fiame wanted the motion proceed so that parliament could continue with its parliament business.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition leader Tuilaepa agreed with Fiame, stating that parliamentary business should not continue until the motion is addressed.</p>
