            <p>Caught by the Tides, which captures significant changes in Chinese society in footage shot over more than two decades in a non-linear fashion, was selected for the main competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival.</p>
        
            <p>The Palme d'Or nominee is assembled from 22 years of footage from Jia's previous work. It is scheduled for release in China over 22 days from 22 November.</p>
        
            <p>The film follows a working-class woman named Qiao Qiao (played by Zhao Tao) as she travels from a small northeastern Chinese town to find a former manager she was in a relationship with on a personal journey of growth, awakening and transformation.</p>
        
            <p>The 111-minute screening includes popular musical references from the past two decades.</p>
        
            <p>"We're thrilled that Caught by the Tides will be the opening film for the third New Zealand Chinese Film Festival," the organizer said, adding that they hoped the audience would find their own interpretation of it.</p>
        
            <p>A total of seven Chinese-language films will be showcased in cinemas at the festival through 24 November.</p>
        
            <p>All screenings offer Chinese and English subtitles, making them accessible to Mandarin and English-speaking audiences.</p>
        
            <p>Bo He, founder of the New Zealand Chinese Film Festival, has been promoting Chinese-language films for more than a decade.</p>
        
            <p>He, who is commonly called "Bobo" by those in the Chinese community, has long attempted to foster intercultural dialogue within the country's diverse communities through film.</p>

            <p>To this end, the 45-year-old has taken steps to enhance film quality and audience engagement at the festival.</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Sichuan province, the festival founder has been passionate about cinema since childhood.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was inspired by the way Caught by the Tides documents the reforms experienced by a generation of Chinese people over more than two decades.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout this period, the film touches on themes of family, homeland and immigration.</p>
        
            <p>With Zhao not given any spoken lines in the screenplay, the movie engages audiences in a silent dialogue across time and space.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] a glimpse of the world, a glimpse of the heart and endless reflection," He said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the first three years of the festival have been tough, with many working on a voluntary basis in a collaborative manner.</p>
        
            <p>Tian Gan is proud to oversee the festival's content selection, planning, and overall execution.</p>
        
            <p>Assembling titles that focus on certain themes is always a challenge, Gan said, but one she has embraced.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope to bring works to New Zealand that truly reflect the transformation and cultural essence of contemporary China, offering both Eastern and Western audiences a pure cinematic experience that transcends language and race," a blurb on the festival's official website written by Gan said.</p>
        
            <p>"When the ties of our shared human destiny extend, those moments of cultural understanding, fusion and universal love will naturally find each other."</p>

            <p>The titles selected for the festival have all been created from a woman's perspective or by female creators in line with this year's theme - "woman in flow".</p>

            <p>The Cord of Life was nominated for Best Asian Future Film at the 2022 Tokyo International Film Festival.</p>

At a life-and-death crossroads, she reconciles with the world in her own way through repeated cycles of hope and despair.</p>
        
            <p>The film is a landmark work in pioneering female-centered Chinese cinema. It won the Critics' Award for Best Screenplay at the 2020 Dublin International Film Festival and the annual Newcomer Award at the 2023 Shanghai Film Critics' Awards.</p>
