            <p>The Crown alleges a retired eye surgeon murdered his wife then staged the scene to make it look like her death was a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Philip John Polkinghorne, 71, has been charged with the murder of his wife, Pauline Hanna, who was found dead in the Remuera home she shared with her husband in April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne was charged 16 months after her death. He has pleaded not guilty to murder.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday morning in the Auckland High Court, he pleaded guilty to two other charges that had been suppressed until now - possession of the class A drug methamphetamine and possession of a pipe, at the time his wife died.</p>
        
            <p>The defence has disputed the Crown's claims, saying Hanna had her own mental health struggles but the couple had been "perfectly happy" together.</p>
        
            <p>In her opening address, Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock told the court Polkinghorne was living a double life and his marriage had deteriorated.</p>
        
            <p>She said he was spending large amounts of money on sex workers and had a methamphetamine habit that made him impulsive and at times, aggressive.</p>
        
            <p>"The Crown says the aspects of this double life that Dr Polkinghorne was leading were becoming harder and harder to keep from his wife," McClintock said.</p>
        
            <p>"A relationship that may at one time have been close and loving had completely fallen apart. Over the two years in particular, prior to Ms Hannah's death."</p>
        
            <p>McClintock said Polkinghorne had unusual sexual demands of his wife and his sex life was relevant to the trial - a sex worker he had formed a relationship with in Sydney, Madison Ashton, would give evidence.</p>

            <p>After his wife died, McClintock said Polkinghorne called police to report his wife's death as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>But she said the Crown alleged Polkinghorne strangled his wife then staged her death as self-harm.</p>
        
            <p>"He strangled her either with his hands, with a forearm, or with something soft or smooth around her neck," McClintock said.</p>
        
            <p>"He did so, perhaps whilst angry and high, or low, or just plain strung out on methamphetamine," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He staged the scene to make it look like his wife's death was a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>"It will sound shocking, like something out of a crime novel."</p>
        
            <p>In response to the Crown's address, Polkinghorne's lawyer Ron Mansfield KC said in his opening statement that Hanna had had previous suicide attempts, struggled with mental health, and her death was self-inflicted.</p>
        
            <p>He told the court "there is no pathology to support its theory of a homicide" and that the couple's sex life was open to the inclusion of others and it was not for others to "pry or judge".</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield said there was no double life and the couple's life was "perfectly happy" at the time of Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were getting along well and there was no argument between them.</p>
        
            <p>"They might have had sexual encounters together or separately outside of their relationship but he loved his wife."</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield said there were facets of Polkinghorne's lifestyle that many people might not like but that his wife was "okay with it".</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not a relationship marred by violence or control and that Polkinghorne's methamphetamine use was "casual".</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
