            <p>Christmas can be a hard time for many families struggling with the current cost-of-living crisis.</p>
        
            <p>But there are a number of New Zealand charities working hard to make sure they are still able to have a special day come 25 December.</p>
        
            <p>Here are some options for the public to pay it forward this Christmas, if in a position to do so.</p>
        
            <p>The Kindness Collective has been helping children have a special Christmas for 11 years, providing more than 42,000 children with presents.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, the Kindness Collective said more than 160,000 children in New Zealand were living in poverty and families were struggling "more than ever before".</p>
        
            <p>It had set up the Christmas Joy Store, providing "the gift of kindness and the dignity of choice".</p>
        
            <p>It allowed parents and caregivers to choose gifts and treats for their children off the shelf, for free.</p>
        
            <p>The Kindness Collective said a donation of $20 will get a child a toy, a donate of $50 will help fill the fridge and a donation of $100 includes pantry staples, treats, food for Christmas Day and three toys per child.</p>
        
            <p>Christmas Box helps deliver food essentials to more than 200,000 people every year across New Zealand, Australia and Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>It was aiming to pack 35,000 Christmas boxed for people in New Zealand and Cook Islands by 25 December.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, Christmas Box said Kiwi families were facing big challenges and many were struggling to make ends meet.</p>
        
            <p>It said a $40 donation could help people who need it most this Christmas, with 100 percent of donations going towards feeding families.</p>

            <p>Kmart's Wishing Tree Appeal is on again this year, with a number of different ways people can help support others at Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>People could donate gifts or give money in store. Kmart said the gifts do not have to be purchased from its store and it is better to keep them unwrapped.</p>
        
            <p>People could also donate online through its website.</p>
        
            <p>Kmart said gifts would be collected by the Salvation Army who would help give them to families in need.</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse is supporting a number of charities this year in the hopes of giving Kiwis in need a special Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, The Warehouse said Christmas was "undoubtedly a wonderful time of year, but it could also be a difficult time for Kiwi families living in hardship".</p>
        
            <p>Up until 24 December, shoppers at The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery and Noel Leeming could donate when making a purchase.</p>
        
            <p>"It's as easy as that," The Warehouse said.</p>

            <p>Variety said it "urgently" needed to get food on the tables of more than 12,800 children this Christmas, with more than 7000 still waiting.</p>
        
            <p>"More than 5000 letters have now been answered - but we still have a way to go for kid's like eight-year-old Isabell who might go hungry this year without your help," its website said.</p>
        
            <p>"Isabell never has special food, no matter what day of the year it is. Her mum, nana and three siblings are barely making ends meet, and by the end of the week, there's not enough food to go around. Instead, she colours in pictures of gingerbread men, a roast turkey and vegetables, and dreams of what it'd be like to eat a festive feast."</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public were able to donate to Variety's website to help get food on the table for Kiwis in need.</p>
        
            <p>It said a donation of $48 will give a child a day of "delicious food", $82 will give a family of two a day full of food, $194 will give a child a week of "tasty food" and $462 will feed a family of four over the week of Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Running since 2018, the Christmas Shoebox Project makes sure children around New Zealand receive a Christmas box filled with special and essential items.</p>
        
            <p>The boxes contain something to love, like a teddy bear or toy, something to read, like a book or magazine, something to wear, like a hat or pyjamas, something to play with, like a frisbee or skipping rope, something for school, like a pencil case or book, and something they need, like a toothbrush or shampoo.</p>
        
            <p>Its website said a $15 donation will contribute towards a Christmas Shoebox, a $75 donation will fill a box, a $150 donation will get two children a box each, and a $450 donation will give a whole family boxes filled with presents.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public can help feed a family this Christmas by donating to The Foodbank Project.</p>
        
            <p>"In our modern world, Christmas can bring increased pressure on already struggling families. For families who can barely afford to survive, Christmas can be a tipping point when they require assistance to put food on the table and provide gifts for the children," its website said.</p>
        
            <p>"Across New Zealand there are many more families who urgently need your support this Christmas. Little things can mean a lot to families."</p>
        
            <p>The Foodbank Project said a $30 donation could provide a small roast meal parcel, a $60 donation could provide a medium roast meal parcel, and a $90 donation could provide a large roast meal parcel.</p>

            <p>Kiwi Christmas Books helps children in need receive brand new books for Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that good books help to build good people, so each year, we put thousands of quality Kiwi books into the hands of tamariki and rangatahi whose families can't afford to buy their own, or who struggle to access quality literature in general," its website said.</p>
        
            <p>People could buy a book to donate and ship it to Kiwi Christmas Books' Auckland address, donate a book online and have it shipped to the charity or buy a $30 Books Xmas card to give to someone, while also giving a brand new book to a child in the process.</p>
        
            <p>Starship said Christmas is a special time for children - "they really are the heart of the season".</p>
        
            <p>It said the hospital helps get kids well enough to be home for Christmas, and it needed help from the public to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"For some children, Starship is where they need to be, even at Christmas, and your support helps us provide the world-class paediatric care these children urgently need."</p>
        
            <p>It said a donation of $50 could help fund play specialist support in Starship's radiology department, $100 could help its air ambulance bring children to the hospital for specialist emergency care, and $200 could help support research for children with respiratory conditions.</p>
