            <p>Hey, we all take shortcuts now and then. Scottish ultra-marathon runner Joasia Zakrzewski was banned for 12 months for using a car during a race. Zakrzewski blamed an injury and jetlag for her decision. She made her move at the 25-mile mark because she said she had gotten lost and her leg felt sore. This did not prevent her from accepting her trophy for third place.</p>

            <p>An absolute debacle in the bay. The Broncos vs Warriors at McLean Park saw more than 20 spectators try or succeed in running onto the pitch during the final quarter. The disruptions ended any hopes of a Warriors comeback as they went down 26-22. All 12 of the pitch invaders escaped fines and criminal charges because they had their clothes on.</p>

            <p>With 17 minutes left in the NgƒÅti Porou East Coast championship game in Wharekahika, Anton King went down with a broken leg. The match was halted as everyone waited for the ambulance to arrive. Due to the isolation of the area, cancelling the game was discussed. But King was not having that. He dragged himself off the field, allowing play to continue and allowing his team to go on and claim the title. It wasn't until after the post match celebrations that he sought medical treatment. Neymar, eat your heart out.</p>

            <p>Players at the 2023 US Open noticed a distinct stink wafting over the courts. The unmistakable aroma of marijuana clouded the concentration of one of the world's best in Maria Sakkari and halted proceedings until the air was cleared. Security footage was reviewed but no culprit within the stadium could be identified, though it's rumoured investigators were distracted by Doritos.</p>
        
            <p>Batsman Timed Out </p>
        
            <p>
Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews was left bemused by his dismissal against Bangladesh at the 2023 World Cup. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan triggered a heated debate on the spirit of cricket at this year's World Cup. As Mathews walked out to bat, the chinstrap on his helmet broke, Mathews waited for a new helmet to arrive before facing Shakib, but was adjudged 'timed out' after failing to take strike within the stipulated two minutes. Shakib did not withdraw his appeal to the disgust of many pundits. Others backed Shakib, claiming Mathews should know better as a veteran.

            <p>A protester disrupted the World Snooker Championship in April by climbing onto the table and throwing a bag of orange powder paint over the playing surface. The man was wearing a 'Just Stop Oil' t-shirt and leapt onto the table to empty a pack of orange powder paint on the green surface before being bundled away by security.</p>

            <p>It's a cricketing miracle on par with Grant Elliott's historic six and Ben Stokes' Ashes triumph. Club side Surfers Paradise had victory in their grasp against Mudgeeraba in the Gold Coast's Premier League Division Three. Chasing 179, they needed just five runs from the final over with six wickets in hand to win. Mudgeeraba captain Gareth Morgan had other ideas though, taking a staggering six wickets in six balls to seal the most incredible and unlikely of victories.</p>

            <p>The crossover the world didn't know it needed. Taylor Swift has become the face of the Kansas City Chiefs due to her relationship with tightend Travis Kelce. Though many of the core fans despise her presence at games, Swift has caused an increase of more than two million female viewers. She says she doesn't care how many "dads, Chads, and Brads" get upset. Shake it off lads.</p>

            <p>It was a bad year for Zane Robertson. The disgraced former New Zealand runner was arrested in Kenya in September after being found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. The 33-year-old had an AK-47 rifle and 23 rounds of ammunition at his house in Kenya. Earlier this year Robertson, a former New Zealand Olympian, was banned for eight years for taking a banned substance and providing false documentation.</p>
