            <p>A Levin resident says he doesn't care if the council fines him - he's not going to cut the grass on the berm outside his house.</p>
        
            <p>Some residents in the Horowhenua town were upset over a council decision to stop mowing berms as part of an effort to reduce costs.</p>
        
            <p>Levin resident John Murphy reckons he has the biggest berm in town and said he would let it grow in protest over the council's plan.</p>
        
            <p>His berm was bigger than his own yard, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He'd once been quoted $30 to mow his yard, and $50 to mow the berm space.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm letting it grow, if the council decides to bill me for it, it's going in the bin," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>He said some parts of the town were starting to look at bit straggly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a case of hit and miss whether someone's done their berm or not."</p>
        
            <p>Murphy said his concern was for the elderly, disabled, and low income people living in Levin.</p>
        
            <p>"They're maybe just managing to do their own but doing the berm maybe too much."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the daughter of a New Plymouth councillor is facing a hefty fine after a years-long battle with council over who is responsible for a massive pohutukawa outside her home.</p>
