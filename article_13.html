            <p>The 2024 Paris Olympic Games are officially underway, and New Zealand have made a victorious start.</p>
        
            <p>That's when they're not dealing with other nations spying on them.</p>
        
            <p>The Canadian women's football team has sent home two of its staff from the Olympics in Paris after a spying scandal involving the New Zealand women's team.</p>
        
            <p>Canada assistant coach Jasmine Mander and an analyst, Joseph Lombardi, have been removed from the team and sent home after Lombardi used a drone to spy on a Football Ferns training session in Saint Etienne.</p>
        
            <p>Lombardi reported directly to the assistant coach, Mander.</p>
        
            <p>Canadian head coach, Bev Priestman - who used to be the Head of Football at NZ Football - has also stood herself down for the opening game against New Zealand, she says "in the spirit of accountability".</p>
        
            <p>The two teams play each other tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, the OlyWhites men's football team started with a 2-1 win over Guinea, while the New Zealand Sevens men started with a 40-12 win over Japan, and a 17-5 triumph over South Africa to book a place in the quarterfinals.</p>
        
            <p>And in this episode, we help explain how some of the newer Olympic sports work.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Explainer Editor Katie Kenny talks through breaking, or break dancing for those who aren't cool and hip, as well as the second appearances for speed climbing, skateboarding, and surfing.</p>
