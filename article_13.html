            <p>Diet, stress management, supplements and hormone replacement can help women "buffer" themselves against the symptoms of menopause, holistic doctor Frances Pitsilis says.</p>
        
            <p>The Women's Wellness author told Saturday Morning that those experiencing negative symptoms should look at their lifestyle choices first.</p>
        
            <p>Her recommendations for optimum wellbeing included getting enough sleep, of exercise, managing stress and working out the right diet - which may be gluten- and dairy-free.</p>
        
            <p>It was also wise for people to train themselves not to grab sugary and starchy foods for a moment of relief, a dopamine hit or an energy boost.</p>
        
            <p>Energetically, those foods picked people up only to later dump them down, she said, and also kicked off an insulin surge in the body that could lead to weight gain.</p>
        
            <p>A protein-rich diet low in sugar and starch could keep energy levels up through the day and help women not gain too much weight over perimenopause and menopause.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommended taking a multivitamin that included methylated folic acid, fish oil and 1000mg of Vitamin C as a good daily "foundation".</p>
        
            <p>For women experiencing sleeplessness or hot flushes, the natural compounds magnesium citrate and magnesium glycinate could be helpful, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"[Magnesium] helps you hold on to your bladder so that you don't have to get up and have a pee, and then you wake up with more energy."</p>
        
            <p>Melatonin is another natural compound that could be an effective sleep aide, Pitsilis said, and as a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory it was also very good for the skin, especially hyperpigmentation.</p>
        
            <p>A GP could prescribe New Zealand-sourced melatonin, which was generally three times more potent than what was produced overseas, which could assist with a good night's sleep, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Around the time of menopause, the natural decline of the sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone in a woman's body could fuel hot flushes, night sweats, a dry vagina, insomnia, anxiety and depression, she said.</p>
        
            <p>If antidepressants and synthetic hormones proved unsuccessful in addressing those symptoms, and only if it was really necessary, Pitsilis recommended women explore hormone replacement therapy as the last line of defence.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from people who had gone through hormone-related cancer - including breast cancer - who must avoid HRT completely, Pitsilis said she had seen many women get great relief from their menopause symptoms after using HRT patches, which had been proven safer than pills.</p>
        
            <p>While the potential dangers of declining oestrogen got a lot of air time, a lack of progesterone could also contribute to sleep problems, anxiety and depression in women, she said.</p>
        
            <p>HRT could help to improve women's mood and cognitive function, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that oestrogen helps the brain a lot. Actually, all of the hormones help the brain. I've got patients who don't want to come off [HRT] because they've gone from not functioning very well to functioning really, really well."</p>
