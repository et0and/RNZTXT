        <h2>'I'm so blessed': Cricketer Chris Cairns walks into bar after spinal stroke</h2>
        <p>
The Black Caps all-rounder achieved many feats in his career, but the simple act of walking into a bar may be his greatest accomplishment to date.

            <p>Chris Cairns achieved many feats in his legendary cricket career, though the simple act of walking into a bar may well be his greatest accomplishment to date.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps legend suffered a spinal stroke following emergency heart surgery in 2021.</p>

            <p>Cairns spent 141 days in Canberra Hospital recovering and he required four open-heart surgeries.</p>
        
            <p>Five months later, he was diagnosed with bowel cancer.</p>
        
            <p>The stroke had left Cairns paralysed from the waist down and he has spent many agonising hours since learning how to walk again.</p>
        
            <p>He has shared his journey on social media which showed the countless hours of grind in recovery.</p>
        
            <p>The work has evidently paid off, as on Monday afternoon Cairns was filmed walking into a bar with the assistance of crutches and setting up at a leaner.</p>
        
            <p>"So a Kiwi walks into a pub (after two and a half f****** years!!!). Day 1 of many that lie ahead…what a team…I'm so blessed and cannot thank you all enough," the caption read.</p>
        
            <p>All of his posts are accompanied with the hashtag #notdoneyet.</p>
        
            <p>Comments have flooded in praising his commitment.</p>
        
            <p>"You are amazing," "this is magic to see," "what a superstar."</p>
        
            <p>Cairns played 62 tests, 215 one-day internationals and two Twenty20 matches for New Zealand between 1989-2006.</p>
        
            <p>His enigmatic style made him a beloved fan favourite.</p>
