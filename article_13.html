        <h2>February sport highlights: What's coming up</h2>
        <p>
We're already one month into 2024 and already plenty has happened in the sports world, Jamie Wall writes.

            <p>We're already one month into 2024 and already plenty has happened in the sports world. We've seen a couple of epic test cricket wins, the NZ Sevens programme seemingly disintegrate overnight, as well as the action of the NFL playoffs. Oh, and the All Blacks somehow found time to do a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>But we're into it now in February, with the action across a number of codes set to make it a month to remember. Here's what's coming up:</p>
        
            <p>NZ v South Africa</p>
        
            <p>Feb 4-8 - 1st test, Tauranga</p>
        
            <p>Feb 13-17 - 2nd test, Hamilton</p>

            <p>The Black Caps host South Africa in a two-test series starting in Tauranga this weekend, with the home side aiming to make history with a first ever series win over the Proteas. OK, it's not the visitors' top side, or arguably even their B side either, but the series will be interesting for how well the Black Caps can play themselves into form for the upcoming visit by Australia.</p>
        
            <p>What do the selectors do with Rachin Ravindra? Does he open or go in the middle order? Whatever happens, all eyes will be on the 24-year-old, who can stake a claim to being a major part of the Black Caps test side for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>Kansas City and San Francisco go head to head in the climax of a fascinating NFL season, as the Super Bowl takes place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Even if you know nothing about American Football, there's Taylor Swift in the stands and Usher performing at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>The 49ers go in as slight favourites over the defending champions, with an established run game and defence. The Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes, while the Niners have Brock Purdy in a tantalising quarterback match up, while Travis Kelce will be keen to get another victory kiss from Swift when the confetti starts falling.</p>
        
            <p>Tyson Fury v Oleksandr Usyk </p>
        
            <p>Feb 18 (NZT)</p>

            <p>The battle to find the first undisputed heavyweight world champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999 takes place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with Fury getting the trash talk going in the lead up. In a press conference this week he called the Ukrainian champion a "sausage" and an "ugly little man" as the hype builds, but it's unlikely Usyk is worried too much.</p>
        
            <p>This will be a huge fight between the two unbeaten heavyweights, with Usyk saying that he's had Fury on his radar ever since the Gypsy King dethroned Vladimir Klitchsko back in 2015. Fury is coming off a very unconvincing win against MMA star Francis Ngannou in an exhibition fight in October, meanwhile it'll be Usyk's first time back in the ring since August of last year when he scored a ninth round knockout of Daniel Dubois.</p>
        
            <p>NZ v Australia</p>
        
            <p>Feb 21 - 1st T20, Wellington, 7.10pm</p>
        
            <p>Feb 23 - 2nd T20, Auckland, 7.10pm</p>
        
            <p>Feb 25 - 3rd T20, Auckland, 1pm</p>

            <p>The red ball makes way for the white after the Proteas series, with Australia making their first visit to Aotearoa in eight years. It's also the first time since 2019 that the Black Caps will be playing tests against the Aussies, but first there's three T20s in front of what should be some bumper crowds at Sky Stadium and Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Anything can happen in T20s, especially on Eden Park's dubious boundaries so the Black Caps will be fancying their chances of an upset series win. The other talking point is whether Glenn 'The Big Show' Maxwell will add to his series of off field calamities while on our shores.</p>
        
            <p>Feb 23-25</p>
        
            <p>The season starts in Hamilton, where there's a replay of last year's final. The Chiefs welcome the Crusaders to FMG Stadium Waikato in a clash that will hopefully be laden with All Blacks, while the rest of the weekend has the Highlanders and Moana Pasifika in an intriguing battle - mainly because it might decide already who out of those two will miss the play-offs.</p>
        
            <p>Just how many All Blacks take part in the big games is one of the big talking points of this season before it's already begun, with Scott Robertson giving a pretty vague answer when pressed about it earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Warriors pre-season</p>
        
            <p>Feb 18 v Wests Tigers in Christchurch</p>
        
            <p>Feb 25 v Dolphins in Auckland</p>

            <p>The NRL doesn't start properly until mid-March, but Andrew Webster's side will have a couple of hit outs before the month is finished. While the results won't tell us much, how the combinations go certainly will - especially the reintroduction of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck into a Warriors jersey.</p>
        
            <p>RTS will line up at centre for the first time in his career, so the question is who out of Adam Pompey or Rocco Berry will he replace. Then there's a fight over the interchange spots, at the moment Dylan Walker is probably the only name that will be a definite due to his utility value.</p>
