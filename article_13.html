            <p>A man has been charged with the rape and sexual assault of a Virgin Airlines flight crew member during New Year's Eve celebrations in Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>Fijian Acting Police Commissioner Juki Fong confirmed to the ABC that a local suspect was in custody over the alleged attack, which occurred in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged victim, a 21-year-old Melbourne woman, was separated from the rest of her crew during a night out in Martintar, a popular entertainment district in Nadi.</p>
        
            <p>According to police records obtained by the ABC, she was allegedly assaulted on her way to her hotel.</p>
        
            <p>A second crew member was robbed and sustained facial injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police investigations into that separate incident continue.</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in court in Fiji's Western Division on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Previously a Virgin spokesperson said the airline was aware of the incident and "our focus is on the wellbeing of our team members affected".</p>
        
            <p>A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said they were aware of the incident but due to privacy obligations they could not comment further.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Minister Viliame Gavoka told the ABC that Fiji's cabinet was committed to "strengthen security" in Nadi.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the tourism police, what we discover now is that we need to revamp that unit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a heightened level of police presence can really help in this area.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen tourism grow from what it was back then to now, to almost a million visitors for a small country like Fiji â€¦ the challenge is there."</p>
        
            <p>Gavoka said Fiji was overall a "safe country", but one needed to exercise care in certain areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year, we reduced nightclub [opening] hours," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But when you're on holidays, you don't want to make too many rules, people are here to relax."</p>
        
            <p>He said the majority of the crew members headed home on Thursday and the remaining ones should have departed Fiji by Friday evening.</p>
