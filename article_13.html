            <p>Local musicians have expressed shock at the death of renowned Indian tabla player and multiple Grammy award-winner Zakir Hussain.</p>
        
            <p>"Zakir Hussain, one of the world's most transcendent musicians, passed away from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in San Francisco at the age of 73," Hussain's family said in a statement on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Hussain is survived by his wife, daughters and siblings.</p>
        
            <p>Son of legendary tabla master Ustad Allah Rakha, Hussain was widely regarded as one of the greatest tabla players of his generation.</p>
        
            <p>He is credited for introducing the tabla percussion instrument to global audiences in a career that spanned six decades.</p>
        
            <p>Born in 1951 in Mumbai, Hussain, who later moved to the US, became the first Indian musician to win three Grammy awards in the same year.</p>
        
            <p>His musical collaborations ranged from Indian icons such as Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and Shivkumar Sharma to Western musicians such as Yo-Yo Ma, Charles Lloyd, Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Mickey Hart, George Harrison and John McLaughlin.</p>
        
            <p>Hussain's family noted how he brought Indian classical music to an international audience, cementing his status as a global cultural ambassador.</p>
        
            <p>"Widely considered a chief architect of the contemporary world music movement ... Hussain's work raised his instrument to virtuoso status," the family said in its statement.</p>
        
            <p>Similar sentiments were echoed by musicians and artists in New Zealand, who called themselves "lucky" to be able to witness Hussain perform here in June at two well-attended concerts in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Basant Madhur of the Sargam School of Indian Music in West Auckland called Hussain an inspiration for tabla players around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"His passing has created a void in the world of music that will never be filled. [Hussain] brought Indian percussion into the limelight on the world stage," Madhur said. "With his death, we feel as if the world of music has lost its rhythm."</p>
        
            <p>Manjit Singh, who runs the Rhythm School of Indian Music in South Auckland, remembered Hussain's moving performances in New Zealand in June.</p>
        
            <p>"When [Hussain] performed on stage, it felt divine," Singh said. "The entire community of musicians in New Zealand, and the world over, are heartbroken."</p>
        
            <p>Gregory Booth, dean of arts at the University of Auckland who has known Hussain since 1977, described the musician as "inventive and creative".</p>
        
            <p>"He brought the tabla to the foreground," Booth said. "He was a prolific performer, doing hundreds of concerts in a year, and always looking to introduce newer audiences to Indian classical music."</p>
        
            <p>Hussain's contribution to world music was recognised by various accolades he received over the years, including the Kyoto Prize and the Aga Khan Award.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian government awarded Hussain the Padma Vibhushan - the country's second-highest civilian award - in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leader Rahul Gandhi both led the nation in paying tribute to the tabla maestro.</p>
        
            <p>Deeply saddened by the passing of a "true genius", Modi credited Hussain for "seamlessly blended Indian classical traditions with global music, thus becoming an icon of cultural unity".</p>
        
            <p>Gandhi noted how Hussain's legacy and contributions to world music "will always remain alive in our memories".</p>
        
            <p>The Hussain family's statement included a similar sentiment.</p>
        
            <p>"[Hussain's] work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians," the statement said. "He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time."</p>
