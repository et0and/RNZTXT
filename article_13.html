            <p>New Zealanders have commemorated World War II sinking of HMNZS Moa in Tulagi Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Personnel from three New Zealand Defence Force missions, and staff from the New Zealand High Commission in Honiara, were among those who paid their respects at Henderson Field memorial gardens.</p>
        
            <p>HMNZS Moa was one of three Royal New Zealand Navy Bird-class Minesweepers which were patrolling off the coast of Guadalcanal during World War II.</p>
        
            <p>On April 7, 1943, HMNZS Moa was hit directly by a Japanese dive bomber and sank bow-first in under four minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Five ratings from Moa were killed in the explosions, and seven were seriously injured.</p>
