            <p>Two out of three professional job applicants admit to applying for numerous roles out of frustration with their current employer, in what the industry calls rage-applying.</p>
        
            <p>The term rage-applying occurs when workers react to a bad day at work by firing out multiple applications for a new job.</p>
        
            <p>A survey of more than 2000 professional job applicants by recruitment specialist Robert Walters indicates more than half of them wanted to leave a toxic work culture, with 20 percent citing a lack of work life balance while 13 percent were concerned about an unmanageable workload.</p>
        
            <p>Just 3 percent said a disagreement with management led to them rage-applying in the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>The survey also found there was a 112 percent surge in job applications following Wellington public sector cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Robert Walters ANZ chief executive Shay Peters said the increase raised queries as to whether individuals were applying for positions out of frustration and apprehension, rather than genuine interest in the advertised roles.</p>
        
            <p>"It's rather intriguing to observe that this surge in job applications is not primarily motivated by factors such as salary or career advancement. Rather, it seems to stem from the work environment and policies, which lie entirely within the employer's control.</p>
        
            <p>"Identifying toxic workplace cultures isn't always a simple task, yet it can profoundly affect the mental wellbeing, morale, and creativity of employees."</p>
        
            <p>He said the company's research found an inspiring company culture was the number one thing that attracted professionals to a job advert - ahead of flexible work and enhanced benefits packages.</p>
        
            <p>"As we embrace the arrival of more Gen Z individuals into the workforce, it's crucial for employers to recognise that the priorities of employees are evolving.</p>
        
            <p>"While salaries may have once reigned supreme as the primary driving force, Gen Z is considerably more concerned about the office culture and working policies."</p>
