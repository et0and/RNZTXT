        <h2>Controversial $20 cookies spark flood of complaints</h2>
        <p>

            <p>For Sydney foodies with a sweet tooth, the chance to try treats from a famous cookie brand only sold in the US was too good to pass up.</p>
        
            <p>So, a pop-up store selling the cookies advertised on TikTok in Bondi over the weekend was met with long lines down the block.</p>
        
            <p>Many had high expectations for the treats, which were being sold for $AU17.50 ($NZ19.40) each.</p>
        
            <p>But soon, social media was flooded with complaints about the quality of the cookies and their high price.</p>
        
            <p>Then an even-more confusing story emerged: The pop-up was not approved or run by the US brand Crumbl, and the organisers has gone to unusual lengths to bring the product to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>It was the result of a group of people who flew to the US and purchased more than 800 of the cookies, spending more than $13,000 importing them for resale.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson for the pop-up, Toby, who declined to provide their last name when contacted by ABC News, said in a statement that the group had faced "considerable backlash" over the event but defended the pricing and process.</p>
        
            <p>So, how did we get here and who is behind the viral pop-up?</p>
        
            <p>In the week leading up to the sale, a TikTok and Instagram account began advertising that the cookies would be sold in Australia in a pop-up event.</p>
        
            <p>It featured professionally shot and edited posts of the cookies.</p>
        
            <p>But after the event, attention on social media turned to the high prices and 'staleness' of the cookies.</p>
        
            <p>Then, comments on these videos began to question the legitimacy of the pop-up.</p>
        
            <p>On one video, the founder of the US company, Sawyer Hemsley, commented that the pop-up was not affiliated with their firm and that the cookies were only available for purchase in the US and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney student Sofia Qistine planned to go with her friend after seeing the pop-up advertised on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>But a few days prior, she said she realised the pop-up wasn't an official event.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it was deceptive because in the beginning I genuinely thought it was (them), until I did a deep dive into the comments on videos that said it wasn't an official event," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the beginning they never stated it wasn't Crumbl, they only said that when people started questioning the authenticity of the pop-up, which I thought was strange."</p>
        
            <p>Qistine and her friend decided to go anyway but were disappointed by the taste of the cookie and the price.</p>

            <p>"No-one prior to the pop-up knew what the price would be and as a cookie enthusiast I knew (these) cookies in Sydney go for almost $11 sometimes, but $17.50 was a big shock to me and my friend," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the cookie I ate was OK, but my friend's was terrible and I don't think it should have been sold.</p>
        
            <p>"They seemed old, the texture was dried up."</p>
        
            <p>Toby confirmed the pop-up clearly stated it was not officially endorsed.</p>
        
            <p>The US company has not responded to ABC's request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The people behind the Sydney account have since deleted all TikToks and provided a link to a statement on the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Customers who were genuinely interested watched the full video or read the comments and bio, where we clearly stated, 'Not endorsed by Crumbl' or 'Not official Crumbl'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of our customers were satisfied with their purchase.</p>
        
            <p>"We received over 15 positive messages and only one complaint on the day, which was resolved with a full refund and return of the product."</p>
        
            <p>According to the pop-up's spokesperson, organisers flew to the US to purchase the cookies and brought them back to Australia for sale.</p>

            <p>"The cookies were picked up late Tuesday (Sydney time) and kept refrigerated until Sunday midday when they were sold," said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is in line with (the makers') recommendations."</p>
        
            <p>He said the process also explained the high prices of the cookies, which sell for $US4.99 ($AU7.25).</p>
        
            <p>"We had approximately 840 (240 of which were damaged)," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The logistics were particularly expensive as we had to book last-minute flights due to an unexpected flight issue."</p>
        
            <p>He said additional costs included import duties and taxes, customs brokerage fees, venues, microwaves, tables, marketing expenses and wages for staff on the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Our goal was to bring cookies to fans who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to try them," the statement read.</p>
        
            <p>"Our intention was not to generate substantial profit."</p>
        
            <p>Qistine said there was a mix of people at the event.</p>
        
            <p>Some, she said, knew it wasn't an official event and wanted to try the cookie anyway, and others had no idea.</p>
        
            <p>"There were kids in the line who had seen the videos and dragged their parents along," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Sydney group said they will not hold any more planned pop-ups due to "negative feedback".</p>
        
            <p>"If (the company) had reached out and expressed any concerns, we would have respected their wishes and halted future events - but they have not done so at this point."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said they believe they complied with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) guidelines on parallel imports.</p>
        
            <p>"Importing and reselling is called parallel imports," they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Parallel imports are legal and more information can be found on the ACCC website."</p>
        
            <p>They said they also legally followed customs laws to import the cookies.</p>
        
            <p>"We followed all legal procedures, declaring the cookies as commercial goods and obtaining the necessary approvals from Australian customs.</p>
        
            <p>"We've attached the customs entry (with sensitive information redacted) to confirm that everything was imported legally and cleared by Biosecurity."</p>
        
            <p>The ABC has contacted the ACCC for comment.</p>
