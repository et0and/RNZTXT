            <p>The Crown Research Institutes will be merged as part of sweeping changes to the science sector.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to staff seen by RNZ, the seven CRIs will become three mega science organisations - "Public Research Organisations" (PROs) - with a fourth established to focus on "advanced technology".</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was due to announce the changes in his State of the Nation speech from 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>The changes come after consideration of the long-awaited Science System Advisory Group's (SSAG) first report by Sir Peter Gluckman.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Research Organisations will be grouped by area of focus.</p>

            <p>Earth Science will see the NIWA and GNS Science merged, and NIWA's acquisition of MetService will continue as planned.</p>
        
            <p>AgResearch, Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, Plant & Food Research and Scion will also be pooled under Bioeconomy.</p>
        
            <p>Health and Forensic Science will be formed by re-purposing ESR.</p>
        
            <p>The changes are due to see the establishment of a fourth Public Research Organisation to focus on advanced technology.</p>

Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins says it's the biggest reset in the country's science sector in 30 years.

            <p>Callaghan Innovation would be disestablished, and its functions moved to other entities.</p>
        
            <p>Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins said it had simply been spread too thinly across too many functions, "leading to poor financial performance and an over-reliance on Crown funding".</p>
        
            <p>During a media briefing, Collins, who will hand the science portfolio to Shane Reti tomorrow, said the reforms would mark the largest reset of New Zealand's science system in more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>The changes would boost the economy and benefit the sector, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reform will maximise the value of the $1.2 billion of taxpayer money that we already put into the science sector each year, creating a much more dynamic science innovation and tech system."</p>
        
            <p>She also highlighted the government's plan to overturn New Zealand's "effective 30-year ban" on gene technology.</p>
        
            <p>"This will unleash enormous opportunities for our science sectors and also for New Zealanders - whether it's in the primary industry sector, health sector - and it's really going to be something that helps us on climate change issues as well.</p>
        
            <p>"So this government sees science, innovation, tech as a way to transform the economy and harness our country so that we are far better able to pay for all the things that we all want for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes that are announced today are extensive but they will ensure a system that generates maximum value for the economy and therefore for all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>She said the current Crown Research Institute chairpeople had already been looking at staffing and downsizing, and were all supportive of the move.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been knowing that they are going to have to right-size and they knew that there was change coming, so much so that every one of the Crown Research Institute chairs is supportive of what we're doing.</p>
        
            <p>"They're excited about this."</p>
        
            <p>She said the government had rejected the science system advisory group's recommendation to merge all the CRIs into a single body.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we know that people like to have a bit of competition, they like to be able to benchmark themselves against others, and we think it's a much better opportunity for them to be able to work together and to get some of those right-sizing."</p>
