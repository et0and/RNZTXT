            <p>While some of us can dry clothes and linen without a dryer in the warmer months, winter becomes a little tricker.</p>
        
            <p>"We discourage using a dryer because it uses so much energy, and drying is bad for your clothes; it wears them down," says Lish Fejer, a science communicator and ABC reporter in Ngambri/Canberra.</p>
        
            <p>She run The Fix It Chicks with co-creator Jenny Edwards, and the pair have been teaching their Instagram audience about cheap ways to wash and dry laundry.</p>
        
            <p>Read on for Lish's tips for drying clothes in winter.</p>
        
            <p>Lish said many of us are washing our clothes too often, so it was worth considering if an item needs washing at all.</p>
        
            <p>"Will airing it do instead? Will a spot wash do? Can I get another day out of it?</p>
        
            <p>"Usually the stuff like jeans and hoodies that take a long time to dry [can be skipped]."</p>
        
            <p>If the clothes can withstand it (avoid linens and silks, for example), Lish said to put them on a high-spin cycle in the washing machine, and repeat.</p>
        
            <p>"You can give drying a head start by spinning to get rid of as much water as possible."</p>
        
            <p>When you take your clothes out of the washing machine, roll them up in a clean, dry towel, Lish said, to remove excess moisture.</p>
        
            <p>Drying happens best outside, so if you have the space, take advantage, Lish said. A windy day was a bonus, as items will dry faster.</p>
        
            <p>"The classic Hills Hoist is gold-class clothes drying."</p>
        
            <p>If you're in an apartment, using the balcony is ideal - even if shady and cold.</p>
        
            <p>Lish said when using a clothing rack, make sure the clothing was spaced out well so air can circulate around each item. Using pegs means you won't have to fold the items over.</p>
        
            <p>"Look at any glass or window that is being hit by the sun - put your drying rack there, that will activate the drying process," Lish said.</p>
        
            <p>If heading out for the day, hang sheets and towels over chairs and tables.</p>
        
            <p>"I love a coat hanger; I hang shirts and them put them over door frames and architraves."</p>
        
            <p>If you have a hot water system in the cupboard, you could also fold clothes that are nearly dry and place them on top.</p>
        
            <p>"Be careful not to cover the pressure valve," warned Lish.</p>
        
            <p>Ventilation was important to minimise condensation and avoid mould.</p>
        
            <p>"Humidity in the house is a big one [if drying clothes indoors]," Lish said.</p>
        
            <p>"How do you get rid of that moisture in your house without it causing mould and mildew and the health effects that come with that?"</p>
        
            <p>She recommended opening a window to manage this.</p>
        
            <p>Some split-system air conditioners have a dehumidifying mode that doesn't cool or heat (and therefore costs less to run), Lish said.</p>
        
            <p>The extraction fan in your bathroom will be effective when drying in there.</p>
        
            <p>You can also increase air flow indoors by using a pedestal or ceiling fan which Lish said uses little energy and helps with evaporation.</p>
        
            <p>For small items, Lish lays them on a towel in the back of her car and parks it in the sun while at work.</p>
        
            <p>"You do have to occasionally go turn them over, and I leave the windows open a little."</p>
        
            <p>Lish said to throw in a clean, dry towel with your wet items.</p>
        
            <p>"That will significantly reduce the amount of time it needs to be on for as it absorbs some of the moisture."</p>
