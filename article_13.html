            <p>A red alert has been issued for Vanuatu's Tafea province due to tropical cyclone Seru, which is now a category 2 storm.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department said that as the system maintains a south-southwest direction, isolated heavy rainfall is expected throughout the Vanuatu group.</p>
        
            <p>There is also the possibility of flash flooding over low-lying areas, and areas close to river banks including coastal flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Rough to very rough seas with heavy to phenomenal swells are expected over central and southern waters.</p>
        
            <p>Damaging gale-force winds of 95km/h and increasing to 105km/h are expected within 25 nautical miles from the centre of the system and may affect Tafea province in the next six to 12 hours (from 3am Vanuatu time).</p>
        
            <p>The Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office advises that a yellow alert is in effect for Shefa province.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Tonga's Meteorological Service says tropical cyclone Rae has now been downgraded to a tropical depression.</p>
        
            <p>It said as the system leaves Tonga waters, associated clouds with heavy rain, thunderstorms and strong winds will continue to affect parts of the kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>In Fiji, schools across most of the country are re-opening on Wednesday, except for those in the Lau Group.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Aseri Radrodro said schools in the Northern Division, Lomaiviti, Western, Central Divisions, and Rotuma will be open as scheduled.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we urge parents to use their discretion when deciding whether to send their children to school, particularly in areas impacted by flooding or other hazards," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Fiji Government said tropical cyclone Rae has caused significant damage to the infrastructure in the Lau Group, including roads, bridges, and crossings, impacting the ability of students and teachers to access their schools.</p>
        
            <p>Several schools are also being used as evacuation centres.</p>
