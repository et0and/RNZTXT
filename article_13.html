            <p>Former news presenter Joanna Paul-Robie has revealed she has terminal cancer.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ's Matariki programme about receiving the Icon Award during the Ngā Tohu Toi awards on Thursday night, Robie described it as the "most honourable experience of my life".</p>
        
            <p>"I was so touched because this award means so much to me coming from Tauranga Moana.</p>
        
            <p>"But more importantly, because I am unfortunately dying, I have terminal cancer, and really to have this award before one posthumously gets it is an even better break."</p>
        
            <p>She said she received the award with her whānau at her side.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't tell you the lightness, the brightness, the feeling of aroha inside me last night."</p>
        
            <p>Paul-Robie began her career at Radio New Zealand, was a newsreader for TV3 and a programmes and production manager at Māori Television.</p>
        
            <p>Starting out as one of the few wāhine Māori on New Zealand's screens was tough, Robie said.</p>
        
            <p>"The newsroom was really, it was being run by mostly, a pair of middle-class middle-age white men who had the audacity and the balls to say 'if it bleeds, it leads', but these guys, you know, they had never been in a Māori world."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was her life's work to bring together her wāhine Māori side and her work as a broadcaster.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ hosts Justine Murray and Mihingarangi Forbes offered Robie their thanks.</p>
        
            <p>"As a young Māori reporter, at times you were the only wāhine Māori on our screens Joanna," Forbes said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to thank you for being a trailblazer, for kicking down those doors and leaving them wide open for people like me and Justine sitting here next to me," she said.</p>
