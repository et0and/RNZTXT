            <p>Blues Captain Patrick Tuipulotu has suffered a fractured jaw and is likely to be out of rugby for eight to ten weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-test lock suffered the injury late in the first half of the Blues opening pre-season win against Tokyo Sungoliath in Japan on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>He will return home for surgery and is likely to be sidelined for the first half of the Blues' Super Rugby Pacific campaign, which kicks off against Fijian Drua on the 24th February.</p>
        
            <p>Blues Head Coach Vern Cotter said he was feeling for his captain.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tough blow for Patrick, especially early on in the season," Cotter said.</p>
        
            <p>"We wish Paddy a speedy recovery knowing he'll still offer plenty to the group from a leadership perspective over the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a resilient group and we've got a strong stock of locks to call on while he recovers."</p>
        
            <p>Cotter said a decision on who will take over the Blues captaincy will be made in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues take on the Yokohama Canon Eagles in their second pre-season match on Saturday.</p>
