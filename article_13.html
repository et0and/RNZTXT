            <p>Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will face YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a fight that will be streamed by Netflix on 20 July at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.</p>
        
            <p>Tyson, who is regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, said it would be fun to take on Paul, who is 27 and has a 9-1 record with six knockouts.</p>
        
            <p>'Iron Mike', who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts, will be hoping to shake off the rust as he will be 58 when the fight takes place at the 80,000 seat arena.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul," Tyson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"He's grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a 'kid' can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT (Greatest Of All Time).</p>
        
            <p>"It's a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch, as I started him on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones and now I plan to finish him."</p>

            <p>Paul was on the undercard in 2020 when Tyson and Jones fought in an exhibition bout that was scored as a draw.</p>
        
            <p>"It's crazy to think that in my second pro fight I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson's undercard," Paul said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, less than four years later, I'm stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing's most notorious fighters and biggest icons."</p>
