            <p>"I much appreciated this chance to meet you and to have such a warm hug from most of you, very healing."</p>
        
            <p>Charles told the team he was split in his loyalties ahead of their game this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that you have great success... I'm trying to be as careful as possible."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns play England on Sunday New Zealand time.</p>
        
            <p>The Daily Express reported King Charles also gave a "rare health update" on the day.</p>
        
            <p>He told the World Champions that due to "doctors orders" he would not be travelling to New Zealand in his upcoming tour to Oceania.</p>
        
            <p>"I am extremely sorry I can't come to New Zealand in later October because of doctor's orders. But I hope there will be another excuse before too long," Charles said.</p>
        
            <p>"But in the meantime, give my love to New Zealand, please, and New Zealanders, we get lots of nice Kiwis coming here in this part of the world as well, so we are very lucky indeed."</p>
        
            <p>Given his recent health issues, the King also had some advice for the Black Ferns players .</p>
        
            <p>"And I hope you make the most of your time in the team because you don't stay young for very long, as I discovered, it all goes quicker than you think."</p>
        
            <p>Charles also offered his condolences on the passing of the MƒÅori king, Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII last month.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt deeply for the loss of Kiingi so suddenly having spoken to him on the telephone only recently," he said.</p>
