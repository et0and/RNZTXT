            <p>Canterbury batter Henry Nicholls is facing allegations of ball tampering in his side's Plunket Shield match with Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Video has emerged of the Black Cap seemingly rubbing the ball against a helmet in between overs.</p>
        
            <p>Nicholls has been reported by the match umpires for allegedly breaching NZC's Code of Conduct.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket confirmed the matter was being referred.</p>
        
            <p>"Nicholls has been reported for allegedly breaching Rule 3.1, article 1.15 of the Code."</p>
        
            <p>Rule 3.1, article 1.15 involves changing the condition of the ball in breach of Law 41.3 of the Laws of Cricket.</p>
        
            <p>"As a Level 2 matter, the allegation will be referred to, and heard by an NZC First Class Commissioner."</p>
        
            <p>Nicolls last played a test for New Zealand in March against Sri Lanka with his last limited overs appearance coming in the Bangladesh series before missing the cut for the world cup.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury won the match by eight wickets.</p>
