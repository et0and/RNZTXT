            <p>An elite ram has set the Gore Showgrounds alight, with one lucky Southland breeder earning more than three times his previous best for the country's highest-priced ram this year.</p>
        
            <p>A Wiltshire crossed with an Exlana shedding ram from Enfield Genetics breeder Grant Kean at Winton received competitive bidding up to the $20,000 mark, before the hammer came down at $24,500.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a bit of a shock and surprise," said Kean, who was in the ring while the hearty bidding was taking place last week.</p>
        
            <p>"We sold one last year for $8000, so I thought it might come near that, but I'm just over the moon."</p>
        
            <p>A Perendale ram topped last week's Gore Ram Fair, selling for $19,000, but Kean's reward of $24,500 at the Gore shedding sheep sale was the top price for a ram throughout the North and South Islands this year.</p>
        
            <p>Bought by a syndicate of Balclutha's Hamish Bielski and North Canterbury duo Daniel Wheeler and Chris Ensor, the ram will be put to work at different corners of the breeding season.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ from Scotland where he was busy scanning sheep, Daniel Wheeler said he was confident the "really good" ram was worth every cent.</p>
        
            <p>"He had a really great set of figures," Wheeler, who farmed near Amberley, said.</p>
        
            <p>"All his performance records were really good, really well balanced across the board. One of the highest-indexing rams in the country and coupled with that, he was just a really good ram. He's structurally sound, great legs, great feet, a very long ram."</p>
        
            <p>Ensor - from Cust, near Oxford - said the prized ram would start its work with a mating cycle on his farm during a 20-day stay in North Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"The ram is going to start in North Canterbury and then hitchhike south down to near Balclutha for Hamish.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not uncommon to share rams between different locations, and you give them a couple of days rest and then put them on a truck.</p>
        
            <p>"Our tupping dates are earlier. We'll put it over some of our best, then Hamish gets to pick it up.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a servicing agreement so he's not worn out. At Hamish Bielski's place he'll have longer down there, so he can take it a bit easier."</p>
        
            <p>And with lambing starting on Ensor's farm in late August, the offspring would not be too far away.</p>
