        <p>
Jamie Hughes has been struggling to keep his Norsewood smithy afloat, but just like his ancestors, he's not giving up. Audio

            <p>Blacksmith Jamie Hughes has a niche business crafting knives and hand-forged metalwork for chefs, farmers and tourists from his old-fashioned smithy in Norsewood.</p>
        
            <p>But tough economic times means he's feeling it from all angles, like many small businesses in rural New Zealand. </p>
        
            <p>Hughes has been running the forge for three years now, showing off traditional blacksmithing skills in one of the heritage buildings lining the main street.</p>
        
            <p>Bespoke knives are a specialty of the The Norseman Blacksmith, as well as more decorative metalwork hammered into shape in a corner of the workshop, which has a distinctly Norwegian flavour, echoing the town's roots.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes is proud of his Norwegian heritage and has discovered only recently he is a direct descendant of one of the immigrants on the first ship carrying Norwegians to New Zealand, the Hovding.</p>
        
            <p>"I do feel at home here in Norsewood."</p>
        
            <p>He chairs a group promoting the town and helps run the Viking Festival which takes place here in February.</p>
        
            <p>He is self-taught and has spent the past three years growing his 16-year old hobby into a business.</p>
        
            <p>He has customers in Norway and other parts of the world, as well as local farmers and chefs and Scandinavian tourists intrigued by the town's Norwegian links.</p>
        
            <p>"They see something Norse and they've got to have a look."</p>
        
            <p>Hughes was able to employ another blacksmith Jar Menzies-Winson who in turn has been helping to train a young student in the craft.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a bit of a dying breed but it's coming back fortunately," Menzies-Winson said. </p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people are staying away from mass production items and wanting some quality and handcrafted stuff."</p>

            <p>But now Hughes is having to rethink how he does things as the recession bites, costs rise and people hold back on luxury items like bespoke knives.</p>
        
            <p>"I sell knives to chefs which is a hospitality trade which is in a downturn currently, I sell knives to dairy farmers and sheep farmers and they're struggling at the moment, so they're not spending, as well as the tourism market. </p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling it from all angles at the moment." </p>
        
            <p>Hughes has decided to downscale, "get back to our roots", keep up his online store and keep open on Sundays, then readdress things in the summer.</p>
        
            <p>"I survived Covid, I survived everything thrown at me until the interest rates hikes. That's what's killed me, the cost of living so high now."</p>
        
            <p>But a bit like his ancestors struggling to carve out a living when they first came to the area, he is not giving up.</p>
        
            <p>"You see it throughout life, there's ups and downs ... and this is just another down."</p>
