        <h2>The seven types of people on Spotify Wrapped day</h2>
        <p>
It doesn't matter who you are, whether you hate music or have never and will never use Spotify. Everyone fits the mould for at least one of these types on…

Are you the unapologetically basic? Perhaps the heaps gay? Or maybe the one who "doesn't care"?

            <p>Happy psychological analysis (AKA Spotify Wrapped) day!</p>
        
            <p>It doesn't matter who you are, whether you hate music or have never and will never use Spotify. Everyone fits the mould for at least one of these types on Wrapped day.</p>
        
            <p>Which one/s are you?</p>

            <p>You feel the need to pretend you're "so embarrazzed" by your top songs and artists, even though those lists are filled with music you really love.</p>
        
            <p>It just happens to be super basic. (I'm talking Billboard top 20 vibes.)</p>
        
            <p>But you know what? I think you deserve some props.</p>
        
            <p>You like what you like and you're unafraid to stick to exactly that… even if you are a little scared to parade the results online.</p>
        
            <p>I say let the fear go and be truly unapologetically you.</p>
        
            <p>trust me we know your spotify wrapped is Taylor, Swift and harry styles we know just by looking at you</p>
        
            <p>You listen to cool stuff and nothing but cool stuff and you want everyone to know it, even though your followers won't recognise your top songs and have no idea who your favourite artists are.</p>
        
            <p>You earnestly caption the screenshot of your number one album: "Imogen Cygler - Stranger Sometimes. Melbourne composer. Under 2k followers on IG. One of my fave discoveries this year. Imagine Stella Donnelly attending a renaissance fair with They Might Be Giants's lyrical attitude."</p>
        
            <p>In five years, when the rest of the world has caught onto the artists you've been listening to, you'll remind them that you were all across it first.</p>
        
            <p>You are this meme and you are also this meme. Don't worry, we still love you.</p>

            <p>This is you if your Wrapped features any of the following (I don't make the rules):</p>
        
            <p>That your Wrapped is so gay is a beautiful thing.</p>
        
            <p>You are obligated to post about it because we need to know and celebrate how gay we all are.</p>

            <p>You have ~no idea~ how World Class Sinner/I'm a Freak became your most listened to song of the year.</p>
        
            <p>It just doesn't make any sense. You heard it play on that one episode of The Idol you could stomach and sure, you'll admit you listened to it a few more times after that because it was a good morning amp-up song but that was IT, SURELY?</p>
        
            <p>Spotify has this all wrong! What does Spotify even know, anyway? Who do they think they're fooling that this is based on data? What does data know, anyway?</p>
        
            <p>I think spotify wrapped this year should have a category for 'songs you obsessively looped for a week and then never touched again'</p>
        
            <p>Good on you for taking the steps to improve your sleep hygiene.</p>
        
            <p>We totally support you in your decision to pretend your favourite talk podcast was your number one, actually.</p>

            <p>The Wiggles, Baby Shark, the Frozen soundtrack.</p>
        
            <p>Not only were you forced to listen to this stuff far more times than you would have liked to over the last 365 days - you also miss out on truly experiencing Wrapped day.</p>
        
            <p>This day now serves as a reminder of how much the soundtrack to your life has changed.</p>
        
            <p>And look, there are good and bad things about this.</p>
        
            <p>If you don't want this to happen again, there is a way to reset your algorithm.</p>

            <p>You might feel an impossible-to-ignore urge to post on your Stories lamenting the fact it's Spotify Wrapped day and insisting everyone stop posting about it.</p>
        
            <p>it’s almost that special time of year <3 #SpotifyWrapped pic.twitter.com/WL5rZSc0om</p>
        
            <p>Or you might hate the Spotify monopoly on the Wrapped concept and would like your followers to instead pay attention to your misc streaming service's janky attempt at cobbling together the same thing.</p>
        
            <p>You diligently post your Apple/YouTube/last.fm/insert random music streaming platform's roundup to your socials in the hope that one day, someone will respond to it with equal enthusiasm.</p>
        
            <p>Bless.</p>
