            <p>Kiwi Indians are bringing their passion for motorcycling to New Zealand roads, with more than 1400 Royal Enfield motorbikes being registered in Aotearoa in the past three years.</p>
        
            <p>Royal Enfield, an Indian motorcycle manufacturing company with British origins, enjoys a devoted following globally.</p>
        
            <p>In 2024, the company sold 920,000 units in India alone.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the Royal Enfield owners here are Indian," said Philips Augustine, a lifelong motorcycle enthusiast who started riding at the age of 18.</p>
        
            <p>Originally from the southern India state of Kerala, the 31-year-old recently purchased his first motorcycle in New Zealand three months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I missed my motorcycle so much and finally got a Classic 350," Augustine said.</p>

            <p>Riding in New Zealand, however, presented a different set of challenges compared to India.</p>
        
            <p>Augustine said the country's weather, especially the wind, could be a significant factor.</p>
        
            <p>"Wearing proper gear is very important here, unlike in India," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"On the plus side, parking is a huge advantage," he said. "Many places offer free motorcycle parking, so I often use my bike for city trips. It's much better during peak traffic hours."</p>
        
            <p>Still, Augustine acknowledged that riding in New Zealand wasn't without its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>Theft was a constant concern.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just the bike - you have to secure the accessories as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Yet, his passion for motorcycling outweighed such difficulties.</p>
        
            <p>"The stunning landscapes here make every ride worthwhile," he said.</p>

            <p>Lokesh Kalburgi, president of the Enfield Riders Auckland Club, shared Augustine's enthusiasm for riding.</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's a bit cliché, but there's this incredible sense of freedom that's hard to describe if you're not a motorcyclist," Kalburgi said. "For me, it's a mental escape."</p>
        
            <p>Born to Indian parents, Kalburgi's family migrated to New Zealand from the United Arab Emirates in 1994.</p>
        
            <p>Since childhood, he has harbored a dream of owning a Royal Enfield Bullet.</p>
        
            <p>"I've wanted one since I was a kid, but life kept getting in the way," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Five years ago, as his children grew older, Kalburgi finally revisited that dream.</p>
        
            <p>What started as casual meetups among a handful of Royal Enfield enthusiasts about seven years ago has now grown into a formal club with around 100 members.</p>
        
            <p>"We initially got together for coffee catchups, but it evolved into a proper club," Kalburgi said.</p>
        
            <p>These days, the club organises bi-monthly rides and events.</p>
        
            <p>The growing membership has even enabled the club to negotiate discounts on insurance premiums.</p>
        
            <p>"We brought the cost of insurance down from about $700 to roughly $150 a year for members," Kalburgi said.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, the club has also attracted several Pākehā members.</p>
        
            <p>"Royal Enfield holds a special place for them," Kalburgi said. "Many of their grandparents owned these bikes, so there's a nostalgic connection."</p>
        
            <p>Kalburgi noted that rising fuel and parking costs made motorcycling an increasingly practical mode of transport.</p>
        
            <p>"What used to be a hobby for enthusiasts is now becoming a viable, economical option," he said. "People are buying mid-level bikes just to get around."</p>
        
            <p>Royal Enfield's presence on New Zealand roads is steadily growing.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, the company sold 528 motorbikes nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>While that number dipped to 411 last year, 461 units have already been registered as of 31 November, according to New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>However, owning a motorcycle in New Zealand came with its own financial challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"Registration is quite expensive," Kalburgi said.</p>
        
            <p>"And motorcycling can become addictive - you buy one bike, and soon you're eyeing your second," he said. "Before you know it, you're paying $500 to $600 for registration and insurance."</p>
        
            <p>According to the New Zealand Transport Agency's website, the annual registration fee for a private motorcycle would be set at $424.28 for models with engine capacities of 61cc to 600cc from 1 January.</p>
        
            <p>For motorcycles with engine capacities exceeding 600cc, the fee would be $538.44.</p>
        
            <p>Augustine echoed this sentiment, but his love for motorcycling remained undeterred.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a passion," he said. "And with summers like this, it's impossible to resist the call of the road."</p>
