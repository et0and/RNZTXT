            <p>Samoa Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa has launched as a two-month gun amnesty to ensure "the safety and security of all world leaders" ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in October.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa police have told RNZ Pacific that a high-level police meeting has been held to discuss preparations for CHOGM.</p>
        
            <p>The gun amnesty - the third since 2015 - commenced on 1 August and aims to reduce illegal firearms and ammunitions in the community.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative will end on 30 September.</p>
        
            <p>Gun amnesties over the past seven years have resulted in 596 firearms and 725 pieces of ammunition being surrendered.</p>
        
            <p>"The intention is for individuals in possession of unlawful firearms and ammunitions to surrender them without prosecution during the amnesty period," Fiamē said on Monday to launch Gun Amnesty 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"As Samoa sets to hold the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 2024, as the incoming Chair, the safet and security of all world leaders attending CHOGM is critical."</p>
        
            <p>Residents are being offered food vouchers worth $100 tala if they co-operate during the amnesty.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2015 and 2016, the police received 317 firearms and 321 pieces of ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, 81 firearms were handed in.</p>
        
            <p>And between 2020 and 2021, 198 firearms and 494 ammunitions were surrendered.</p>
        
            <p>Statistics show the police reported 16 incidents involving firearms between 1 January last year and June 30th this year.</p>
        
            <p>These included the fatal shooting of a senior police officer and in another incident a 12-year-old boy.</p>
        
            <p>"[The gun amnesty] demonstrates the importance of ensuring that our community, our country and our people live in a safe and secure environment," Fiamē said.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner, Auapa'au Logoitino Filipo told Samoa Observer in June that almost 200 officers from Tonga, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia will support Samoa at CHOGM.</p>
        
            <p>"We are confident in our preparations to ensure a safe and successful CHOGM," Auapa'au was quoted as saying.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa is the first Pacific member county to host the biennial meeting.</p>
