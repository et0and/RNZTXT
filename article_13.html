            <p>Bainimarama was granted an absolute discharge while the Qiliho received a conditional discharge with a fine of FJ$1500 by the Suva Magistrates Court earlier on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Magistrate Seini Puamau announced that both their convictions would not be registered.</p>
