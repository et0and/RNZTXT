            <p>A training initiative in Southland is giving young adults with high-functioning disabilities the skills required to work on a dairy farm.</p>
        
            <p>Michial Todd is the first trainee to graduate and now he's a certified dairy farm relief worker.</p>
        
            <p>"When Michial got his Agricademy certificate he was dressed in a suit and I don't think the smile left his face.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just so proud of himself and we were proud for him," Lynda Gilkison said.</p>
        
            <p>She is the chair and a founding member of the Whanake House Charitable Trust, that runs the Dairy Farm Training programme.</p>

            <p>"So, the reason that [the programme] eventuated was that I have a son who's 27 and has Asperger's and at that time, when he left school, it was quite hard to find a job for him," Gilkison said.</p>
        
            <p>Fortunately, she said, a dairy farmer was happy to take him on and teach him how to milk cows in a structured and clear way.</p>
        
            <p>"Once he learnt the steps, he just grew in confidence and he became a really successful dairy farmer."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted other young adults with special needs to have access to hands-on work experience too.</p>

            <p>Whanake House teamed up with the Rabobank Community Fund, which agreed to support the programme, and education provider Agricademy, which supplies online video training to help develop practical skills.</p>
        
            <p>It's Gilkison's job to match the trainees with dairy farmers. She said the biggest challenge was finding the right fit.</p>
        
            <p>"'Maybe a farmer that wants to give back to the community, someone that's compassionate and patient. Mel has all those qualities. She's been a really good fit for Michial."</p>
        
            <p>Bluff contract milker Mel Pennicott offered the 19-year-old a position on her farm. He's been there for a year and said working with Pennicott was a privilege.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been enjoying it. I like being with the cows and being in the shed," Todd said.</p>

            <p>So why did the farmer link up with this training programme in the first place?</p>
        
            <p>"This may be the wrong way to say it, but I bet for the underdog, everybody deserves a chance," Pennicott said.</p>
        
            <p>During the week, Michial lives in a sleepout on the property. This has helped him to become independent and look after himself.</p>
        
            <p>Pennicott said winter was not the easiest time for Michial to start as it was extremely wet.</p>
        
            <p>"We were driving in paddocks on a motorbike and you would just sink."</p>

            <p>She nicknamed Todd 'Boots' as he kept on getting stuck in mud.</p>
        
            <p>"He hadn't worked out the skill that when the mud's halfway up your boot, you actually roll your foot forward.</p>
        
            <p>"So, for a while there I would just crack up laughing and tell him 'roll that foot, roll that foot, come on Boots'."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the challenging conditions, winter was a good time to start working on the farm.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's when you can focus on basic animal health, picking up little things like the fencing, moving stock, working out their feed allowance and stuff like that," Pennicott said.</p>

            <p>Despite the hard work and long days Todd is making the most of the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"It felt like it was like a change, change for my life and getting away from, I guess, the stuff that goes on at home," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Todd and Pennicott have become good friends and she was proud of what he had achieved, workwise and on a personal level.</p>
        
            <p>"The little steps he's taking, being able to talk about his life, being able to talk about his home, the challenges, it's all progress in the right direction," Pennicott said.</p>
