            <p>A Kiwi gamer says he has spent about $16,000 on loot boxes, which could be described as virtual treasure chests, in online video games.</p>
        
            <p>Games like Counter-Strike and FIFA, now EA FC, allow players to spend real money to open them and have a chance at winning in-game rewards.</p>
        
            <p>Problem gambling groups are worried about the sums of money being spent on loot boxes, which they say operate in much the same way as real-life gambling.</p>
        
            <p>Jacques Strydom got hooked on loot boxes while playing the hugely popular online first-person shooter Counter-Strike.</p>
        
            <p>It was the thrill of clicking on and opening the boxes that drew him in, rather than the prizes themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Because he was only spending a few bucks at a time he felt he wasn't a big deal, but it all added up.</p>
        
            <p>"If you put all that money aside in a bank account, I would have had about 16k now, that I could have put towards a home deposit or something."</p>
        
            <p>Strydom said he felt "terrible" whenever he looked at the amount of money he'd spent.</p>
        
            <p>He was in no doubt that loot boxes were designed to be addictive.</p>
        
            <p>He could no longer trust himself with a credit card, so he left it to his wife to look after, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a person with an addiction, you'd always find some sort of 'I'll just cut on this this week so I've got a little to spend'... it's just easier to just give it all to her."</p>

            <p>Popular gaming personalities often post highlight reels of themselves opening loot boxes, and their over-the-top reactions should they get something good.</p>
        
            <p>For example, duo Twosync open loot boxes in football game EA FC. Their videos are loud and colourful with fast-paced editing and sound effects. And there's a lot of screaming when one of them gets a good player.</p>
        
            <p>Strydom said these sort of videos glamorized opening loot boxes. He has two children who also play video games and he tells them not to watch them.</p>
        
            <p>"They only show you the good stuff they get, they don't show you all the thousands they've spent before that."</p>
        
            <p>Mark was also a keen Counter-Strike player who had spent about $5000 on loot boxes.</p>
        
            <p>The way the boxes worked was reminiscent of real-life gambling, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you open a loot box, you get the scrolling animation, as if you're sitting down at the pokies and watching what you could be getting go past."</p>
        
            <p>Mark said his friend whom he opened the boxes with would always be sure a big win was just around the corner.</p>
        
            <p>"He would say 'I'm due for a knife', which is like the most expensive thing in Counter-Strike, and I'm sitting there like 'you aren't due anything, every time you click it's completely random what you get'."</p>
        
            <p>Pasifika gambling counselling service Mapu Maia chief executive Pesio Ah-Honi said it was concerning that "gambling mechanisms are embedded in kids games that are not regulated or don't have age restrictions on it".</p>
        
            <p>The agency has done research into the link between gaming and problem gambling for Pacific youth, and suggested education as part of the solution.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a lot of ways that we can use education as a platform to raise awareness, and to also get feedback from the community ... around what services are needed ... for our young people in particular."</p>
        
            <p>Ah-Honi also wanted to see a labelling system for games that contain loot boxes, so parents knew what their kids were playing.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Electronic Arts, the creators of FIFA and EA FC, said it believed that optional in-game purchases played an important role in giving players a choice in how to play the game.</p>
        
            <p>EA did not target minors or encourage them to spend money, they said, and the consoles their game was available on had robust parental control options.</p>
        
            <p>Loot boxes which do not allow players to win actual money should not be considered gambling, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Research into the connection between gaming and gambling is in the early stages they said, and there was no conclusive scientific evidence that loot boxes caused harm.
