        <h2>Stuff-Newshub deal: What's it worth?</h2>
        <p>
Mediawatch - Taking on the 6pm news bulletin will provide much-needed income for Stuff, but what is the investment and the length of the deal?
</p>
        
            <p>Warner Bros Discovery has done a deal with Stuff to provide news to replace Newshub which will keep news on TV channel Three from July 5. It will provide much-needed income for Stuff, but the level of investment in the project and the length of the deal is not known.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Stuff will provide a one-hour bulletin each weekday and a half-hour in weekends.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed Stuff will also retain a live Newshub website but migrate the content to Stuff.co.nz which is the country’s most-visited news website. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Staff at Newshub and Stuff were informed of the deal at meetings this morning. Senior Newshub reporter Michael Morrah has said staff were told there would be “limited” roles for ex Newshub staff.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff's publisher Sinead Boucher has told her staff the company will "definitely be bringing some Newshub staff" to produce the 6pm bulletins.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Mediawatch understands many media companies approached WBD with proposals to provide news after the company first proposed the cost-saving closure in late February. But by the time of the confirmation earlier this month most of those had been rejected by WBD.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Sky TV was also reported to be in the running. It currently runs a Newshub-produced bulletin at 5:30pm each weekday on the free-to-air channel Sky Open and would require a replacement. It also had plenty of TV production facilities.  </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff's Sinead Boucher told Stuff staff today  a Sky bulletin is not included in the deal, but she hoped there would be discussions about that.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Negotiations were carried out with a great deal of secrecy both before and after Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) confirmed the complete closure of Newshub on July 5, leaving the company with no news presence. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff refused to comment during the process and Stuff journalists told Mediawatch last night they were unaware of an impending announcement. </p>
        
            <p>The money WBD is putting into the deal is confidential but it is certain to be just a fraction of the current cost of running Newshub, which would run to tens of millions of dollars a year. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>WBD was clearly determined to carve that cost off the bottom line of its loss-making local operation. The financial benefit for Stuff may not be great taking the set-up and running costs into account.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>But while the audience for TV news bulletins is declining - and the ad revenue has fallen accordingly - it is still substantial for TVNZ 1 and Three. The ‘appointment viewing’ time of 6pm creates a viewing peak which the TV broadcasters use to hold viewers for the entertainment or factual programmes that follow. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Former Newshub chief Hal Crawford told Mediawatch the overall audience for Three could collapse without news in the evening. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>“There's still a reason that the 1 and the 3 on remotes around the country are worn down. News is the one programme that runs 365 days a year ... which the schedule is going to rely on to lead into prime time. So the rest of your schedule is going to dwindle. Ratings are gonna fall off and everything is going to go to pieces,” Crawford told Mediawatch.  </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>“The loss of the newsroom represents the loss of the ability to respond to any event in real time. That is the heart and soul of a traditional TV broadcaster.” </p>
        
            <p>Stuff has journalists in more places around the country than any other news publisher. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff’s publisher Sinead Boucher recently told a parliamentary committee it has journalists in 19 locations, even after years of cuts and successive retrenchments.   </p>
        
            <p>It also has audio and video production facilities at some sites and some senior journalists with TV reporting and presenting experience, such as former Newshub political editor Tova O’Brien, former TV3 current affairs reporter Paula Penfold and senior journalist Andrea Vance.      </p>
        
            <p>But Stuff video ventures have not endured. It launched its own free online video platform Play Stuff in mid-2019. It also hired key former TV3 current affairs staff for its own longform video productions but disbanded the Stuff Circuit team earlier this year. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>When the Stuff app and website were refreshed recently, short vertical videos were added as a feature, called Stuff Shorts.  </p>
        
            <p>Stuff's weakness has in the past been a dependence on newspaper advertising. It was only last year that Stuff launched its first paywalls for online news for three of its mastheads. </p>
        
            <p>Stuff’s main rival NZME has half the country’s radio networks in addition to newsrooms supplying its newspapers and websites. NZME’s New Zealand Herald has been getting revenue from ‘premium content’ digital subscriptions for four years.  </p>
        
            <p>After Boucher acquired Stuff in 2020, Stuff embarked on a digital transition creating more digital audio and video content. It has hired executives from multimedia companies such as Nadia Tolich (ex-NZME now Stuff Digital managing director) and former NZME digital leader Laura Maxwell, now Stuff’s chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>Depends what you mean by 'success.'</p>
        
            <p>WBD is planning for a future beyond linear TV broadcasting - and all the transmission costs associated with it. It is possible WBD has done the deal with Stuff mainly as a kind of gap-filler to hold as much of the ‘rusted on’ news viewers as possible term in mind while it plans an online-only transition.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>It recently upgraded the formerly-clunky ThreeNow online app and added a number of streaming FAST channels, which mimic traditional linear broadcasting and carry live advertising but are only available online.   </p>
        
            <p>If the Stuff / Newshub service is not well resourced it will not compare well with TVNZ’s 1 News at 6.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ’s CEO Jodi O’Donnell recently said the state-owned broadcaster invests $40m in news annually.     </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Longtime TV3 news boss Mark Jennings (now co-editor of Newsroom) told Mediawatch any substitute service made on the fraction of the current budget would have another problem - TVNZ’s 1 News. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>"You're up against a sophisticated TVNZ product so viewers will have an immediate comparison. Probably that won't be favorable for Warner Brothers," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff will be using Newshub's existing studio on in Auckland while it sets up its own dedicated studio.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff will have to spend money on technical skills and equipment to get up to speed to produce a daily bulletin just three months from now. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>This could be a stretch for a company that is also under financial pressure. </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>There’s also the risk for Stuff that its existing news journalists and editors are stretched. Most will have to learn new skills and cope with the addition of daily deadlines.   </p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>Stuff has recently had to rejig regional reporting and made several sports reporters redundant. </p>
