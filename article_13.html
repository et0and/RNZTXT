            <p>A specialty Indian digestive made from betel leaves is experiencing a surge in popularity nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Paan, which is made from betel nut leaf and consumed with slaked lime, rose petal jam and mouth fresheners such as cardamom and cloves, has fascinated South Asians for centuries.</p>
        
            <p>What historically started out as an after-dinner treat has gradually evolved into a cultural symbol, often associated with hospitality, celebrations and religious ceremonies.</p>
        
            <p>The meticulous production of paan has also become something of an artform, with variations spanning regions and communities across the subcontinent.</p>
        
            <p>Now, a growing collection of small family-oriented businesses are bringing those flavours to households in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I never thought that I'd be in this business but here we are," said Sreeman Myadam, owner of Paanwala, which launched in 2018.</p>

            <p>Despite coming from a family that owned a paan business in India, Myadam was reluctant to start a similar venture in New Zealand upon arriving in 2008 due to the difficulty in sourcing ingredients, especially betel leaves.</p>
        
            <p>"The main challenge was sourcing the leaves for the paan," the 43-year-old Hyderabad native said.</p>
        
            <p>Unable to import betel leaves from India due to Ministry of Primary Industries restrictions, Myadam turned to Fijian exporters.</p>
        
            <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Myadam imported around 1500 leaves a week, although he brings in roughly half that amount these days.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, I supply about 30 restaurants and Indian grocery shops in Auckland," he says. "I [also] ship to Wellington, Hamilton and Christchurch."</p>

            <p>His business now offers five different kinds of paans; laddu paan, three varieties of chocolate-coated paan and fresh paan.</p>
        
            <p>"My clientele is mostly South Asians, but often I see Kiwis giving it a shot," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty-nine-year-old Rakesh Sharma started a paan business bearing his family name last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are three senior citizens who have joined hands and started this venture," Sharma said.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly challenged by the scarcity of betel leaves, Sharma found an innovative solution.</p>
        
            <p>"We decided to grow our own leaves because we couldn't import them from India due to the restrictions."</p>
        
            <p>He said most paan available in New Zealand were made using betel leaves imported from Fiji.</p>
        
            <p>While acknowledging their uniqueness of betel leaves from the Pacific region, he said they taste very different from their Indian counterparts.</p>

            <p>Sharma now has multiple greenhouses with betel plants in Auckland and in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"Betel leaves have been grown in New Zealand for the past 30 years but not professionally, so we thought we should give it a try."</p>
        
            <p>Sharma said the greenhouses have heating systems to keep the plants warm in winter.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, Sharma's business offers five paan products in New Zealand, including a waffle paan and two types of mouth fresheners.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, Sharma aimed to boost sales and said his production facility in South Auckland can churn out 1000 paan each day.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a truly distinctive product that resonates with many members of the community."</p>
