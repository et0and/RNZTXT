            <p>Food supplies are running low on Tikopia Island, in the far east of the Solomon Islands, despite fresh supplies arriving on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The islands crops were destroyed during severe tropical cyclone Lola that made landfall about a month ago.</p>
        
            <p>Kensley Manu, who's from Tikopia, was told by locals via satellite phones that food stocks would not last long.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no food and people are asking around now, they only have one or two meals a day," Manu said.</p>
        
            <p>"They said they were lucky that the patrol boat arrived on time.</p>
        
            <p>"People are struggling and are still trying to get up with what happened. I think they really need help from outside."</p>
        
            <p>Manu said people's homes were also badly damaged, and there was little time to prepare before the cyclone arrived.</p>
        
            <p>At its peak, gusts from Lola reached around 300kph when it reached category five strength - the highest scale possible for a cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>In Pentecost Island in Vanuatu - that was directly hit by Lola when it was at category four strength - the environment is starting to make a comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Teacher Andrew Gray said aid had removed a lot of stress surrounding food security and most had managed "crude fixes" to their homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Food Aid is starting to be distributed to people whose gardens have been wrecked," Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>"The landscape is slowly changing colour, it hit peak brownness about a week after the cyclone when all the smashed vegetation had decayed and withered, now it's very slowly starting to turn green again."</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu has been battered by three cyclones in the past eight months, all at or surpassing category four strength.</p>
        
            <p>Lola arrived at the end of October before the official cyclone season started.</p>
        
            <p>"People are wondering, is this just bad luck or is it climate change?</p>
        
            <p>"People are really thinking about planning for the future and what we're rebuilding, is it going to survive the next cyclone?</p>
        
            <p>"Almost every time dark clouds gather, people are rushing to sort of find someone with data on their phone to check the weather forecast," Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>UNICEF Vanuatu's field office chief Eric Durpaire said the repetition is affecting children's development.</p>
        
            <p>"More [children] are sick, more are weak, less are able to recover and that really impacts the future of their lives with capacity development.</p>
        
            <p>"So today that's really the concern is a repetition of cyclones and lack of time to recover."</p>
        
            <p>He said everyone in Vanuatu was worried that the cyclone season had just started.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of Vanuatu school students had their education disrupted.</p>
        
            <p>Gray said his school, Ranwadi College, returned for only two weeks, except for seniors who have continued to finish their exams.</p>
        
            <p>He said students are frustrated because the end of year graduation ceremony will be far smaller than previous years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really big event in students' lives, their families come and quite a lot of these students are the first generation of their families to complete high school so it's quite a big deal for them.</p>
        
            <p>"[The ceremony] has had to be drastically scaled back because the chapel is half damaged and food supplies are enough for people to eat at home but not adequate for a big public feast."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the US has joined other countries in the response, by providing US$1.3 million through its Agency for International Development.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the money will go towards emergency food, shelter and protection for 4000 households on Pentecost and Maewo.</p>
