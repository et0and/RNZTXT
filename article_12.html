        <h2>Celebrating Tongan ngatu at Studio Carolina Izzo</h2>
        <p>
The studio in Parnell, Auckland, is dedicated to maintaining taonga - cultural treasures.
</p>
        
            <p>Located on Scarborough Terrace in Parnell, Auckland, Studio Carolina Izzo is a hub of art preservation, focusing on the conservation of cultural heritage.</p>
        
            <p>Led by head conservator Carolina Izzo, the studio is dedicated to maintaining taonga - cultural treasures.</p>
        
            <p>During Auckland's Heritage Festival, which runs until 13 October, the studio hosted a discussion with Tongan artist Ebonie Fifita, on the intersections of Pacific art practices and conservation.</p>
        
            <p>Fifita focused on the importance of ngatu, or tapa cloth, a cornerstone of Tongan tradition.</p>

            <p>Fifita explains that creating ngatu involves multiple layers.</p>

            <p>The beating is what allows the pieces to be spread into thin sheets, known as feta'aki.</p>
        
            <p>Koka'anga is the process by which the pieces are pasted together.</p>
        
            <p>"Each piece works by two rows at a time - langanga - a measuring unit for counting progress," Fifita explains.</p>
        
            <p>She says that earlier practices used visual symbols for counting, while many techniques today rely on numbers.</p>
        
            <p>Different forms of ngatu are gifted during important life events, including births, birthdays, weddings and funerals, she adds.</p>
        
            <p>"The practice is intergenerational and communal."</p>
        
            <p>The craft is a feminine activity, where women come together to soak, beat and flatten the bark of the hiapo.</p>
        
            <p>Fifita explains that the creation of ngatu fulfils familial and communal obligations, serving both everyday needs and ceremonial purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"In past generations, it met every day needs, from clothing to bandages. Today, it is often used for ceremonies and celebrations, but its roots lie in daily practice.</p>
        
            <p>"We make ngatu on sunny days, while weaving continues on rainy days. This rhythm supports our homes, much like doing laundry or dishes."</p>
        
            <p>Each ngatu is rich in meaning, with patterns reflecting historical and contemporary narratives: "Some of the species have seen over one hundred hands contributing to their adornment," Fifita says.</p>

            <p>The communal aspect of ngatu preservation is vital, Izzo highlights.</p>
        
            <p>Fifita and her collaborators aim to ensure this practice continues across generations.</p>
        
            <p>Alisi Tatafu, who works alongside Fifita, has brought the practice into schools.</p>
        
            <p>"To make thisâ€¦it supports women, it helps them to be economically stable and sustainable in Tonga," Tatafu says.</p>
        
            <p>The significance of ngatu extends beyond fabric; it embodies cultural heritage and family histories.</p>
        
            <p>One piece showcased by Fifita illustrates Ha'amonga 'a Maui, a stone structure in Tonga, crafted from coral rock transported by canoe.</p>
        
            <p>The accompanying kapesi depicts two birds, symbolising that birds signify land and fish, and that you do not take important journeys alone.</p>
        
            <p>Meaning, culture, and tradition are all interwoven into these beautiful cloths, reflecting a vision of intergenerational longevity.</p>
