        <h2>Palau's president invites Trump to visit to see climate crisis impacts</h2>
        <p>
He says he might even take the US leader, who's often criticised as a climate change denier, snorkelling in Palau's pristine waters.

            <p>Palau's President Surangel Whipps Jr is inviting United States President-elect Donald Trump to "visit the Pacific" to see firsthand the impacts of the climate crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Palau is set to host the largest annual Pacific leaders meeting in 2026, and the country's leader Whipps told RNZ Pacific he would "love" Trump to be there.</p>
        
            <p>He said he might even take the American leader, who's often criticised as a climate change denier, snorkelling in Palau's pristine waters.</p>
        
            <p>Whipps said he has seen the damage to the marine ecosystem.</p>
        
            <p>"I was out snorkelling on Sunday, and once again, it's unfortunate, but we had another heat, very warm, warming of the oceans, so I saw a lot of bleached coral.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad to see that it's happening more frequently and these are just impacts of what is happening around the world because of our addiction to fossil fuel."</p>

            <p>"I would very much like to bring [Trump] to Palau if he can. That would be a fantastic opportunity to take him snorkelling and see the impacts. See the islands that are disappearing because of sea level rise, see the taro swamps that are being invaded."</p>
        
            <p>Whipps said Americans were experiencing the impacts in states such as Florida and North Carolina.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean, that's something that you need to experience. I mean, they're experiencing [it] in Florida and North Carolina.</p>
        
            <p>"They just had major disasters recently and I think that's the rallying call that we all need to take responsibility."</p>

            <p>However, Trump is not necessarily known for his support of climate action. Instead, he has promised to "drill baby drill" to expand oil and gas production in the US.</p>
        
            <p>Palau International Coral Reef Center researcher Christina Muller-Karanasos said surveying of corals in Palau was underway after multiple reports of bleaching.</p>
        
            <p>She said the main cause of coral bleaching was climate change.</p>
        
            <p>"It's upsetting. There were areas where there were quite a lot of bleaching.</p>
        
            <p>"The most beautiful and pristine reef and amount of fish and species of fish that I've ever seen. It's so important for the health of the reef. The healthy reef also supports healthy fish populations, and that's really important for Palau."</p>

            <p>University of Hawaii Manoa's Dr Tarcisius Tara Kabutaulaka suspects Trump will focus on the Pacific, but for geopolitical gains.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be about the militarisation of the climate change issue that you are using climate change to build relationships so that you can ensure you do the counter China issue as well."</p>
        
            <p>He believed Trump has made his position clear on the climate front.</p>
        
            <p>"He said, and I quote, 'that it is one of the great scams of all time'. And so he is a climate crisis denier."</p>
        
            <p>It is exactly the kind of comment President Whipps does not want to hear, especially from a leader of a country which Palau is close to, or from any nation.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the United States, we need China, and we need India and Russia, to be the leaders to make sure that we put things on track," he said.</p>

            <p>For the Pacific, the climate crisis is the biggest existential and security threat.</p>
        
            <p>Leaders like Whipps are considering drastic measures, including the nuclear energy option.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got to look at alternatives, and one of those is nuclear energy. It's clean, it's carbon free," he told RNZ Pacific.</p>
