            <p>The first day of the first sitting of Samoa's parliament for 2025 has ended with the prime minister saying if a vote of no confidence is tabled against her, she will advise the head of state to dissolve parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The past few weeks have seen a political storm with sackings and rife social media speculation.</p>
        
            <p>On the floor of parliament this morning, Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa began her introductory speech highlighting the government's commitment to addressing national priorities.</p>
        
            <p>She then said if a vote of no confidence is tabled against her, she will advise the head of state to dissolve parliament and call a snap election.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Speaker of the House, Papali'i Li'o Taeu Masipau urged the importance of loyalty and service to Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>Masipau said decisions regarding the potential vacancy of parliamentary seats do not fall within his jurisdiction.</p>
        
            <p>"To make it clear, I, the Speaker of the House, in my view, believe this is not a topic to discuss at this time. There is no peace that comes from it for our Parliament," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Speaker further noted that internal issues within the caucus should be resolved by the caucus itself.</p>
        
            <p>"This Parliament is not for a caucus but for the country."</p>
        
            <p>Then former prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielagaoi stood up and thanked the speaker of the house.</p>
        
            <p>Tuilaepa said he supports Fiame's decision.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament will meet again tomorrow from 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Three days into January, the chairman of the ruling FAST party and Samoa's Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries La'auli Leuatea Schmidt confirmed he was facing criminal charges.</p>
        
            <p>These include three counts of conspiracy or attempt to defeat or pervert the course of justice, and three counts of false statements causing harm to a person's reputation.</p>

            <p>On 10 January, prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa removed La'auli's ministerial portfolio, and went on to remove three of her Cabinet ministers.</p>
        
            <p>But La'auli remains chair of the FAST Party, and last week announced the removal of the prime minister and five Cabinet ministers from the ruling party.</p>
        
            <p>This was reportedly challenged by the removed members.</p>
        
            <p>Late last week, Fiame removed 13 of her associate ministers.</p>
        
            <p>These events have caused division not only within Samoa but also among diaspora communities.</p>
