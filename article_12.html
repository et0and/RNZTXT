            <p>With Parliament in recess this week, the coalition used the clear air to clear the decks, rattling through a laundry list of announcements - congestion charging, genetic engineering, and two separate ministry overhauls. </p>
        
            <p>But the announcement the government tried hardest to highlight was its new hardline approach to welfare.</p>
        
            <p>National campaigned on introducing a traffic light warning system, and on Monday, the government pressed go. </p>
        
            <p>Jobseeker Support recipients will be required to re-apply every six months, as opposed to every year, and any blips will stay on their record for two years, instead of one.</p>
        
            <p>First-time failures to meet obligations, such as someone not demonstrating they are actively looking for work or attending seminars, could result in a new sanction like enforced community work, or a money management card.</p>
        
            <p>The traffic light system was canvassed during the election campaign, and came into play on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It applies to recipients of Jobseeker Support, Jobseeker Support Student Hardship, Sole Parent Support, and the Supported Living Payment.</p>
        
            <p>At green, a client is complying with all of their benefit obligations.</p>
        
            <p>At orange, the client has failed an obligation and has five days to make contact with the Ministry of Social Development to dispute the failure, or arrange how they will meet their obligation again.</p>
        
            <p>And at red, payments have been reduced or stopped, and the client is yet to re-comply.</p>
        
            <p>In this week's Focus on Politics, Political Reporter looks at what the changes will mean. </p>
