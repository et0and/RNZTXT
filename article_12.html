            <p>The chairperson of the Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission (FHRADC) shot down suggestion by a senior government minister to bring back the death penalty to deter international drug traffickers.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Women and Children's Minister, Lynda Tabuya, told local media that she wants "see the death penalty brought to Fiji for those who traffic large quantities of drugs".</p>
        
            <p>The minister said Fiji continues to be used as a transit point for drug traffickers.</p>
        
            <p>"We are vulnerable, our borders are vulnerable, we need to explore the possibility of the death penalty to protect our people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the FHARDC is calling for stronger policies, laws, and judicial processes to tackle the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji abolished the death penalty in 1979 and the country's constitution ensure that every person has a right to life.</p>
        
            <p>"The Commission is of the view that the death penalty is not the solution to the rising drugs problem," FHARDC chairperson Pravesh Sharma said in statement on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Sharma said capital punishment "is a serious violation of human rights".</p>
        
            <p>"Rather, the government should conduct baseline research to determine why our people are engaging in drugs, and then put in place measures to better address the issue," he said.</p>

            <p>Sharma called for "rehabilitation of addicted people; to prevent drugs from entering Fiji".</p>
        
            <p>"We need to strengthen out border security, raise awareness, and educate our people about the impacts of drugs."</p>
        
            <p>He added severe prison sentences for convicted drug offenders "will continue to have a deterrent effect".</p>
        
            <p>This follows Minister of Social Protection Lynda Tabuya's suggestion of capital punishment for those who traffic large quantities of drugs.</p>
        
            <p>Tabuya's comments were met with mixed reactions from the Fijian public on social media, with comments including "this is a really dangerous rhetoric" to "a death penalty sentence will save our country".</p>
        
            <p>At least two MPs have voiced opposition to the suggestion.</p>

            <p>Home Affairs Minister, Pio Tikoduadua, who has been at the forefront of the fight against drugs, said the death penalty was not something that is part of their strategy.</p>
        
            <p>He said the key to tackling the country's drugs crisis "lies in comprehensive and humane strategies that address the underlying issues, while ensuring justice is served".</p>
        
            <p>Tikoduadua said the Fijian government's recent initiatives, such as the National Countering Illicit Narcotics Strategy 2023-2028 and the ongoing Police Reset, were designed to tackle these complex issues more effectively."</p>
        
            <p>The Narcotics Strategy, launched in June, focuses on comprehensive measures, including demand and supply reduction, alternative development, and harm reduction strategies.</p>
        
            <p>It also involves the establishment of a Counter Narcotics Bureau with a budget allocation of $2.5 million, tasked with leading enforcement operations and enhancing border control measures.</p>
        
            <p>"In parallel, the Police Reset aims to modernise the police force through capacity building and cultural shifts, backed by partnerships like the MOU with the Australian Federal Police." Tikoduadua said.</p>
        
            <p>"These strategies represent a holistic approach to addressing drug trafficking and related crimes through stronger institutions, better resources, and international collaboration, which are likely to yield more sustainable results.</p>
        
            <p>He added these were "crucial steps" taken by the government to address the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"These efforts prioritise building a secure environment through robust law enforcement and community-based prevention strategies, avoiding the irreversible consequences associated with the death penalty."</p>
