        <h2>Manawanui sinking: Samoa govt says oil spill risk biggest concern</h2>
        <p>
The Royal New Zealand Navy vessel ran aground south of Upolu on Saturday as it was conducting a reef survey.
</p>
        
            <p>No oil leaks have been found the area where the NZ Navy ship HMNZS Manawanui sank yet, the Samoa government says.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Works chief executive Fui Mau Simanu told RNZ Pacific that New Zealand Navy divers had been assessing the area since Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were working alongside local police and Samoa's Natural Resources and Environment Ministry.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't seen any leakage or any sort of spillage," Fui said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we should have a fair idea of any damage to the environment if there is any probably tonight, when the teams come back from their assessment," Fui said.</p>

            <p>The Royal New Zealand Navy vessel ran aground south of Upolu on Saturday night as it was conducting a reef survey.</p>
        
            <p>Chief of Navy, rear admiral Garin Golding told Morning Report nearly 1000 tonnes of diesel fuel was onboard HMNZS Manawanui when it sank.</p>
        
            <p>Fui said the risk of an oil spill poses the biggest environmental risk, with some reports of oil already leaking.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't confirm anything there's some speculation [of a leak] but we will have a true assessment hopefully tonight when the teams come back," Fui said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the weather had improved since Monday which meant the assessment teams were able to be fully mobilised.</p>
        
            <p>University of Waikato's Professor Chris Batter said the effect of ship hulls on coral reef systems can be quite damaging.</p>
        
            <p>"Because a lot of the antifouling paint comes off and gets ground into the corals. Where that can be cleaned up, then recovery of the corals can happen quite quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's left there, particularly if it's some of the older style anti-fouling paints that have tin in them, the effects can be quite long-lasting," Professor Batter, who is the chair of the Coastal Science, said.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa Conservation Society coordinator Ioane Etuale said the organisation did not see any oil at the three sites they visited close to the ship.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw regular clean water and clean sand, there were no signs of any oil residues or [oil] washed up to the shores," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Etuale said he was told by a local fisherman oil washed up on the beach Sunday and they had seen a number of dead turtles early Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"This type of threat is new to Samoa, I don't think it happens often, so I am not sure how well equipped we are to respond to such incidents," Etuale said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned, we want to know what what's in that boat, it needs to be looked at."</p>
        
            <p>Brent Ross, who is the owner of Offshore Adventures, a surf tour business, travelled on his boat close to the site of where the boat sank and said he saw both diesel and rubbish in the water.</p>
        
            <p>He said about half-a-mile west of where the boat sunk he saw what looked like food containers, one of them was broken letting out food.</p>
        
            <p>"There were food products spilling everywhere," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of what I took to be diesel fuel on the water it was quite bad."</p>
        
            <p>Ross said he picked up lifejackets and bits of timber from the ship.</p>
        
            <p>He checked one of the regular surf spots he takes clients to and said rubbish was flowing through the line-up.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people come all over the world predominantly to surf one or two of these waves over here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are world class waves and when I had a look at it there was just fuel flowing through the line-up, rubbish everywhere. I can't put people out in that.</p>
        
            <p>"If I can't take people out snorkelling surfing and fishing do I have a livelihood?"</p>
        
            <p>Ross said his guests at the moment were understanding of the situation but hoped everyone would do as much as they could to stay on top of the situation.</p>
