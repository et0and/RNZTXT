        <h2>Pacific countries struggling to keep up with drug syndicates</h2>
        <p>
Drug syndicates are quickly evolving and Pacific law enforcement is struggling to keep up, an expert says.

            <p>Drug syndicates evolve at a speed Pacific law enforcement is struggling to keep up with, the director of a geopolitical consultancy agency says.</p>
        
            <p>Fiji police have seized three-and-a-half tonnes of methamphetamine, in what they say is one of the largest seizures seen in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Local police have not put a street value on the drugs, but based on the NZ Drug Trends Survey it could be priced in the hundreds of millions of dollars if it landed here.</p>
        
            <p>Strategika Group advises law enforcement agencies in the Pacific and its managing director Jose Sousa-Santos said there was a capacity issue with Pacific law enforcement.</p>
        
            <p>"The problem here is that these types of syndicates evolve at a speed at which law enforcement in the Pacific is struggling to keep up with," he told RNZ Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an issue of capacity, it's an issue of cooperation, and I think law enforcement - not just in the Pacific, but Australia [and] New Zealand - need to have stronger ties with their counterparts in South America and in Southeast Asia to ensure that the response is holistic.</p>
        
            <p>"You cannot beat a machine such as the syndicates or the cartels, linked to Australian criminal organised crime or New Zealand criminal organised crime, without a cohesive strategy behind it."</p>
        
            <p>The origin of the seized drugs was not yet known, but Sousa-Santos said the "worst-case scenario" was if it was produced in Fiji aimed for export.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to speculate. But definitely the amount would indicate that it would be for export.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been quite a few years since we've seen a seizure of this size of methamphetamines. We have seen seizures around the size of cocaine in the Pacific over the past several years."</p>
        
            <p>Acting Police Commissioner Juki Fong Chew said Fiji's "fight against drugs" continues in the form of "consistent raids" with "more drugs being seized".</p>
        
            <p>"This is one of the biggest seizures ever and this shows that we are on top of things," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the Fijian government admitted it was losing the fight against the sale and consumption of illegal drugs.</p>
        
            <p>Attorney-General Siromi Turaga pleaded with traditional leaders to work with police to address the drug problem, local media reported.</p>
