            <p>The director of Fiji's biggest sporting event says it will drop the name and branding of Coca-Cola for next year's 50th anniversary - if they can find " a safer brand" to support the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers of the Coca-Cola Games have been discussing how to limit branding of the sugary-drink company from the youth athletics event, which has long been a staple for thousands of school students and their families.</p>
        
            <p>The secondary school athletics competition took place in early May, with 2883 students from 155 secondary schools competing.</p>
        
            <p>The games boast of being a breeding ground for national sporting icons, such as former Pacific sprint champion Banuve Tabakaucoro.</p>
        
            <p>Secondary Schools Athletics Association acting secretary and 2024 Coca-Cola Games competition director, Biu Colati, said these games are tied to almost every Fijian home and every Fijian hero.</p>
        
            <p>"Fijians like Joeli Vidiri who went on to be an All Blacks player in rugby. He took gold here as a runner in one of the games."</p>
        
            <p>However, the brand deal with Coca-Cola is expiring next year and organisers have agreed to look for new sponsors, Colati told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately our sponsors happen to be Coca-Cola. We have now discovered that sugary drinks are not appropriate for kids.</p>
        
            <p>"Come next year, you might not be able to see anything called Coke.</p>
        
            <p>"We will now call it the Fiji Finals. We will need to change the brands on everything we use," he added.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, the event defended its sponsorship, saying the sponsorship came from the company, not the drink itself; and only Powerade (sports drink) and Fiji Water were given to children competing, not the carbonated soft drink.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Health expert Sir Colin Tukuitonga said Coca-Cola should never have been funding the athletics meet and it was "unacceptable" for it to still be sponsoring youth sporting events.</p>
        
            <p>"It's totally inappropriate in this day and age," Sir Colin said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a significant national event and no doubt there will be other sponsors who would support it."</p>
        
            <p>Fiji's population is struggling with rising rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and promoting sugary drinks does not help that, he said.</p>
        
            <p>This year, athletes were offered fruit juice, water and diet Coca-Cola as beverage options at the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Colati said the soft drink giant had overall been flexible and provided over FJ$200,000 (over US$86,000) towards running the nearly week-long event.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were no strings attached and "nothing binding" keeping them from making small changes and reducing branding.</p>
        
            <p>"If we are given a safer brand then of course we will start considering that. It is fair all of these changes will be happening for next year."</p>
        
            <p>Tukuitonga said the same situation happened in New Zealand when a tobacco company was sponsoring the National Rugby League (NRL).</p>
        
            <p>"They complained there will be no more sport and they would not be able to continue to offer the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"But the reality is the sponsors were found."</p>
