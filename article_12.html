            <p>An anti-crime petition has been launched by an Indian business group that calls on the government to introduce harsher penalties for offenders.</p>
        
            <p>Rajesh Goel, president of the Auckland Indian Retailers Association, said the petition had gathered more than 5000 signatures since launching on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very scared at the moment and some of us say they don't know what will happen during the day or will they reach home safely at night, especially jewellery retailers," Goel said.</p>
        
            <p>"Crime in the country has risen to a very high level, and I know that the government is doing something, but we believe that there should be stricter laws."</p>
        
            <p>The petition followed an attack at a jewellery store in the south Auckland suburb of Papatoetoe in June, which left the owner with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>It called on the government to introduce harsher sentences, mandatory rehabilitation programmes, enhanced support for victims, community engagement measures and strict monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance with court orders.</p>
        
            <p>Goel said existing sanctions on youth offenders lacked teeth, "thereby creating an environment in which young offenders do not learn consequences".</p>
        
            <p>The petition called for legislation to impose harsher punishment on juvenile offenders while maintaining a structure that encouraged rehabilitation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the government announced a new advisory group headed by the chair of the dairy and business owners group to help ensure fewer victims of crime.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said the group would "engage directly with victims, workers, business owners, retail experts and advocacy groups over the next two years to provide the government specific proposals to address urgent challenges in retail crime".</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell in May told RNZ he was confident the government would deliver on its tough-on-crime promises.</p>
        
            <p>In June, the government also released further details on its plan to set up military-style academies and a new category, Young Serious Offender, that could land someone as young as 14 in one.</p>
        
            <p>In March, police data released under the Official Information Act revealed nearly 150,000 crimes reported at retailers across the country in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>On average, six retailers a day were being assaulted at work.</p>
        
            <p>Goel said shopkeepers and customers were afraid of rising crime rates, with some shops closing their doors for good.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped more resources could be allocated to provide support services for victims, including counselling, financial assistance and legal advocacy.</p>
        
            <p>"Victims should receive the necessary support to recover from their trauma and rebuild their lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Goel said the petition had garnered a large number of signatures since its launch.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped 30,000 people would sign the petition over the next few weeks before taking it to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is fed up," he said. "Please help us."</p>
