            <p>Australia and Papua New Guinea signed a bilateral security agreement today that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and counterpart James Marape said showed the closeness of the two nations.</p>
        
            <p>The deal is designed to bolster PNG's internal security through more assistance in policing, defence and the judiciary as the Pacific Islands' largest nation seeks to develop its economy.</p>
        
            <p>Amid strategic competition between China and the United States in the region, PNG signed a defence deal with the United States in May to upgrade its military bases, and is boosting trade ties with China.</p>
        
            <p>Marape told reporters on Thursday the security agreement with Australia showed they were "brother and sister nations", but added PNG would not pick sides and had a foreign policy of "friends to all".</p>
        
            <p>"This is a comprehensive and historic agreement. It will make it easier for Australia to help PNG address its internal security needs," Albanese told a news conference in Canberra.</p>

            <p>He paid tribute to the support PNG's population gave to Australian service members during World War II, and said it was a defence relationship forged through sacrifice.</p>
        
            <p>"For our interests going forward, we have no closer friends than Papua New Guinea," Albanese said.</p>
        
            <p>PNG's judiciary, public service and borders were established by Australia before PNG became an independent nation 48 years ago, Marape said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have always given support to us. What happens up north of your borders has deep, deep shared effect, benefit, consequences, on our region," he added.</p>
        
            <p>The text of the agreement says that enhancing PNG's capabilities contributes to "Pacific-led regional security and stability", and that the two nations will prioritise consultations with each other on PNG's need for security-related equipment, infrastructure and training.</p>
        
            <p>As China has sought to boost its security presence in the Pacific Islands, signing deals to equip and train police in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, where it is a large infrastructure lender, Australia has said security should be provided by Pacific countries.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Richard Marles said on Wednesday that a meeting of South Pacific defence ministers, including PNG, had agreed at a meeting in the French territory of New Caledonia to consider forming a Pacific Response Group to provide assistance in emergencies.</p>
        
            <p>The security deal between Australia and PNG says the two nations will consult if there is a threat to peace in the Pacific, or an external armed attack on either party.</p>
        
            <p>It also covers classified information sharing, critical infrastructure, cyber, maritime and aviation security and health.</p>
