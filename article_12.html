            <p>The United States House of Representatives has passed a bill which would require US presidents to develop a Pacific Partnership strategy.</p>
        
            <p>The bill, if eventually passed into law, would mean the President, in coordination with the Secretary of State, "shall develop and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy entitled the "Strategy for Pacific Partnership'."</p>
        
            <p>It said this should happen "not later than January 1, 2026, and again not later than January 1, 2030".</p>
        
            <p>The bill states this strategy would include overarching goals for United States engagement in the Pacific Islands region and a plan to address threats faced by the region, including from natural disasters.</p>
        
            <p>It would also include an analysis of the needs and goals expressed by governments of the Pacific Islands region.</p>
        
            <p>Hawai'i representative Ed Case, who sponsored the bill, told the House it aims to broaden and deepen US partnerships with their fellow nations of the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Pacific today faces challenges including increased natural disasters, human and drug trafficking, economic sustainability and threats to democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"It is crucial that the United States continues to extend our hand of full partnership in assisting the countries of the Pacific to meet these challenges, as we have for generations.</p>
        
            <p>"Our bill...advances these goals.</p>
        
            <p>"It acknowledges that the United States should support the vision, values and objections of the Pacific Islands."</p>
        
            <p>American Samoa representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen said while Congress has extended the Compacts of Free Association, "those are only focused on three Pacific Island countries".</p>
        
            <p>"There are 11 other countries who need our attention."</p>
        
            <p>The US is widely considered to be in a geopolitical battle of wills with China, which also pours large amounts of funding into the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>But not everyone sees the US as the great supporter of the region, particularly in the wake of nuclear testing.</p>
        
            <p>The Pacific Partnerships bill also extends certain diplomatic immunities to the Pacific Islands Forum; requires the President to report to Congress on the implementation of the strategy; and states the President should consult and coordinate with allies and partners in the Pacific Islands region about programs that provide assistance to the region.</p>
        
            <p>The bill has passed the lower House this month and has been received in the Senate, read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>
        
            <p>The US House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the Congress, with the Senate being the upper chamber.</p>
