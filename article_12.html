            <p>Explainer: From a glittering music career and lots of celebrity mates to allegations of sexual abuse, violence and federal raids, US hip hop star P Diddy (real name: Sean Combs) has been in the headlines recently.</p>
        
            <p>According to the man himself, he hasn't done a thing wrong. According to various lawsuits, allegations and a very public search of two properties by US federal agents, Sean Combs (aka P Diddy) could be in quite a lot of trouble.</p>
        
            <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs is a US music mogul and influential hip hop producer who first gained fame in the 90s.</p>
        
            <p>Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, made his name by being the manager and producer of rapper Notorious B.I.G. He's a three-time Grammy Award-winner who has worked with a long list of big names, including Mariah Carey, Mary J Blige, Usher and Faith Evans.</p>
        
            <p>His debut album, No Way Out, sold seven million copies worldwide. It featured 'I'll Be Missing You', a tribute he wrote after the death of rapper Biggie Smalls in 1997.</p>
        
            <p>Combs' talents aren't just limited to music: He's dabbled in fashion by starting his own label, Sean John, and launched a TV channel. He also partnered with drinks giant Diageo to promote and jointly buy a couple of vodka and tequila brands.</p>

            <p>Last week, his mansions in Los Angeles and Florida were raided by the Department of Homeland Security. Associated Press reported that two anonymous officials said the properties were searched "as part of an ongoing sex-trafficking investigation", though it was not clear whether Combs himself was the target of the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC reported that his lawyer called the action an "unprecedented ambush" and a "gross overuse of military-level force", and maintained his client's innocence.</p>
        
            <p>Combs is no stranger to trouble. As a young promoter who had organised a charity basketball game, he was held partly responsible for the 1991 City College stampede, a catastrophic crowd crush situation that left nine people dead and 29 injured.</p>
        
            <p>Combs was charged with criminal possession of a weapon while on a night out with then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez in 1999, but later acquitted.</p>
        
            <p>Various allegations of violence have bubbled up over the years, but things seemed to come to a head late last year. Combs faced three lawsuits alleging abuse and assault in a week, including one from former partner Cassie Ventura in December 2023. That particular case was settled a day after it was filed, though Combs' lawyer said it was "in no way an admission of wrongdoing".</p>
        
            <p>In December 2023, soon after the Ventura case was settled, Combs was sued by another woman who accused him of sex trafficking and gang rape.</p>
        
            <p>He took to Instagram to plead his innocence: "Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth."</p>
        
            <p>In February 2024, Combs was accused of 'grooming' by music producer Rodney Jones Jr, who has filed a NZ$50 million lawsuit against him.</p>

            <p>There is much speculation about Combs' whereabouts; after the raids on his properties, the New York Times reported that Combs was also stopped at an airport in Miami as he prepared to leave for the Bahamas. He was not detained though, so internet sleuths have been busy tracking his private jet. Last week, Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne told Newsweek that "there is no credible information" that Combs was on the Caribbean island.</p>
        
            <p>Unlikely. US department store Macy's announced that it would be removing the Sean John label from its stores and website in November 2023. Some items are still available via Walmart. As for the TV side of things, Combs 'temporarily' stepped aside from his role as chairman of Revolt TV last November.</p>
        
            <p>Combs and Diageo also parted ways in January after a messy dispute that involved accusations of racism.</p>
