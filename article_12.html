            <p>TVNZ has confirmed Shortland Street will air just three episodes a week in 2025, a compromise to keep the long-running drama alive.</p>
        
            <p>NZ On Air has injected $3 million in public media funding to secure the programme's 34th season.</p>
        
            <p>Shortland Street has aired five episodes a week, Monday through Friday, since 1992. But industry insiders say the programme was almost cut as part of TVNZ's latest restructure, which resulted in the cancellation of Fair Go and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"It was on the cards that we could lose Shortland Street," Screen Production and Development Association president Irene Gardiner said.</p>
        
            <p>"With the big drop in advertising revenue, TVNZ just couldn't afford to fully fund it on their own anymore."</p>
        
            <p>It was thanks to a last-minute policy tweak by Media and Communications Minister Paul Goldsmith and a life-saving cash injection by NZ On Air that Shortland Street narrowly avoided cancellation.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people have been working very hard behind the scenes to save Shortland Street," Gardiner said.</p>
        
            <p>"Goldsmith has announced they will tweak the Screen Production Rebate very slightly to make Shortland Street eligible, and NZ On Air has come to the party a bit too."</p>
        
            <p>The Screen Production Rebate gives domestic productions a 40 percent cash rebate on expenses, but Shortland Street did npt meet the threshold until Goldsmith adjusted the programme earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Gardiner said Shortland Street was culturally significant to New Zealand and remained a critical breeding ground for talent in the local screen industry.</p>
        
            <p>For its 2021 season, Shortland Street employed 383 people in casual, contract, and permanent crew roles. It employed 190 actors, including the 21 core cast members.</p>
        
            <p>South Pacific Pictures, which produces Shortland Street, had entered a consultation period to consider how the new schedule would impact staff.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really, really relieved that we have still got a show," chief executive Kelly Martin told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got another year, we've got work we still have to do, and we have a creative challenge ahead of us... quite frankly, in this current media environment, that's a win."</p>
        
            <p>Martin admitted she was nervous about the future.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really lucky we have such a strong and successful show as a base that we're working with, but as you look around the market... it ain't pretty," she said. "We're all a bit nervous, it's a tough time."</p>
        
            <p>She said fans of Shortland Street could expect more intense episodes to make up for the reduced schedule.</p>
        
            <p>"We intend, creatively, getting the show on steroids," she said. "I have such faith in the creative team, and this will be an opportunity to take it up a notch."</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ chief executive Jodi O'Donnell said the decision was influenced by the broadcasters new digital-first strategy.</p>
        
            <p>"The TV environment is changing fast and we're moving with our viewers," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an extremely engaged online audience for Shortland Street and we want to take the show successfully into the future and ensure its ongoing relevance," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The 34th season of Shortland Street will start in February, but South Pacific Pictures and TVNZ were unable to confirm which days the programme would air.</p>
        
            <p>Martin said the they would focus on quality over quantity.</p>
        
            <p>"Fewer episodes mean a greater focus on creating the storylines that will cut through with audiences in a competitive market," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll bring all the things Shorty viewers love on steroids for three days per week, with stories that dig deep into real-life and topical issues in New Zealand."</p>
