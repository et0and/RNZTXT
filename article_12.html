            <p>Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 150 runs in the opening test in Sylhet to grab a 1-0 lead in the two-test series on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Chasing 332 for victory, New Zealand were all out for 181 on the morning session of the final day of the spinner-dominated contest.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell scored 58, but it was overall a slipshod batting display by New Zealand, who posted 317 in the first innings.</p>
        
            <p>Resuming at 113-7, they added 68 on the final day for the loss of three wickets, with Tim Southee scoring a rapid 34 and Ish Sodhi the last man out for 22.</p>
        
            <p>Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam was pick of the Bangladesh bowlers claiming 6-75, giving him 10 wickets for the match.</p>
        
            <p>It was New Zealand's first ever test loss in Bangladesh, having won three of the six previous matches and drawn the other three.</p>
        
            <p>The second and final test starts in Dhaka on Wednesday.</p>
