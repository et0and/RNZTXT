            <p>Huge progress has been made in clearing farms and orchards in East Coast-Te Tai Rāwhiti of debris and damage left in the wake of Cyclone Gabrielle last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, the work is far from over, with repeated storms in recent months adding to the challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Vicki Crosswell came on board as coordinator of the East Coast Rural Support Trust, supporting farmers and growers through such adverse events, just after the storm hit.</p>
        
            <p>In those early days the need was as simple as "to know someone cared", she says.</p>
        
            <p>The advice to those feeling overwhelmed and unsure where to begin was to "do what you can, not what you want to", taking the time to assess the damage and make a plan of attack from there.</p>
        
            <p>"So much has been achieved which is a credit to landowners," Crosswell says. "The progress is a lot of flat has been refenced so it's useable land again."</p>
        
            <p>However, storms like the one which hit last week create a further setback and slowdown gains made on clearing more difficult, hill country land.</p>

            <p>"We're still struggling."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the challenges, farmers are "pretty positive" and proud of the gains made these past few months.</p>
        
            <p>One positive to come from the successive adverse weather events is the trust has seen a lot more gatherings, with community coming together off-farm.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to see the humour and the smiles and banter," she says.</p>
        
            <p>The East Coast Rural Support Trust - which includes Te Tai Rāwhiti, Hawke's Bay, Tararua and Wairarapa - is part of a national network of charitable trusts which support rural communities.</p>
