            <p>As New Zealand's rainbow communities mark the Day Against LGBTQIA+ Discrimination on Friday, three Chinese residents discuss the challenges they have faced in their journey.</p>
        
            <p>"Arajoe", 23, vividly recalls the day she first came out to her mother.</p>
        
            <p>The graphic designer remembers experiencing a mix of fear and excitement, bringing tears to her eyes.</p>
        
            <p>"A heavy weight was lifted from my shoulders," Arajoe says. "My mother's love for me surpassed my expectations."</p>
        
            <p>Approaching his 31st birthday, Ming* says it has taken him nearly two decades to fully embrace his sexuality.</p>
        
            <p>The IT practitioner describes his journey as long, arduous and sometimes bitter.</p>
        
            <p>"Had I lived in a more LGBTQI+ friendly environment, I might have understood and accepted myself much sooner," Ming says.</p>
        
            <p>Yan*, 41, has conceived two sons with her wife.</p>
        
            <p>Although the urban designer says she initially struggled with how to explain the uniqueness of the family to their children, she believes that parental confidence bolsters their children's development.</p>
        
            <p>"You strive to be there for them, shower them with love and ensure they feel complete within the family unit," Yan says. "Even without a traditional father or mother figure, a child can still thrive mentally and emotionally."</p>
        
            <p>*Ming and Yan spoke on condition of using a pseudonym to protect their privacy </p>
