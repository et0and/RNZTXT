        <h2>Matariki public holiday: What's open, what's not</h2>
        <p>
Like Easter, the date of Matariki changes from year to year, but it will always fall in June or July.
</p>
        
            <p>
Matariki is the name for the cluster of stars known as the Pleiades. When it rises in the north-eastern skies in late May or early June, it signals to Māori that the New Year will begin.

            <p>Matariki marks the Māori New Year and signals a time for people to gather, honour the dead, celebrate the present and make plans for the future.</p>
        
            <p>It's only become an official public holiday in the past two years, but it's a day New Zealanders look forward to very much.</p>
        
            <p>Like Easter, the date of Matariki changes from year to year, but it will always fall in June or July. This year, the public holiday falls on Friday 28 June.</p>
        
            <p>It's a non-working day just like any other public holiday - which means if you are working on the day (as regularly rostered), you're entitled to time-and-a-half pay and an alternative day off.</p>

            <p>Matariki is the name of a star cluster in the constellation of Taurus, commonly known as Pleiades. In mid-winter, the stars rise and herald in Te Mātahi o te Tau, the Māori New Year.</p>
        
            <p>The word 'Matariki' is an abbreviation of 'Ngā mata o te ariki o Tāwhirimātea' or 'the eyes of the god Tāwhirimātea'. Matariki was taken as a wife by Rehua and she gave birth to eight children, each star having a unique purpose and defined role in Te Ao Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally falling at the end of the harvest, the cluster's rise marked a time of abundant food and feasting. Today, people across Aotearoa gather to celebrate the day with plenty of kai, stargazing, and community gathering.</p>
        
            <p>Keen observers will have noticed the Matariki public holiday is observed on different dates each year.</p>
        
            <p>This is because Māori follow an environmental calendar system that considers the sun, the moon, various stars, and other ecological indicators to determine time.</p>
        
            <p>The Matariki public holiday dates fall on the closest Friday to the Tangaroa lunar period during the lunar month of Pipiri. Tangaroa is not a single phase of the moon but rather the last quarter period of the lunar calendar. Because of this, the dates to celebrate Matariki will differ from year to year.</p>
        
            <p>Established in April 2022, Matariki is the first public holiday to recognise Te Ao Māori, and the first new public holiday since Waitangi Day became a public holiday in 1974.</p>
        
            <p>Trading restrictions don't apply to Matariki in the way they would for Easter holidays, Christmas, or the first half of Anzac Day.</p>
        
            <p>Shops, restaurants, cafes and other hospitality and retail venues will be open as usual, but they can choose to close if they wish - so it pays to check opening hours beforehand.</p>
        
            <p>Supermarkets and malls will be open too, but some may operate with shorter hours.</p>
        
            <p>Public holidays are an expensive day to be a business and Matariki is no different.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality businesses in particular may add a 15 percent surcharge to their services - this is usually to cover the costs of paying employees time-and-a-half.</p>
        
            <p>If a business does charge a surcharge, they must have clear signage communicating this to the customer.</p>
        
            <p>This can be done with the display of signs detailing the surcharge, a message on the business's website, or by verbally letting the customer know at the time of purchase or before they order.</p>
        
            <p>If customers believe they have been misled about a surcharge, they can complain to the Commerce Commission.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, the Matariki Advisory Committee set out the Matariki public holiday dates for the next 30 years.</p>
