            <p>The winners of a Wellington awards night set up days after the Felix Wellington Hospitality Awards were postponed have been released.</p>
        
            <p>Felix organisers said after a challenging year in hospo, it made the sad and difficult decision to postpone the awards night until 2025.</p>
        
            <p>After the announcement a small group of Wellington hospitality owners got together to organise The Welly Hospo Awards which saw them raise over $10,000 via a Pledge Me campaign in under 24 hours to hold the event.</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated that between suppliers, makers, producers, brewers, distributors, restaurants, and the physical award makers the event received $60,000 in support.</p>
        
            <p>The awards were held this evening at Foxglove and the winners were voted on by the industry.</p>
        
            <p>A legacy award was given to Scott Kennedy and Malcolm Vaughan, better known as Scotty and Mal of S & M.</p>
        
            <p>They have been in Wellington's hospitality scene for over 25 years and have owned multiple hospitality venues that provide community for Wellington's queer scene.</p>
        
            <p>The award winners are listed below:</p>
