            <p>A New Zealand woman wearing a wedding gown bought on sale and restyled in Te Awamutu has won the biggest fashion prize on the Australian racing calendar.</p>
        
            <p>Eleanor Campbell was named winner of the 2023 Best Dressed competition, the culmination of a week of Fashion on the Field events centred on the Melbourne Cup, at Flemington Racecourse on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The Waikato 28-year-old said it had been a "crazy" experience, especially as she'd taken part in the contest mostly to support her mother, Anna, who was also a finalist in the Best Suited category.</p>
        
            <p>"I went as Mum's plus-one and then I stole her thunder," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>
Eleanor Campbell reigned supreme in the Best Dressed category, wearing a white full-length dress by Solace London and hat by Monika Neuhauser Millinery. Domingo Martinzez from Sydney took out Best Suited wearing an upcycled suit and self-made millinery.

            <p>She won the fashion contest on Derby Day, when contenders have to dress in black or white, which guaranteed a place in the finals. She said winning the top prize yesterday was completely unexpected, even though she'd been a finalist in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a bit nervous... but I've done it! I have no words."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said her mother had found her white Solace London dress on sale several months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought it might have been a wedding dress, because it was floor-length, so we had it taken up, and then the bit that we took off the bottom, we put around the neck."</p>
        
            <p>The re-styling was done by "a local lady in Te Awamutu", while her hat was created by Pirongia milliner Monika Neuhauser. Black heels and clutch bag completed the look.</p>
        
            <p>"They say that you never win in black or white against a field of colour, but mine was so simple and classic, it stood out because I was so plain," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Less is more, I guess."</p>
        
            <p>Her prize pool from the Flemington win includes $48,000 cash and "lots of other lovely things".</p>

            <p>Campbell, who runs a doggy day care business with her mother in Mystery Creek, near Cambridge, has been competing in racing fashion events for a decade. Next week she'll be judging the Fashion in the Field event at Riccarton racecourse in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>First though, Campbell said she was looking forward to dressing down after a week of high fashion.</p>
        
            <p>"My feet are killing me after a week in heels. I can't wait to put some old clothes on."</p>
