            <p>The verbal warfare is intensifying.</p>
        
            <p>The newest sporting rivalry in Aotearoa writes its second chapter this weekend, when the Wellington Phoenix come north in an attempt to conquer the current A-League kings.</p>
        
            <p>With Auckland FC warning the Phoenix they will face a barrage of banter from fans at Mount Smart, Wellington are embracing the chance to spoil the party of the new kids on the block.</p>
        
            <p>Across their first five appearances, Auckland are sitting unbeaten at the top of the table without a goal conceded.</p>
        
            <p>Phoenix defender Corban Piper said they are looking to spoil the party, and end the dream start.</p>
        
            <p>"I can speak on behalf of all the boys. We're pretty keen to smash them and get rid of that winning streak."</p>
        
            <p>Revenge is driving the men from the capital, with Auckland having taken the honours in their opening encounter at the Caketin last month.</p>
        
            <p>"I really want to get them back, because that will make the final derby really interesting, and I want to give all the Phoenix supporters  bit of ammo on social media," Piper said.</p>
        
            <p>Midfielder Kazuki Nagasawa concurred.</p>
        
            <p>"We are really [excited] about this game, and looking forward to the chance of revenge."</p>
        
            <p>For Piper, the rivalry is a bit closer to home, with him believing his next move would be north to the new franchise.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially it was Auckland FC for me. I didn't really think about Wellington Phoenix, because I thought that they were pretty Academy focused. So, I was looking at Auckland FC, but there just wasn't room in Auckland FC for me as a 10 and thankfully, Wellington Phoenix looked outside the academy and slotted me in."</p>
        
            <p>Nagasawa said the first encounter was a special experience.</p>
        
            <p>"But the result was not good for us. I want to get them back, we have to this time."</p>
