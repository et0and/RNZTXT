            <p>An Otago student has set up a petition to have disgraced Dunedin artist John Middleditch's sculpture removed from public display at the University of Otago.</p>
        
            <p>The large bronze sculpture created in 1969 sits outside within the Dunedin campus and is currently the subject of a panel enquiry about whether to remove it.</p>
        
            <p>In February RNZ revealed Middleditch was convicted of indecently assaulting young girls and a teenage girl in December 1976.</p>
        
            <p>The convictions came to light after a Dunedin woman complained to Health NZ in January, asking that a 1980s water sculpture of Middleditch's in Dunedin Hospital be removed.</p>
        
            <p>The women went to police late last year to complain that the late sculptor sexually abused her in 1972 when she was 11, after he selected her to attend art classes at his home.</p>
        
            <p>The grandmother, who does not want to be named, first complained to Health NZ Southern in 2012, but was ignored.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, after another victim of Middleditch's alleged sexual abuse came forward, Health NZ removed all of his paintings including one of three naked girls from the hospital along with the sculpture's plaque with his name on it.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Health NZ Southern group operations director Hamish Brown formally apologised to the woman for not responding appropriately to her 2012 complaint and said the water sculpture would not be moved to the new Dunedin Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Now, a Change.org petition to remove both sculptures has attracted 245 signatures.</p>
        
            <p>The petition, created by Bee Brown on 12 March, calls on fellow Otago University and polytechnic students, families, friends and residents to support the removal of the sculpture entitled Eleven Bronze Rods supporting Albatross Wingspan, as well as the water sculpture.</p>
        
            <p>"As an art teacher that hosted lessons in his house, he took full advantage of being a teacher and a supposed 'idol' for the young girls, using their trust to groom them at their vulnerable age.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the harm caused, John Middleditch went on to be a successful and renowned sculptor with little consequence for his actions."</p>
        
            <p>She asked whether the sculptures should be left to represent "something we do not and should not promote".</p>
        
            <p>"There are discussions in place but there should be no doubt in removal being the best decision for survivors of Middleditch's assaults and other sexual assault survivors around Aotearoa and the rest of the world."</p>
        
            <p>The woman who made the original complaint said she was pleased to see the petition.</p>
        
            <p>She said since speaking out there had been questions on social media about why she complained after so long.</p>
        
            <p>"People haven't tried to understand the issues about how this has come about and how people are silenced.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just about something that happened 50 years ago. It is about how victims are always silenced and the Old Boys' Network is protected."</p>
        
            <p>The woman said the argument by some that the art should be separated from the artist was flawed.</p>

            <p>The university had now convened a panel to "examine the future of the sculpture in question", registrar Dr David Clark told the woman in an email.</p>
        
            <p>Clark, a former health minister, said the panel was made up of members of the university community.</p>
        
            <p>"I have explicitly requested of the panel that survivor voice and sexual abuse prevention education perspectives are sought and considered," Clark wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"The six-person panel includes academic and professional staff, Māori and student representation, together with sexual violence support and prevention expertise."</p>
        
            <p>He said the panel had now been formally established and in order to uphold the integrity of the process he would pass on the woman's contact details to the convenor.</p>
        
            <p>"While the university aims to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible, it expects the process to take some time to ensure a thorough and careful review.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for your willingness to support us with this important mahi."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the woman also wrote to the Police Commissioner Richard Chambers about the fact her complaint to police should not be shelved because Middleditch was dead.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would meet with Dunedin police on Thursday to continue to advocate for a full investigation into Middleditch's crimes.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
