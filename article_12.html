        <h2>Mama Kali's Farm: A mother and daughter microgreens business</h2>
        <p>
Yu Kali and Yu Jiang's microgreens venture is sprouting almost as fast as the veggies themselves.

            <p>A pocket-sized bit of land, a small shed, a few trays and lots of health-conscious customers - that is all it took to get Mama Kali's microgreens farm sprouting.</p>
        
            <p>After starting out selling their produce at farmers' markets two years ago, Yu Kali and Yu Jiang are now also sending out 2000 packs of the nutrient-dense seedlings every week to the veggie aisles of 30-odd supermarkets in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>The mother and daughter duo started out in a small greenhouse on a rural block on the outskirts of Te Puke in Bay of Plenty.</p>

            <p>Microgreens - closely planted baby vegetable plants harvested after a couple of weeks - were the best crop for two women starting out in horticulture, Jiang said.</p>
        
            <p>"Traditional farming, it's just not realistic. We don't have machinery, we don't have that much land.</p>
        
            <p>"It's easy. It's not a lot of investment. We just bought some trays. We did a bit of research as well. And we're quite lucky in the Bay of Plenty. There's no other microgreen growers in this area."</p>

            <p>They now have a purpose-built 72sqm greenhouse with a packing shed alongside, providing room for hand harvesting and sorting.</p>
        
            <p>It is a far cry from Kali's days selling shoes in China.</p>
        
            <p>She married a Kiwi and arrived in New Zealand in 2007. Jiang followed two years later, completing her schooling at Te Puke High.</p>
        
            <p>Jiang said her mother had always had a passion for nature and growing things.</p>

            <p>"She always wanted to have lots of garden, but, being in the city is really hard. We have very small apartments [in China] and it's hard to have a garden," Jiang told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>"When she came to New Zealand it's like a dream come true for Mum."</p>
        
            <p>Kali's transformation from "city girl" to "farmer girl" was a bit of a "shock" for family in China, her daughter said.</p>
        
            <p>They moved into microgreens after Jiang lost her job as an indoor plant technician during the pandemic. The working-from-home movement meant offices got rid of their indoor plants.</p>

            <p>The pair initially wanted to set up an indoor plant growing business but realised they had missed the moment.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, they decided to nurture edible plants.</p>
        
            <p>They started off growing from trays on a small trolley in a 12sqm greenhouse, selling at markets in Hamilton and Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>They thought people would only want the sprouts as a fancy garnish and were surprised at the demand.</p>

            <p>"We have people that love them and they eat them every day, and they said, 'Oh, can't live without it in my sandwich.'</p>
        
            <p>"I started doing more research on microgreens and we started to get really, really amazed how beneficial [they] can be to your diet."</p>
        
            <p>The demand grew so much they employed friend Kate Crossman full-time to keep up with the constant task of sowing seeds, sprouting and watering the crop.</p>
        
            <p>It is then sorted and hand harvested before being delivered - sometimes in person - and sold directly at local farmers' markets.</p>

            <p>They grow five different types of microgreens including a customer favourite, a blended pack of eight vegetables, based on a lucky number in the Chinese culture.</p>
        
            <p>"We love the number eight and the more, the better!"</p>
        
            <p>As for family dynamics affecting the flow in the greenhouse?</p>

            <p>"Always fighting!" Kali laughed.</p>
        
            <p>Not so, Jiang said.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like me and mum definitely [have grown] a long way from the beginning, understanding what each other's like, strengths and weaknesses, and I guess, compromising as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, Mum always comes on top, because [she's] your mother!"</p>
