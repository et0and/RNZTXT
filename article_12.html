            <p>An East Coast baker famous for pāua pies has created a new delicacy - bringing her business back from the edge.</p>
        
            <p>Rachael Thomas, who owns Te Puia Springs Store an hour and a half north of Gisborne, was struck by inspiration while driving.</p>
        
            <p>She wondered what she could do with leftover parengo - a type of seaweed - she had at home.</p>
        
            <p>Pāua pie made Thomas' former eatery, Cafe 35, in Tokomaru Bay famous.</p>
        
            <p>She sold the business a couple of years ago and moved back to her roots in Te Puia Springs.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the coast has had a rough time, first with Covid, then a slew of severe weather events, culminating in Cyclone Gabrielle at the start of this year.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas said she had to let go of all her staff after the cyclone, with reduced forestry work dwindling her customer base.</p>
        
            <p>"I lay in bed and I just realised, my business is screwed, it's completely screwed. Straight away I knew, there's going to be no forestry, the roads and that were just all gone."</p>
        
            <p>She carried on, running the shop herself seven days a week, struggling to keep her head above water.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought, heck, okay, you know you've gotta be creative and proactive. You can't just sit there and let life go by and hope like hell someone's going to walk through your door."</p>
        
            <p>One day, inspiration struck on the drive home from town.</p>
        
            <p>"It was like a lightbulb moment," she said.</p>

            <p>"Because you have [parengo] with bread usually anyway, bread and butter. And my pastry is real yum.</p>
        
            <p>"I roared back, and I tried it out, and it is yum."</p>
        
            <p>So far, she has seen people drive from as far away as Whakatāne to sample the pie and has sold up to 90 a day.</p>
        
            <p>Now, she is in the process of hiring back her staff.</p>
        
            <p>An older couple was sent into her store by their son, who lived half a world away in London, but had heard about the pie online.</p>
        
            <p>One customer, Jason Walker, was impressed.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh bro, that's a beautiful pie Rachael.</p>
        
            <p>"Well presented, tastes nice... if that don't make you feel Māori, I don't know what will," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas said the secret was butter and a lot of bacon.</p>
        
            <p>The pies took two days to make, so she was not getting a lot of sleep.</p>
        
            <p>But she knew it would not be long before others start copying her parengo pie, just as they did with her famous pāua pie, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is seasonal though, so I don't know how long I can keep putting it out there for, but at the moment it's going off and we're just going to ride the wave."</p>
