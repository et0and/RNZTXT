            <p>Portia Woodman-Wickliffe scored a hat-trick of tries to help the Black Ferns Sevens to their first title of the 2023/24 World Series.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand beat France 35-19 in Vancouver to get their 34th title over all, while denying France a maiden title.</p>
        
            <p>It means the Black Ferns Sevens, who sit second on the overall World Series standings, have closed the gap on Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Woodman-Wickliffe scored inside the first minute and added another before half-time and crossed for New Zealand's final try in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Michaela Blyde and Jorja Miller also scored tries in the first half and New Zealand led France 28-7 at half-time.</p>

            <p>Woodman-Wickliffe was named the player of the final and told Sky Sport, she was proud of the side, especially given they are missing a number of key players.</p>
        
            <p>"I think their ability to learn and grow each tournament, we've had some massive moments but looking forward to the next tournament we've got some girls back home who are working hard but this is all for them."</p>
        
            <p>Woodman-Wickliffe said her try scoring fest brought back memories.</p>
        
            <p>"This has given me memories of old times, I never thought I'd ever get back to this sort of stage but it's always up to my team, they do all the hard work."</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns sit second on the tournament ladder behind Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Later Argentina denied New Zealand the double at the Vancouver leg when they beat the All Black Sevens 36-12.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina have won the last two finals in Vancouver and they again showed their prowess.</p>
        
            <p>Joe Webber and Brady Rush scored a try apiece to give the All Black Sevens a good start but Argentina replied.</p>
        
            <p>The game was tied 12-all at half time but it was all one way traffic after that.</p>
        
            <p>Argentina scored three tries in the second half, and Matías Osadczuk touched down for a hat-trick to put the game out of New Zealand's reach.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have jumped up to fourth in the men's overall standings.</p>
