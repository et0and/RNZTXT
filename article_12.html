            <p>Wānaka freeskier Nico Porteous has won a silver medal in a hotly contested X Games Men's Ski SuperPipe event in Aspen.</p>
        
            <p>Porteous, 22, the Beijing 2022 freeski halfpipe Olympic champion, saved the best for last in Aspen, clinching the silver medal on his third and final run.</p>
        
            <p>He put together a unique run that oozed style and creativity, along with the highly technical tricks he is renowned for to claim his fourth X Games SuperPipe medal.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels amazing, it's been two years since I have been on the podium with the year off. I have been switching up how I ski and I wanted to express myself. I did what I wanted to do and it paid off - I am over the moon."</p>
        
            <p>Alex Ferreira of the USA took the top spot with compatriot Hunter Hess third.</p>
