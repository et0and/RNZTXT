            <p>Warning: This story mentions suicide and domestic disputes.</p>
        
            <p>Emails between Auckland couple Pauline Hanna and Philip Polkinghorne have shed light on the state of their marriage before Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is on trial for murdering Hanna in 2021 and staging her death as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>At the High Court in Auckland on Thursday, police constable Madeline Palmer read out a document, entitled Philip.docx, which Hanna emailed to herself on 5 January 2020.</p>
        
            <p>In it, Hanna appeared to respond to an email from Polkinghorne that suggested she did not contribute financially.</p>
        
            <p>"Money is a big issue, you do take the lion's share of the load. But this email from you - I completely acknowledge your contribution and opportunity you have afforded the children and me - however it reads as if I am a totally selfish person who contributes nothing financially.</p>
        
            <p>"That is truly unfair. I do put my $4k away a month and the Hanna/Polkinghorne trust earns approximately $1k per month. I do shop for groceries, I do shop for things for the house, I do get flowers etc to make it nice.</p>
        
            <p>"I do buy you things, I do buy family gifts, I take and collect your drycleaning, or at least used to. You don't let me now as you put it under your own name. I don't wear body suits, I don't pick up the glasses by their upper rim, etc etc as you keep criticising me.</p>
        
            <p>"I have never been dirty but take on board your criticism about my handling of food, I have my text messages chime so I cannot miss your text, I make an effort to be on time, sometimes I fail. I take my dishes down to the dishwasher in the morning, accumulate the washing so I am not using the washing machine overly. I don't ever wear my bodysuits other than to work, I strive to make you proud of my work effort/ethic, I attempt to pre-empt your difficult days by encouraging you when you are in theatre, doing the dinner when I know you are tired, preparing the types of things I think you like."</p>
        
            <p>She apologised to Polkinghorne and said she felt "devastation" she had "let him down so badly".</p>
        
            <p>"l am so sorry. You are everything to me and you have changed. I haven't, but clearly I have not read your signals.</p>
        
            <p>"I still have bucket loads of love. I think you do too."</p>
        
            <p>Hanna asked Polkinghorne if he wanted a divorce to do it before 31 January 2020 so she could make arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to Hanna, also read in court by Palmer, Polkinghorne told his wife of 20 years he felt "increasingly devoid in the last few months" from their relationship.</p>
        
            <p>The former eye surgeon criticised Hanna for not contributing to their bills.</p>
        
            <p>"For many years you have asked what I want for Christmas and my answer has been to not ask me to borrow money from me. But in 2019, not only was that ignored but you went and got an overdraft as well.</p>
        
            <p>"2019 as you know was a difficult financial year for me because of the changes Auckland Eye imposed. My income reduced to approximately twice your salary. But right up until last week you were stating I hadn't taken you to Australia as much as in previous years. My response was in 25 years you have never taken me to Australia, ever!</p>
        
            <p>"In 25 years I don't think you have ever paid for the rates, water bill, insurance etc either at Upland Rd or Rings Beach, or your car for that matter.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know where the bucket load of love went but there you have it."</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne said he had enrolled in a three-day retreat in Auckland: Moving on, or Up, and intended to return to their Rings Beach bach on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>"I am leaving in a few minutes and I am sorry I haven't prepared everything at the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what the outcome of this retreat will be but to be frank without some sort of insight I am sure I will not be able to continue. If there is a pill to make it easier, don't worry I would take the bottle."</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
