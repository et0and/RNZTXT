        <h2>Palau first country in the world to ratify High Seas Treaty</h2>
        <p>
Greenpeace Aotearoa said the move sets down a challenge for New Zealand to follow suit and back meaningful ocean protection.

            <p>Global environmental advocacy organisation Greenpeace has welcome Palau's move to become the first nation in the world to officially ratify the UN High Seas Treaty.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace spokesperson Laura Meller says Palau had already shown leadership in opposing deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean, and has now set the bar for what it means to be an ocean champion.</p>
        
            <p>Conservationists consider the landmark ocean protection pact as the most significant multilateral environmental deal since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.</p>

            <p>Adopted in June 2023 and signed by 84 countries in September 2023, the treaty will only enter into force once it is ratified by at least 60.</p>
        
            <p>Greenpeace Aotearoa said the move sets down a challenge for New Zealand to follow suit and back meaningful ocean protection.</p>
        
            <p>"A vital tool to reverse the ocean crisis, the treaty is the most significant multilateral environmental deal since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement," the environmental NGO said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are thrilled to see Palau leading the ratification process demonstrating that it can be done and paving the way for the creation of a network of global ocean sanctuaries - including in the Pacific," Greenpeace Aotearoa oceans campaigner Ellie Hooper said.</p>
        
            <p>"Bringing the Global Ocean Treaty to life will mean protection for a vast array of marine life from coral reefs to humpback whales and seabirds like the antipodean albatross," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific nations continue to demonstrate global leadership from the frontlines of the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"This sends a strong message to other countries in the region, including the New Zealand government, that the time to protect the ocean and all the life it supports is now."</p>
