            <p>More than 30 of New World supermarkets throughout the South Island will have their off-licenses suspended for 48 hours for breaching online alcohol advertising rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Alcohol Regulation and Licensing Authority (ARLA) released its reserved decision on Friday, ordering a 48-hour suspension of 32 supermarkets' licences to sell alcohol in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Police inspector Ian Paulin sought the suspension of liquor licences for a total 35 New World stores for an alleged violation of The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The breaches relate to the online promotion of DB Export Gold and Ultra Low Carb products on 9 January, that was advertised at a 26.1 percent mark down for club card owners.</p>
        
            <p>Under Section 237 1B of the Act, the promotion of discounts of alcohol products of more than 25 percent is prohibited, unless on licensed premises.</p>
        
            <p>A two-day hearing in front of the Alcohol Regulatory and Licensing Authority was held in the Christchurch District Court last month.</p>
        
            <p>In its decision, the authority found 32 of the stores in breach, suspending their off-licences for 48 hours - most of which will begin at 7am on Tuesday 8 October.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said it was "clear, fair and transparent" throughout the process.</p>
        
            <p>"[Police] previously warned the chain for the same breach including advertising a 50 percent discount, double the allowed 25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are dedicated to seeing less alcohol-related harm in our communities, and ensuring licence holders are responsibly selling alcohol is key."</p>
        
            <p>Further in its statement, police said 84 percent of all alcohol consumed in New Zealand was purchased at an off-licence, and consumed in public places or homes without the controls of an on-licence premises, such as a bar or tavern.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite only having 10 percent of all the off-licenses in the country, supermarkets sell 31 percent of all alcohol consumed.</p>
        
            <p>"Selling that volume of alcohol comes with certain obligations, one of which is to ensure the responsible advertising of alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"Cheap alcohol is more likely to be purchased by those that experience the most harm from alcohol, including heavy drinkers, young people, and MƒÅori and Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>"It is our responsibility to help minimise that harm, and ensuring compliance with licensing regulations is one of the ways we do this."</p>
        
            <p>There is a total of 40 New World stores throughout the South Island.</p>
