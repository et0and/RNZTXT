            <p>A team of seven New Zealanders has qualified for the World Axe and Knife Throwing Championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma in April.</p>
        
            <p>It's a four-day event, and contestants will compete in their various throwing disciplines to try become world champion and receive part of a NZ$100,000 prize.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington axe thrower Michelle Mitchell will be competing with her duals partner Sarah Hilyard, who is also one of the owners of Sweet Axe - an axe-throwing experience business. </p>
        
            <p>"I actually started playing over in Australia and it's quite hard to meet people - it's not quite like Kiwis where everyone's just friends.</p>
        
            <p>"And so I was trying to find a sport that I thought I could do, and then I saw an advert and I went along and joined the Gold Coast League and just really, really enjoyed it. When I returned back to New Zealand, there was a place down on Cambridge Terrace so I just got straight back into it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I landed with all my luggage on the Sunday and I went to the first league night on Monday, so I was straight back into it."</p>
        
            <p>She enjoyed how the sport was mixed gender, without classes.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty much anyone can do it - if you're in a wheelchair, no matter what gender, if you're short, tall, whatever, because it just comes down to like, a little bit of accuracy… it's quite a good sport for anyone to get involved in."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was not expecting to win in Tulsa, but will train hard over the next 12 or so weeks nonetheless. </p>
        
            <p>"In America it's a massive sport and like, anything they just, they do, there are some amazing, amazing players out there."</p>
        
            <p>But even she, a world-level competitive axe-thrower, would dare throw one at anything other than a target - with no desire to join a circus act.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think I'd find anyone that would trust me to do that."</p>
        
            <p>I mean, I think in America the, it's, I mean, it's a massive sport and like, anything they just, they do, there are some amazing, amazing players out there.</p>
        
            <p>You can keep up with their progress on the Sweet Axe website or Facebook page.</p>
