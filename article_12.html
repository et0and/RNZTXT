            <p>What you get paid can depend a lot on where you live - both within New Zealand and trans-Tasman, new data shows.</p>
        
            <p>Recruitment company Hays has released its latest salary guide, which includes "typical" salaries across a range of roles.</p>
        
            <p>Hays New Zealand managing director David Trollope said that across Australia and New Zealand, 86 percent of organisations said they were intending to offer pay rises in the coming year, down from 95 percent the year before.</p>
        
            <p>There were also 25 percent fewer organisations planning to offer more than 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>He said human resources and accounting and finance seemed to be the areas most likely to experience pay increases.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of living was a big driver in determining how much of an increase to offer, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand labour market is still reasonably strong and crucially the sentiment after what has been a tough year is improving."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "no denying" it was a competitive job market but people in fields such as HR, healthcare and engineering would find it easier to secure new roles.</p>
        
            <p>Some roles were being paid significantly more in Australia. A site engineer in the construction sector, for example, could earn 50 percent more in Sydney based on Hays data.</p>
        
            <p>But in some other roles, pay was more similar. A cyber security role would be paid $140,000 in New Zealand but A$135,000 (NZ$145,453) in Sydney, Hays said.</p>
        
            <p>A chief operating officer at a firm with turnover of $50m-$500m might typically be paid $325,000 in New Zealand, but A$500,000 in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's average full-time weekly total earnings were A$1953.70 in November 2023. In New Zealand in the September quarter, the average weekly earnings for all full-time equivalent employees was $1558.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago associate professor Dennis Wesselbaum said change would be required for New Zealand's wages to catch up to Australia's more generally.</p>
        
            <p>Productivity growth would be needed, he said, as well as a stronger macroeconomy, structural changes towards different types of jobs, more investment in education, support for small business, more foreign direct investment and infrastructure development.</p>
        
            <p>He said tax cuts and flexible work arrangements would also help.</p>
        
            <p>But economist Shamubeel Eaqub said it would take a long time, and the gap had been growing for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably that we were too rich in the past rather than too poor now."</p>
        
            <p>He said the last National government had tried to close the gap, but had not succeeded.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about the fundamentals, how do you get your human capital right, your institutions, your culture? It's easy to say but hard to do. The gap has been building for a long time. Why should we expect to be able to turn it around quickly?"</p>
        
            <p>Eric Crampton, chief economist at the NZ Initiative said some key changes would be needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Making it easier for firms to access capital, including by removing barriers to foreign direct investment, makes labour more productive. Easing regulation so that firms can focus on delivering value rather than undertaking costly compliance activities would also help: at minimum we should expect that regulation delivers more in benefit than it imposes in compliance cost," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Land use regulation makes it hard for people and businesses to move to places where they can be more productive. And, leaving aside measurement issues in state-sector productivity, a sharp focus by government on ensuring that its spending delivers real value would improve real productivity as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Higher wages require stronger productivity growth. Stronger productivity growth is possible, but Treasury just revised downward its expectations for the coming years. More substantial reform would be needed if closing the gap with Australia is still a goal."</p>
