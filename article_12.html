            <p>Members of a pro-democracy group have delivered a petition to Parliament that calls on the government to launch an inquiry into Chinese interference in New Zealand and the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Values Alliance launched the petition in September after a government intelligence report highlighted China as a concern.</p>
        
            <p>Freeman Yu from the NZ Values Alliance handed the petition to ACT Party lawmaker Laura McClure on the steps of Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We Chinese New Zealanders have to tell all New Zealanders: Please wake up to face China's interference in New Zealand," he said. "It's very serious. Please wake up, New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>The petition claimed the Chinese community did not feel safe in New Zealand because of foreign interference from China.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel that it is having a corrosive impact on NZ democracy, NZ's national security and regional security," the petition said. "We believe NZ needs to face up to the problem."</p>
        
            <p>The petition has gathered more than 1000 signatures so far.</p>
