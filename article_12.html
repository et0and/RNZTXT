        <p>
Getting rid of your smart phone is the clever thing to do, Canadian Spencer Campbell says.

            <p>Switching from a smart to a dumb phone is the smart thing to do, according to Canadian Spencer Campbell.</p>
        
            <p>He's part of a back to the future movement extolling the virtues of the dumb phone, phones where you can call, text, and sometimes you can play Snake but that is about it.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell has been on the dumb phone train for over a year now. He runs a YouTube channel called Spencer's Adventures where he tries to show the benefits of a frugal relationship with technology and consumerism.</p>
        
            <p>He made the switch because his life became just too distracted, he tells Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"I was finding that there was just so much distraction that was coming from my smart devices, namely, my smartphone."</p>
        
            <p>And he started to notice his attention span deteriorating, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't really put a finger on exactly what's causing it or why that might be, you just think that you don't maybe have the attention span that you used to."</p>
        
            <p>Not surprising, he said, when the average person checks their smartphone every six and a half minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"It really does take up a large part of your life, whether or not you really intend for that to be the case."</p>
        
            <p>The move has given him more control over his time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to think about it as how to get the most out of the technology without letting it get the most out of you."</p>
        
            <p>The so-called dumb phone means he can disconnect from "all the bad stuff", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want companies extracting my data, or trying to take my attention and get a hold of it in order to show me advertising so that they can meet their bottom line.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to get the things that are beneficial for me out of my technology, but then leaving the rest behind."</p>

            <p>So, does he have a bad case of FOMO? Not so much, Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody else still is connected with these smart devices. So I'm very quickly going to hear about anything that majorly important occurs just from the people immediately around me.</p>
        
            <p>"But the good thing, the thing that I really want to highlight is that I'm missing a lot of the things that a lot of people don't want from those devices as well.</p>
        
            <p>"All of the kind of fear of missing out type of things that you get from social media, all of those things that kind of make you feel less than."</p>
        
            <p>In fact, his phone is so basic even texting is a chore, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if you remember, typing with a T9-style keyboard it's not the fastest way to type, it makes it actually tough to send a text message.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it makes me more likely to reach for the phone call itself and have that more social interaction rather than just talking in sound bites."</p>
        
            <p>So, what does he do with all the free time he now has? Embrace the boredom, Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's important to find those moments of solitude and of boredom. And those things are in a lot more in supply when you use something like a dumb phone, because you're just not able to fill your time with everything all at once."</p>
        
            <p>And if you can't bear the thought of parting with your smartphone, there are ways to slightly dumb it down, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the things that I do with my work phone, so I'm able to still use it but not feel like it's using me too much, is I turn off all of my notifications, that is one thing I've turned all of them off. That's text, that's calls, that's emails, that's everything."</p>
        
            <p>If you're checking your phone every six and a half minutes anyway, you're not going to miss anything, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then another thing is you can turn your phone from colour to black and white, it's in the accessibility settings of your phone, and it just makes it a little less flashy. And you just, you just find something subconsciously makes you not want to look at it as long."</p>
