        <h2>Should renters be told about property risks?</h2>
        <p>
An impending law change means councils must disclose natural hazard risks to prospective home buyers - but what about tenants?.

            <p>Renters have the right to know if they are moving into a home that is at risk of flooding or earthquakes, an advocacy group says.</p>
        
            <p>A law change that comes into force in 2025 means councils must disclose natural hazard risks to prospective home buyers via land information memorandums (LIMs).</p>
        
            <p>But Renters United president Geordie Rogers said prospective tenants were still in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>They should be privy to the same information, especially with the increased frequency of severe weather events, Rogers said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no standard in terms of making sure a renter is informed of what risks posed by the environment are at the property."</p>
        
            <p>Healthy Homes standards required landlords to show their property was properly heated, insulated and has working fire alarms. Rogers believed there should be similar statements regarding flood or earthquake risks.</p>
        
            <p>"Something like that could very much help renters decide whether it's a risk they want to take on when they move in.</p>
        
            <p>"As living in flood prone areas becomes higher risk, we foresee more of these properties being rented out instead of being occupied by their owners."</p>

New Zealand Property Investors' Federation president Sue Harrison says usually the risk to tenants is minimised because investors would have checked for risks already. (file image)

            <p>On the other hand, New Zealand Property Investors' Federation president Sue Harrison said people were aware that most places in New Zealand had some level of risk.</p>
        
            <p>For example, much of Wellington was on a steep hill and earthquake-prone, while the rest was in a tsunami zone - and other risks were unforeseen, Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no real way of predicting when cyclones are going to hit a region, or if anywhere is likely to be more vulnerable than others."</p>
        
            <p>It did not seem to be a pressing issue for tenants, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's, in some cases, the last thing on their mind, and when the investor is buying a property, it's the first thing on their mind - they want a property that's as secure as possible - so it's being, hopefully, taken mostly care of in the first instance.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's probably bigger housing issues to be worried about.</p>
        
            <p>"Renters United has a good part to play in working to help renters, but I suggest there are other conversations that could make a much bigger difference than trying to pin owners to disasters, caused by 'acts of God'."</p>
