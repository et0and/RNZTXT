The Detail - Cracking infrastructure, costly repair bills and strict new earthquake strengthening rules are playing havoc with with Wellington City Council's…
</p>
        
            <p>What's the matter with Wellington? Cracking infrastructure, costly repair bills and a dollar that's far too stretched to cover it all – and it's not the only council slicing services and plans to meet budget bottom lines that are acceptable to ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>
Wellington councillors have agreed to pour more money into repairing the Town Hall to meet the potential final refurbishment cost of around $330 million.

            <p>The cracks are showing in our cool little capital. </p>
        
            <p>Earthquakes themselves are not strictly to blame, but strict new earthquake rules relating to the strengthening of buildings are straining Wellington's budget.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, the job of fixing aging infrastructure is a massive one, which city councillors discovered when they tried to make the books balance at their marathon long term plan meeting last week.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington is not alone. All 78 councils around the country are facing financial stress, and they can't keep borrowing to pay for desperately needed upgrades. </p>
        
            <p>Today on The Detail we talk to The Spinoff's Wellington editor Joel MacManus about what's happening in Wellington – changes like demolishing the unique city-to-sea bridge and pulling back on cycleways.</p>
        
            <p>"This budget forced so many spending cuts," MacManus says.</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at the reasons why ... when you look around Wellington, the town hall is going to cost $330 million, the library is going to be enormously expensive, so many of the pipes are breaking and all of this stuff comes back to earthquake issues. </p>
        
            <p>"The 2016 Kaikoura earthquake caused so many microfractures across Wellington. It's just kind of spread, and over the years – particularly with new earthquake standards coming in – everything suddenly needed to be repaired, everything was broken and costs have just kept ticking up.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that local government's under a lot of strain across New Zealand – Wayne Brown in Auckland made that really clear about the council books.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that central government's looking at local government reform already. Local governments are going to need new funding tools, they're going to need to be reshaped, possibly amalgamated. There are a lot of things that you could say that aren't working about councils right now."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau has talked about keeping rates low and keeping the council within its debt limit. </p>

            <p>Most homeowners glare at their rates bills when they arrive, but they don't always think about the other side – debt.</p>
        
            <p>Former Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby talks to The Detail about how councils manage it.</p>
        
            <p>"[Debt] was a dirty word in local government. You'd go to ratepayers meetings and you'd get beaten up if you had $5 million worth of debt, let alone $50 million or $200 million," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"But it has changed a little bit over time, as people have understood that it's just a financial instrument that should be used where appropriate, particularly in helping fund infrastructure that will last over many, many years."</p>
        
            <p>Crosby talks about the rules around what councils can use debt to finance, how they access it, and what the limits are.</p>
        
            <p>Then he looks ahead to what local government wants from the Beehive this term, given their dire financial straits and the suite of changes that had been proposed under Labour.</p>
        
            <p>"The main thing is that we develop a good partnership with central government, because central government cannot achieve their dreams and ambitions without local government, who often deliver them. We've just got to think a little bit more differently in 2023 than we have over the last 120 years, because that simply hasn't worked."</p>
