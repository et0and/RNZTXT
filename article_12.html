            <p>The schedule for the Black Caps tour of Pakistan next month has been confirmed with the two sides to play five T20 internationals.</p>
        
            <p>Rawalpindi's Pindi Stadium will host games on 18, 20 and 21 of April and Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium will host the last two games on 25 and 27 April.</p>
        
            <p>The tour was given the go-ahead after a security delegation toured Pakistan last month.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third time New Zealand has toured Pakistan since December 2022.</p>
        
            <p>They played two Tests and three ODIs in Pakistan at the turn of that year, before returning in April 2023 to play ten white-ball games.</p>
        
            <p>As was the case last April, this series will clash with the Indian Premier League meaning a number of Black Caps won't be available for the tour.</p>
        
            <p>Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Kane Williamson, Rachin Ravindra, Trent Boult, Glenn Phillips and Lockie Ferguson are all involved in the IPL which starts next week.</p>
        
            <p>The tour will be the last by New Zealand before the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and United States in June.</p>
        
            <p>"In a testament to the unwavering camaraderie between Pakistan Cricket Board and New Zealand Cricket, we are delighted to present the schedule for New Zealand men's team tour to Pakistan 2024," the PCB's director of international cricket Usman Wahla said.</p>
        
            <p>"This tour symbolises the deep-rooted ties and mutual respect that define the relationship between our two cricketing nations.</p>
        
            <p>"Our avid cricket fans and the people of Pakistan will welcome the New Zealand team again and we hope to have yet another competitive series which is a key part of our buildup to this year's ICC T20 World Cup."</p>
