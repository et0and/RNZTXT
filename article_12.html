            <p>Health authorities are investigating after a Perth family claimed their two children were served insect repellent instead of juice at a western suburbs restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>It happened while Marcus and Michele Lemin were out at dinner with their daughters, Hannah and Olivia, on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The girls, aged 11 and 12, ordered cranberry juice but were allegedly served a pink-coloured solution of citronella torch and lamp oil.</p>
        
            <p>"My daughters just went to gulp it down and they both spat the cranberry juice out and said 'it's poisoned'," Ms Lemin said.</p>
        
            <p>"I said 'don't be silly' and took the glass and I went to gulp it down and then spat it out."</p>
        
            <p>Lemin said he ran to the front counter after smelling the liquid and demanded to see the bottle it came from.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed the staff member initially refused, telling him it was "just old cranberry juice".</p>
        
            <p>"He took the bottle [out of the fridge] and placed it under the counter," Lemin said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's when I sort of said, 'No, you need to give me the bottle, I need to see what it is.'"</p>
        
            <p>The ABC was supplied with a picture Lemin took of the bottle.</p>
        
            <p>The Mount Claremont family rushed to Perth Children's Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after receiving advice from the poisons information centre.</p>
        
            <p>"My daughters' â€¦ stomachs were burning, their fingers and hands were tingling," Lemin said.</p>
        
            <p>"They had a headache... it was awful."</p>
        
            <p>The children and Lemin were observed in hospital for several hours before being discharged.</p>
        
            <p>Lemin said he had contacted the local council and made a complaint to the Department of Health.</p>
        
            <p>A department spokesperson said it would support the local council, which is responsible for investigating the family's claims.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's pretty simple, right? You can't manage a restaurant and allow chemicals to be in an area where these sorts of mistakes can happen," Lemin said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a minimum, there needs to be some steps taken to ensure that they basically adhere to the state safe handling of chemicals and hazardous materials."</p>
        
            <p>The restaurant - which the ABC has chosen not to name - said it was investigating the incident but declined to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>"We're lucky that the children weren't younger," Lemin said.</p>
        
            <p>"If they were younger children that this happened to, I'd hate to think what would have happened."</p>
