If you are using excessive glad wrap around your school lunch sarnies, watch out.

            <p>If you are using excessive glad wrap around your school lunch sarnies, watch out.</p>
        
            <p>A group of very dedicated school kids could have your number.</p>
        
            <p>It is estimated the average Kiwi gets through about a kilogram of soft plastic packaging - that is anything that is scrunchable like wrappers and plastic bags - every year.</p>
        
            <p>One Auckland primary school is trying to reduce their reliance on packaged goods and their impact on the environment, one lunchbox at a time.</p>
        
            <p>It was lunchtime at Stanhope Road School in Auckland's Mount Wellington when Checkpoint visited.</p>
        
            <p>But before year five students Kyle and Mitchell tucked into their packed lunches, they donned their green high vis vests and - clipboards in hand - began their shifts as waste management officers.</p>
        
            <p>The idea, dreamt up by sustainability teacher Kim Gee, is all about reducing the kura's impact on the environment.</p>

            <p>Gee said the need to tackle the amount of packaging filling lunch boxes became clear at the end of last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We're coming up to around the 580 mark, so the students did the math if everyone reduces their rubbish by one piece per day, that's quite a few thousand pieces each week, and over a year it's going to make a big difference."</p>
        
            <p>Kyle said it was not about being the food police, it was about doing one's best.</p>
        
            <p>"If some kids don't want to show us [their lunchboxes] they don't have to. We say encouraging words to try to get them to stop getting plastic in their lunch boxes."</p>
        
            <p>Twice a week before assembly, Mitchell and Kyle complete their rubbish run, announcing which class had the least amount of waste. Mitchell said every Friday a green toy rubbish truck was handed out to the class with the least amount of waste as the winning prize.</p>
        
            <p>"We do 3rd, 2nd and 1st place and 1st place gets to have my brother's green dump truck for a week."</p>
        
            <p>The scheme had been running for several months, and quickly became popular. Some students shared tips with Checkpoint for those aiming for less waste.</p>
        
            <p>"Try not to buy stuff at your supermarket that has a lot of plastic on it," one student said.</p>
        
            <p>Another suggested wrapping sandwiches in beeswax wrap. Year 4 student Cole said the best tip was to allow enough time to pack your lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"I always get up early to make my lunch because I have a lot of jobs to do and always grab fruit and vegetables, make a sandwich."</p>
        
            <p>Gee said while the kids cherished the reward of the green truck trophy, they knew the biggest reward was protecting Papatūānuku.</p>
        
            <p>"We really need to think about the environment. My generation probably hasn't been so good at that, and they are going to have to kind of ... make a big effort to try and make things a lot better."</p>
        
            <p>If Stanhope's students RNZ spoke to were anything to go by, they were on track.</p>
        
            <p>"Reduce, reuse and recycle because if you put plastic out in the sea then the fish will eat it."</p>
        
            <p>"If less people are buying plastic more companies will have to stop it because it's not making them money."</p>
        
            <p>"We're saving the environment and if we save the environment there is more future."</p>
        
            <p>The school was hoping to secure funding to take the students on a trip to a pest-free island like Tiritiri Matangi, to show them how this little lunchbox project could have some big results.</p>
