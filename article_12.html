        <h2>Watch: Luigi Mangione screams arrest is 'truly unjust', led into court</h2>
        <p>
The 26-year-old CEO shooting suspect shouted as he was led into court for a planned extradition hearing.
</p>
        
            <p>The 26-year-old Manhattan shooting suspect appeared in a Pennsylvania court for a hearing on whether to extradite him to New York to face murder charges there.</p>
        
            <p>Luigi Mangione shouted "it's truly unjust" and "an insult to the intelligence of the American people" as he was led into court on Tuesday (local time). He is accused of gunning down UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson in the streets of Manhattan.</p>
        
            <p>He added: "It's lived experience!".</p>
        
            <p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona on Monday at a McDonald's restaurant following a five-day manhunt. Police had been trying to retrace his movements in Pennsylvania over the past few days, as well as whether he was helped by an accomplice before or after the brazen shooting, CNN reported.</p>
        
            <p>He had been spotted at the McDonald's by an employee who thought he looked like the gunman in surveillance images released by police. A gun, clothing and fake identifications found in his possession all closely match those used by the shooter, police said.</p>
