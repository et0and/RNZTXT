            <p>Over 5000 people have signed a petition demanding rearrests of six tourists after a brutal bar brawl landed two local nightclub employees in hospital with stab wounds in Rarotonga.</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islands Police Service reported five men needed medical attention, two with stab wounds following the fight on Wednesday, 8 November.</p>
        
            <p>A group of six males between the ages of 18 and 27 were arrested the next day, in early hours of Thursday morning and are facing a range of assault charges.</p>
        
            <p>The group are visiting from Australia for a wedding and were granted bail on Friday afternoon, hours before the ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>The release has sparked outrage in the Cook Islands community, with thousands taking to social media to express their anger and disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>An online petition was launched over the weekend to challenge the decision, demanding the rearrests of the six men.</p>
        
            <p>It amassed over 3500 signatures in the first 24 hours. As of Wednesday, 5140 people have signed the petition.</p>
        
            <p>The online campaign was launched by Teherenui Koteka who hopes the Ministry of Justice and Police Service will hear the public outcry and "revaluate their decision and resend the privilege of bail, holding the individuals in remand until the conclusion of their trial."</p>
        
            <p>She said: "A miscarriage of justice has occurred," and "these dangerous individuals should not have been permitted to re-enter our community".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific has seen videos and photographs of the accused circling online, in which the alleged can be seen laughing and joking about the situation.</p>
        
            <p>This has further fuelled the community's rage.</p>
        
            <p>"The 6 men released on bail claim to be remorseful of their actions but have flaunted their release on social media promoting outrage from Cook Islanders both in the ipukarea and abroad," Koteka exclaims.</p>
        
            <p>Miss World Oceania and Ms Cook Islands 2019 Tajiya Sahay said: "Innocent people were hurt and the culprits seem to have absolutely no remorse".</p>
        
            <p>"They clearly have not learnt their lesson and are laughing at the fact 'they got away with it.' What kind of message does this send?"</p>
        
            <p>Sahay has added her voice, calling calls for justice to be served.</p>

            <p>A seventh local man involved in the fight was remanded in custody for his own safety, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>However, Koteka feels that this is an unjust move.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision inadvertently implies that the six visitors they released are capable of inciting further acts of violence, yet [Ministry of Justice] and [police] have chosen to release them without concern for public safety."</p>
        
            <p>The six defendants have been charged with fighting, assaulting a female, assaulting police officers, common assault and injuring with intent.</p>
        
            <p>A representative of the Cook Islands Police Service stated they will not comment on this matter as it is before the court, and also subject to an ongoing investigation.</p>
        
            <p>They have however stated that "police will be enforcing the court ruling in terms of the strict bail conditions, as is the case with all court rulings".</p>
        
            <p>An eighth man was arrested on Monday, an overseas resident also facing charges of fighting in public.</p>
        
            <p>The defendants are due to appear in court at the end of the week.</p>
        
            <p>The incident took place at the popular Rehab Rarotonga nightclub.</p>
        
            <p>It is currently unclear how the fight started. However, videos online portray a graphic fist fight with staff members stepping in to break up the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Staff can be seen attempting to contain the situation, but this ended up with one employee a victim of stabbing, and another struck over the head with an object, resulting in serious head and eye injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The nightclub announced online that they would not be open the following night "to allow our staff time to regroup following the traumatic events that occurred".</p>
        
            <p>"We pride ourselves in providing a safe and fun environment for our guests to enjoy, and this disgusting behaviour has angered and saddened our entire team."</p>
        
            <p>They reassured the public that the two injured are in "good spirits and on the road to recovery".</p>
