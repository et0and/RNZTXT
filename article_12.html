            <p>A Kiwi man has reportedly been killed following a robbery in South Africa, media are reporting.</p>
        
            <p>According to local news media Daily Voice, the man was trying to stop a robbery in Monte Vista and shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>Police spokesman Malcolm Pojie confirmed to the Daily Voice the man was 49-years-old and died around 1.30pm on Friday on Mostert Street in Monte Vista.</p>
        
            <p>"We have reason to believe that it was a bank-following-robbery as the motive, even though the suspects fled the scene without any loot," the outlet reported Pojie as saying.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicles of the suspects were traced and recovered in a parking lot in Parow."</p>
        
            <p>Daily Voice reported the dead man's parents were the intended victims of the robbery - having returned from shopping mall N1 City with a large amount of money and followed by the offenders.</p>
        
            <p>A local resident told the media outlet the offenders shot the man after he threw a large sledgehammer at their vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said consular officials were "providing advice to the family of a New Zealander who died in South Africa".</p>
