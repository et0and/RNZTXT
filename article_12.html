            <p>As the death toll from a massive earthquake climbs, search and rescue specialists in Vanuatu's Port Vila are still hopeful they can find survivors in multi-storey collapsed buildings.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday night, Vanuatu's president said the police had put the death toll from the earthquake at about 16, with more than 200 people injured.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Urban Search and Rescue team has been focussed on finding survivors in the Billabong building, which pancaked in Tuesday's 7.3 magnitude earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>The crew joined their Australian counterparts, who arrived 24 hours earlier. According to the ABC, they had pulled seven survivors from the rubble so far.</p>
        
            <p>Up to eight people were thought to be trapped in another building.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand deputy national commander Brendan Nally said the team was concentrating all its efforts on finding people alive.</p>
        
            <p>"There's an area where it's obviously not survivable and heavy machinery is clearing the rubble to make access to areas where it possibly is survivable.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got all that high tech gear, but we still do the really old school (thing), everyone's quiet, stop and listen. Listen for knocking and possible signs of life."</p>
        
            <p>He said the crew were familiar with the level of destruction, having responded to both the Christchurch and Kaikōura earthquakes, and were searching for survivors layer by layer.</p>
        
            <p>"The pancaking is inside our knowledge base," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a de-layering job - lifting the floors and the walls off, up and out of the rubble pile and then looking for persons, trapped or otherwise."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to helping clear a landslide that was blocking the main port, a few members of the team were also helping to stabilise the flatten High Commission building, Nally said.</p>
        
            <p>Although everyone managed to escape the building in the earthquake, he said the risk of injury from further collapse due to aftershocks was high and had to be mitigated.</p>
