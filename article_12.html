        <h2>PNG pilgrims' endurance efforts to see the Pope</h2>
        <p>
Thousands have journeyed to see Pope Francis, even if it meant risking their lives and health.

            <p>Just four days ago, Jacob Ten and 48 Catholics from the Mt Hagen Parish were stranded on an overloaded dingy off the coast of the Gulf province after running out of fuel.</p>
        
            <p>Jacob, a serving member of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, is leader of a pilgrimage to Port Moresby to see Pope Francis.</p>
        
            <p>"There were 48 of us. The boat was overloaded. Along the Gulf coast, we ran out of fuel. Our families couldn't get in touch with us. Many thought we were lost," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The group sought refuge on a nearby island while Jacob headed off on another boat to Kerema, the provincial capital, to buy fuel. He later returned with the fuel and two more boats and the journey resumed.</p>

            <p>Jacob's group is called Triumph of the Cross. It's an organisation of Catholic faithful who mediate in tribal conflicts and place crosses in conflict zones when peace has been established.</p>
        
            <p>Like many other members of the church, they live in communities that continue to face enormous challenges around tribal violence and lack of access to services. In many of those communities, the Catholic Church is the primary service provider.</p>
        
            <p>The members of the group were determined to get to Port Moresby even if it meant risking their lives and health.</p>
        
            <p>The group began their journey in Mt Hagen, travelling in two 25-seater buses over two days through the Southern Highlands before reaching the Gulf Province. The road cuts through what used to be near impenetrable jungle and mountainous terrain.</p>
        
            <p>After reaching the first Catholic parish on the Gulf province, weary and bruised, they were convinced by the local parish priest to rest for a few days before proceeding with the sea journey to Port Moresby.</p>
        
            <p>"For us as Catholics, the Pope's message of hope is important," Jacob said. "Many of us won't be able to go to Rome. This is the only opportunity to see the Holy Father up close in Papua New Guinea."</p>

            <p>The Triumph of the Cross from Mt Hagen is just one of several groups who have come to Port Moresby to see the aging Pontiff in person.</p>
        
            <p>Most of them are from rural Papua New Guinea who made the journey using routes that less frequently travelled on because airfares are expensive.</p>
        
            <p>Another group from the Morobe Province travelled through the Menyamya in the Morobe hinterlands to the Gulf then to Port Moresby.</p>
        
            <p>"We have close to 6000 registered people who have come in from outside centers. There will be more," head of team organising the Papal visit, Archbishop Rosario Menezes, said.</p>

            <p>And the other figures were staggering for a comparatively small city like Port Moresby.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-five thousand people have registered to attend the Eucharistic Celebration lead by Pope Francis Sunday. It represents nearly two percent of Papua New Guinea's estimated Catholic population of two million.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly all major hotels have been booked out for the event and various routes will be sealed off starting Friday night by police and military.</p>
        
            <p>For many young Papua New Guineans, this will probably be the first and only time they will get to see a Pontiff in person when he attends a youth festival on Monday after his return from Vanimo.</p>
        
            <p>"I am preparing myself spiritually and physically for the event," Delainey Meckle, a journalism student who is part of Sunday's choir, said.</p>
        
            <p>Pope Francis is expected to land in Port Moresby on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>He will meet with seven Pacific leaders during his four-day visit in PNG, including the prime ministers of Tonga and Vanuatu, the president of Nauru and Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Baron Waqa.</p>
        
            <p>They will join the papal visit programme which begins Friday night and ends midday on Monday, after the Pope's departure.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome our Pacific leaders to PNG as they join our people to participate in receiving His Holiness, Pope Francis; and I look forward to meeting with the three heads of governments in bilateral meetings later while they are here," Prime Minister James Marape said.</p>
