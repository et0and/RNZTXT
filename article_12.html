            <p>Electoral candidates of Asian descent from parties of all political stripes demonstrated their fundraising prowess in the 2023 election, according to figures released by the Electoral Commission last month.</p>
        
            <p>The commission mandates electoral candidates to declare donations of more than $1,500 and overseas donations exceeding $50.</p>
        
            <p>Aside from restrictions placed on overseas donations and contributions made by anonymous donors, there is no limit to the total amount of donations a candidate can receive.</p>
        
            <p>The commission also limited advertising expenses to $32,600, including GST, for the regulated period between 14 July and 13 October last year. Other campaign costs - such as travel, venue hire and office space - do not need to be declared in a candidate's expense return.</p>
        
            <p>If an electorate candidate receives donations exceeding what they spend on their election campaign, the remainder can be redirected to the party's war chest or returned to donors.</p>
        
            <p>An unprecedented 27 candidates of Asian descent competed for a seat in Parliament at the 2023 election, all but one - Nancy Lu - fighting for an electoral position.</p>
        
            <p>What follows is a breakdown of the donations they attracted:</p>
        
            <p>Siva Kilari and Mahesh Muralidhar were easily the best-performing Indian-origin candidates in the National Party, standing in the Manurewa and Auckland Central electorates, respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Kilari raked in donations totalling $110,483, spending $21,015 of this amount.</p>
        
            <p>Muralidhar brought in $109,496, spending $30,056 in his campaign as he tried to win the seat back for National from Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick.</p>
        
            <p>Both campaigns failed and neither candidate was able to get into Parliament via the party list.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Chinese-origin MP Carlos Cheung collected $42,099, spending $31,072 to win the Labour stronghold of Mt Roskill.</p>
        
            <p>Indian-origin candidate Ankit Bansal brought in $28,990, spending $18,345 in a losing battle for the Palmerston North electorate.</p>
        
            <p>A large number of donations for Muralidhar ($104,496) and Bansal ($25,060) came from the National Party, while the party stumped up 100 percent of Cheung's contributions.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, no National Party donations were used to fund Kilari's campaign, with many contributions coming from South Auckland-based companies and individuals.</p>
        
            <p>Korean-origin minister Melissa Lee, National's highest-ranking candidate of Asian heritage at the election, received donations worth $25,662 - 100 percent from the party. Lee spent $24,938 of this amount on her campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Navtej Singh Randhawa, who stood for the Panmure-Ōtāhuhu electorate, also received 100 percent of his donations from the party. Randhawa spent $9,356 of the $9,644 worth of donations he brought in.</p>
        
            <p>Paulo Garcia, who became the first-ever candidate of Filipino descent to win an electorate seat (New Lynn), received almost half his donations, or $13,398, from the party. He spent $19,505 of the $26,198 worth of donations that were collected.</p>
        
            <p>Karunā Muthu, who stood for the Rongotai electorate, received a little less than half his donations, or $10,767, from the party. His election expenses totalled $26,356 - far more than the $18,530 worth of donations he attracted.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Naisi Chen, who was the only MP of Chinese origin in the previous administration, was unable to attract a single donation last year. However, she did end up spending $1,656 on her campaign in the East Coast Bays electorate.</p>
        
            <p>Zulfiqar Butt, an electorate candidate for Rangitikei who was ranked a lowly 68 on Labour's party list, received $25,880 in donations for his campaign. Fifteen thousand dollars came from the party, while the remainder was donated by a single individual, with Butt spending $12,101 on the campaign.</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, high-ranking MP Priyanca Radhakrishnan attracted just $13,500. While the party contributed $4,000 and the E tu union $2,000, Former Onehunga Electorate Trust contributed the lion's share, or $7,500, to the former minister's campaign.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Kharag Singh from Botany and sitting MP Vanushi Walters from Upper Harbour spent more than what they received as donations ($2,000 each). Singh spent $5,618 on his campaign, while Sri Lankan-origin Walters spent $6,492.</p>
        
            <p>Singh's donation came from one South Auckland business, while Labour's contribution comprised 100 percent of Walters' total.</p>
        
            <p>Chen and Walters lost their place in Parliament and weren't able to make it back into the Beehive on their party's list either.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party had seven electorate candidates of Asian origin in the 2023 election.</p>
        
            <p>Parmjeet Parmar from Pakuranga (now a list MP), Himanshu Parmar from Hamilton East, Rahul Chopra from Mt Roskill, Pothen Joseph from Mangere and Ankita Lynn from Wigram are of Indian descent.</p>
        
            <p>Christine Young from Tauranga and Rae Ah Chee from Takanini are of Chinese heritage.</p>
        
            <p>All seven candidates filed returns stating they received zero donations and spent nothing on their election campaigns.</p>
        
            <p>Lawrence Xu-Nan, the Green Party's likely first-ever MP of Chinese origin who stood in the Epsom electorate, collected $2,317 in donations from a hospitality company.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens' other Asian origin electorate candidates - Lan Pham (now a list MP) from Banks Peninsula, Golriz Ghahraman (now a former MP) from Kelston, Francisco Hernandez from Dunedin, Sapna Samant from Maungakiekie and Neelu Jennings from Hutt South - have declared zero donations.</p>
        
            <p>While Xu-Nan and Samant's campaign spending stood at just $65, Pham spent the most - $2,201.</p>
        
            <p>Hernandez also ended up spending $1,271, according to his returns, with most of it going to an advertisement placed in a local newspaper ($916).</p>
