            <p>Production has commenced in Wellington on Puli and the Tiger, a Tamil short film exploring how immigrant children connect with their elders and homeland through tradition and storytelling.</p>
        
            <p>The film's director, Jessica George, pays homage to the close ties she had with her grandparents when she was younger.</p>
        
            <p>"[The film] was inspired by my childhood growing up with my grandparents and the relationship I have with them," she says.</p>
        
            <p>George, who is half-Indian and was raised in Lower Hutt, says this is her first time directing a drama in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"My parents got divorced when I was eight, and I lived with my dad and his parents," she recalls.</p>
        
            <p>Her father is from the southern Indian city of Chennai, while her mother is P훮keh훮.</p>
        
            <p>George says the film addresses the universal cultural divide experienced by third-culture kids across different migrant communities.</p>
        
            <p>Initially aspiring to be a visual effects artist after being inspired by Marvel movies, she soon recognised challenges associated with the role and instead embraced video production.</p>
        
            <p>During her undergraduate studies, George produced a climate change documentary titled VAKA (2019), which premiered at the United Nations' COP25, and The Lascar (2023), which screened at Wh훮nau M훮rama (NZIFF) 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been working on the project since January 2023," George says.</p>
        
            <p>She collaborated with Wellington-based writer Esteban Jaramillo-Ulloa for the film's script.</p>
        
            <p>"I came up with a treatment for the story, and Esteban turned my seed of an idea into a fully fleshed narrative," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Both were inspired by Studio Ghibli films, particularly their treatment of magical realism.</p>

            <p>Wellington-based producer Rajeev Mishra is backing the film.</p>
        
            <p>"Jessica approached me last year to be her producer and mentioned it was a Tamil-language film, which was really exciting," says Mishra, who has worked in film and TV since 2006.</p>
        
            <p>He felt an immediate connection with the script and noted the challenges of finding a mentor and producer in the New Zealand film industry.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw myself in Jessica from 15 years ago and felt a responsibility to help tell this story," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Mishra says unconscious bias in the industry often sidelines diverse creators.</p>
        
            <p>"People might not realise they're doing it, but it happens," he says.</p>
        
            <p>However, Mishra acknowledges a degree of progress in diversity within the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"It's much more diverse now, which is great," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Both George and Mishra are committed to assembling a diverse cast and crew.</p>
        
            <p>"Rajeev and I are passionate about diversity and representation for Asian creators," George says.</p>
        
            <p>She believes it is important to hire Tamil-speaking actors and an Asian crew.</p>
        
            <p>The cast includes Tamil-speaking actors Hayaa Sinh, Prabha Ravi, Archana Gideon and Nanthika Sabesan.</p>
        
            <p>Mishra says short films are challenging due to a general lack of commercial revenue, but they serve as powerful artistic expressions.</p>
        
            <p>"Short films are often about telling an important story," he says.</p>
        
            <p>He believes Puli and the Tiger represents a voice rarely seen on New Zealand screens, which motivated him to produce the film.</p>
        
            <p>George and Mishra aim to complete post-production by the end of the year, hoping to enter the festival circuit in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>George wants the film to help other immigrants to connect with their elders.</p>
        
            <p>"The film explores the relationships we have with our immigrant grandparents and how we overcome cultural barriers and the fear of ageing to connect with them," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope viewers think about their own grandparents, build stronger relationships and preserve their stories because that's our history and it's worth cherishing."</p>
