            <p>An international conference in Auckland this week brings together gambling researchers developing methods to get people to kick the habit.</p>

During the June quarter the gaming machine industry made $257 million in profits nationwide, while venues in south Auckland made $27m.

            <p>Although fewer people might be gambling these days, that doesn't mean less money is being lost. </p>
        
            <p>"Over recent years, the rate of participation - or how many people are playing the pokies - tends to be decreasing," Associate Professor of Psychology at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) Simone Rodda says. </p>
        
            <p>"Young people aren't really starting at the rate that they did 20 years ago, but the rate of problems remain the same - over a billion (New Zealand) dollars in expenditure last year and that's being done by a smaller number of people - that's a little concerning."  </p>
        
            <p>Rodda is speaking at the International Gambling Conference, being held in Auckland this week by AUT and the Problem Gambling Foundation.</p>
        
            <p>"When people develop a problem, they are spending more money than what they used to," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"The opportunities to gamble have increased - not only do we have gambling venues but we can buy Lotto tickets online, we can do sports betting online, you can bet anytime of the day or the night now."</p>
        
            <p>One of the areas growing in prevalence is in "loot boxes", through online video games. </p>
        
            <p>Tegan Charnock is a PhD candidate at the University of Tasmania, researching how excessive video game play can lead to gambling issues, and is also speaking at the conference.</p>
        
            <p>Charnock describes loot boxes as "a virtual lucky dip that gamers can buy with their real world money".</p>
        
            <p>"The items in the loot box are randomised, so you don't know what virtual items you might get. What you get inside them could be high or low value, but the really risky part is you don't know before purchasing - only after opening," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"Psychologically speaking, if we think about how people learn behaviours, we know that the most effective way to teach someone a new behaviour is to reward that person for completing the desired behaviour. The trick here is though that you don't reward them every time, you reward them sometimes or intermittently. Some video games features and loot boxes in particular work very similarly to this." </p>
        
            <p>Charnock says although some countries - such as Belgium and the Netherlands - have banned loot boxes, game users can find ways to access these loot box games if they really want to.</p>
        
            <p>Rodda says the traditional ways to combat gambling via phone or counselling service are still available, but to alleviate the stress on these providers, she's part of a group creating and trailing new apps to give people immediate support.</p>
        
            <p>"Gambling Habit Hacker was my app - basically we set the survey up that they would get a notification three times a day," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"The survey would ask someone if they are in a dangerous situation - so are they having arguments with people, are they near a gambling venue, are they feeling depressed? We would also ask them about their gambling urges and about their self-efficacy or their confidence to be able to keep going. If they said they were starting to waver or they were in a tricky situation or they were thinking of gambling, we would, through an algorithm, deliver a set of strategies that would be useful to that person." </p>
