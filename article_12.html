            <p>Tuvalu's Transport, Energy, and Communications Minister Simon Kofe has expressed doubt about Australia's reliability in addressing the climate crisis.</p>

            <p>Kofe was reacting to the latest report by report by the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, which found that Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom are responsible for over 60 percent of emissions generated from extraction of fossil fuels across Commonwealth countries since 1990.</p>
        
            <p>Kofe told RNZ Pacific that the report proves that Australia has essentially undermined its own climate credibility.</p>
        
            <p>He said that there is a sense of responsibility on Tuvalu, being at the forefront of the impacts of climate change, to continue to advocate for stronger climate action and to talk to its partners.</p>
        
            <p>"When the climate crisis really hits these countries, I think that might really get their attention. But that might actually be too late when countries actually begin to take this issue seriously," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He noted that Australia approved the extension of three more coal mines last month, which demonstrates that "there's a lot of work to be done".</p>
        
            <p>"I think [that] kind of shoots their own credibility in the in the climate space."</p>
        
            <p>While Pacific leaders have endorsed Australia's bid to host the United Nations climate change conference, or COP31, in 2026, Kofe said that if Australia really wants to take leadership on the climate front, then they need to show it in their actions.</p>
        
            <p>"They are in control of their own policies and decisions. All we can do is continue to talk to them and put pressure on them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just have to keep pressuring our partner, Australia, to do the to do the right thing."</p>
