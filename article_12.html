            <p>The name of New Zealand's newest sports franchise has been revealed as Auckland FC.</p>
        
            <p>After months of speculation the team to play in the men's A-League football competition from next year avoided using Knights in the name and opted for a more straight forward approach.</p>
        
            <p>A desire to anchor the team to its home city and reflect a strong football heritage is why the name was chosen, according to the franchise.</p>
        
            <p>The team will wear electric blue - building on Auckland's traditional royal blue.</p>
        
            <p>The newly revealed shield contains a graphic tribute to Rangitoto and Auckland's skyline, and with an ascending 'A' for Auckland in its centre. The Black Knight visor and the stripes in the badge link the crest to club founder Bill Foley and the other teams alongside Auckland that form part of the Black Knight Football Group.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC will join the A-League Men at the beginning of the 2024-25 season in October this year. The season runs until May and includes a 26-round regular season followed by a finals series playoff, with 12 home games confirmed to be played at Mount Smart Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Club chief executive Nick Becker said more New Zealanders play football than any other sport and "we have seen first-hand how much Auckland has embraced football".</p>
        
            <p>"We are building the elite professional team that Auckland deserves. We want to be successful on the pitch, and we want to create a club that represents TƒÅmaki Makaurau for generations to come."</p>

            <p>Steve Corica, head coach and one of the A-Leagues' most successful players and managers, said: "I'm looking forward to helping build the club from the ground up, foster a strong attacking team known for their entertaining style of football, and attract some of the best talent to grow with the club. We'll have some exciting player announcements to make from June 2024."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC will launch its A-League Women's team to play in the 2025-26 season early next year.</p>
