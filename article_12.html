</p>
        
            <p>There are household names (Duncan Garner, Carmel Sepuloni), faces you will recognise (Bubbah, Suzanne Paul) and top class athletes current (Mea Motu) and retired (Christian Cullen) amongst the rollcall of castaways announced on Sunday for the upcoming season of popular reality TV show, Celebrity Treasure Island (CTI) .</p>
        
            <p>This year's diverse group of New Zealanders has been split into two teams of nine - Team Aihe and Team Wētā. Each player has signed up to eat rice and beans on the beach for weeks, with the aim of raising money for their chosen charity. One will go on to join the line up of previous winners including James Mustapic, Chris Parker, Jesse Tuke and Matty McLean.</p>
        
            <p>Former castaway (class of 2022) Perlina Lau has taken a long hard look at the line up, and served up her picks for top of the class, the biggest threats and the dark horses who could surprise us all on season six.</p>
        
            <p>
Team Wētā L-R standing are Aidee Walker, Casey Kopua, Spankie Jackzon, Wairangi Koopu, Duncan Garner and seated L-R is Vinnie Woolston, James Rolleston, Carmel Sepuloni, Gaby Solomona.

            <p>Duncan Garner, broadcaster - Garner is an outdoors guy. He'll be extremely comfortable and adaptable in the wilderness that is the CTI huts. Probably a nice reprieve from the studio. The former political editor will also love figuring out strategy and analysing alliances. He could get quite far.</p>
        
            <p>Gabby Solomona, actor - We think Gabby will be hugely entertaining and fun to watch. Sassy and straight-up, the Samoan actor could easily become a fan favourite. When morale's down, Gabby will perk everyone up which could see her cruise along as an unassuming contestant…. at first.</p>
        
            <p>Spankie Jackszon, drag superstar - Surely - surely will be a crowd favourite. We can easily see Spankie making it to the final few. Sometimes charisma and being entertaining can be the best form of trickery. And getting that make-up on each day. The cameras roll up at 8am… it's going to be an early start for this RuPaul's Drag Race: Down Under season 2 winner.</p>
        
            <p>Michelle Langstone, actor - Being quietly determined, tall and charming is a huge part of this game and Langstone is all three of those things. She'll make for a great team player but will slowly be recognised as a threat.</p>
        
            <p>Bubbah, comedian - The woman you know as Tina From Turners has also had a hoon on Taskmaster, so the Samoan-New Zealand comedian is quick-thinking. Could she draw on these spontaneous skills in crafty challenges? Maybe it will help her bond with new mates over beans and rice. We know she's committed. She got the Taskmaster crew's faces tattooed on her arm. She's not here to play. Or rather, that's exactly what she's going to do.</p>
        
            <p>Casey Kopua, former Silver Fern - We can imagine this Silver Ferns legend sitting back and taking it all in before figuring out her strategy. Quietly. As a mum of three, she knows how to lead - so will she be put up for captain? Or will she be put to the test?</p>
        
            <p>Tamati Coffey, former politician/broadcaster - A broadcaster, politician, former weatherman. Could you be any more prepared for a reality TV show? Coffey knows how cameras work - when he's on and when he's off. He could stir up drama… someone needs to. He'll know how to be on the d-low and navigate group dynamics. He's also got two young kids at home - this guy's adaptable and prepared for anything.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Mea Motu, boxer - She may be the reluctant contestant but she's there and she's going to be focused and strong. I can't see Motu putting up too much with camp politics and drama. She seems like an obvious threat - so how early on will she become a target?</p>
        
            <p>Aidee Walker, actor/director - Walker could be an unexpected threat. She's an actor - she knows how to come across as chill and unthreatening. I wouldn't be surprised to see her in the top six.</p>
        
            <p>Christian Cullen, All Blacks legend - He's giving captain, he's giving sporty dad, he's giving useful. But his background is an obvious threat so I wouldn't be surprised if he's propelled to team leader early on. He's a threat BUT a threat that gets pretty far we reckon.</p>
        
            <p>Wairangi Koopu, former Warrior - Like all the other sports stars, Koopu will no doubt be all over the strategy in this game. He's an obvious target but he'll be able to take the challenges on. Do you put him up for defence or protect?</p>
        
            <p>Carmel Sepuloni, former deputy PM - Strong personality + leadership qualities + politician = Classic CTI 101 threat. We're picking the former deputy PM will be an obvious and clear target from Day 1.</p>
        
            <p>Millen Baird, actor - Baird will be hilarious to watch. It'll be laugh-a-minute but don't be fooled; he's got plenty of insider help from his wife Siobhan Marshall who got incredibly far in her season. He'll keep the morale high and he's got the physique which also means he's toast. Remember Guy Montgomery from 2021? Well we all saw what happened there so he'll need to be protected from the start or he'll be a goner.</p>
        
            <p>James Rolleston, actor - The beloved star of Boy is bringing a ton of life experience to CTI. At 19, he had to learn to walk and talk again after surviving a horrific car crash that left him with a traumatic brain injury. He's got the grit required to take home bags of money for charity.</p>
        
            <p>Janaye Henry, comedian - Comedians have historically done well on CTI; they don't win, but we enjoy their company. They also often end up being one half of the season's 'unlikely friendship', so even if Henry doesn't add a win to her Billy T nomination, we could see that narrative unfold for her.</p>
        
            <p>JP Foliaki, actor - The star of the Red White and Brass theatre performance has a lot on his CV. Maybe he can entertain his team with his performance poetry? Perhaps he can show them what he opened with for rapper Sean Kingston?</p>
        
            <p>Suzanne Paul, informercial queen - Paul won't be the only one relying on her natural glow on the island. Why does it sound like a boomer wrote this? Will she become a 'Camp Mum' figure? Or will a team be unsure where to place her and put her up for early elimination?</p>
        
            <p>Vinnie Woolston, international model - Woolston's attention to his physique may mean he has secret strength (or not-so-secret, going from his steamy poses). But he also reckons his strength is getting along with everyone. It's a team game Vinnie…. until it's not.</p>
