            <p>Community leaders attending the inaugural Asian Mental Health and Wellbeing Summit in Auckland on Wednesday have called for improved visibility and resources to improve Asian mental health.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 200 participants attended the first edition of the summit, which was organised by the Asian Family Services.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly Feng, chief executive at Asian Family Services, hoped the summit would shed some light on barriers that existed in the mental health sector.</p>
        
            <p>"The demographic population is changing," Feng said. "The huge service gap is there from top down, bottom up, every level, so they really need to think ahead in the strategy level and funding level, [and consider] how to address those challenges and look at solutions for the future."</p>

            <p>The 2021 New Zealand Asian Wellbeing and Mental Health Report found that 44.4 percent of Asians exhibited symptoms of depression, with the rate particularly high among younger Asians at 61.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey believed there was a lack of mental health and addiction support in the Asian community.</p>
        
            <p>Doocey called on members of the audience to share suggestions on ways that support networks could be strengthened.</p>
        
            <p>"What we can find with people is that if they don't see themselves or identify with the services," he said. "Quite often that can be a barrier for people to reach out for help.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why it's important that we look to support more Asian mental health and addiction services, as well as growing a culturally competent workforce as well that can connect with the Asian community and support them in getting the help they need."</p>

            <p>Doocey said a lot of solutions to mental health issues were already in the community - "we just need to identify them and elevate them".</p>
        
            <p>Melissa Lee, minister for ethnic communities, helped to launch a series of videos of New Zealanders from different Asian backgrounds sharing their experiences.</p>
        
            <p>Dubbed the "Flourishing Asian Community Resource", the series aimed to make migrants feel less isolated, as they would see others who had experienced similar things before them.</p>
        
            <p>"I think understanding that it is not something strange ... that this is actually a pathway and experience that will actually only make them stronger and for them to actually realize that they don't have to be alone, but there is a lot of help out there," Lee said.</p>

            <p>People at the summit were divided into different groups to discuss policy, research, lived experiences, services and community.</p>
        
            <p>Many participants supported the idea of having a national strategy to tackle Asian mental health, improved pathways of submission, better advocacy, better resourcing, funding and representation of Asian populations at leadership.</p>
        
            <p>Asian Family Services also launched its Kia Ora Ake Service, which would provide school-based mental health assistance to young Asian New Zealanders in Counties Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>Gaorui Wang, a Chinese senior who also attended the meeting, wanted the government to pay more attention to senior migrants who didn't speak English and were isolated.</p>
        
            <p>"These seniors are often isolated and are at risk of developing depressed feelings," Wang said. "I hope the government can do more to help them."</p>
