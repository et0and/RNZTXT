            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced additional sanctions on Russian entities, alongside further support for Ukraine's recovery and rebuild.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the world marks three years on Monday since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>The new sanctions target entities involved in Russia's military-industrial complex, its energy sector, North Korean support of Russia, and the forced relocation and re-education of Ukrainian children.</p>
        
            <p>"Russia's illegal invasion has brought three years of devastation to Ukraine's people, environment, and infrastructure," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The government will also make a $3 million contribution to the World Bank-administered Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fund supports the Government of Ukraine to maintain services, conduct relief efforts, and plan and implement recovery, reconstruction and reforms," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>The Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022, a month after the invasion, with New Zealand imposing sanctions on more than 1800 individuals and entities.</p>
        
            <p>These also include a ban on all Russian and Belarusian government and military aircraft and vessels from New Zealand, a ban on exports to Russian and Belarusian military and security forces, and a suspension of bilateral Foreign Ministry consultations with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>Several trade measures, including a 35 percent tariff on all Russian imports to New Zealand have also been imposed.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury University professor and Ukrainian Studies Association of Australia and New Zealand president Natalia Chaban told Morning Report  a peace deal over Ukraine would involve "difficult negotiations" and compromises were "inevitable".</p>
        
            <p>"I think what we can see now from the Ukrainian response is that Ukraine would apreciate to be treated as a partner.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not only Ukraine who is excluded from these negotiations - we're talking about European partners and they are very important partners too."</p>
        
            <p>Chaban said all Ukrainians would have been "surprised and shocked" by US president Donald Trump's remarks describing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator.</p>
        
            <p>"There definitely is a feeling of uncertainty and shock and suprise, if not disillusionment and betrayal," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These tensions are not usual.</p>
        
            <p>"These three years showed that Ukraine is [a country] that is well known to the world and recognised and has a positive reputation."</p>
        
            <p>Chaban told Morning Report she was unsure whether Ukraine would be forced to give up some territory to strike a peace deal.</p>
        
            <p>"In an ideal world we want to go back to the borders of 1991.</p>
        
            <p>"What we do know is that the Ukrainian army at the moment is one of the most capable armies in Europe.</p>
        
            <p>"And there is New Zealand contribution to that."</p>
