            <p>Analysis - Super Rugby Aupiki is back this weekend, with the same number of teams but twice as many matches. It's been an interesting last 12 months for the women's game - the Black Ferns had a poor return last year, while their Sevens counterparts have only just picked up their first World Series victory of the season as they build up to the Olympics. It's hoped this edition of Aupiki can recapture some of the buzz that the Black Ferns' World Cup campaign generated, but professional sport is a challenging landscape. Winning off the field is pretty important for the four teams, but here's a look at how they are hoping to win on it:</p>

            <p>Overview: The defending champs come in with far more expectations on them than they had last season, because a year ago they hadn't won a game and were pretty much written off as contenders. However, a stunning run of results saw them reach the final and knock off the highly fancied Chiefs Manawa in a thrilling final.</p>
        
            <p>The good: What they're doing down there is clearly working. Matatū have clearly managed to establish a solid and successful culture in a short time, despite having to draw from a wide geographic region and essentially being a start-up enterprise. Whitney Hansen takes the step up to the head coaching role, perhaps on the pathway to become the first ever female Black Ferns coach.</p>
        
            <p>The bad: There's a target on their backs now and that's been aimed during the off-season too. Matatū have had Renee Holmes and Grace Steinmetz leave for the Manawa, taking not only their talents but a bit of valuable IP as well.</p>
        
            <p>Who to keep an eye on: Liv McGoverne returns from a season in England to join an exciting back line. Di Hiini and the impressive Rosie Kelly are a very effective inside back combination, while Amy du Plessis and Martha Mataele will score plenty of tries.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Overview: 'Stacked' is the best way to describe Manawa this season, with the aforementioned additions from down south among the 18 players in the squad who have test experience. Their season last year was one of dominance that just fell over at the final hurdle, and even then that final loss came down to a missed goal kick. It's fair to say Manawa are looking like the most formidable team in Super Rugby Aupiki this season.</p>
        
            <p>The good: Up front, Manawa have also signed World Cup winner Krystal Murray, Fiji's Bitila Tawake and experienced Japanese international Seina Saito. It means their already powerful scrum now has an entire rotation of test props.</p>
        
            <p>The bad: 'Stacked' is also exactly the same way Manawa were described last season and they came up short. They were highly dependant on their set piece, once Matatū had unlocked that area Manawa didn't seem to have any sort of plan B. It's something new coach Crystal Kaua will be wanting to address, although the extended season will give her plenty of time for that.</p>
        
            <p>Who to keep an eye on: Chelsea Semple (Alley) is back, after having a baby. She ran at first five in the Manawa'a pre season game against the Blues, despite playing most of her rugby in the midfield it's likely she will get a bit more time in the 10 jersey backing up Hazel Tubic.</p>

            <p>Overview: There's plenty of firepower in the Blues line-up this season, and the bulk of their squad are coming off winning an FPC title with Auckland. They will be out to prove a point after a disappointing campaign in 2023, they finished last and that really shouldn't have been possible considering how much talent they had on their books.</p>
        
            <p>The good: This is very much Ruahei Demant's team, with the 2022 Women's World Player of the Year capable of playing an open and conservative game at her own pace. This is a skill that will become more valuable as the women's game becomes more professional, she also has the very in form Katelyn Vahaakolo to utilise outside her. Vahaakolo was herself Women's Breakthrough Player of the Year in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The bad: The biggest issue the Blues women have is the same as their men's side. All the names are there, they just can't put it together, so there will be plenty of pressure on the coaching staff of Willie Walker, Linda Itunu and Carlos Spencer to make this year's squad click.</p>
        
            <p>Who to keep an eye on: Niall Williams-Guthrie, sister of Sonny Bill and Black Ferns Sevens and NRLW veteran, has played less than a dozen 15-a-side rugby games in her life. However, she brings the experience of a professional career that no one else in the changing rooms and will give the younger players a role model to follow.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Overview: The Poua are coming off a 2023 season that saw glimpses of their potential, most notably when they shot out to a big lead over Chiefs Manawa in their first game and also beating the Blues in their last. They also have a new coach in Ngatai Walker, he's joined by Mel Bosman and Emma Jensen, they all have to make things work fast in order for this to be a successful campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The good: After chatting with the other Aupiki skippers, the Poua have a reputation for physicality that is unmatched. While it has manifested itself into indiscipline in the past, if it can be channelled into the right places it'll be a real strength. Joanah Ngan-Woo, the Black Ferns' heroine of the World Cup final, has moved to number eight in a bid to resurrect her test career.</p>
        
            <p>The bad: Battlers might be a tad harsh, but the Poua only have two current Black Ferns in Layla Sae and Iritana Hohaia. They've lost Carys Dallinger, who discovered she was Australian less than a year ago, and Ayesha Leti-I'iga to injury, so that takes away a couple of key weapons.</p>
        
            <p>Who to keep an eye on: Te Rauoriwa Gapper takes over the 10 jersey from Dallinger after mostly sitting on the bench for Matatū, she's been a constant presence in the highly successful Canterbury FPC side over the years.</p>
