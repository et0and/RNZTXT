Analysis - As if Sam Cane hasn't been beaten up enough this season, even his words were given the same treatment this week, Jamie Wall writes.

            <p>Analysis -As if Sam Cane hasn't been beaten up enough this season, even his words were given the same treatment this week. His utterance that NZ Rugby should have a think about letting players plying their trade overseas be eligible for the All Blacks brought up a discussion as old as professional rugby itself.</p>
        
            <p>To be clear, what Cane fully said: "A lot of the Springboks have shown the ability to play in League One and go back to international rugby fairly quickly and continue to play their best. The challenge for us, who are on the shorter-term deals in the hope of playing international rugby again, is that we play really well here.</p>
        
            <p>"Should we get the opportunity to represent the All Blacks again, we've got to show we've improved our games. If not, kick off where we left off. If we can do that, maybe that conversation can be had with NZ Rugby, but I can also see the other side. Having experienced players to bring through young guys in the New Zealand game is equally important.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously a lot to consider and well above my pay grade."</p>
        
            <p>While it is rather ironic that Cane is mentioning his pay grade while on a serious money-making venture sanctioned by his employers, the key word in there is 'maybe'. It somewhat nullifies the headlines saying that Cane is 'urging' NZR to change their policy on selection, a topic that the national union was unsurprisingly quick to shut down.</p>
        
            <p>Really, the quote the incumbent All Black captain made was more about pumping up the tires of the Japanese competition that he's playing in, given that he's now one of the main faces of it. Japanese rugby long been thought of as an easy way for New Zealanders to go pick up a bit of coin at the end of, and now during, their test careers. That perception should start to change now that League One is full of current Springboks, Pacific Island players and now a great deal of the All Black side that just competed at the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>That is, of course, if New Zealand rugby fans actually start paying attention to it, and that's a challenge that rolls into another move recently by Super Rugby teams to expand their horizons. The Chiefs and Blues announced pre-season fixtures with Japanese teams, to go along with the Crusaders' planned tour to Europe in February.</p>
        
            <p>Blues CEO Andrew Hore made no secret of the fact that the plan was to get bigger than just pre season games.</p>
        
            <p>"As countries develop stronger and stronger leagues, that ability to cross over with different leagues around the world comes into play. Rugby is a global game, and we want to be part of that as it evolves. This is a significant step to that globalisation of the club game." Hore told media, clearly hinting at a situation where the best domestic sides from around the world play each other.</p>
        
            <p>Again, nothing new, but the idea of a world club competition actually finally happening does seem more plausible than ever - with Cane and his fellow All Black teammates' situations the key indicator. But there's still one pretty big issue about Super Rugby teams playing against international club sides: Would anyone in New Zealand actually care?</p>
        
            <p>This country's awareness of rugby matters outside its own borders is shockingly limited, first off not helped by a generally earned feeling of superiority given the state of the rugby world over the last 120 or so years. New Zealanders have never really needed to watch any other country's domestic competition (not helped by the time of night they are on), to the point that you'd be hard pressed to find many people who could tell you what 14 teams make up the Top 14, or what the URC even is.</p>

            <p>The brand recognition here is non-existent aside from provincial sides like Munster who at least have a connection to the All Blacks. Then there's the challenge of loosening the grip the NRL, with its much more friendly timeslots, has on secondary attention of rugby fans here.</p>
        
            <p>Is it going to stop plans forging ahead? Probably not, but it is at least worth considering given Super Rugby's history of Icarus-like behaviour in terms of expansion. At least with the Japanese sides now full of familiar faces, it'll be an easier sell to a market that needs some form of reinvigoration.</p>
