The Detail - There's no turning back when it comes to electric vehicles, even without the clean car discount that lured buyers, and new road user costs.

            <p>Being able to start your car from miles away with an app on your phone, voice commands and of course cutting that carbon.</p>
        
            <p>Electric vehicles may be the way to a more climate friendly future, but there is still some pushback against them.</p>
        
            <p>Today, The Detail speaks to a motoring journalist and an EV car company manager about the positives and the pitfalls.</p>
        
            <p>Richard Edwards, the managing editor of Auto Media Group, says EVs are one of his passions.</p>
        
            <p>"I do love them for the technology and what they offer," he says. </p>
        
            <p>"You've got some relatively simple mass market cars now doing things that only super cars could do 10 years ago."</p>
        
            <p>Warren Willmot is the New Zealand manager for Chinese brand BYD - a new name on the motoring scene but already the world's largest electric car manufacturer.</p>
        
            <p>He says his business is "all about safeguarding the future" and "reducing those carbon emissions."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's had a pretty high uptake of electric vehicles recently. From 2021-22, New Zealand had the third highest increase of electric vehicle sales in the world, after India and Brazil.</p>
        
            <p>Part of this was due to the Labour government's clean car discount, which gave electric vehicle buyers a rebate, while high-emitting CO2 vehicles had to pay a tax. </p>
        
            <p>This ended in December, under the new government. </p>
        
            <p>Now there is a plan is to install 10,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that is an admirable plan... so really the devil on that one is going to be in the detail," Edwards says.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest, I don't have that many issues charging at the moment. I very rarely have to queue for a charger.... there have been some holes particularly in the South Island but a lot of those have been tidied up over the last year or two - and the private market is continuing to do that at pace."</p>
        
            <p>Willmot explains the clean car standard in the podcast, which aims to encourage more imports of low emissions vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>It charges importers for vehicles with high CO2 emissions and gives credits for low emissions.</p>
        
            <p>This tax could be passed on to the consumer though, so could bring a "ute-tax" of a different sort to the market, ironic given National's campaign against such a measure when it was in opposition. </p>
        
            <p>"I think the industry has a combined view that the clean car standard is a good thing, because it forces manufactures or importers to bring in as lower emitting vehicles," Willmot says.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as the rebate and clean car discount - for our business it was fabulous - our customers were getting a lot of money off the government to make those decisions but even without the rebate, the cost-benefit of owning an EV outweighs buying a petrol or ICE [internal combustion engine] car."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to the criticisms of EVs, Edward's certainly well aware of them - 'range anxiety' being one of the big ones.</p>
        
            <p>"I appreciate some people in some cases might not find them as useful - people who have to do a lot of miles every day of the week," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"An EV - I will be quite blunt - is not necessarily the right vehicle for everyone at the moment. But if you do do some miles, you don't have to spend $80,000 on an EV .... there's plenty of good options in the used market, if you can afford it."
