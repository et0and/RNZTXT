            <p>Papua New Guinea's Police Commissioner, David Manning, has been reinstated after being stood down following riots and looting on 10 January.</p>
        
            <p>That rioting was sparked by a police protest after unannounced deductions from their wages, which the government blamed on a glitch.</p>
        
            <p>The protest led to a riot causing the deaths of more than 20 people, widespread looting and hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Amnesty International called on authorities to protect human rights in response to the riots.</p>
        
            <p>The 14-day state of emergency following the violence has now ended.</p>
        
            <p>The National newspaper reported Prime Minister James Marape announced Manning's reinstatement, and that of Taies Sansan as the Department of Personnel Management Secretary, after administrative preliminary investigations concluded.</p>

            <p>However, Treasury Secretary Andrew Oake and Finance Secretary Samuel Penias remained suspended "due to their failure to update the salary system, which led to the events of Jan 10", Marape said.</p>
        
            <p>Marape also said Deputy Police Commissioner Dr Philip Mina was being suspended.</p>
        
            <p>A commission of inquiry will be appointed to look into the police force.</p>
        
            <p>"The commission of inquiry will be headed by a Judge from the Supreme Court and National Court, and will be concluded as soon as possible, to look into the structure, the operation, and their ethics of conduct," Marape said.</p>
        
            <p>"The country deserves to have a police force that is effective and efficient. We will leave no stone unturned as we recover, reboot and restore."</p>
