            <p>The term "waka jumper" has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
        
            <p>The colloquial phrase, which is used almost exclusively in New Zealand politics, is among several new words the dictionary has included in its latest update.</p>
        
            <p>It defines a waka jumper as a member of Parliament who moves from one political party to another during a parliamentary term.</p>
        
            <p>The dictionary says that the phrase has been in use since 1999.</p>
        
            <p>"Waka jumping (1999) is the name for this practice of party switching, and a waka jumper (1999) is a member of Parliament who engages in it."</p>
        
            <p>The most recent waka jumping legislation passed in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Other New Zealand words added to the dictionary included:</p>
        
            <p>There has been an increase in the number of te reo Māori words being added to the dictionary with experts saying it's a sign of the times as more Māori and non-Māori use certain words.</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland linguist Dr Peter Keegan said the addition of the words did not surprise him given they were used often in the media and people in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The one that may have caught some by surprise was 'Aotearoan'.</p>
        
            <p>Keegan said people should not be surprised terms like 'kapa haka' have been added as they are well represented in media.</p>
        
            <p>Other new regional words and phrases that the dictionary has added this round include the Welsh interjection of disgust 'ych a fi' and 'towel' as slang for the Guyanese one-thousand-dollar bill.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria University Emeritus professor of linguistics John Macalister was Oxford's go-to consultant on New Zealand English.</p>
        
            <p>The university updated its dictionary about four times a year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a regular process, but it is a big event because what it is doing is it's capturing the changing nature of New Zealand society through the language that's used.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's also capturing the distinctive nature of New Zealand society both in historical and contemporary terms."</p>
        
            <p>Māori Language Commission chief executive Ngahiwi Apanui said the inclusion of Maori words was great news.</p>
        
            <p>"It recognises how te reo Māori has become part of the New Zealand vernacular... That's something for us to celebrate in Māori Language Week."</p>
        
            <p>Aucklander Richard agreed. "I think [it's] tremendous that our reo is getting included in the Oxford dictionary... They're part of the reo of our country."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident, Adrian, said it was nice to see New Zealanders embrace te reo.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always thought people should embrace it, personally I didn't really embrace my Māori side until my early teens," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been more of an enriching experience than anything else and I don't see why people wouldn't take that opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>But one word stuck out.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't mind any of them apart from 'Aotearoan,' because it's kind of bastardising te reo. It's combining a te reo word with... I guess an English ending on it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As part Māori it doesn't feel quite right."</p>
        
            <p>Apanui felt the same way.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, I'm not particularly keen on that one, because it's not consistent with our orthographic conventions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But people are going to use the language like that and you can't stop them. I'd prefer something like 'tangata Aotearoa'."</p>
        
            <p>Macalister said enough people called themselves Aotearoans to justify including it in the dictionary, but he did not think the term would replace New Zealander or Kiwi.</p>
        
            <p>"If I was betting person, I would bet that it's unlikely to be widely adopted," he admitted.</p>
