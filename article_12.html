            <p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown is proposing a trilateral defence and security co-operation arrangement between the Cook Islands, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Friday the agreement will be an addition to the Cook Islands defence and security arrangements with New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Such a trilateral arrangement would in our view encapsulate the existing multi-decade areas of security cooperation with Australia including through the Defence Co-operation Program, the Pacific Maritime Security Program, and regional mechanisms such as the Pacific Transnational Crime Network," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>This month, Cook Islands marked three decades of diplomatic relations with New Zealand and Australia, and Brown signalled his nation's intentions during the Australia Day celebrations in Rarotonga.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the 30,000 Cook Islanders now residents in Australia have made their homes in Queensland, NSW, Victoria, and Western Australia, the foreign affairs office said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have assimilated into Australian communities adding cultural and social richness to the fabric of Australia society.</p>
        
            <p>"They continue to enrich Australia's economy through their work in primary industries, construction, manufacturing, tourism, trade, sports, education, health, government and beyond.</p>

            <p>Brown proposed several initiatives for future cooperation between the two countries, the statement said, including "equal sporting opportunities availed to other Pacific nations for Cook Islanders and progression to fruition superannuation portability arrangements".</p>
        
            <p>He called on Australia to also make available to Cook Islands the same access to grant funding initiatives as other Pacific nations available through Australia's grant funding facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands Cabinet made changes to its immigration policy last week to enable Australian passport holders a 90-day visitor visa and permit on arrival.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAI) will continue to lead the Cook Islands coordination of engagement with the government of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"This 30th year anniversary will likely include a number of high-level engagements as the two governments endeavour bring to further fruition their shared aspirations detailed in 'Oa Tumanava'.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Oa Tumanava' partnership details five pillars for future cooperation between the Cook Islands and Australia.</p>
