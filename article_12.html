            <p>Heavily redacted documents released under the Official Information Act have revealed Prime Minister Christopher Luxon received a briefing on last year's Khalistan "referendum" on 5 November.</p>
        
            <p>The non-binding "referendum" on 17 November was organised by US-based separatist group Sikhs for Justice, which advocates for the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ observed thousands participating in the referendum in Auckland's Aotea Square.</p>
        
            <p>S. Jaishankar, India's minister of external affairs, raised the issue with Foreign Minister Winston Peters on the sidelines of the Raisina Down Under conference in Canberra on 6 November.</p>
        
            <p>According to the briefing documents, organisers of the "referendum" told New Zealand police that about 8000 people were expected to attend the event.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ police are engaging with ... organisers about the event in Auckland," the briefing documents said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the organisers have communicated their desire for a peaceful event, and that they currently expect approximately 8000 people to attend."</p>
        
            <p>In reply to a parliamentary question from Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins on 25 November about briefings or advice the prime minister had received in the week beginning 4 November, Luxon declined to name a briefing he had received on the Khalistan "referendum".</p>
        
            <p>"I ... received three documents in the specified time frame, however, it is not in the public interest to release the titles of these documents," Luxon replied.</p>
        
            <p>Later, in reply to an OIA request dated 22 January, it was revealed that Luxon was briefed about the "referendum" on 5 November - information that had been previously withheld but could "now ... be released, given the passage of time".</p>
        
            <p>The briefing documents confirmed that the "referendum" and related activities had been closely monitored by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC).</p>
        
            <p>"On 24 October, DPMC convened an inter-agency working group (IAWG) of officials - including DPMC's National Security Group, NZ Police, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, NZSIS [New Zealand Security Intelligence Service], Ministry of Ethnic Communities and Immigration NZ - to ensure a common understanding of the situation, risks and triggers for convening the ODESC system," the briefing documents said.</p>
        
            <p>The Officials Committee for Domestic and External Security Coordination - commonly referred to as ODESC - is a committee of chief executives that manages national security in New Zealand in terms of governance and response.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was told on 5 November that "additional IAWG meetings will be held if warranted and the ODESC system will be activated if required".</p>
        
            <p>The briefing notes also clarified New Zealand's position on Khalistan and listed several "talking points" for Luxon to draw upon if asked about Sikh separatist activities and the "referendum" scheduled in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand recognises India's sovereignty and territorial integrity," one of the talking points in the briefing noted.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is a strong supporter of human rights, at home, and around the world - including freedom of speech - provided such initiatives are lawful and peaceful," another said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand takes any threats on incidence of violence against ethnic and religious communities in New Zealand seriously," the briefing said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ethnic communities are a vital part of New Zealand's diverse society. We expect all communities to act lawfully and be treated with respect."</p>
