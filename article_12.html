        <h2>A taste of New Zealand's emerging seaweed industry</h2>
        <p>
As part of Aotearoa's first seaweed festival, Pacific Harvest hosted a seaweed tasting event where people could sample various red, green and brown dried…
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is home to over 1000 different types of seaweed - in Wellington's waters alone there are believed to be over 900 different types.</p>
        
            <p>From the top of the North Island - Te Ika-a-Māui to the bottom of the South Island - Te Waipounamu, water temperatures differ by about 7 degrees Celsius providing for a wide range of seaweeds along Aotearoa's biodiverse and rich coastlines.</p>
        
            <p>It something which will likely serve as well as more is discovered about this underwater resource.</p>
        
            <p>Seaweed is the common name used to describe a wide range of marine plants and algae that grow in water bodies.</p>

            <p>Seaweed aquaculture is an emerging global industry estimated to be worth over $14 billion dollars US in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"Seaweed is an emerging industry in Aotearoa," explained Hayley Fraser-Mackenzie from Pacific Harvest.</p>
        
            <p>The B-corp has been producing edible seaweed products for over 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>"There's lots of different things that seaweed can be used for - bio-stimulants, nutraceuticals, there's even bioplastics. It's absolutely fascinating all the different applications," she told Country Life.</p>

            <p>Fraser-Mackenzie is most interested in its value as a "highly nutritious food" which she said is more nutrient dense and sustainable than extractive crops.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just phenomenal in terms of what they offer from a nutritional perspective," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What is less known is seaweeds also offer a range of other minerals and nutrients. This is because a seaweed doesn't have a root structure ... they use the whole surface area [to absorb nutrients]. They're like uber-absorbers."</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Harvest's range is more artisanal and mostly wild harvested seaweeds from New Zealand and some which are imported - seaweed is commonly farmed in parts of Asia.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to source seaweed that are food grade seaweeds."</p>
        
            <p>She said wild harvesting allowed them to be more sustainable and ensure they do not damage the reproductive system.</p>

            <p>Pacific Harvest's seaweeds are also air dried to maximise their nutritional value as seaweed's are very heat sensitive.</p>
        
            <p>At a tasting session in Wellington organised as part of Aotearoa's first ever seaweed festival, Fraser-Mackenzie talks attendees through the nutritional value of their products.</p>
        
            <p>There are little jars of dried seaweed flakes in all colours and textures - from the soft, dewy greens of seaweed to the rosey pink of the now dried red seaweed dulse.</p>
        
            <p>Seaweeds come in three main colour types, Fraser-Mackenzie explains - red, green, and brown.</p>

            <p>Each grows in different environments and provides different nutritional benefits.</p>
        
            <p>"The greens have higher chlorophyll, and they are in the shallower waters where the light is stronger. The browns come the next level down, a little bit deeper - they offer much more iodine. And the reds tend to be slightly deeper, and they will have different properties again - more protein, more kerogen or agar."</p>
        
            <p>For example, sea lettuce, a green variety, is a good a source of iodine, iron, magnesium, b12. It's also a good source of fibre and aminos. Others like nori, a red seaweed, have high protein.</p>
        
            <p>Most seaweeds are also rich in iodine which supports thyroid health, helping regulate our hormones and digestion.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't need to eat a lot of seaweeds because the mineral richness is high. The trick is to have little bits often," Fraser-Mackenzie told Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>The seaweed tasting session allowed attendees to gain new insights into this often-overlooked marine treasure.</p>

            <p>It's exactly what festival organiser Zoe Studd, from Love Rimurimu, was hoping for.</p>
        
            <p>She said seaweed didn't have a "great PR image", but the week-long festival held earlier this month which aimed to celebrate it had received a "fantastic response".</p>
        
            <p>Love Rimurimu, is a project initiated by Mountains to Sea Wellington as an education programme but which grew into a restoration project.</p>
        
            <p>It aims to regenerate Wellington's underwater giant kelp forests which are in decline here and abroad.</p>
