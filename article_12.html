        <h2>'Severe disruption' for Auckland roads until new bridges built</h2>

A planned six-year wait for new bridges to be built after Auckland's City Rail Link opens is disappointing, the Automobile Association and National Road…

New bridges expected to smooth the integration of the new Auckland City Rail Link are now not expected to be built until 2032 - which will cause serious traffic problems in the meantime, transport industry voices say.

            <p>Clarification: This story has been updated with comment and clarification from Auckland Transport.</p>
        
            <p>A planned six year wait for new bridges to be built after Auckland's City Rail Link opens is disappointing, the Automobile Association and National Road Carriers say.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the government allocated another $200 million dollars of funds to remove several level crossings, to build three new road bridges, and access bridges at three stages.</p>
        
            <p>The level crossings were expected to close in 2026 with the opening of the City Rail Link, with the bridges later built in 2032. However, Auckland Transport's director of infrastructure and place Murray Burt later clarified the level crossings would remain open until alternative access points are built.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Automobile Association (AA) policy director Martin Glynn told RNZ the delay would mean more congestion in the interim.</p>
        
            <p>"The barrier arms will be down for much longer; so more queuing, longer delays, and increased safety risks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, National Road Carriers' general manager James Smith said the opening of the City Rail Link will mean more frequent timetables causing barrier arms to be down up to 50 minutes per hour.</p>
        
            <p>Burt refuted this, and said the barrier arms at level crossings would not be down for 50 minutes an hour when the City Rail Link opens. He said Smith was referring to the planning scenario for 2051, used in the business case to justify the need for grade separation.</p>
        
            <p>"When City Rail Link opens in 2026 and train frequencies increase, modelling shows traffic delays in Takaanini could increase by at most 2.5 minutes in the peak hour."</p>
        
            <p>"Traffic impacts will be minimised by optimisation of the Great South Road corridor and other intersections, with traffic light management and lane reallocations.</p>
        
            <p>"The planned works will be sequenced to keep freight and general traffic flowing smoothly on the roads."</p>

            <p>Smith said businesses, light industry, and commuters in South Auckland would be left grappling with severe congestion and economic harm while waiting for these essential crossings to be built.</p>
        
            <p>"Takanini, a key hub for Auckland's light industry, is already burdened with chronic traffic congestion," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>"The planned level crossing closures, without timely level crossing replacements, will cause severe disruption to freight and transport operators.</p>
        
            <p>"Many businesses are already considering relocating due to the uncertainty and inefficiencies caused by Auckland Transport's failure to deliver integrated planning."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said businesses and commuters were now staring down the barrel of six years of detours between level crossing closures and the eventual construction of grade separated crossings.</p>
        
            <p>"Six years of economic harm is simply not acceptable. These vehicle crossings must be fast-tracked and built with urgency.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Transport has no excuse for this planning failure - integrated planning between road, rail, and freight networks is standard practice in transport infrastructure projects world-wide."</p>
        
            <p>Burt added more than 70 percent of the road/rail crossings on the Auckland Rail Network have already been grade separated.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Transport is working in partnership with Kiwirail, NZTA, MoT and Auckland Council to remove or grade separate the remaining level crossings in stages.</p>
        
            <p>"Work on level crossing removals at Takanini and on the Eastern line has been fast-tracked to take advantage of the planned rail line closures prior to CRL opening.</p>
        
            <p>"AT is well advanced and ready to begin the projects, following funding details confirmation from NZTA and Auckland Council."</p>
