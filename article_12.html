            <p>Back in the 1990s, comedian Ruby Wax was known for her fresh and candid interviews with celebrities like Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>In the hit stage show I'm Not As Well As I Thought I Was (based on the 2023 bestseller) the 71-year-old comedian and writer opens up about having a wild international adventure cut short by psychiatric illness.</p>
        
            <p>"When I wrote the first half of the book somebody said 'This is okay, but it's a travel log'. But then when I ended up in the mental ward they said 'This is a hit!'"</p>
        
            <p>Wax tells Susie Ferguson she's excited about performing her show in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland next month.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to New Zealand's beauty she doesn't hold back, declaring Auckland "the best place in the world".</p>
        
            <p>"If there was a God he said 'let's give it one more chance' and he made New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>In I'm Not As Well As I Thought I Was, Kiwi audiences will see her first on a wild international adventure to find "meaning" and then struck down by extreme mental illness.</p>
        
            <p>Although Wax didn't find meaning during her stay at a psychiatric hospital, she says she did rediscover there the event which she believes has led to her "running so hard" throughout her life.</p>
        
            <p>"I was locked in my house as a kid - I had no idea."</p>

            <p>Raised in Chicago as the only child of Austrian immigrant parents who were physically abusive, Wax says everything she did growing up seemed like a disappointment.</p>
        
            <p>While her mother Berta Wachs was a beautiful former 'it girl' who spoke eight languages, Wax had front teeth "that were in another time zone" and due to undiagnosed dyslexia was put in "the slow class".</p>
        
            <p>"It was a cruel house, you know, and it's a miracle I survived it... I knew the only way out of there was to get a sense of humour. That was my safety gauge."</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after finishing high school, Wax moved to the UK where she trained as a classical actress and worked on stage and TV productions before becoming a celebrity interviewer for the BBC in 1991.</p>

            <p>Multiple meetings with Pamela Anderson were a highlight of this time, Wax says, and it was clear to her then the Baywatch star would become "a cool older woman".</p>
        
            <p>"That's an evolved soul. She's not at all hungry for what she used to be. I think she looks happier now. Some people just evolve at a certain age. People turn into wine or vinegar. She turned into wine."</p>
        
            <p>Some of her own interviews Wax can now no longer watch - such as those with Donald Trump and Bill Cosby.</p>
        
            <p>"Their whole thing is humiliating women and boy, did they. But I'd stick it out because I had a show and I wasn't going to walk away or cry, which maybe that's what they wanted me to do."</p>
        
            <p>Side by side on the future US president's private jet in 1996, Trump quickly soured when Wax started laughing at the idea that he wanted to be president: "I thought 'I'm with a comedian. This guy's funny!" - and promptly landed the plane to kick her off.</p>
        
            <p>The real estate developer didn't know what to make of a woman who wasn't fawning over him, Wax says.</p>
        
            <p>"With somebody who had a smirk on their face and wasn't taking him seriously, he just couldn't bear it."</p>
        
            <p>Met at the door for her interview with Bill Cosby, Wax says that soon after the comedian put his hands around her neck and tried to choke her.</p>
        
            <p>"He dragged me with his elbow around my neck into the room and made me kneel at his feet and had a toy phone that he kept calling and saying 'get her out of here' just the way Trump did."</p>
        
            <p>After leaving the TV business in the early 2000s, Wax studied mindfulness at Oxford University, later writing several self-help books including Sane New World and Mindfulness Guide for Survival. In 2015, she received an OBE for services to mental health.</p>

            <p>Depression, which Wax first experienced in childhood, isn't about being sad, she says. It's about being "completely incapable of going back to who you used to be".</p>
        
            <p>"Your personality is gone and you assume - the way you do when you have the flu or whatever - that this is your new personality. And it's so horrific."</p>
        
            <p>Wax says the place where she "shines" is on stage in front of a receptive audience.</p>
        
            <p>This April, while talking about her experiences onstage in New Zealand, she'll also invite audience members to share their own.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm happy in my body because I'm with my people … This is my happy moment because I get to meet the public."</p>
