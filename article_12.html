            <p>Authorities are searching for a Bering Air passenger plane with 10 people on board that was reported missing while en route from Unalakleet to Nome, Alaska's Department of Public Safety says.</p>

            <p>A disproportionate number of air taxi and commuter plane accidents occur in Alaska compared to other US states, the US government's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health says.</p>
        
            <p>Alaska has mountainous terrain and challenging weather. Many villages are not connected by roads and small planes are used to transport people and goods.</p>
        
            <p>Bering Air is an Alaska-based regional airline that operates around 39 planes and helicopters, according to data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24.</p>
        
            <p>Its last position, flying over water, was received by FlightRadar24 trackers 38 minutes after departing Unalakleet at 1438 local time Thursday (2338 GMT) for a flight that usually takes under an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Bering Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
