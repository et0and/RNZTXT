            <p>Members of the Ukrainian community in Aotearoa have stood with New Zealanders, people from many different nationalities and diplomats from around the world in Wellington this afternoon, to mark the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 200 people, many carrying blue and gold flags and large sunflowers, listened to speeches and music in Wellington's Civic Square.</p>
        
            <p>On the steps lay pairs of children's shoes and toys, in remembrance of the children who have lost their lives.</p>
        
            <p>The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates more than 10,000 civilian Ukrainians including 528 children have died in two years.</p>
        
            <p>Head of the Ukrainian Gromada (community) of Wellington Olga Vorobey told the crowd it's important to remember the real people behind the "sad statistics" and said assistance from the global community was critical for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>She also noted the war had started not two years but 10 years ago - in 2014 with the Russian invasion of Crimea.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the European Union Ambassador told the crowd it was important to get a clear message to Ukraine that the EU and other nations would do whatever it took to achieve victory.</p>
        
            <p>Lawrence Meredith said the day was not just about values or principles, but people.</p>
        
            <p>"Even here in this crowd in Wellington, so far from Ukraine itself, people here have lost, somebody told me they'd lost their closest friend from school, was in tears, understandably, another person told me they'd lost a cousin, and these are the people who are gathering [here today]."</p>
        
            <p>Meredith said the rally was the first in the world to mark the anniversary, but he was confident people across the planet would speak up for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the event would send a strong signal. He welcomed the government's extension of the Defence Force's Ukrainian deployment and provision of another $26 million of support, saying it showed New Zealand stood with Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand, the European Union and many ambassadors both from the European Union and other countries - United States, United Kingdom - we all stand with the Ukrainian people because we believe in the fight for freedom, sovereignty and democracy."</p>

            <p>The ambassadors of Poland, Germany, France and Taiwan, deputy ambassador to Spain and the high commissioner to Canada were also at the event.</p>
        
            <p>Oksana, who is Ukrainian, told RNZ she came to the rally because she has lost family and friends in the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here because I have family... my cousin, my university friend who is a surgeon and volunteered is dead. There are lots of young people, 18 years old, who go to war to fight for freedom and this is the least I can do, to stand here, to think of them and to pray for them.</p>
        
            <p>"I really hope that it will stop, that there is some solution sometime soon because there are lots of dead people, I don't know if anyone realises [how much]."</p>
        
            <p>Standing beside her, Natalya said she arrived in New Zealand last year, leaving Ukraine after she lost many of her family.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw all scary situations, my family in Ukraine - my son, my grandson, my mum..I've lost [them] and everything.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking quietly and in tears, Natalya says the rest of her family was now scattered around the world, including in Canada and Germany.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand woman at the rally who fundraises for Ukraine's war effort said the situation there was heartbreaking.</p>
        
            <p>"It's terrible, it's an awful, awful rollcall everyday... I honestly can't describe how bad it is. It's horrendous and it just doesn't stop."</p>
        
            <p>She said New Zealanders get very comfortable in their corner of the world, and many did not even know the war was still going on.</p>
