        <h2>Elimination of cervical cancer in NZ is within reach - but not without funding and a plan</h2>
        <p>
After committing to a global plan to eliminate cervical cancer, NZ is lagging behind Australia and other countries in how it manages this preventable disease.

            <p>Analysis - After committing to a global plan to eliminate cervical cancer, New Zealand is lagging behind Australia and other countries in how it manages this preventable disease.</p>
        
            <p>Each year approximately 175 New Zealanders are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 55 people die from it.</p>
        
            <p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of 95 percent of cervical cancers and some throat and anal cancers. New Zealand has a very effective vaccine against this cancer. And HPV screening can detect changes on the cervix before cancer occurs.</p>
        
            <p>With vaccination and screening it is now realistic to aim to eliminate cervical cancer in our lifetime - but it requires a strategy and investment.</p>
        
            <p>The World Health Organization's global elimination strategy for cervical cancer rests on three targets:</p>
        
            <p>But to achieve this in Aotearoa New Zealand, there needs to be a commitment from the government to develop and resource an elimination strategy.</p>
        
            <p>This is not currently happening. And, despite some advances, women continue to die.</p>
        
            <p>HPV self-testing was introduced as part of the national screening programme in September 2023. Testing for the virus provides 60-70 percent greater protection against developing invasive cervical cancers compared with cervical cytology (the "smear" - involving a speculum examination by a trained provider).</p>
        
            <p>It is such good a test that following a negative result (and no symptoms) another test is not needed for five years.</p>
        
            <p>Switching to HPV-testing has potential to reduce the annual number of cervical cancers by 15 percent. Women can do the test themselves and, under the new scheme, 80 percent are choosing self-testing.</p>
        
            <p>There has also been a high uptake from never-screened or under-screened women. This is important because more than 85 percent of our cervical cancers occurred in those not regularly screened.</p>
        
            <p>Before the introduction of the HPV self-test, just 67.1 percent of eligible people were up to date with their screening. Over the past year this has increased to 70.8 percent - reaching the WHO target. However, coverage for M훮ori remains below - increasing from 56.3 percent to just 61.9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>While screening coverage has increased to 70.8 percent overall, New Zealand's HPV vaccination coverage is low (45-60 percent) - nowhere near the 90 percent target, which Australia is close to.</p>
        
            <p>Australia is set to become the first to achieve elimination, after the government committed A$48.2 million to support their national elimination strategy and its implementation.</p>
        
            <p>HPV vaccination is an essential pillar of cervical cancer prevention.</p>
        
            <p>A recent study found no cases of cervical cancer in a cohort of girls immunised between the age of 12 and 13 (born between 1996 and 1998) in Scotland's school-based vaccination programme. But there were cases of cervical cancer in the unvaccinated group.</p>
        
            <p>Champions, researchers, clinicians and wh훮nau campaigned and contributed to our new (albeit overdue) HPV cervical screening programme. But more action is needed.</p>
        
            <p>This is particularly the case as funding for healthcare is cut back.</p>
        
            <p>To achieve the elimination goals we have committed to, three things need to happen:</p>
        
            <p>It's essential everyone is included to achieve elimination. The WHO global targets - set to address the differential burden of cervical cancer between countries - fail to address the rights of Indigenous peoples to be counted within the elimination targets. Within-country inequities may remain hidden as a country can claim elimination based on data that doesn't separate different ethnic groups.</p>
        
            <p>Countries, including Aotearoa New Zealand, need to meet elimination targets for all women.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa has the tools (HPV self-testing, vaccination and treatment for cell changes) to make elimination for all a reality. But without an equitable strategy or funding to drive progress, the end of cervical cancer for New Zealanders will not be as close or as equitable as it should be.</p>
