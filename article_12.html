            <p>Chanelle Dickie has taken dozens of retired racehorses under her wing at the Selwyn Equestrian Centre.</p>
        
            <p>But she says the hardest thing is always letting them go to their forever home.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know many horses I've let go that haven't put tears in my eyes as they go down the driveway," Dickie tells Country Life.</p>
        
            <p>Located at Burnham, the horse trainer is part of HERO - a rehoming and re-educating programme caring for standardbred's that have fallen off the pace.</p>
        
            <p>"It's run by Harness Racing New Zealand," Dickie explains.</p>
        
            <p>"It's their scheme to show they care about the life after racing and the standardbred breed," she says.</p>

            <p>Most of the horses Dickie re-trains come from the Canterbury region. However, there are also HERO re-trainers in Auckland, Southland and North Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>She says even though the horses haven't had riders on them, it's usually quite easy to break the horses into saddle.</p>
        
            <p>"They've had a bridle on, a bit in their mouth, they know how to steer and stop.</p>
        
            <p>"Essentially the only thing they need is weight on their back and the pressure of your legs on either side, that's new to them."</p>
        
            <p>Once retrained, Dickie says it's quite easy to find horses new homes through the HERO programme, but there's a strict vetting process.</p>
        
            <p>"We only ever let them go if they have another horse at home, as they're a herd animal.</p>
        
            <p>"And they have to come here and ride in front of me and show me their skills," she says.  </p>
        
            <p>Not all harness racing horses can be rehomed for riding, due to either an injury or their attitude.</p>
        
            <p>However, there are other options for these horses, Dickie says.</p>
        
            <p>Females can become brood mares while males can be a good paddock mate for another horse, she explains.</p>
