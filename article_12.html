        <h2>'A special relationship': The 'old friend' Djokovic visits each year during Australian Open</h2>
        <p>
It may seem odd to some, but for 15 years Novak Djokovic has been a regular visitor to the Botanic Gardens for a particular reason.

            <p>Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens has long been a major tourist destination and during the Australian Open each year there is a particular visitor the park attracts.</p>
        
            <p>World number one and 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic has revealed he visits the gardens to help him cope with the pressure that comes with being the perennial tournament favourite.</p>
        
            <p>And there is a certain tree within the gardens that Djokovic revealed he especially enjoys visiting.</p>
        
            <p>"There's one particular tree that I've been having special relationship with, so to say, in the last 15 years," Djokovic said after his emotionally charged win over Alexei Popyrin in the second round.</p>
        
            <p>"I love every corner of [the] botanical gardens. I think it's [an] incredible treasure for Melbourne to have such a park and nature in the middle of the city.</p>
        
            <p>"That particular tree, I cannot reveal which one. I'll try to keep it discreet for myself when I'm there to have my own time.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to ground myself and connect with that old friend."</p>
        
            <p>Djokovic adds: "I got connected with that tree. I just liked it. I liked its roots and the trunks, and branches and everything.</p>
        
            <p>"So I started climbing it years ago. That's it. I just have a connection."</p>

            <p>Djokovic says he is "not superstitious", but he likes to frequent certain places in Melbourne that have previously brought him luck.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a wonderful park where I like to spend time and just be by myself in nature: just grounding, hugging trees, climbing trees and stuff," Djokovic said at his pre-tournament media conference on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"I love to do that ... whether that's  secret of success here in Australia or not, I don't know, but it has definitely made me feel good.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to have places where you can just rewind, relax, rejuvenate and kind of gather all the necessary energy for the next day.</p>
        
            <p>"I like to isolate a bit more. In a place like New York [for the US Open], for example, I stay in New Jersey. I stay with my friend where I'm in complete nature, isolation.</p>
        
            <p>"It just allows me to relax and recharge. I like that kind of balance because grand slams are  completely different kind of energy, vibe tournaments than any other event that we have on the tour."</p>
