        <h2>'This is me in my vulnerable state': Singer Aaradhna on her new album</h2>
        <p>
Taking the reins as a producer has enabled RnB singer Aaradhna to dig deep on Sweet Surrender - the follow-up to her chart-topping 2016 album Brown Girl. Video

            <p>Eight years after topping the Kiwi charts with her 2016 album Brown Girl, Aaradhna has learnt how to find strength in vulnerability.</p>
        
            <p>On her new album Sweet Surrender, the Kiwi RnB singer takes full creative control for the first time, writing and producing a set of tracks that are much more honest and direct than her previous work.</p>
        
            <p>"I get nervous about it because this is me in my vulnerable state, it's a new place … It's all straight from the source and there's just no detours," she tells RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>Aaradhna (Aaradhna Jayantilal Patel) was raised by her Indian mother and Samoan father in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>She wrote her first RnB ballad at age 11 and her 2006 debut album I Love You was certified gold.</p>
        
            <p>Over the last seven years, she taught herself instruments to construct a "skeleton" for each song that would end up on Sweet Surrender.</p>

            <p>Writing music from scratch on her own for the first time, the lyrics just "spilt out", Aaradhna says.</p>
        
            <p>"Being real about your feelings and your thoughts, I think that's where you're the strongest. I find strength in being vulnerable and that's exactly what this album is about - a sweet surrender. It's just about letting go and being who you are.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're not growing then I don't know what you are doing."</p>
        
            <p>While the songs on Sweet Surrender may sound like they're about unrequited romantic love, the album is more about discovering love within, Aaradhna says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about me going through the motions and feeling what I need to feel and then letting go.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also about me not holding back and not trying to be tough about stuff, just letting everything be and also taking ownership for everything that I create."</p>
        
            <p>One of her favourite songs on the album is 'Love 2 Love', featuring fellow soul singer Ladi6.</p>
        
            <p>"'Love 2 Love' is about me just wanting to just focus on love and all the good things even though life brings a lot of trouble sometimes. I just want to keep looking up and focus on trying to find my peace."</p>
        
            <p>'Beautiful Ones' - the closing track on Sweet Surrender - came to Aaradhna late one night when she was outside under a full moon.</p>
        
            <p>"I just was like 'Give me a song. Give me a song'. I sat out there and then I came back in and I sat in front of this keyboard and just started playing.</p>

            <p>"I didn't know what I was playing but I had to record it because I forget. So I recorded everything, I layered everything, I started singing. The lines just kept coming out."</p>
        
            <p>Aaradhna says she didn't know 'Beautiful Ones' was about her mum's recent death until she listened back to it.</p>
        
            <p>"I kind of had a little breakdown, like I broke down because then I finally knew what it was about."</p>
        
            <p>On a recent "soul trip" to India, Aaradhna visited her mum's side of the family and shot some visuals for Sweet Surrender.</p>
        
            <p>What was meant to be a two-week trip extended to over a month because being in India felt so right, she says.</p>
        
            <p>"When I got there I just felt a deep connection to everything. I felt like I needed to be there, I just knew I had to go. I ended up staying there and meeting a lot of really good people and just making a deeper connection with India. It was a soul trip for me. It was definitely good for the soul. I just didn't even want to leave … I definitely have to go back.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm proud of where I come from. I'm proud of my roots. It's what makes me - my Samoan and my Indian roots. I want to represent that in the most genuine way and in the realist way."</p>
