        <h2>'Biggest ever' tug-of-war showdown in NZ</h2>
        <p>
Fifteen teams from New Zealand and Australia competed in one of the country's largest tug-of-war competitions.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Kerala community came together at Auckland's Manukau Tennis Centre for a spirited tug-of-war competition on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Tug-of-war, also known as vadam vali, is a traditional sport with deep roots in the southern Indian state of Kerala.</p>
        
            <p>The competition in South Auckland brought the Kerala community together for the first time at a national level. Previous tournaments had been held in regional centres.</p>
        
            <p>Tug-of-war is an athletic contest in which two teams at opposite ends of a rope try to drag the other across a centre line.</p>

            <p>Titled Mamankam 2024, the competition was organized by Auckland Malayali Samajam and featured more than 150 players across 15 teams from New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time we are hosting a vadam vali competition here in Auckland, and it is the biggest ever," said Robin Babu, president of Auckland Malayali Samajam.</p>
        
            <p>Traditionally celebrated around the harvest festival Onam, tug-of-war had become increasingly popular in New Zealand, Babu said.</p>
        
            <p>Teams travelled from WhangƒÅrei, Auckland, Hamilton, Nelson, Hawke's Bay, Taranaki and Christchurch to compete in the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, a self-declared "undefeated" team from Australia travelled across the ditch to battle for the trophy.</p>

            <p>"We expected more teams from Australia, but unfortunately, some of the team members had visa delays," Babu said.</p>
        
            <p>Babu said the event also featured food stalls offering traditional southern Indian and Kerala cuisine for the community to enjoy.</p>
        
            <p>Although the origins of tug-of-war are uncertain, the sport was believed to trace its roots back to ancient India, Greece, Egypt and China.</p>
        
            <p>Tug-of-war appeared in five Olympic Games from 1900 until 1920, with team sizes ranging from five to eight members.</p>
        
            <p>Great Britain was the world leader in the event, winning two gold medals, two silvers and a bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Tug-of-war was once a popular sport in rural New Zealand, but interest has declined over the years. RNZ reported in 2020 that only two clubs were left - Te Awamutu and Hastings.</p>

            <p>Arun Kalluparampil, captain of Brisbane Sevens, has competed in the sport since 2011.</p>
        
            <p>"The current team was formed in 2016, and we've managed to win 14 championships," Kalluparampil said. "Luckily, we haven't lost any contest in the past couple of years."</p>
        
            <p>He said competition was fierce in Australia, with multiple national competitions held every year.</p>
        
            <p>"I can see that the sport is being picked up by many here in New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mebin John, who has been competing for two years, agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"The interest in the sport is growing here," he said.</p>

            <p>John, who is also the secretary of the Auckland Malayali Samajam, said his West Auckland team, the Western Knights, practiced every day leading up to the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had tug-of-war teams since 2013, but only now has it gone professional, thanks to increasing support and interest from the Kerala community," John said.</p>
        
            <p>He extended an invitation to the wider Kiwi community to participate in future competitions.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is welcome to join us," John said.</p>
