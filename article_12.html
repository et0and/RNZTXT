            <p>The number of arrivals from the world's most populous nation continues to soar but securing a visitor visa remains a challenge for many Indian nationals.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 January to 8 September, Immigration New Zealand processed 42,542 first-time visitor visa applications from Indian nationals, of which 32,085 were approved.</p>
        
            <p>During this period, 9970 applications were rejected - a rejection rate of 23 percent, according to the latest Immigration New Zealand figures.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, first-time applicants from India submitted 91,748 visitor visa applications. Of these, 68 percent were approved, while 30 percent were rejected.</p>
        
            <p>However, the total number of visa applications from India continues to rise post-Covid.</p>
        
            <p>This growth is attributed to factors such as the rising appetite for overseas travel among India's growing middle class, relaxed visa rules by many countries and a younger population eager to explore new destinations.</p>
        
            <p>According to a report published earlier this month by MakeMyTrip Limited, one of India's leading online travel companies, the number of Indian residents who took two or more trips abroad in a year increased by 32 percent from June 2023 to May 2024.</p>

            <p>The United Arab Emirates, Thailand and the United States were the top three overseas destinations for Indian travellers, followed by Singapore and Indonesia.</p>
        
            <p>Many countries in Southeast Asia and Central Asia, including Thailand, Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan, are capitalizing on India's travel boom by easing their visa requirements.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Henley Passport Index ranked the Indian passport 82nd in the world, allowing visa-free access to 58 countries.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, New Zealand ranked fourth, with visa-free access to 190 countries and territories worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, Indian nationals continue to flock to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Before the pandemic, 84,288 visas were approved in 2018 and 83,583 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, a total of 115,008 visitor visa applications from India were approved.</p>
        
            <p>As of 31 August 2024, 97,842 applications had been approved.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 January 2023 to 8 September 2024, China topped the list of visa applications to New Zealand with 315,467 submissions, followed by India with 134,290 applications.</p>
        
            <p>Thailand, with 20,654 applications, had the highest approval rate at 96 percent, while Pakistan, with 7030 applications, had the highest rejection rate, with 71 percent of applicants failing to secure a visa.</p>
        
            <p>Indian nationals had the second-highest rejection rate over the same period, with 28 percent of applicants denied a visa.</p>
        
            <p>"India is an exciting and important market for New Zealand," said Jock Gilray, director of visas at Immigration New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Gilray said Immigration New Zealand had seen a higher proportion of well-prepared applications from India recently.</p>
        
            <p>"This has led to a higher approval rate and faster decision times," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But he stressed the importance of applicants being sure to meet the immigration requirements of the visa category they were applying for.</p>
        
            <p>"Visa applicants must demonstrate genuine intentions to visit New Zealand temporarily and return home at the end of their stay," he said.</p>
