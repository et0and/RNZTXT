            <p>Finn Allen rewrote the history books as he produced New Zealand's greatest T20 International innings in Dunedin This afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Allen plundered Pakistan for 16 sixes, equalling the most hit in a T20I on his way to 137 from just 62 balls, the highest individual score for the Black Caps in the format.</p>
        
            <p>The opener's stunning knock helped New Zealand post an imposing 224/7, the highest score at University Oval, after being sent in to bat.</p>
        
            <p>In reply, Pakistan fell 45 runs short as the Black Caps claimed the five-match series 3-0 with two games to play.</p>
        
            <p>Allen told TVNZ he felt he was in the zone from ball one, having belted 34 and 74 in games one and two.</p>
        
            <p>"I've just been trying to keep things simple, I've put the work in throughout the series and tried to go in with same game plan."</p>
        
            <p>He credited Tim Seifert for the supporting role he played, as he fed the strike to the red hot Allen.</p>
        
            <p>"We assessed the wicket and felt good cricket shots would give us good reward."</p>
        
            <p>Allen's imperious innings saw him overtake Brendon McCullum's 123 against Bangladesh in Pallekele in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>None of the Pakistan bowlers were spared from the carnage, Mohammed Wasim returning 1/35 and Haris Rauf 2/60.</p>

            <p>Allen took Rauf in particular to task, hammering 47 from 14 balls off the seamer.</p>
        
            <p>Seifert chipped in with 31 as he and Allen combined for 125 from 61 before Allen finally played one on from Zaman Khan.</p>
        
            <p>Wickets began to fall regularly following Allen's dismissal, New Zealand managing just 17 from the last 16 balls.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Southee sent Saim Ayub back to the dugout early for just 10, bringing together Mohammed Rizwan and Babar Azam to combine for Pakistan's best partnership of 39.</p>
        
            <p>Santner then had Rizwan caught behind for 24 before Lockie Ferguson forced Fakar Zaman to mis-time one into the skies,</p>
        
            <p>Wicketkeepr Azam Khan toed a slower ball from Matt Henry which Phillips swallowed up with Pakistan crumbling to 115/4.</p>
        
            <p>Ahmed was the fifth Pakistan batter sent back without reaching 30, run out courtesy of a direct hit from Santner, marking a collapse of 4-29 for the tourists.</p>
        
            <p>Babar brought up another half century, his sixth in a row batting at first drop, but the classy right hander was again unable to find enough support at the other end.</p>
        
            <p>He was eventually out for 58 as the tourists scrapped their way through the 20 overs, finishing on 178/7.</p>
        
            <p>Southee was the pick of the bowlers for New Zealand, taking 2/39.</p>
        
            <p>Game four is in Christchurch on Friday with the first ball at 7.10pm.</p>
