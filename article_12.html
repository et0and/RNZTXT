        <p>
Explainer - With the national flu immunisation programme starting on 1 April, there's still a little confusion about what may or may not be needed.

            <p>Notices recommending people to get vaccinated against winter illnesses have been plastered on walls in pharmacies and medical centres nationwide ahead of the flu vaccine's availability from 1 April.</p>
        
            <p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, public awareness of the importance of vaccination has increased.</p>
        
            <p>There has also been an uptick in people monitoring themselves for flu-like symptoms and isolating themselves from others when ill.</p>
        
            <p>But with the national flu immunisation programme starting on Tuesday, there's still a little confusion about what may or may not be needed.</p>
        
            <p>Below, RNZ tries to answer a few common questions related to vaccination.</p>
        
            <p>Five years after the country first went into lockdown due to the pandemic, Covid-19 has not been eradicated.</p>
        
            <p>According to data from Health NZ, 524 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the week up to March 23, with 44 of them in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>But it would be wrong to think that Covid is the biggest danger.</p>
        
            <p>About 500 people die every year from influenza, with most cases occurring between May and October, according to data from Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Because strains of the flu vary each year, Health NZ recommends that people receive a flu vaccine annually.</p>
        
            <p>It's important to note that influenza and Covid share similar symptoms, such as fevers, sneezing and sore throats.</p>
        
            <p>When such symptoms arise, Health NZ recommends people to use rapid antigen tests to determine the actual cause.</p>
        
            <p>Other viruses that circulate on a smaller scale but persist in the community include chickenpox, whooping cough and hepatitis A/B, among others.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, key seasonal vaccinations are the flu shot and the Covid-19 vaccine and booster.</p>
        
            <p>Although symptoms of the flu and Covid appear similar, they are different viruses and so there is no "silver bullet" vaccine that prevents them both.</p>
        
            <p>This means people may need more than one vaccination to prevent infection.</p>
        
            <p>Vaccines typically take time to build immunity, which is why medical researchers encourage people to be vaccinated early.</p>
        
            <p>But if you're planning on receiving a flu jab and a Covid-19 booster, Health NZ recommends a one-week gap between doses. People are advised to consult their GP if having shots any closer together.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 boosters must be received six months apart, and nurses cannot administer them any sooner.</p>
        
            <p>Different strains require updated influenza vaccines each year.</p>
        
            <p>Immunisation Advisory Centre medical adviser Dr Edwin Reynolds told RNZ earlier this week there were essentially two influenza A strains and two B strains that vaccines protected people against.</p>
        
            <p>The World Health Organisation decided which strains should go into vaccines for New Zealand each year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The protection provided by vaccination typically weakens over time, so booster shots are an effective preventative measure to guard against Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>"When you are first vaccinated, your body learns what to do if it meets a particular virus or bacteria. Your second (and sometimes third or fourth) dose boosts your immune system so you will have stronger, and longer-lasting, protection," Health NZ says on its website.</p>
        
            <p>"Different vaccines protect you for different lengths of time, which is why you may need a booster vaccination to strengthen your immunity."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ encourages most people to receive a flu jab, especially pregnant women, infants and children, people over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions.</p>
        
            <p>These vulnerable groups generally have lower resistance to viruses.</p>
        
            <p>For example, catching the flu during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth, miscarriage and low birth weight.</p>
        
            <p>Appointments can be booked through your GP, and some pharmacies also offer walk-in vaccinations for those aged 3 and above.</p>
        
            <p>Individuals and groups can book online via the Health NZ website.</p>
        
            <p>Flu vaccinations are free for vulnerable groups in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>If you do not meet the criteria for a free flu jab, most health providers charge between $25 and $45, Health NZ says.</p>
        
            <p>Decades of immunisation practice have proven that building immunity through vaccination is a safe and effective way to combat disease.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has been using vaccination to prevent disease for more than 150 years, with vaccines employed in the fight against smallpox as early as 1863.</p>
        
            <p>The first official nationwide immunisation programme came in the form of the Diptherica, Tetanus and whole-cell Pertussis (DTwP) vaccine in the late 1960s to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.</p>
        
            <p>This later evolved into the National Immunisation Schedule.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has 17 different vaccines that prevent more than 20 diseases (some vaccines protect against more than one disease), including Covid-19, influenza, whooping cough and measles.</p>
        
            <p>Respiratory illnesses that commonly peak during winter include Covid-19, influenza, whooping cough and tuberculosis.</p>
        
            <p>You can register and create a personal immunisation record on the Health NZ website.</p>
