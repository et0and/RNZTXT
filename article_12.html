            <p>Hundreds of dollars of counterfeit notes have been palmed off in Waikato, with retailers being warned to keep a sharp eye out during the Christmas rush. </p>
        
            <p>Since October, police say there have been seven incidents with alleged fake notes, including $50, $20 and $10 notes.</p>
        
            <p>They have been reported across Waikato, including Hamilton East, Te Rapa, Frankton, Te Awamutu, Beerescourt, and Paeroa. </p>
        
            <p>Waikato Prevention Manager Inspector Hywel Jones reckons told Checkpoint in one case, a few real bills were mixed in with a total $750 of counterfeit banknotes.</p>
        
            <p>"That was in early October. We've got CCTV and witness accounts for that and we are following positive lines of inquiry."</p>
        
            <p>At this stage, police have not connected this case with the recent alleged use of counterfeit banknotes in the Pukekohe area, Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"Counterfeit notes have been around for many, many years as you know, and it would probably be more than one criminal group that are trying to use those." </p>
        
            <p>Jones warned retailers and people to be aware of the fake notes.</p>
        
            <p>"They're actually quite good [in resembling the real notes] from what I've seen. So, I would say be very careful when handling cash at the moment and, if [you have] any doubt, don't accept it and call police.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're handed a number of notes, check each one basically. And like I said, if you spot it, after you accept it, just limit your handling so we've got maximum forensic opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose with this time of year, with the shopping season coming up, I'd expect to see an attempt to put some more into the market at that point."</p>
        
            <p>There are some security features - which help distinguish fake notes - on the two types of banknotes in circulation at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"The first one has a bird at the lower left front. And if you move that back and forth, you should see a rolling bow of color, as it's tilted and you can hold it up to the light and you'll see a fern in the centre of the bird," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"The second older style of banknote has got a small oval window at the front right and holding it up to a light will show a watermark of the queen to the left of that window.</p>
        
            <p>"And finally, for those retailers, I suppose who've got a UV torch or black light, both styles have a patch that shows the denomination that glows which is located on the front left of the note."</p>
