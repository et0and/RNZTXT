            <p>Kiwi tennis player Marcus Daniell is looking to rally against child poverty, animal abuse and the impacts of climate change.</p>
        
            <p>One of New Zealand's most successful tennis stars, Daniell has pledged to donate half of his winnings from his final year on tour.</p>
        
            <p>After a two-year hiatus due to serious knee injuries, the 34-year-old is back in action and looking for a strong end to his career at marquee tournaments including the French Open, Wimbledon, the US Open and a shot at the Paris Olympics in July.</p>
        
            <p>But this year Daniell is playing for far more than trophies or medals.</p>
        
            <p>After donating 10 percent of his annual winnings in 2021, Daniell is aiming for $162,000 which he says could protect 28,000 humans from diseases and malnutrition, 138,000 animals from poor living conditions and mitigate 12,500 tonnes of CO2e from the environment.</p>
        
            <p>An Olympic medalist, Daniell won bronze at the 2020 games in doubles with Michael Venus.</p>
        
            <p>Daniell said he is excited to end his career on a high.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be even more rewarding knowing that my on-court success will have a direct impact off the court by contributing to amazing charities who provide the biggest impact for people, animals and the planet."</p>
        
            <p>He said he hopes to set a precedent for other athlete-led charities.</p>
        
            <p>"As athletes, we have an amazing opportunity to use the power of sport for good and engage fans to help make the world a better place. My hope is that this commitment will inspire both fans and fellow athletes to consider the impact we can collectively achieve."</p>
