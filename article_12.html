            <p>A massive specimen of one of the world's most venomous spiders will have its venom extracted to save lives.</p>
        
            <p>A mammoth male Sydney funnel-web spider, who was been named Hemsworth after brothers and actors Chris, Luke and Liam Hemsworth, has been collected by the Australian Reptile Park.</p>
        
            <p>Measuring in at 9.2 centimetres from foot-to-foot, it is the largest funnel-web spider ever received by the park.</p>
        
            <p>Hemsworth's size surpasses the previous record set by Hercules - who measures in at 7.9cm and was donated last year.</p>
        
            <p>Sydney funnel-web spiders usually range in length from 1-5cm, with females being generally larger than their male counterparts, but not as deadly.</p>
        
            <p>They are predominantly found in forested areas and suburban gardens from Sydney, to the coastal city of Newcastle in the north, and the Blue Mountains to the west.</p>
        
            <p>The head spider keeper at the Australian Reptile Park on the NSW Central Coast, Emma Teni, said she was surprised that Hemsworth was a male when staff picked him up from a drop-off location in Newcastle.</p>
        
            <p>"When he got handed in to one of our drop-off locations, we just had a look and thought, 'definitely a female'," she told ABC's News Channel.</p>
        
            <p>"On closer inspection, you can actually see the spurs, which are the male organs and we were like,' No, that's a male', so he's ridiculous."</p>
        
            <p>Hemsworth will undergo "milking" to extract venom, essential for producing life-saving antivenom, as part of the reptile park's antivenom program.</p>
        
            <p>The antivenom program involved collecting venom from a specimen, freeze drying it, and then sending it to a laboratory at Seqirus in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Only male funnel-web spiders are milked as they're about six times more venomous than females.</p>
        
            <p>Since the program was introduced in 1981 at the park, there had not been a single fatality from a funnel-web spider bite.</p>
        
            <p>Teni said Hemsworth would be "pretty juicy" due to his sheer size and the amount of venom he has.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged the public to bring more funnel-web spiders as the park was the only supplier of venom for the antivenom program in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the constant supply of males to ensure that we have a constant supply of spiders for the antivenom," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They can't jump and they can't climb a smooth surface, so if you have a smooth jar and a long-handled spoon you can gentle place it in front of the spider and encourage them to walk into the jar."</p>
        
            <p>After securing the spider with a lid, the spider can be taken to one of the park's drop-off locations, which can be found on their website.</p>
