        <h2>What weather warnings actually mean, and what triggers them</h2>
        <p>
MetService could issue a red weather warning for Westland - but what does that mean? Here's all the info you need.

            <p>MetService might issue a red weather warning for Westland on Wednesday as the region is pummelled by heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Large swathes of both the South and North Islands are already under either an orange weather warning or a yellow weather watch as a front moves slowly up the country.</p>
        
            <p>But what do these colours mean? How serious does weather need to be before a warning or a watch is issued? And how do you know when a warning is in place?</p>
        
            <p>Here's all the info you need.</p>
        
            <p>MetService uses a three-tier, colour-coded warning system to alert New Zealanders when severe weather is on its way.</p>
        
            <p>Weather watches are represented by the colour yellow, while weather warnings are generally orange. Red warnings are issued when there is extreme weather forecast which is likely to have a considerable impact.</p>
        
            <p>The World Meteorological Organisation - of which New Zealand is a member - recommends the use of colour-coded warnings for severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>They are also used by many other countries, including the United Kingdom and United States.</p>

            <p>Severe weather watches are issued when severe weather is possible, but not yet imminent or certain.</p>
        
            <p>When a watch is in place, people are urged to stay alert and keep an eye on local forecasts for updates.</p>
        
            <p>Watches are generally issued one to three days in advance of potential severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>On MetService maps and other communications, watches are represented by the colour yellow and accompanied by a circle icon.</p>
        
            <p>These are issued when forecasters believe incoming weather will be bad enough to meet MetService's severe weather criteria.</p>
        
            <p>For rainfall, that means greater than 50mm is expected to fall within six hours, or 100mm within 24 hours, over a widespread area (1000 square kilometres or more).</p>

</p>
        
            <p>For wind, that means widespread severe gales with a minimum mean speed of 90km/h, or frequent gusts exceeding 110km/h.</p>
        
            <p>For snowfall, that means widespread snow below 1000 metres on the North Island, South Canterbury or Otago, or below 500 metres elsewhere on the South Island. For a warning to be issued, the snow depth must be expected to reach 10cm within six hours or 25cm within 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>MetService says when an orange weather warning is in place, people need to be prepared and take action as appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"There could be some disruption to their day and potential risk to people, animals and property."</p>
        
            <p>The vast majority of weather warnings issued by MetService forecasters are orange. They are represented by a hexagon icon on MetService maps.</p>
        
            <p>These are reserved for the country's most extreme weather, when significant disruption and safety issues are expected.</p>
        
            <p>Anticipated outcomes of weather systems requiring a red warning are widespread power outages, washed-out roads and bridges, toppled trees, isolated communities, large slips and evacuations.</p>
        
            <p>Red warnings signify that immediate action is needed to protect people, animals and property from the impact of the weather, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>"People should also be prepared to follow the advice of official authorities and emergency services."</p>

            <p>Red weather warnings were introduced in May 2019 and were only used seven times in their first three years of existence, including for the Canterbury flooding in May 2021 and the 2022 flooding in Gisborne and Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>More recently, red warnings were issued for parts of the North Island ahead of the Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>The vast majority of weather systems for which MetService issued a red warning were so severe that they resulted in local or regional states of emergency being declared.</p>
        
            <p>Severe thunderstorm warnings are separate to severe weather warnings, and are issued when a storm with one or more of the following criteria is forecast:</p>
        
            <p>Severe thunderstorm warnings are not differentiated by orange and red. They are only ever signified by the colour red.</p>
        
            <p>Up-to-date information can be found at MetService's warnings and watches page.</p>
