        <h2>New Zealand's future in 'a world without China'</h2>
        <p>
China is in trouble and Aotearoa needs to find its way out of a relying on it so much, geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan says.
</p>
        
            <p>"No one is in a worse position than the Chinese," Peter Zeihan, a top geo-political strategist, says.</p>
        
            <p>"According to the data that the Chinese have updated in just the last year... they've got a fertility rate that is one quarter, or below, replacement levels in all of their major cities.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we're looking at the demographic collapse of the Chinese state within 10 years, and that assumes nothing else goes wrong - no trade war with the United States, no government breakdown because of the cult of personality that has arisen around chairman Xi [Jinping], no conflict, nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Zeihan's dramatic predictions are in the latest episode of RNZ's multimedia programme, 30 with Guyon Espiner.</p>
        
            <p>The implication of China's collapse as a viable global economic power, according to Zeihan, is huge losses to New Zealand's export market.</p>
        
            <p>Zeihan is the author of New York Times bestseller The End of the World is Just Beginning.</p>
        
            <p>He has warned that globalisation as we know it is in its twilight years, with the US becoming increasingly isolationist and pulling back from its post-war role in policing global trades routes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's "two-pillar" approach to keeping up relationships with both China and the US is fraught, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't serve your economic interest. It definitely doesn't serve your cultural, or your strategic interests."</p>
        
            <p>Over decades of diplomacy culminating in a free trade agreement, China has become New Zealand's largest trading partner buying more than $21.b in exports including dairy, meat and wood products each year. Few countries have achieved the diplomatic ties with China that New Zealand has won.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has also pursued an independent foreign policy for several decades, most notably via a nuclear-free policy that is supported by most Kiwis despite the discord it has created with the US.</p>

            <p>But Zeihan suggests New Zealand needs to re-assess all of that. It needs to start preparing for a future when relying on the Chinese economy is no longer an option, and follow Japan's example by holding its nose and cosying up to the US.</p>
        
            <p>"Under the previous government of Shinzo Abe, we basically had the Japanese come to the United States, say flat out, '[we] can't go it alone,' and came up with an absolutely humiliating trade deal that gave in to Washington on each and everything that had ever been an irritant in the relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"It worked. And Japan is now part of the American inner circle of allies.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand, if they want to be part of this network, is going to have to do something similar."</p>
        
            <p>The US, he says, due its geographic position, security and self-sufficient energy production, doesn't rely on globalisation for survival in the same way most of the world currently does.</p>
        
            <p>"The United States is the world's premier power not because of globalisation.</p>
        
            <p>"If you remove the NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] states from the equation, we trade for about 3 - maybe 3 and a half - percent of our GDP."</p>
        
            <p>To bolster its chances of survival, Zeihan believes New Zealand must be prepared to acquiesce more to US demands in terms of free-trade agreements, and actively pursue inclusion in sensitive security arrangements with Western allies, like the AUKUS pact.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's far, far smarter to start that process before the old system has collapsed, because [when you have no choice] the price would be much higher."</p>

            <p>While its demographic crisis appears to be pointed, China isn't the only country facing the problem - it's affecting much of the developed world, including New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"As we all globalised, we also industrialised and urbanised," Zeihan says.</p>
        
            <p>"When you live on a farm, kids are free labour, but when you move into a condo in a city, kids are an expense.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, we went from having four to five, to six [children] on average, to now less than one and-a-half in most parts of the advanced world.</p>
        
            <p>"You play that forward for 75 years and in most countries there's not even a theoretical possibility of repopulation."</p>
        
            <p>Without the replacement numbers to maintain the flow of commerce, countries that rely heavily on global trade will find things a lot tougher in the coming years.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all going to have to adjust a lot. And for countries that are major food importers, some of these adjustments are going to be incredibly painful."</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to food security, however, Zeihan says New Zealand is in a better position than most.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand is nearly unique in the world and the products you've chosen to specialise in are the products that you have the lowest input costs for.</p>
        
            <p>"In the case of dairy, for example, you don't have a hard winter, you don't have a hard summer and you have sufficient rain that most of your dairy doesn't have to be fed fodder.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got all the pieces in place that can survive the globalisation collapse.</p>
        
            <p>"Your biggest concern is going to be access to manufacturing goods in a post-China world."</p>
