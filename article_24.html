        <p>
Race, political influence and the unfinished job of tackling Aotearoa's biggest climate change problem.

            <p>This time last year, Dame Jacinda Ardern was still prime minister, NZ First was still deep in the political wilderness and we were still basking in the glow of that epic Rugby World Cup final victory at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>Two prime ministers, one Winston Peters comeback and a RWC final that went the other way later, it's almost 2024.</p>
        
            <p>To help digest the year, start thinking about the new one, or just discover some stories you might have missed, here's a selection of our best journalism in 2023 from RNZ's In Depth team.</p>
        
            <p>Since the election of the coalition government, race has surged onto the political agenda.</p>
        
            <p>It simmered during the election campaign, where we examined what exactly is 'race baiting' anyway?</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party campaigned for a referendum on the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. It didn't get that but it got close - there will be a Treaty Principles Bill in Parliament that will at least make it to a select committee. Ella Stewart's story, written while we were waiting for the coalition to be formed, explains why it will be so contentious.</p>
        
            <p>Another ACT Party coalition outcome is a review of the long-standing admissions programme for MƒÅori and Pasifika medical students, which the party calls "racial discrimination". Again, we explain what's at stake.</p>

            <p>Debate on these issues will be intense and the motivations and identities of people involved aren't always clear, as Farah Hancock showed in her piece about a campaign accused of 'astroturfing'.</p>
        
            <p>One of the stand-out journalistic investigations of 2023 came from RNZ's Guyon Espiner: an ongoing probe into the lobbying industry.</p>
        
            <p>'Mate, Comrade, Brother', started in March this year, laying out in unprecedented detail the tactics and influence of lobbyists. It led directly to a swift response from then-Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, who announced a suite of policy changes, a review and even a change to the important Cabinet Manual.</p>
        
            <p>For an overview of the issue from Espiner read this piece and this one. The latest on work to clean up the industry is covered here. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has previously indicated he's willing to tackle the issue - RNZ will be following this closely in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Our coverage of political donations was led by Farah Hancock's data analysis, including where it appeared to overlap with policy.</p>
        
            <p>In Undercurrent, a multimedia documentary series, RNZ's Susie Ferguson took a close look at the drivers, results and responses to the rise of mis- and disinformation. The podcast was released as the election campaign was starting, updated with a bonus episode as it unfolded, and remains an important resource as the problem persists.</p>
        
            <p>Among RNZ's best-read stories from 2023 were two about Jacinda Ardern's term as prime minister. Anusha Bradley's news feature, published the day after Ardern resigned, examined the hate and vitriol she endured. And a deep analysis of Ardern's premiership - Spare Change - concluded she left the role with a number of projects unfulfilled.</p>
        
            <p>Also widely viewed - and still a gripping watch - is Boiling Point, a video documentary directed by Angus Dreaver and narrated by Corin Dann. Internationally recognised by the Association for International Broadcasting, it gives a raw account of the occupation at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>In a deeply-reported three-part series, RNZ's Kirsty Johnston explained how an agricultural lobby pushed the Labour Government off its course to price agricultural emissions. Crown vs Cow is a must-read for anyone hoping to understand the next moves on New Zealand's big, unresolved climate change challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Mental healthcare, another area where critics say Labour tried but failed to make fundamental change, was also covered in depth in Anusha Bradley's four-part series, which makes ominous reading for the incoming Mental Health Minister.</p>
        
            <p>Bradley also carried out a major investigation into the Jehovah's Witnesses, exposing the harm caused by its policy of 'shunning' as well as evidence of alleged paedophiles remaining active in the community, unbeknownst to followers. The Jehovah's Witnesses continue to resist examination by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into abuse in care.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, if you're planning to listen in to another year of weekly interviews with the new Prime Minister, our data analysis of his (and Labour leader Chris Hipkins') verbal tricks and habits would make a solid primer.</p>
