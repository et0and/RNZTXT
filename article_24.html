        <h2>Three (very) big weeks for Crown-Māori relations</h2>
        <p>
Analysis: Starting tomorrow, what happens at three key events will have a major bearing on the new government's relationship with many Māori.

            <p>This story has been updated to clarify details regarding the planned Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The annual events of Rātana and Waitangi Day are usually pivotal moments in Aotearoa's cultural and political calendar. Marking the start of the political year, they provide platforms for the celebration of te ao Māori and foster dialogue between iwi Māori and te Kāwangatanga (the government).</p>
        
            <p>But this year, another event has been added to the calendar, Hui-aa-Motu, called by the Kiingitanga to "unify the nation and hold the government to account".</p>
        
            <p>The event will likely set the scene for the next few weeks of discussions, reflecting the heightened tensions around the perceived "anti-Māori" and "divisive" nature of the new government's approach.</p>
        
            <p>It will also be a crucial time for the new coalition government as they find their feet in te ao Māori. The new ministers and MPs will be closely scrutinised by Māori leaders seeking clarity on their intentions.</p>
        
            <p>The mauri (life force/spirit) of Hui-aa-Motu will be passed on to Rātana, where conversations will continue, and then to Waitangi commemorations. The events will undoubtedly shape the dynamics of Māori-government relations in the coming year.</p>

            <p>Over the past 20 years, and largely since the 1980s, there has been a broad cross-party consensus on Māori-Crown relations. Both the main parties of the left and right have supported the application of the Treaty of Waitangi and the revitalisation of Te Reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The new coalition government has turned sharply away from these positions. Items in the coalition agreement, as well as the rhetoric of its leaders have been criticised as 'anti-Māori' and 'divisive'. Already, there are four legal challenges underway by iwi.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, there are concerns about a planned Treaty Principles Bill, which will be supported by the government through the initial legislative stage. The bill is an ACT Party policy and seeks to clarify or redefine the existing Treaty principles. Details of what this will look like aren't clear yet.</p>
        
            <p>The Government has also already axed Te Aka Whai ora, the Māori Health Authority, and told departments with dual Māori-English names to lead with their English title first.</p>
        
            <p>These issues, as well as the overall approach to the relationship with Māori, will colour the mood at Hui-aa-Motu, Rātana and on Waitangi Day this year.</p>

            <p>In December, after widespread protest against the new government's policies, Kiingi Tuuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII issued Te Paki o Mātariki the highest form of proclamation by the king, calling a hui to unify the nation and hold the government to account.</p>
        
            <p>It's been more than a decade since the Māori King issued a royal proclamation. The last time was in 2012, prompted by a debate over water rights.</p>
        
            <p>Hui-aa-Motu is a tikanga based event for all ages, taking place at Tuurangawaewae Marae in Ngaaruawaahia, which will be focussed on looking forward. Over 3000 people have already registered for the event online. Iwi from across the country expected to attend including Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahungunu, Rangitāne, and Ngāti Porou. The event will be one to remember, acting as a who's who of te ao Māori.</p>
        
            <p>After the pōwhiri, the hui will split into five different breakout sessions with a range of speakers and MCs including Hone Harawira, Pania Papa, Hinewehi Mohi, Taa Tipene O'Regan, and Dame Jenny Shipley.</p>
        
            <p>Sessions will focus on tikanga and matauranga, rangatahi perspectives, national unity, people and wellbeing, and te tiriti and the environment. A lot of ground will be covered.</p>
        
            <p>The new Prime Minister Christopher Luxon won't be there - he did however meet with Kiingi Tuuheitia privately on Tuesday. That meeting had been planned since last year and was an opportunity to further build on the relationship they have established over the last two years, the prime minister's office said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's absence may raise eyebrows, though Labour's leader Chris Hipkins is also not expected to attend. Instead, both parties will be represented by senior Māori MPs in their ranks.</p>
        
            <p>For National, its newly appointed Māori-Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti Minister Tama Potaka (Ngāti Hauiti, Whanganui, Ngāruahine, Taranaki, Ngāti Raukawa, and Ngāti Whitikaupeka) and Dan Bidois (Ngāti Maniapoto), who is chair of the Māori Affairs select committee, will be there.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka has a background in leading iwi organisations and is also the Minister for Whānau Ora and Conservation. He will be a key player this weekend for the National Party, but also over the coming weeks with his extensive knowledge of Te reo Māori me ōna Tikanga.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's (much-reduced) Māori caucus will be there too, as well as Green Party MPs, and all of Te Pāti Māori's six MPs.</p>
        
            <p>NZ First's deputy leader Shane Jones has been scornful of the hui, suggesting it could turn into a "monumental moan session". Jones told RNZ's Morning Report the contentious policies were what the public voted for and claimed that none of the iwi leaders had even read the coalition agreements.</p>

            <p>The conversations around Māori and Crown relations will continue at the week-long festival held at Rātana, which is usually considered to be the start of the political year. The annual event celebrates its founder Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana's birthday. The pan-iwi religious movement, founded in 1925, has a long-standing alliance with the Labour Party but that doesn't stop other parties engaging.</p>
        
            <p>Politicians from all parties are invited to speak on issues relating to te ao Māori, while Māori are able to make their views clear. It's a place where promises are made and the tone of relationships are set. The ACT Party will be the only party in Parliament not attending this year's Rātana celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Whilst it is a peaceful celebration, it has not been without controversy.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Luxon was directly addressed by prominent Waikato-Tainui leader Rāhui Papa, a speaker on the paepae at Rātana, who told him there was nothing to fear about co-governance.</p>

            <p>Through the early 2000s, politicians attending Waitangi became a target for some protesters, resulting in the political pōwhiri moving to the Treaty grounds. The physical protests that flared as former National leaders Don Brash and then John Key walked on to the lower Te Tii Marae haven't been seen in years but there are likely to be firm challenges issued to Government MPs this year.</p>
        
            <p>More recently, Waitangi commemorations have centred around iwi Māori and their voice. A forum tent is typically set up on the grounds of Te Tii Marae where various kaupapa are discussed. The forum tent is set to continue, hosting discussion on Tino Rangatiratanga, Te reo Māori, and Te tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>But the absence of a large and strong Māori caucus within the current Government, in contrast to the previous Labour government, changes the dynamic.</p>
        
            <p>Under the previous Labour government, Kiritapu Allen and Peeni Henare attended the forum discussions. Last year, then-deputy Labour leader and local Māori MP Kelvin Davis frequently sat alongside leader Chris Hipkins during official Waitangi events, providing him translation and context.</p>
        
            <p>The National-led coalition has fewer ties in to the community, less knowledge of tikanga Māori and little in the way of a record to speak of from its Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>The Waitangi celebrations are also a time of whānaungatanga and whānau fun, with food stalls, and New Zealand artists performing. But everyone will be expecting a more tense atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>With three major gatherings taking place over the next few weeks, the government should be prepared for Māori to make their opposition to its policies heard.</p>
        
            <p>The nuanced discussions that unfold during Hui-aa-Motu, Rātana, and Waitangi commemorations, and the Government's response to them will shape its relationship with te ao Māori for the next three years.</p>
