            <p>Young mountain bike star Sammie Maxwell has won her bid for Olympic selection after high level discussions involving the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) board.</p>
        
            <p>Maxwell was on Monday confirmed in the New Zealand team for Paris alongside two-time world champion Sam Gaze. Both will take to the cross country course at Elancourt Hill in less than two weeks - albeit Maxwell's selection is conditional on her health needs being adequately supported at the Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>The late announcement comes after Maxwell successfully appealed Cycling NZ's decision not to nominate her for the Paris Games, in an "incredibly complex" case that has been watched closely by sports officials.</p>
        
            <p>Maxwell, who has been open about her battles with disordered eating, had not been put forward for selection for health, rather than performance reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Cycling NZ's nomination criteria includes a clause that athletes must demonstrate they do not suffer from "any mental or physical impairment that would prevent them from competing at the 2024 Games to the highest possible standard".</p>
        
            <p>But that decision was overturned by the Sports Tribunal, which said Cycling NZ's handling of Maxwell's case for nomination represented a "serious breach of natural justice".</p>
        
            <p>While the tribunal commended Cycling NZ for its concern about athlete health and wellbeing, the panel found officials had relied on inaccurate and out of date information when it considered Maxwell's case.</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal panel was also critical of the national body's failure to provide Maxwell with a copy of a medical report compiled that was pivotal in the decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>Maxwell said while the past few weeks had been "stressful and hectic" she was excited about the opportunity to compete at her first Olympic Games.</p>
        
            <p>"It's true the past few weeks have been stressful and hectic, but I recognise that everyone involved in the process has a shared goal - to put my health and wellbeing first," the under-23 world champion said.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't always agree with how everyone thought that should look, but I am grateful to have so many people around me caring for me and looking out for my health."</p>
        
            <p>NZOC said in a statement that it appreciated it had been a complex process and "acknowledges the care shown by all those involved as they worked to balance both performance and wellbeing outcomes".</p>
