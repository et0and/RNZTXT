        <h2>Thousands fewer getting mental health care, new data shows</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Thousands fewer young people are getting specialist mental health and addiction care despite rising demand, new figures reveal.</p>
        
            <p>Data released today by Te Hiringa Mahara-Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission show 16,000 fewer people were seen by specialist services in the year to June 2024, compared to a peak in the year ended June 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Two-thirds of the gap - more than 10,000 people - were those aged under 25.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023/24 there were 176,261 people who used specialist services, which is more than 3000 fewer people than in 2022/23 (179,472), and nearly 11,000 fewer than 2018/19 - the first year of data the commission had analysed.</p>
        
            <p>Commission chief executive Karen Orsborn said the decline in people being seen was not due to falling demand.</p>
        
            <p>"Levels of need are increasing in the community, but people are really struggling to get access to services when they need them."</p>
        
            <p>This was largely due to workforce shortages coupled with the increasing complexity of people's needs, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was particularly concerning that so many fewer young people were accessing specialist help, said Orsborn.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 19 to 24 experienced the largest relative decrease, with 1368 fewer people in that age bracket seen in the last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that youth services are under particular pressures around the workforce, but also there are increasing rates of distress for our young people," Orsborn said</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing those rates of distress increase significantly, both in New Zealand but also globally, so that's certainly a big challenge."</p>
        
            <p>Some mental illnesses also had their onset when people were young, which put increasing pressure on youth services, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The government's mental health workforce plan, published in September, did not specifically address shortages in youth services.</p>
        
            <p>"That's one of the areas that we'd like to see much more focus on in terms of that workforce plan," she said.</p>

            <p>Orsborn was also concerned about the overall downward trend in the number of people being seen.</p>
        
            <p>In the past year, the decrease in access was entirely related to mental health services, rather than addiction services, which actually saw slightly more people in 2023/24 than the year prior.</p>
        
            <p>Across the population, this represented an access rate of 3.3 percent, down from 3.4 percent in 2022/23 and 3.8 percent in 2018/19.</p>
        
            <p>In June 2024, the commission made recommendations for government and health agencies to take urgent action to speed up improvements in critical areas.</p>
        
            <p>One of its recommendations - a study to understand rates of mental illness among young people - was announced in Budget 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Three other recommendations had been made to Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand, and the Commission would be keeping a "close watch" on progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to see some real, tangible focus on improving access, particularly for our young people," Orsborn said.</p>
        
            <p>"That needs a really concentrated effort and some leadership that involves services, clinicians and the young people having a voice so everybody working together to really address those issues and make that difference for young people and their families."</p>
