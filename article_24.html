        <h2>The day the Māori Queen came to Waitangi</h2>
        <p>
Dressed in all white, the new queen stood out immediately among the kuia and kaumātua wearing their usual black formal pōwhiri clothes.
</p>
        
            <p>In the 10 minutes before the new Māori monarch, Kuini Nga wai hono i te po, was welcomed onto the Waitangi Treaty grounds on Tuesday there was complete silence.</p>
        
            <p>The pōwhiri was already behind schedule and hundreds of onlookers stood patiently in anticipation behind boundary ropes in the hope they'd get a glimpse of her.</p>
        
            <p>The lucky few who managed to get a patch of shade were still sweating, attempting to cool themselves down with makeshift fans. Some had brought camping chairs, while others sat on picnic blankets.</p>
        
            <p>Then, after what had felt like a lifetime waiting, the manuhiri (visitors) stepped forward signalling the start of the formal welcome.</p>
        
            <p>The sounds of pūtatara (conch shell trumpets) rang out, overlapping with haka and karanga.</p>
        
            <p>Three kaiwero (warriors) slowly edged forward towards the manuhiri, placing a taki on the ground.</p>

            <p>It was the first time Kuini Nga wai hono I te po has visited the historic treaty grounds since her father, Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau te Wherowhero VII, passed away in August last year and she was appointed the new monarch of the Kiingitanga movement.</p>
        
            <p>During Waitangi commemorations last year, she had accompanied her father to the Far North, responding to the tono from Ngāpuhi rangatira and carrying with them the mauri from hui aa motu. This time, she made the journey without him, and although she didn't come alone, Kiingi Tuheitia's presence was notably felt and missed.</p>
        
            <p>The queen took her place, sitting on the mahau (porch) of Te Whare Rūnanga as whaikōrero commenced.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikōrero is a skill, which if done well, can seamlessly weave together whakapapa and kaupapa and this pōwhiri was no exception.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes flowed and lamented the loss of leaders including the late Kiingi Tuheitia, Dame Tariana Turia and more recently Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, the matriarch of the Kohanga Reo movement.</p>
        
            <p>Speakers on the paepae often use symbolic language, embellishing their kōrero with whakataukī (Māori proverbs) and references to whakapapa and history. It means that the translation of whaikōrero from te reo Māori into english, just doesn't do it justice.</p>
        
            <p>Translation headsets were provided so attendees could understand the beauty and nuance of the whaikōrero on the paepae. Below are the translations provided in real time.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party MP and uri nō Te Tai Tokerau, Peeni Henare, was the first to speak on the haukāinga (home people) side, acknowledging the new queen and her whakapapa links to the North, of which she is a descendent.</p>
        
            <p>"In the short time you have taken the throne you have accomplished a lot, you haven't ceased working. Look at her youthfulness, the youthfulness of our queen. She brings such energy. All of the work you have accomplished in such a short time, we acknowledge that."</p>
        
            <p>Tainui rangatira Tukoroirangi Morgan brought an element of lightheartedness at the beginning of his kōrero, also expertly referencing the Kuini's whakapapa to the North, a common thread throughout the speeches.</p>
        
            <p>But he turned to a more serious subject, the need for unity among te iwi Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"There is only one reason we are here, it is unity. For mana Māori, so that mana motuhake returns. That is the one and true purpose of us being here today."</p>
        
            <p>"We saw the unity in the hikoi, we can see that here today. There is nothing that can stop us."</p>

            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu chairman Bayden Barber asked for Māoridom to keep moving.</p>
        
            <p>"The question is still, how can we unite as people to move forward? I've been sitting here thinking about that question and pondering."</p>
        
            <p>"I encourage everyone, friend or foe, don't leave this kōrero on your lips. The unity of Māori is a long journey, I'm not saying it's impossible but what I am thinking right now is how can we continue this work of kōtahitanga?" Barber said.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leader of Te Pāti Māori Rawiri Waititi was also part of the manuhiri, walking on with the Kiingitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi, who has been pushing for a separate Māori Parliament since Waitangi last year, spoke of the need for change, instead of just kōrero.</p>
        
            <p>"At Rātana I spoke about a Māori parliament, but we are still waiting to embody these prophecies. We have been speaking about all of these things for a long time, when will we establish these things? It is time!"</p>
        
            <p>"Do not wait. It is not until we establish them and go full throttle that we will find prosperity for te iwi Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day Te Pāti Māori re-committed to establishing a Parliamentary Commissioner for Te Tiriti, which it said would ensure the Crown was held accountable for its obligations under the founding document.</p>
        
            <p>The party also campaigned on establishing a commissioner at the 2023 election.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori said that while the Waitangi Tribunal looked at breaches of Te Tiriti, the commission would "be invested in, and have teeth" in compelling the government to honour its obligations.</p>
        
            <p>In his whaikōrero, Waititi once again put forward the idea, which seemed to be well received by the crowds.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's establish a Treaty of Waitangi commission, a high commission, so that we may have the ammunition to challenge the government."</p>

            <p>Although Kuini Nga wai hono i te po did not speak publicly, much like her predecessors, her attendance at Waitangi this year was met with joy.</p>
        
            <p>At just 27 years old, the new Kuini signals a societal shift, with a new generation of rangatahi now stepping up.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau Māori, including Tamariki were out in droves to get a glimpse of her in person.</p>
        
            <p>One family had brought their five daughters all the way from Whakatāne just to see her.</p>
        
            <p>When we asked why they had come here today, they all had the same answer.</p>
        
            <p>"To see the queen."</p>
        
            <p>The oldest daughter, at 12 years old, explained why she admired her so much.</p>
        
            <p>"She's beautiful, just her presence makes everyone happy."</p>

            <p>After formalities had finished, the kapa haka skills of te iwi o te motu were on full display.</p>
        
            <p>Nannies and kuia from Tainui arose to sing and dance across the marae atea, encouraging the rangatira from Ngāpuhi to join them.</p>
        
            <p>They succeeded in getting the Mayor of Far North Moko Tepania up on his feet, attempting to showcase his best dance moves despite the hot sun.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiingitanga have left Te Tai Tokerau, many will now travel to the tangihanga of Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi.</p>
        
            <p>Today, the haukāinga will have the massive job of welcoming government officials, where the atmosphere will likely be very different.</p>
