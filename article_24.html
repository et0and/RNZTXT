        <h2>Eden Park proposes university housing - without talking to university</h2>
        <p>
The stadium trust said the suggestion was "in context of future possibilities". But it was already included in the fast-track law. Audio

            <p>The University of Auckland has said it was unaware of plans for a student hostel at Eden Park, despite the stadium trust claiming it would be developed "in conjunction" with the university.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed 150-bed hostel was included in Eden Park's successful fast-track act application for upgrades to its suburban Auckland stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The Fast-track Approvals Act was introduced in December 2024 as a one-stop shop to speed up gaining consents and permissions for projects with national or regional significance.</p>
        
            <p>It listed 149 projects for "fast track", including the Eden Park Trust's 2.1 project, which proposed upgrades ranging from a retractable roof and stand improvements to "potential student accommodation providing 150 beds in conjunction with the University of Auckland".</p>
        
            <p>Inclusion in the act means Eden Park's upgrade project can skip a referral stage and go straight to consideration by an expert panel. Projects included in the act could avoid potential legal challenges about their referral to the fast-track pathway.</p>
        
            <p>But the inclusion of the student hostel at Eden Park was not raised with residents in the area or with the university, RNZ has found.</p>
        
            <p>Official Information Act requests made to the university by RNZ failed to unearth any communication or documents regarding the hostel.</p>
        
            <p>"We have consulted with the University's Vice Chancellor, Chief Property Officer, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Strategic Engagement, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Operations and Registrar and confirm that the University is not aware of any proposal, documents or correspondence that pertains to student hostels and The Eden Park Trust," the response stated.</p>
        
            <p>The university also confirmed none of the above staff had any recollection of verbal conversations about the topic.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, the university confirmed no formal conversations had taken place, but a spokesperson said it was "unsurprising" the Trust invoked its name in the fast-track application as the university and the Eden Park Trust had a "strong, multi-faceted partnership".</p>
        
            <p>Partnerships such as student accommodation would need to be considered by a joint board. "The board has not yet considered specific proposals involving student accommodation," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked Eden Park Trust why it included the university's name in its application without having discussions first, and whether it felt the inclusion was misleading.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Trust chief executive Nick Sautner told RNZ the reference to the hostel was made in "context of future possibilities" and was "appropriate given our strong and collaborative relationship".</p>
        
            <p>"As with all our icon partners, we remain open to exploring opportunities that align with the future vision for Eden Park."</p>
        
            <p>The fast-track application document required applicants to confirm the information provided was "true and correct".</p>
        
            <p>Victoria University law expert Dr Eddie Clark described it as "extraordinary" that something which was not first discussed with the University of Auckland was included in an application, however he doubts Eden Park would face any legal difficulties given the vagueness of the content on the application.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was interesting that, "this sort of looseness can end up in the schedule of a piece of legislation" and suggested a brief online application form demonstrated "not great process".</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that you can say, 'Oh, we're going to do this student accommodation because we think it might be a good idea. The uni might like it - have we asked them? No.' It seems pretty extraordinary that you can get that in there, because it is in the Schedule. It says that the project will include a functioning entertainment facility, the boutique hotel and student accommodation."</p>
        
            <p>Clark expects some fast-tracked projects may face litigation in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"If an error like this comes up in the substantive application, I think there's a decent chance it could get knocked back by the courts."</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Infrastructure Chris Bishop said applicants who sought to be included in the Fast-track Act were required to sign a statutory declaration that the information provided was true and correct.</p>
        
            <p>The Advisory Group selecting the projects to be included in the Fast-track Approvals Act could have "reasonably expected" information to be correct.</p>
        
            <p>All applicants need to submit a second, substantive application which was considered by an expert panel.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident that the substantive-stage decision making will be thoroughly robust," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>If the project is not for the same activity, or in the same location as the project as included in the Act, they will be unable to lodge their substantive application, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They can however reapply to have their project referred to expert panels should they choose to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Another Fast-tracked project has walked-back information included in its application. Seabed miners Trans Tasman Resources retracted a claim the a mining project off Taranaki's coastline would generate $1 billion in annual export earnings.</p>
        
            <p>In February 2024 the university entered into what it described as a three year strategic partnership with Eden Park Trust, which involved renaming the North Stadium the University of Auckland North Stand.</p>
        
            <p>When it was announced, University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Dawn Freshwater said the partnership would create opportunities to collaborate on, "educational exchanges, joint research, work integrated learning and internship experiences, venue-related professional development experiences, and aligned community and cultural initiatives that benefit the community we proudly serve."</p>
        
            <p>A document outlining the benefits of the relationship described the partnership as a new approach for the University and said a range of programmes were being developed in four key areas. These included student and staff experiences, research collaboration, brand visibility and civic engagement.</p>
        
            <p>The inspiration for including accommodation for students came from overseas examples, Sautner told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Integrating accommodation with stadiums has been successfully implemented internationally, including at the University of Arizona, where student dorms are part of Arizona Stadium. Wembley Stadium in London has student accommodation developments in close proximity, such as Unite Students' Olympic Way and Scape Wembley."</p>
        
            <p>The park's long-term future as Auckland's main stadium is is likely to become clearer after today, when Auckland Council will vote on whether to back Eden Park's upgrade proposal, or a new proposed waterfront Te T≈çangaroa/Quay Park stadium, which includes a hotel, shops, bars and restaurants. Ahead of the meeting advisory staff from Auckland Council indicated neither proposal for a new or upgraded "main stadium" was viable without significant public funding.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported 15 of 20 councillors voting have previously accepted invitations from Eden Park Trust to events at the venue, including Coldplay and All Blacks test matches.</p>
        
            <p>The council's backing does not include financial support.</p>
