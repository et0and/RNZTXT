            <p>Former politician Dame Tariana Turia has died.</p>
        
            <p>The founder and former co-leader of Te Pāti Māori suffered a stroke earlier this week and was said not to have long left.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ranga Tupua said in a post on Facebook that she had passed away early on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"A mother of six; grandmother; and great-grandmother of over 80 mokopuna, Kahurangi (Dame) Tariana will be remembered for spearheading a movement of transformation inspired by her belief in whānau being able to define their own solutions," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Her introduction of Whānau Ora in 2002 was instrumental in changing how the state interacted with Māori, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kahurangi Tariana championed the drive for self-determination; becoming co-leader of the Māori Party in 2004 after she famously 'crossed the floor' to vote against the Foreshore and Seabed Bill."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana served as a member of parliament for 18 years, initially as a list MP for Labour, then in the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate.</p>
        
            <p>She left Labour in 2004 and returned to parliament after winning a by-election for Te Pāti Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"The loss of her beloved husband, George, in April 2019 took a significant toll on Dame Tariana, as has her declining health over the last two years.</p>
        
            <p>"It was her heartfelt wish to return home to lie in the house of Rangitāhuahua; her last days surrounded with the laughter of mokopuna, the waiata of her whānau; the karakia and kōrero that had always given her comfort."</p>
        
            <p>Friday and Saturday would be a time for her whānau and iwi to gather at Putiki Marae and in Whangaehu.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday and Monday, others were welcome to visit and pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana's nehu would be held on Tuesday 7 January.</p>
