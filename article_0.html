            <p>Sevu Reece nearly quit New Zealand rugby but chose to stay and he's not regretting his decision after playing a starring role in his return to the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The Crusaders wing scored the opening try of Saturday night's tense one point win over England in Dunedin, calmly collecting a Damian McKenzie cross field kick before out sprinting the English cover defence to dot down in the right hand corner.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously it was on the back of some awesome momentum from my big boys (All Blacks forwards) and I was just on the edge and finished off the try," Reece said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it was good to get a try and big thanks to the boys for setting me up."</p>
        
            <p>Reece was weighing up a move offshore after missing most of last year with a serious knee injury, including the World Cup.</p>
        
            <p>He revealed last week that Scott Robertson's elevation to All Blacks coach changed his mind about leaving.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old, who hadn't played for the All Blacks since 2022 before the England game, is chuffed he decided to stay and fight his way back in the national side.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm feeling a bit sore. The last time I played test rugby was 18 months ago, so being back out there was very special. Hopefully I get to play again next week."</p>
        
            <p>Reece, who now has 16 test tries to his name, concedes it was hard to stay calm when the All Blacks were leading England by just one point with 15 minutes remaining in ÅŒtepoti.</p>
        
            <p>"I was running around and you don't feel happy with the scoreboard and anything can happen. Thank goodness we managed to come out on top."</p>

            <p>The match finished in bizarre fashion as All Blacks first-five Damian McKenzie lined up a penalty goal attempt in the final few minutes only for Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli to rule that he had taken too long.</p>
        
            <p>England then grabbed momentum and went on the attack with New Zealand conceding a penalty.</p>
        
            <p>The tourists looked like they were mounting a strong challenge to win the game, but the All Blacks held on with replacement forward Tupou Vaa'i winning a penalty turnover to end the match.</p>
        
            <p>A player has 60 seconds from when a penalty is awarded to take the kick at goal, but with no visible shot clock present at Forsyth Barr Stadium, Reece said there was confusion around McKenzie's attempt.</p>
        
            <p>"We were standing there and I heard the ref say something, but I wasn't too sure what he said and I'm pretty sure Damian was thinking the same thing as well. He said he heard the ref say something but it wasn't the time.</p>
        
            <p>"That actually stressed us all out because we had the chance to extend the lead and when that happened it was like, 'oh anything can happen' right now."</p>
        
            <p>Reece, Super Rugby's leading try scorer this season in a team that didn't make the playoffs, was one of the All Blacks best players against England.</p>
        
            <p>New coach Scott Robertson, who was rather relieved to have started his tenure with a win, said the winger was outstanding.</p>
        
            <p>"He was awesome wasn't he," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was energetic, did some great things. Defensively he was outstanding. Did great work off the ball. I'm really pleased for him. To come back from an injury like that and play at that level after, it normally takes you a while but he's been up there all season, so very pleased for him."</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks retain the Hillary Shield with the first test win.</p>
        
            <p>The second and final match of the series is at Eden Park next weekend.</p>
