            <p>Swimmer Erika Fairweather has made it through to the 200m freestyle final.</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather was finished seventh fastest after the semi-finals on Monday morning. The final will be held early on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns won their first two games of the tournament this morning - besting both China and Canada - they take on Fiji in their final pool match early on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>But several New Zealand athletes had a tough time at the Olympics overnight and early on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Surfer Saffi Vette was eliminated from the Games in her second round heat in Tahiti.</p>
        
            <p>Lulu Sun lost her first round singles match to Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk and her doubles match with Erin Routliffe was delayed again by rain.</p>
        
            <p>Gymnast Georgia Rose-Brown missed out on the finals, Luuka Jones missed out on the medals in the kayak singles, and Sammie Maxwell finished 8th at the mountain biking.</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Lewis Clareburt made it to the 400m individual medley final but came 6th.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand remains medal-less.</p>
