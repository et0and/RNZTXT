            <p>"We will continue to update everyone as we get information. Please stay away from the school until this area is given the all clear. Nga mihi (sic)."</p>
        
            <p>Staff and students were safe in locked classrooms, the school said.</p>
        
            <p>It said whānau interviews had been postponed and it had been in contact with the bus company to ensure there would be buses for students who needed them after the lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the public were to avoid the Hilltop area and cordons were in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons are in place on multiple streets in the area, and schools have been placed into lockdown as a precaution. More information will be released when we are in a position to do so."</p>

            <p>"Do not be alarmed, we are all safe. We are under police guidance and ask parents not to come to school until we are given the all clear," it said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Hospital said it was not in lockdown and patients and staff were safe.</p>
