            <p>Auckland Central MP Chl√∂e Swarbrick will be the Green Party's new co-leader alongside Marama Davidson, as James Shaw steps down.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Shaw said he would be stepping down from his duties as co-leader in March.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin-based activist and conservationist Alex Foulkes had put his hand up too for the role but announced on Sunday that he had withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>Ranked third on the party list, the Auckland Central MP appeared to be the popular choice from when Shaw made his announcement.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the mayoral race in 2016, she joined the Green Party.</p>
        
            <p>Winning the Auckland Central seat in 2020 and becoming the country's youngest MP in 42 years, she has proven her popularity from early on.</p>
        
            <p>She is the first Green MP ever to hold on to a seat for more than one term after winning again in the 2023 elections.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick denied leadership ambitions in 2022, when more than 25 percent of delegates at the party's annual general meeting voted to reopen Shaw's position.</p>
        
            <p>She has regularly registered in preferred prime minister polls ahead of the party's co-leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Recently, she had to apologise to Parliament a week after saying in the debating chamber Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had lied - a breach of the rules.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come </p>
