        <h2>Live updates: Ferry steering recently replaced, KiwiRail says</h2>
        <p>
The ferry is "lucky" to have run aground into sand and not rocks after steering issues, KiwiRail and Interislander bosses say. Follow our live updates here.
</p>
        
            <p>A comprehensive maintenance programme of the Aratere had been completed three weeks ago, which included replacing the steering system, Interislander executive general manager Duncan Roy said.</p>
        
            <p>"We brought in experts from overseas and that was part of our effort and commitment to improving the maintenance and reliability of our ferries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Interislander ferry Aratere ran aground near Picton and will likely stay there till Saturday night at the earliest.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry had been on a freight-only sailing when it suffered a steering failure and crashed about 9.45pm on Friday. No one was injured and there was no environmental damage, KiwiRail said.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers have safely disembarked and some crew members have now been swapped over.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail is working on plans to refloat the vessel at hightide on Saturday about 9pm.</p>
