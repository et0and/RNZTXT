</p>
        
            <p>More rain is forecast to fall on the West Coast overnight and orange heavy rain warnings remain in place for Buller, Westland and Southland, as of Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said heavy rain and strong north to northeast winds were forecast for many places.</p>
        
            <p>Large waves were expected to affect the West Coast of the South Island and heavy rain was forecast for the far south of the South Island, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>It continued to be a significant weather event for Westland, MetService said in its latest update.</p>
        
            <p>The bad weather is also now hitting the North Island, with orange level heavy rain warnings in place for Bay of Plenty, Taranaki and Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Heath Gullery told the Nights programme Westland's orange rain warning was in place until 6am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"There's going to be improvements in weather across the South Island, so those areas like Southland and Fiordland, up the West Coast through Westland Buller, and the top of the south Island which has also seen some significant rain around Tasman and northern Marlborough - all of those areas will see an improvement throughout tomorrow, rain becoming patchy and light."</p>
        
            <p>More than 800mm of rain has fallen in parts of Westland over the last two and a half days, and there was concern about how high two major rivers would get.</p>
        
            <p>Hokitika and Waiho Rivers peaked over their warning level on Thursday night, but have since been dropping, and were being closely monitored by emergency officials.</p>
        
            <p>These are the South Island areas under an orange level heavy rain alert, note that the rain amounts are in addition to what has already fallen in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Gullery said the front was forecast to move across central and upper North Island overnight and then eastwards through those areas on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have a series of heavy rain watches and warnings, extending down from Northland down to Taupo and across the Bay of Plenty and with that rain there is the possibility of localised downpours."</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, there are three areas under an orange level alert, although several other areas are under severe thunderstorm watches and heavy rain watches.</p>

            <p>Heavy rain moving through from the upper Wairau catchment is expected to raise the Wairau River level significantly on Friday.</p>

            <p>A power outage at Hannahs Clearing was worse than originally thought, and the area remains disconnected due to the loss of several power poles.</p>
        
            <p>Westland Emergency Management said areas south of Hannahs Clearing, including Arawhata, Jackson Bay and Neils Beach, were likely to be without power for several days. An update on the timeframe for it being restored was expected at midday on Friday.</p>
