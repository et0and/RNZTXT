            <p>US President Donald Trump has rebuked the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an extraordinary Oval Office clash, telling him he has "no cards" and is "gambling with World War Three".</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky has travelled to Washington DC to discuss a critical minerals deal as Trump seeks to broker an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>The last 10 minutes of the nearly 45-minute meeting then devolved into a verbal spat between the leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky was referencing Russian President Vladimir Putin breaching earlier agreements about attacking Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian president told Trump that promises of peace from Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted.</p>
        
            <p>US Vice-President JD Vance said: "What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump's doing."</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky questioned that saying "Putin broke the ceasefire. What kind of diplomacy JD are you speaking about?"</p>
        
            <p>Vance replied: "I think it's disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."</p>
        
            <p>The pair repeatedly shouted over each other, with Trump telling the Ukrainian president that he was losing the war, adding, "people are dying, you're running low on soldiers."</p>
        
            <p>Trump told Zelensky he was not in a very good position and Ukraine was in "big trouble".</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to be more thankful," Trump told Zelensky, adding that the Ukrainian leader was "gambling with World War Three."</p>

            <p>He threatened to withdraw US support in the stand-off in front of reporters ahead of a planned signing ceremony for a revenue-sharing minerals agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"You're either going to make a deal, or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty," Trump said.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing."</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky openly challenged the US president over his softer approach toward Putin, urging him to "make no compromises with a killer".</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the meeting, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social and said Ukraine's president was "not ready for Peace if America is involved."</p>
        
            <p>"I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace," Trump wrote said.</p>
        
            <p>White House officials have confirmed Zelensky has left the White House early. A press conference scheduled for later in the day has been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian leader was also due to meet with US politicians later on Saturday but it is unclear if those meetings will take place.</p>
