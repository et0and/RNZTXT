            <p>An organisation that supports women in Motueka suffering from family violence says it's now faced with a shortfall of $17,000 each year in order to continue its services, after an Oranga Tamariki funding cut.</p>
        
            <p>Women's Support Motueka provides counselling and social support and is the only crisis intervention service for women in the town affected by family violence and abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Manager Maluz Moreno said at the end of June, the service was given three days' notice that a four- year contract for funding would be terminated.</p>
        
            <p>She received the news on the eve of the Matariki and kept it to herself, not telling the team or the board until the following week, so they could enjoy the long weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really disheartening, at first we thought we were the only organisation affected but every time we hear about more organisations coming forward and the millions and millions of dollars lost, it puts a heavy toll on all of us.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a huge shock, as she had been told by various sources within Oranga Tamariki that family violence services would not be affected by cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki has defended the funding cuts, insisting it is a re-prioritisation of funding and that services will not be affected.</p>
        
            <p>The contracts of 190 providers will be discontinued, and more than 142 providers will have funding reduced.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Family Start in Nelson spoke out about the proposed loss of up to 40 percent of its frontline staff, as Oranga Tamariki reduces its funding.</p>
        
            <p>Moreno said for the last 37 years, Women's Support Motueka has provided services for women affected by family violence and abuse.</p>
        
            <p>It recently launched an initiative to help prevent family violence, in a bid to not only be the "ambulance at the bottom of the cliff".</p>
        
            <p>She said the demand for family violence services was increasing. In the year ending June, there had been an 18 percent increase in referrals.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it directly impacts the wellbeing of children when mums have support."</p>
        
            <p>It had received funding from Oranga Tamariki of $17,000 each year to provide counselling for 26 women and their families, however, Moreno said it consistently exceeded its expected outcomes and delivered counselling for more than 60 women per year.</p>
        
            <p>Moreno said there had been no explanation for why the funding was cut.</p>
        
            <p>In the last four years, it has provided counselling to over 250 wāhine. It works closely with Women's Refuge, as the only provider of crisis services in Motueka.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the time wāhine don't know that they are in an unsafe situation, they might come for other worries like anxiety and depression, but we find out along the way that they are actually in an unsafe relationship."</p>
        
            <p>Moreno said with the number of services affected by the recent funding cuts, she was concerned about where those needing support will go.</p>
        
            <p>"The services we provide mean that children don't necessarily see the effects of family violence in the long term and we can support them to navigate it without experiencing huge trauma, later in life.</p>
        
            <p>"The less these services are available, the more we will see family violence extending to our children's children and it is devastating to see there hasn't been a long term focus on the impact of these problems and the higher social cost for all of us in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Moreno said the organisation was committed to serving the Motueka community and would continue to support those affected by family violence.</p>
        
            <p>She was working to find alternative funding sources and welcomed any donations from the community, so the organisation could continue to provide services to those in need.</p>
