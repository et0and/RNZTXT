            <p>A large hole has been ripped in the hull of the Cook Strait ferrry Kaiarahi.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the hole above the waterline in the Interislander ferry "looks quite dramatic".</p>
        
            <p>"You can actually see through to the other side of the ship."</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said the Kaiarahi was damaged at its 10pm berthing Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, a Bluebridge ferry had to turn back after it hit a wharf as it was leaving Wellington, causing a dent and a small hole in the hull.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
