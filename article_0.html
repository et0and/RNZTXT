            <p>New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens has reportedly been freed from more than 1 1/2 years in captivity in West Papua, Indonesia.</p>
        
            <p>The Indonesian police announced it in a statement on Saturday, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>"We are prioritising approach through religious leaders, church leaders, traditional leaders and Egianus Kogoya's close family to minimise casualties and maintain the safety of the pilot," the chief of Cartenz 2024 Peace Operations, Brigadier General Faizal Ramadhani said in a statement released to media.</p>
        
            <p>Mehrtens was freed and picked up by a joint team in Nduga Regency and is undergoing health check-ups and a physiological examination in Timika regency, the police said.</p>

            <p>Indonesia has previously said it had prioritised talks with religious and community leaders to free the pilot, as a military operation in the rugged highland area presented dangers.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for comment.</p>
