            <p>Three people have now died in New Caledonia as the death toll rises amid escalating unrest.</p>
        
            <p>Charles Wea, a spokesperson for international relations in the president's office, confirmed the deaths to RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances are unclear in the French territory's third day of violence.</p>
        
            <p>France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said hundreds of people had been injured in rioting, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>French High Commissioner Louis Le Franc said "I sense dark hours have arrived in New Caledonia".</p>
        
            <p>"So what we must remember from what I am going to tell you is a call for calm, stop, stop.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop what has been started."</p>
        
            <p>It follows France sending in more than 600 reinforcements to back up local police.</p>
        
            <p>More than 130 people have been arrested and fears are turning to how these people will be detained, with the prison population already at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Local journalist Coralie Cochin told RNZ a curfew had been announced for Wednesday evening starting at 6pm local time.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealander holidaying in New Caledonia earlier told RNZ residents in the territory believed the situation could get worse.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Lightfoot and his family are stuck in New Caledonia until at least Friday after the government imposed curfews and a drinking ban to try to quell protests.</p>
        
            <p>The violence was provoked by a proposal by France which would allow French residents who've lived in New Caledonia for 10 years, to vote in provincial elections - a move local leaders fear will dilute the vote of the indigenous population.</p>
        
            <p>Lightfoot said the situation seemed peaceful as his family returned from a beach north of Noumea, but the number of protests escalated as they entered the capital. Intersections were blocked and some on fire. There were riot police throughout the city.</p>
        
            <p>He and his wife had to leave the hotel at night to find a doctor after she developed a chest infection.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a frightening experience. We could hear gunshots. We heard explosions."</p>
        
            <p>They had to drive through a roundabout on fire, blocked by 150 protesters.</p>
        
            <p>Lightfoot said locals and staff in the hotel had told them they believed protests could escalate with the presence of more riot police and latest moves from France.</p>
