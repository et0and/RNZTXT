            <p>The person accused of killing an elderly Wellington woman can now be named as her daughter, Julia DeLuney.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Gregory, 79, was found dead in her Khandallah home in January after suffering what police described as a "violent act".</p>
        
            <p>DeLuney, 53, had interim name suppression - but Justice Karen Grau denied giving her permanent name suppression last month.</p>
        
            <p>Her name, and her husband's Antonio DeLuney - who does not face charges, but had also sought name suppression - were kept secret until now to allow the family to prepare for it being made public.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Grau's judgment has also revealed details about what the Crown alleges: "A brutal and financially motivated murder."</p>
        
            <p>Julia DeLuney in July pleaded not guilty to murder and obtaining thousands of dollars by deception.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleges that Julia DeLuney deceived her mother into giving her $15,000.</p>
        
            <p>It said she then went to her mother's house on 24 January and murdered her.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said Julia DeLuney "attacked her with significant, and ultimately fatal, force".</p>
        
            <p>It said Antonio DeLuney called Julia DeLuney that evening and asked when she would be home.</p>
        
            <p>After that, Julia DeLuney is alleged to have left her mother's house and driven home, before returning to the house with her husband.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr DeLuney, when confronted by the scene, called 111 and performed CPR until ambulance staff arrived and took over," the judgment said.</p>

            <p>Julia DeLuney is a teacher who lives in Paraparaumu, court documents showed.</p>
        
            <p>The judgment said prior to her mother's death, Julia DeLuney had spent seven years trading cryptocurrency.</p>
        
            <p>She described facing significant mental health issues since the onset of menopausal symptoms in 2022, and suffered from poor sleep, panic attacks and persistent low mood, it said.</p>
        
            <p>She was currently taking an antidepressant, and had a history of anxiety and chronic low mood, depending on alcohol in her 20s - though she no longer drank.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband is Antonio DeLuney, and they have been living together at their home while she has been on electronically monitored bail, Justice Grau's judgment said.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to be a Crown witness at trial which is set down for June next year. There is no suggestion he was involved in his wife's alleged crimes.</p>
        
            <p>The document said the pair met in the United States and have been married for 10 years. They moved in together in New Zealand in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Antonio DeLuney has worked in construction and labouring. He has also reported struggles with mental health and alcohol addiction.</p>
        
            <p>Julia DeLuney's lawyer, Hunter de Groot, fought to keep her name secret at a hearing in September.</p>
        
            <p>There would be a "firestorm" of media coverage that could prejudice perceptions, he said, suggesting the level of interest surrounding the case would be similar to that of Auckland eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>But in her decision, Justice Grau said this case and its "level of intrigue" was not comparable, and publicity would not be "relentless and hostile".</p>
        
            <p>"There will naturally be more extensive reporting when the trial starts. But that is to be expected, and it does not follow that it will necessarily be 'minute by minute'."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Grau's judgment said Antonio DeLuney reported being under extreme stress "from the traumatic scene of his mother-in-law's death", the impending trial, and the prospect of his name being made public.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer, Sam Campbell, said revealing his name may make people think he was connected to the alleged murder.</p>
        
            <p>But neither of the DeLuneys' mental health issues - or the argument that they might worsen if their names were made public - was a reason to grant name suppression because they did not meet the threshold of extreme hardship, Justice Grau said.</p>
        
            <p>Publication of Antonio DeLuney's name was not likely to cast suspicion on him, she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no allegation that Mr DeLuney had anything to do with his wife's alleged offending.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not accept there is any realistic likelihood he will fall under suspicion or be 'tarred with the same brush', at least by any reasonable person."</p>
