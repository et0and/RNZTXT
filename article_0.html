            <p>Former All Blacks hooker and Dancing with the Stars winner Norm Hewitt has died, aged 55.</p>
        
            <p>Hewitt, who was understood to have motor neurone disease, died overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Hewitt won the first season of Dancing with the Stars in 2005 and played for the All Blacks from 1993 to 1998 in 14 matches, nine of which were tests.</p>
        
            <p>He was a stalwart of Hawke's Bay, Hurricanes and Māori rugby.</p>
        
            <p>He played initially during the Sean Fitzpatrick era in the All Blacks, which limited his number of appearances.</p>
        
            <p>A dynamic, combative player on the field, he had problems off it with alcohol which resulted in a few high-profile incidents.</p>
        
            <p>But he later became a vocal advocate over the following decades for changing drinking habits.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
