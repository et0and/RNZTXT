            <p>The national observance of Matariki is being held on Friday morning at Treble Cone skifield near Wﾄ］aka.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 people were gathering above the clouds, including Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other dignitaries.</p>
        
            <p>The theme for this year's celebrations was Matariki Heri Kai, the Feast of Matariki. It is a call for people to think not only about their kai, but the environment it came from.</p>
        
            <p>There are also other commemorations happening around Aotearoa.</p>
