            <p>Cabinet ministers are expected to decide on Monday whether to significantly boost Pharmac's funding to make right National's broken promise on cancer drugs.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands ministers will consider a range of options and figures on Monday - with an announcement to be made soon after it is signed off.</p>
        
            <p>At least one of those options is a major investment of cash for Pharmac.</p>
        
            <p>During last year's election campaign, National pledged to fund 13 specific cancer treatments - but the promised funding did not eventuate in last month's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>After a backlash from patients, ministers said work was under way to find a solution - and promised an announcement was coming soon.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
