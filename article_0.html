            <p>A person has been shot dead amidst escalating unrest, New Caledonia's French High Commissioner has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances are unclear, and two others are injured, in the French territory's third day of violence.</p>
        
            <p>"I sense dark hours have arrived in New Caledonia," commissioner Louis Le Franc said.</p>
        
            <p>"So what we must remember from what I am going to tell you is a call for calm, stop, stop.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop what has been started."</p>
        
            <p>It follows France sending in more than 600 reinforcements to back up local police.</p>
        
            <p>More than 130 people have been arrested and fears are turning to how these people will be detained, with the prison population already at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Local journalist Coralie Cochin told RNZ a curfew had been announced for Wednesday evening starting at 6pm local time.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
