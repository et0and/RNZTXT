            <p>The Prime Minister has confirmed he will not attend Waitangi at all next year.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon says senior representatives of the government will attend events across the country, including Waitangi, but he has chosen to take part in commemorating it elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>That means Luxon will not attend government talks with the Iwi Chairs Forum on 4 February, and will not be there for the annual political talks on 5 February.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday he would not confirm to reporters whether he was attending the commemorations in Northland, prompting the chair of the Waitangi National Trust to urge him to accept the invitation.</p>

            <p>Pita Tipene told RNZ on Tuesday the trust's kaupapa saw Waitangi as "the enduring symbol of nationhood" and he expected the prime minister to be there.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're clear about is that a promise was made at Waitangi on the 6th of February 1840. Therefore, discourse or conversations need to continue.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last few years, everyone comes to Waitangi. Why would the prime minister not come?"</p>
        
            <p>Tipene said while things had the potential to get "volatile", Waitangi commemorations were safe environments.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has confirmed he will attend Ratana celebrations in January, but has ruled out going to any of the set-piece calendar events in Waitangi in February.</p>
        
            <p>He let Tipene know on Friday morning after meeting with iwi leaders in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"It has always been my intention to celebrate Waitangi Day around the country with different iwi," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been in Waitangi the last two years, including in my first year as prime minister, so next year I have decided to head to another part of the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Waitangi Day is of national importance, and I am keen to join New Zealanders celebrating it in other regions."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Luxon was "running away from problems of his own creation".</p>
        
            <p>"This decision by Christopher Luxon shows that he is not willing to stand on his own track record, and defend the decisions his government is making... Christopher Luxon could easily do both - go up to Waitangi and join in some of the celebrations in the lead up to Waitangi Day and be part of the pōwhiri. He can then go and celebrate Waitangi Day elsewhere."</p>
        
            <p>His choosing not to showed he was "not willing to honour the Treaty of Waitangi despite his claims he would", Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Former prime ministers Sir John Key, Sir Bill English, and Helen Clark also decided to stay away from Waitangi and Te Tii marae in the past over issues around speaking rights.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018, however, the political talks have moved away from the controversial Te Tii Marae and have been held at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, which is seen as a more neutral environment.</p>
        
            <p>Key did not attend the Iwi Chairs Forum, political talks, or Waitangi dawn service in 2016 and in 2017 English went to Waitangi to meet iwi chairs but did not stay on beyond that.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said his talks with iwi chairs on Thursday morning were a "positive and productive discussion".</p>
        
            <p>"There are a number of areas where the government and Māori are already working together, for example in health, housing, infrastructure and climate adaptation.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of great work being done by iwi throughout the country and there are many opportunities for us to work together and do so much more."</p>
        
            <p>Details of where the prime minister will spend Waitangi Day will be announced closer to the time.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Māori-Crown relations and Māori development Minister Tama Potaka has already committed to going to Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>"As you know, I'm pretty committed to the kaupapa, the whakapapa, and the kotahitanga that comes with Waitangi," Potaka said earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said he was certain Waitangi would deliver robust conversation next year, but noted the peaceful nature of the recent hīkoi to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a real sense of pride, whakahīhī you might call it, but also commitment to kaitiakitanga [guardianship] that many of the engagements have had.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really enthused by the level of rangimārie or peacefulness at the hīkoi recently. That was absolutely outstanding and a credit to those people who led that."</p>
