        <h2>Watch: Luxon tells MPs to 'watch their rhetoric' as NZ First accused of racism</h2>
        <p>
Asked about comments by Shane Jones and Winston Peters, the PM says "I've seen MPs from lots of different parties making ... comments and remarks that aren't helpful".
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is facing questions as the Green Party calls for him to speak out against 'racist' comments by Shane Jones and Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First MPs are refusing to back down from comments they made towards immigrant MPs in the House this week.</p>
        
            <p>MPs were debating the Prime Minister's statement on Tuesday when Shane Jones yelled "send the Mexicans home" across the floor.</p>

            <p>Winston Peters then told Green MPs Lawrence Xu-Nan and Francisco Hernandez to "show some gratitude" for being in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon says he was not in the House on Tuesday and did not hear the remarks but reminds all MPs across Parliament to "watch their rhetoric".</p>
        
            <p>"They're not remarks I'd make myself, but I obviously have conversations with colleagues all the time," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"All I'd just say is having seen remarks from members of parties across Parliament even in the last 48 hours, you might recall I said last year every MP needs to watch their rhetoric.</p>
        
            <p>"Across the parties there's been MPs from lots of parties making comments I think that aren't appropriate or helpful."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he gathered Peters had clarified his comments "weren't intended to be anti-immigrant" but he reiterated they were not words he would use.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Lawrence Xu-Nan told RNZ Luxon needed to show leadership and address unacceptable behaviour in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really important for the prime minister to actually step up and address unacceptable behavior by his ministers," he said. "Our concern is behaviour like this without accountability will only empower and embolden racism within the communities."</p>
        
            <p>He pointed to a rise in violence against migrants on public transport last year, saying racist rhetoric in Parliament should not spill over into society.</p>
        
            <p>"Within the four walls of Parliament, [we should] have respect and understanding for each other," he said. "I feel like the minister ... is lowering the standard of what is expected [from] a member of Parliament and a minister."</p>
        
            <p>Xu-Nan said migrant communities were an integral part of New Zealand's identity.</p>
        
            <p>"Our diverse communities are migrant communities," he said. "It is an important part and is integral to our shared New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party has written to the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the House asking they take action, saying the comments were "outwardly racist and xenophobic".</p>
        
            <p>Mexico-born Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March said Luxon needed to hold his ministers to account.</p>
