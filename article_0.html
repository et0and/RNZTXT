            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has directed her council staff not to remove a mural in the city calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>On Instagram, Whanau said another 'Free Palestine' mural was removed yesterday by council officers from the same area in Waitangi Park.</p>
        
            <p>"As the Creative Capital of Aotearoa, I do not agree with the approach to remove art from dedicated spaces that speaks to the hard, complex and at times abhorrent issues of the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Art helps us digest unimaginable harm and things that we may struggle to comprehend. It can be confronting, uncomfortable, difficult, a call for peace, or a stamp of the heartache of a city."</p>
        
            <p>She said art should be "embraced" for the huge contribution it made to "our collective culture and conscience".</p>
        
            <p>"Murals should only be painted over if they incite hate or are inappropriate for children."</p>
        
            <p>National Party MP Chris Bishop responded to Whanau's post on Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>Atop a screenshot he shared of her statement, he added the comment: "Does anyone seriously think that if this had been a graffiti message calling for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages or condemning the savage brutality on 7/10, that the Mayor would order it to stay up?"</p>
        
            <p>National Party leader Christopher Luxon has previously spoken to Bishop about a strongly-worded email the MP sent about the Gaza conflict, which was widely shared on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau's statement comes a day after the US Consulate and Ministry of Foreign Affairs buildings in Auckland had red paint splashed on them and were tagged with messages calling for a ceasefire.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Wellington City Council voted to become the sister city of Ramallah in Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau's office has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Israel launched its war against Hamas after the Islamist Palestinian group's 7 October rampage into southern Israel. About 1200 people died in that attack and 240 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israel's tally.</p>
        
            <p>The armed wing of Hamas said it was ready to free up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for a five-day truce in the war.</p>
        
            <p>Israel, which effectively blockades Gaza, has rejected a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas would simply use it to regroup, but has permitted brief humanitarian "pauses" to allow food and other supplies to flow in and foreigners to flee.</p>
        
            <p>Gaza medical authorities say more than 11,000 people have been confirmed killed in the Israeli bombardment, about 40 percent of them children.</p>
