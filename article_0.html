        <h2>Watch: Hamish Kerr soars to gold after nerve-racking jump-off</h2>
        <p>
Kerr beat American Shelby McEwen in a tense duel in front of a packed house at the Stade de France.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Hamish Kerr has snatched a historic Olympic men's high jump gold medal by winning a dramatic jump-off at the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr beat American Shelby McEwen in a one-on-one duel that stretched for more than 30 minutes in the Stade de France, finally securing victory in the third round of the jump-off.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin-born 27-year-old ran to embrace family and supporters after clearing 2.34m, with McEwen having failed at that height, leaving the United States jumper to settle for silver.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had finished level after the full round of competition, being the only two jumpers to succeed at 2.26m - which equalled Kerr's personal best height - with co-defending champions Gianmarco Tamberi, of Italy, and Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar having both been eliminated.</p>

            <p>Kerr and McEwen's jump-off was full of tension, with both failing at 2.38m and then 2.36m before they were finally separated at 2.34m.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr becomes the first New Zealand male to win a field event in the Olympic track and field programme after picking up his country's record ninth gold in Paris.</p>

            <p>And under new terms introduced for these Games by World Athletics, he will receive a winner's prize of $US50,000 ($NZ83,400).</p>
        
            <p>In the qualification round earlier in the week, Kerr came within one jump of years of hard work coming to an unexpected halt.</p>
        
            <p>When the bar moved to 2.20m Kerr missed with his first, then his second attempt.</p>
        
            <p>He had one last attempt to keep his Olympic dream alive, and Kerr later admitted fear was setting in.</p>
        
            <p>"I've faced a few of those jumps in my life and not all of them have pulled off so I had to dig pretty deep for that one."</p>
        
            <p>The gold caps a breakthrough year for Kerr, who won gold at the world indoor championships in Glasgow, when he also pushed McEwen into silver.</p>
