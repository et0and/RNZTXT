        <h2>Watch live: Luxon faces questions after poll puts him behind Hipkins</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister is speaking to media after today's Cabinet meeting.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will speak to media about 4pm following Monday afternoon's Cabinet meeting.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a week which saw the government make moves towards speeding up infrastructure projects, sack the country's diplomatic representative in the UK and apologise for the ongoing school lunch omnishambles.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has overtaken Luxon as preferred prime minister, and the centre-left bloc would be able to form a government based on results in the latest Taxpayers' Union-Curia poll.</p>
        
            <p>Coalition partner New Zealand First introduced a bill to get rid of "woke" language it put into law when it was in coalition with Labour, and its leader Winston Peters was now heading to the United States to meet with his counterpart Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
        
            <p>Other topics that might come up include sacked minister Andrew Bayly's two-weeks off to go mountain climbing, the debate over the length of the Parliamentary term and another potential overhaul of the health system.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is expected to speak at 4pm.</p>
