            <p>Southland's district mayor Rob Scott says the bottom of the country is "over-governed" and is calling for a merger of the region's local authorities.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal - that would save an estimated $10m annually - would include the establishment of two unitary authorities in Southland, rather than the existing four councils.</p>
        
            <p>The region's representation comprises of the Invercargill City Council, Southland District Council, Gore District Council and Southland Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>Scott said the proposal would "reduce cost and improve efficiency" for local decision-making, off the back of a 13 percent rates increase for the 2024-25 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>"Those numbers aren't palatable, but they're not going down in a hurry either," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a population of about 100,000 with four councils.</p>
        
            <p>"You could argue we're over-governed."</p>
        
            <p>A similar proposal had been mooted further up the mainland this week, with a local group campaigning for southern councils, from Waitaki to Selwyn, break away from the Canterbury Regional Council and amalgamate into a unitary council.</p>
        
            <p>The structure of the country's local representation has been in place for more than 30 years,following the New Zealand local government reforms in 1989.</p>
        
            <p>This involved 850 local bodies amalgamating into 86 local authorities, made up of regional and territorial levels.</p>
        
            <p>"The world has changed quite a bit," Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think as a sector we need to take a look at ourselves and make sure that we are actually relevant to perform and deliver for our ratepayers."</p>
        
            <p>The proposed governance overhaul in Southland would mean 20 councillors would be cut with two fewer mayors and chief executives.</p>
        
            <p>Scott said the structure would "de-centralise" rather than centralise local authorities, by ensuring the retention of local voices with the continuation of community boards and river catchment committees.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a very big fan of the community board model and I can see that being enhanced."</p>
        
            <p>Although the finer details were still being firmed up, Scott envisioned a further two community boards established for the Gore and Mataura areas respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor conceded his position "could be on the chopping block" as a result of the proposed restructure.</p>
        
            <p>"We still need to service the community from a staffing level.</p>
        
            <p>"You're also looking at the operational aspect of two Long Term Plans, rather than four.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a very expensive, arduous process."</p>
        
            <p>The proposal is expected to be tabled at a council meeting later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Southland Regional Council chairperson Nicol Horrell said the merger proposal was a "timely conversation" to be had.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard from our community through the Long-term Plan process that we need to be looking for efficiencies, and we're committed to that.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure the Southland District mayor and councillors heard the same when they recently consulted on their own Long-term Plan and no doubt the council is facing difficult decisions around rate setting.</p>
        
            <p>But Horrell was not convinced on initial reading that Scott's proposal would be the ultimate outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"In my view, seeking efficiencies makes sense where similar services exist.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm less certain that, at first read, the mayor's proposal is where we'll end up but let's work together as a region for the best Southland solution."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Invercargill mayor Nobby Clark said he had discussed the proposal with Scott.</p>
        
            <p>Clark said it was not appropriate to comment until the Gore District Council and Southland Regional Council have had time to consider it.</p>
        
            <p>"I also need time to discuss the proposal with my elected colleagues and our chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>"The decisions required are not to be taken without due consideration."</p>
        
            <p>Gore District mayor Ben Bell has been approached for comment.</p>
