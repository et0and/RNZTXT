            <p>Firefighters have contained multiple scrub fires that threatened homes in Canterbury, and are continuing to work on the hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>A number of spot fires broke out along a railway line between Aylesbury and Darfield, west of Christchurch and were first reported about 4.30pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>By 7:30pm Fire and Emergency (FENZ) confirmed that houses in the area, and especially near Kirwee, were "no longer ... under immediate threat from fire", and no homes had been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>People were initially asked to keep away from the area, with police working on setting up road closures, but State Highway 73 would be reopened soon, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the blazes was believed to have started by sparks from a train travelling toward Darfield, and the fire crews had been working on multiple blazes at once.</p>
        
            <p>"A freight train shunting wagons from a milk factory in West Rolleston was held back near Darfield earlier today after it created a number of grass fires along the track," a KiwiRail spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The train was stopped while the incident was being investigated. No one was hurt."</p>
        
            <p>The track is closed overnight between Rolleston and Darfield.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said affected services overnight include the TranzAlpine travelling from Greymouth to Christchurch with 172 passengers on board. Overnight freight services are also affected.</p>
        
            <p>Bus replacements are in place for the TranzAlpine passengers.</p>
        
            <p>"We are sorry for the inconvenience, but safety has to be our top priority," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said the police have lifted a cordon which was set up at the intersection of West Coast Road and Courtenay Road.</p>
        
            <p>Three helicopters were still at work on the hotspots, along with 17 ground crews, using pumps, tankers, smoke chasers and a Command Unit. Crews had come from from Kirwee, Darfield, West Melton, Hororata, Dunsandel, Springfield, Wigram, Canterbury High Country and the Christchurch Command unit.</p>
