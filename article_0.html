            <p>A resident has described the moment the storm hit Mangawhai overnight, injuring two, ripping roofs of houses and cutting power.</p>
        
            <p>Two people from Mangawhai were taken to hospital in a serious condition. One was flown to Auckland Hospital by helicopter and the other was taken to North Shore hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Zoe Gimring said she woke to "the loudest roaring" and the sound of all of the outdoor furniture smashing against our deck railing. "Across the road from us there's part of someone's roof through the neighbour's roof - luckily they weren't home."</p>
        
            <p>Julie Wall's house had its roof torn off, and her family told her some of the debris ended up about 300 metres away.</p>
        
            <p>Close to 5000 properties were without power in the Mangawhai, Mangawhai Heads and Langs Beach areas overnight. By late morning Northpower said just under 1000 were still without supply.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) was working through all the calls for help with property damage, and checking homes in the wider area. A specialist drone team had also been called in.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said people should treat all power lines as live, and avoid driving in the area so as not to hold up emergency services.</p>
