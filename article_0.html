            <p>A plane has crashed at Toronto Pearson International Airport and injured eight people, officials say, with CBC television reporting the plane flipped on landing.</p>
        
            <p>Video posted by News Channel3 Now on Tuesday (NZT) showed a Delta Air Lines plane belly up on a snow-covered tarmac, with people walking away from the plane.</p>
        
            <p>Of the eight injuries, one was critical and the rest were mild to moderate, Peel Regional Paramedic Services Supervisor Lawrence Saindon said.</p>

            <p>Toronto's Pearson Airport said it was aware of an incident involving a Delta plane arriving from Minneapolis and that emergency teams were responding.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers and crew were accounted for, the airport said in a statement on X.</p>
        
            <p>Representatives for Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a plane crash. However, we don't know the circumstances surrounding it at this point," said Constable Sarah Patten of the Peel Regional Police in Ontario.</p>
        
            <p>"It is my understanding that most of the passengers are out and unharmed, but we're still trying to make sure so we're still on scene investigating," Patten said.</p>
        
            <p>Toronto Pearson Airport's website showed more than four dozen delayed flights leaving and arriving at the airport. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said there was a ground stop at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>The Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the independent agency that investigates plane crashes, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The crash in Canada comes after some other recent crashes in North America in late January. An Army helicopter collided with a passenger jet in Washington, killing 67 people, while at least seven people died when a medical transport plane crashed in Philadelphia.</p>
