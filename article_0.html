            <p>Transpower is disconnecting some North Island power assets in response to an extreme solar storm.</p>
        
            <p>The grid emergency now affects transmission throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>An "extreme" geomagnetic storm is affecting Earth at present.</p>
        
            <p>Material fired out from a sun spot, is crashing into the planet's atmosphere this weekend .</p>
        
            <p>The storm has the potential to disrupt power and satellites, as well as communications and GPS.</p>
        
            <p>The US Space Weather Prediction Centre says G5 (extreme) geomagnetic storms can impact power grids, satellites, and radio communications.</p>

            <p>The solar storm is expected to peak tonight, with the US Space Weather Prediction Centre forecasting severe conditions from 6-9pm (NZ time) on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA says although most solar events do not cause much impact, this is an "unusually strong event" so it pays to be prepared.</p>
        
            <p>It recommends people ensure they have charged batteries and flashlights in case the power goes out.</p>
