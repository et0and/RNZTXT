            <p>Hawke's Bay officials are preparing for possible flooding with heavy rain expected for Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecasters earlier issued an Orange Heavy Rain Warning for a period from early morning Boxing Day, for Gisborne-Tairāwhiti, and Hawke's Bay north of Napier.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings are in pace from 6am Thursday until 6am Friday in the Gisborne area and 9am Thursday until 1pm Friday in the Hawke's Bay north region.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 130mm of rain is expected to fall, and possibly more in localised areas, and thunderstorms are possible.</p>
        
            <p>It said that means there is potential for streams and rivers to rise rapidly, as well as flooding and slips.</p>
        
            <p>The Hawke's Bay Regional Council said it was calling back some staff from leave in preparation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team has been called back from leave and includes staff on the ground in Wairoa, closely monitoring river levels and looking to potentially open minor river mouths in the area should the need arise," the council said in a statement today.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently the Wairoa River mouth is performing well and we will be closely monitoring the mouth during the period of high swell.</p>
        
            <p>"From Esk to Māhia, we expect rivers to rise and remain within their channels, although we urge the community to be mindful that levels may rise quickly in heavy rain."</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there is a minimal chance of upgrading to a red warning.</p>
        
            <p>"We're closely monitoring the situation and will share updates if anything changes," the Hawke's Bay council said.</p>
