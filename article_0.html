            <p>The children's minister has slammed the actions of young people who climbed onto the roof of their South Auckland correctional facility as "not a protest", but as disruptive behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Eight young people spent the night on the roof of the youth justice facility, Korowai Manaaki in Wiri on Monday - the stand-off ended yesterday afternoon when the last of the youths were coaxed down.</p>
        
            <p>They are now in police custody, and have been charged with intentional damage.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Children Karen Chhour said in a statement the youths' behaviour was disorderly and disruptive.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a 'protest' as some media have labelled it, and as some may first assume."</p>
        
            <p>Chhour said the young people had often showed similar behaviour in their communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas can be a time where emotions are heightened, however I want to be clear - this behaviour will not be tolerated."</p>
        
            <p>She said the police and courts would deal with the consequences for their latest actions.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second time in 2024 youths had gained access to the roof of a justice facility, compared to 15 such incidents in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Chhour put the drop down to changes to improve the running of youth justice facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"The decrease in occurrences comes after the significant changes being introduced in the operation of the youth justice residences in the last year, with work programmes beginning to lift the safety and security of residences and improve staff recruitment and training."</p>
        
            <p>She backed the actions of Korowai Manaaki staff and thanked those who worked to get a solution.</p>
        
            <p>"The facility has done what it was meant to do and nobody was able to leave the premises, and I am glad that nobody has been badly hurt while this was resolved."</p>
