        <h2>Live: Who will take home the Silver Scroll Award?</h2>
        <p>
The second half of Aotearoa's most prestigious songwriting award ceremony is underway, with Jordyn for a Why's waiata taking the Maioha Award. Video
</p>
        
            <p>The top five finalists for the APRA Silver Scroll Award have a chance of winning the prize for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>They are Stan Walker (for 'I Am'), SKILAA (for 'Jenny Greenteeth'), Anna Coddington (for Kātuarehe'), Georgia Lines (for 'The Letter'), and Mermaidens (for 'I Like to Be Alone').</p>
        
            <p>Jordyn with a Why has taken out the APRA Maioha Award, which recognises contemporary Māori music and songwriters telling Te Ao Māori stories, for her waiata 'He Rei Niho'.</p>
        
            <p>The winners are determined by the votes of New Zealand APRA members (who are also songwriters, producers and performers).</p>
        
            <p>Jazz legend Mike Nock was also inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. He told RNZ, despite his many awards, this recognition would be top of the list for him.</p>
