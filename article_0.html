            <p>Warning: This story contains details of sexual assault.</p>
        
            <p>A court in France on Friday jailed three rugby players formerly with French side Grenoble for 12 to 14 years over the 2017 gang rape of a student.</p>
        
            <p>It sentenced Irishman Denis Coulson, 30, and Frenchman Loick Jammes, 30, to 14 years behind bars, and New Zealander Rory Grice, 34, to 12 years in jail.</p>
        
            <p>It handed four years in jail, including two suspended, to ex-Ireland international 31-year-old Chris Farrel over failure to prevent the crime.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealander Dylan Hayes, 30, received a two-year suspended sentence, also for not intervening to stop it.</p>
        
            <p>In the small hours of 12 March, 2017, the student, identified only as V, was in tears as she left a hotel on the outskirts of Bordeaux, where the Grenoble team spent the night after losing a Top 14 encounter against local side Bordeaux-Begles.</p>
        
            <p>V filed a complaint with police, saying she had met the players in a bar together with two friends and accompanied them to a nightclub where all of them drank heavily.</p>
        
            <p>The student said she had no recollection of how she got from the club to the hotel where she woke up, naked on a bed and with a crutch inserted in her vagina.</p>
        
            <p>She saw two naked men in the room and others fully dressed.</p>
        
            <p>Coulson, Jammes and Grice stated they had sexual relations with V but claimed the encounter was consensual and the student had been proactive in bringing it about.</p>
        
            <p>Farrell, owner of the crutch, was present, as was Hayes.</p>
