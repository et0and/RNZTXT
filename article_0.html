            <p>New Zealand's Finn Butcher has won gold in the men's kayak cross at the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>After progressing through the quarters and semis, he beat three other competitors in the "big final" of the men's event at the Vaires sur Marne Nautical Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand's women pole vaulters have all qualified for Thursday's final at the Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Eliza McCartney cleared 4.55m on her second attempt to go through.</p>
        
            <p>Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris missed that height, but go through to the final by virtue of clearing 4.40m on their first attempt.</p>
        
            <p>In the women's gymnastics, Italy's Alice D'amato was a surprise gold medallist in the beam.</p>
        
            <p>Simone Biles - chasing her eighth title - fell off during her difficult routine and was relegated to fifth.</p>
        
            <p>Biles later won silver in the women's floor event, missing out to eventual winner Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Connor Bell missed out on a place in the final by the narrowest of margins.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's Alex Rose grabs the last spot with the same distance as Bell - 62.88m - but he achieved that mark with his first attempt, while Bell did it with his second.</p>
