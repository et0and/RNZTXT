        <h2>Government to change free speech rules for universities</h2>
        <p>
The coalition's proposal will also prohibit unis from adopting positions on issues that don't relate to their "core functions".

            <p>The coalition is tweaking university regulations to curb what it says is an increasingly "risk-averse approach" to free speech.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed changes will set clear expectations on how universities should approach freedom of speech issues.</p>
        
            <p>Each university will then have to adopt a "freedom of speech statement" consistent with the central government's expectations.</p>
        
            <p>The changes will also prohibit tertiary institutions from adopting positions on issues that do not relate to their core functions.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour said fostering students' ability to debate ideas is an essential part of universities' educational mission.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite being required by the Education Act and the Bill of Rights Act to uphold academic freedom and freedom of expression, there is a growing trend of universities deplatforming speakers and cancelling events where they might be perceived as controversial or offensive.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why the National/ACT coalition agreement committed to introduce protections for academic freedom and freedom of speech to ensure universities perform their role as the critic and conscience of society."</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Tertiary Education and Skills Penny Simmonds said freedom of speech was fundamental to the concept of academic freedom.</p>
        
            <p>"Universities should promote diversity of opinion and encourage students to explore new ideas and perspectives. This includes enabling them to hear from invited speakers with a range of viewpoints."</p>
        
            <p>It is expected the changes will take effect by the end of next year, after which universities will have six months to develop a statement and get it approved.</p>
