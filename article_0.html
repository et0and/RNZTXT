            <p>High power prices are hurting not just manufacturers, but councils too.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa District Council said its energy costs had gone up 40 percent in the past three months.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Craig Little told RNZ the town relied on electrical pumps to get water to residents, and the price increases had been scary.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's hit everyone by surprise right across the country as with us. You try and predict it and you can't get that one right - we've got pumps with massive electrical motors and it's going to be huge for us," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers met with several manufacturing companies this week, after Winstone Pulp International proposed closing down because of the high wholesale energy prices.</p>
        
            <p>That closure would result in the loss of 230 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Little said the power increase could end up hitting residents in the pocket.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have to look at the rates people pay for water, but at the end of day it has to be paid and hopefully we can absorb it somehow."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor was also worried about big employers in the area, such as meat processor Affco.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses like Affco that buy the water off us, they're paying extra power as well.. it's pretty scary across the country what's happening out there at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really hard and we have to look at other alternatives for power."</p>
        
            <p>Little wanted to see the government develop strong incentives for solar power so that homes and businesses could afford to put panels on their roofs.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not telling the government what to do by any means, but look at Australia and what they did over there."</p>
