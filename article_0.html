            <p>A female police officer has died from her injuries after being hit by a car in Nelson in the early hours of this morning, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers and Minister Mark Mitchell have spoken to media after multiple people were injured at an event in Buxton Square early on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers confirmed this afternoon that Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming had died from her injuries, while Adam Ramsey is in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The two officers were on foot patrolling the square at the time of the incident about 2am, Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"A vehicle drove at them at speed and collided with them. The injuries that they sustained were critical. The vehicle then turned and drove at a police car, ramming it.</p>
        
            <p>"Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming is a daughter and a mother and a wife.</p>
        
            <p>"She has done 38 years of service to the communities. She was a beautiful soul and an outstanding police officer."</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon paid tribute to Fleming, saying he was devastated.</p>
        
            <p>"Police across New Zealand do an incredible job keeping us safe and it's heart-wrenching for an officer to lose her life carrying out that duty.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a devastating day for police and for New Zealand. Lyn will never be forgotten."</p>
        
            <p>I am devastated that Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming has died and another officer is critically injured after a violent incident in Nelson last night. Police across New Zealand do an incredible job keeping us safe and it’s heart-wrenching for an officer to lose her life carrying…</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was long involved in local sport and coached netball at Nelson College for Girls.</p>
        
            <p>The team paid tribute to "the bedrock of our netball programme for over a decade" on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"Words cannot describe her imapct on our athletes, coaches and staff at Nelson College for Girls. We love you."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack called the death "devastating news".</p>
        
            <p>"Our police work hard to keep people safe and they deserve to be safe at work. My thoughts and love are with Lyn's family, friends and colleagues as they mourn her loss.</p>
        
            <p>"Our community does not stand for this level of violence."</p>
        
            <p>Ramsey is undergoing surgery, but is expected to recover. A third police officer received a concussion in the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old suspect was tasered by other police staff and taken into custody at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Two other members of the public were injured. One woman received a broken arm and a male who came to assist police was injured in his shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point our priorities obviously are to provide support to Lyn's family, Adam's family and Adam.</p>
        
            <p>"The strength of the police family is something that we are all very proud of and it's times like these we all come together," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"A tragic day for New Zealand police, for New Zealand, where we have lost a police officer," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating any possible motive for the attacker.</p>
        
            <p>"This was an unprovoked and senseless act," Chambers said. "There was no indication that what was about to occur."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if police officers in New Zealand were safe, Chambers said he was proud of the work officers did and the challenges they faced.</p>
        
            <p>"We have lost staff over the years. We recover, but it hurts forever.</p>
        
            <p>"We must be reminded that behind the uniform is a human being."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said an investigation will look at if anything could have been done differently, but he said both officers were highly trained and capable.</p>
        
            <p>"They were faced with the senseless act of an individual who was determined to cause harm. I'm not sure if Lyn or Adam or anyone could have done anything differently."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the news was "gut-wrenching".</p>
        
            <p>"They are outstanding leaders, they are highly respected," he said of the victims.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been targeted in what I consider a very cowardly attack, and of course now we have lost Lyn, and that is going to cut very deep.</p>
        
            <p>"For a minister of police, any minister of police, it's your worst nightmare when you lose a front-line police officer."</p>

            <p>The attack highlights the risk that is posed to any front line police officer, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been updated throughout the day, he added.</p>
