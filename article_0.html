        <p>
The government has put forth new efforts to tackle youth crime and gang activity, as well as a dramatic increase in police for some cities.
</p>
        
            <p>The government is announcing a new declaration for youth offenders with harsher penalties.</p>
        
            <p>The new Young Serious Offender (YSO) declaration can be applied to teenagers between 14 and 17 who have committed two offences punishable by 10 years of imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>So-called YSOs may be sent to a military-style boot camp which is entering its pilot phase.</p>
        
            <p>The government says they aim to reduce youth reoffending by 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile an additional 21 police officers will be redeployed in Auckland City, bringing the total number of beat police in the central city to 51 by the end of July.</p>
        
            <p>It is the start of a staged two-year roll out, which will see 63 additional staff deployed in new Community Beat Teams across Auckland's three policing districts, with 17 in Wellington and 10 in Christchurch.</p>

            <p>The Prime Minister also said gang members should expect harsher penalties later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said gang membership will become an aggravating factor in sentencing and gang patches will be banned in public.</p>
        
            <p>He says the new rules will be passed in August and be in effect starting in November.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said three strikes legislation will be reinstated in November for serious crimes including sexual assault.</p>
