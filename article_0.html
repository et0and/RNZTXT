        <h2>Watch live: Child given meth 'lolly' found in donate food parcel, City Missioner says</h2>
        <p>
Up to 400 people who were given food parcels at the Auckland City Mission are being contacted after potentially lethal amounts of methamphetamine were found in a lolly.
</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Mission is urgently contacting people who may have been given food parcels with lollies containing potentially lethal amounts of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>The Rinda-brand pineapple lollies were unknowingly distributed in food parcels.</p>
        
            <p>Drug Foundation testing found a sample was 100 percent methamphetamine. Further testing was expected to happen on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Foundation was trying to figure out if there are more contaminated lollies out there. The lolly was one in a sealed bag of about 20.</p>
        
            <p>Missioner Helen Robinson and a representative from the NZ Drug Foundation will speak to media at 11am in Auckland.</p>
