            <p>Despite repeated calls for action, public health experts say New Zealand remains at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Health authorities and experts have been warning for months of the risks the country faces with falling immunisation rates and more people arriving from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Epidemiologist Michael Baker told Morning Report the measles vaccine was very effective but because the disease was so infectious population coverage levels of 95 percent were needed.</p>

            <p>Vaccination rates had been falling since 2017 and the decline had ramped up during the Covid pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Current coverage was 83 percent overall, and just 69 percent for MƒÅori, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we've got these big groups, or cohorts, of children who've missed out. And so we're really just very vulnerable now to a national epidemic."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said two things must be done immediately - a catch-up programme rolled out through early childhood centres and schools, and travellers should be told to check their immunity status.</p>
        
            <p>The Government was investing in improving the vaccine programme but that would take awhile, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said checking vaccine status could be a challenge for older people, but they should talk to their GP.</p>
        
            <p>He said during the 2019 outbreak a third of children who contracted the disease were hospitalised, and the spread to Samoa saw 83 children died there.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had vaccines since 1969 and so many people have never seen measles, they don't know how devastating this illness was and why it's so important to vaccinate against it."</p>
