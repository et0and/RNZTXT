            <p>It's the first day of summer and according to NIWA, the El Niño weather cycle looks set to bring warm weather and high winds for the rest of the season.</p>
        
            <p>Watch NIWA experts on what to expect from the season ahead:</p>
        
            <p>The planet switches between two weather cycles- El Niño and La Niña - every few years.</p>
        
            <p>During El Niño, New Zealand summers tend to have strong winds from the west, meaning eastern parts of the country dry out and western areas receive more rain.</p>
        
            <p>The NIWA forecast shows El Niño is almost certain to persist through summer, and has an 85 percent chance of continuing through autumn.</p>
        
            <p>The summer forecast is for more northwesterly winds than normal across the country, but rainfall is likely to be around average.</p>
        
            <p>Spells of hot, humid conditions looked likely during December, however areas of heavy rain were possible in the North Island over the next week.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA said an increased awareness around the risk for dry spells was recommended across several regions: Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa, Tasman, Nelson, Marlborough, Buller, Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>This might contribute to water restrictions, particularly in areas that had not had them in recent years.</p>
