            <p>A helicopter could be heard flying overhead in Avalon.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses near the cordon said police had not explained what was happening but officers were on the road holding guns.</p>
        
            <p>One shop worker said traffic was being turned around and rerouted to avoid the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the situation was currently controlled.</p>
        
            <p>Schools which earlier confirmed they were in lockdown were Avalon Intermediate School, Naenae College and Naenae Intermediate.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kura o Kimi Ora was also in lockdown and contacted parents to let them know not to collect their children.</p>
        
            <p>Lockdowns at all but one school have since been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>At about 11.40am, Avalon Intermediate School had a notice on its website saying that it was in lockdown.</p>
