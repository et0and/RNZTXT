            <p>Christchurch man David Benbow has been sentenced to life in jail with no parole for 17 years for the murder of a childhood friend.</p>
        
            <p>Michael McGrath, 49, was last seen at his Halswell home in May 2017, and he was due to visit Benbow the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Benbow claimed his friend never turned up, but in October he was found guilty of murdering McGrath with a firearm.</p>

            <p>Justice Jonathan Eaton described the murder as an execution style killing.</p>
        
            <p>He said the high level of planning, including the fact that Mr McGrath's body has never been found added to the length of the sentence.</p>
        
            <p>During the Christchurch High Court trial, the prosecution said that Benbow - a former prison guard - killed McGrath after learning that he was in a relationship with Benbow's ex-partner of 17-years.</p>
        
            <p>McGrath's mother, Adrienne McGrath, said she could not believe her son would never come home again.</p>
        
            <p>In her victim impact statement, she said still hoped her son would come knocking at her window.</p>

            <p>McGrath's brother Simon, speaking after the guilty verdict, said the family still wanted to know where his brother's body was.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Kylie Schaare said while the sentence did not alter the grief and loss the McGrath's family have endured, he hoped it allowed them to start to process and find a way forward.</p>
        
            <p>"They epitomise what it means to be heroes, they have shown immense courage dealing with a loss no family should have to endure."</p>
