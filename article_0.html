        <h2>At least nine homes yellow stickered by tornado</h2>
        <p>
The storm in Mangawhai was so powerful that power poles were snapped in half and roofs were ripped off, leaving the seaside community littered with debris. Audio

            <p>Residents in the Northland town of Mangawhai are reeling after the weekend's suspected-tornado that devastated homes and landed two people in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The storm was so powerful that power poles were snapped in half and roofs were ripped off, leaving the seaside community littered with debris.</p>
        
            <p>At least nine homes have been yellow stickered with Civil Defence expecting that number to rise, while over 140 homes were without electricity earlier on Monday as Northpower crews worked to restore the network.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower said it also has discovered more damage in the storm-stuck Mangawhai than they were initially aware of.</p>
        
            <p>The company was originally hoping to restore power to the remaining 146 homes by 5pm, however that will now be delayed.</p>
        
            <p>The company estimates that about 30 homes on Old Waipu Road will have power restored by midnight tonight, but another 30 on that road will spend another night without power.</p>
        
            <p>Eighty-one homes on Moir Street and Leslie Place can also expect to have their power back by 10.30pm, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower said they discovered more damage, including an additional broken transformer which needs to be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the community has banded together to help those worst affected.</p>
        
            <p>Debris lined Old Waipu Road in Mangawhai, one of the worst hit areas in town.</p>
        
            <p>It was here a woman, Tina Johnson, was seriously injured after the top floor of her home was destroyed.</p>

            <p>Just up the road, neighbour Jo described hearing the commotion.</p>
        
            <p>"My window a little bit open, I got up to shut it and it was forced, the force of the wind," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Next minute, there was a smash, smash, crash, and this very, very loud roaring sound, it was horrible, frightening."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident, Philip Lees, said the storm sounded like a train.</p>

            <p>"The whole house started shaking," said Lees.</p>
        
            <p>"The windows were vibrating, my girlfriend was screaming, and then it just went quiet."</p>
        
            <p>He too had a big cleanup on his hands, but he said it could have been worse.</p>
        
            <p>"Bit of damage, bit of iron flying through the air, smashed into our house, smashed off the gutters, but compared to the neighbours it's nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Sam Greenslade was checking in on his goddaughter's house, after her terrifying ordeal during the storm.</p>
        
            <p>"It happened in the middle of the night so she was was terrified," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"She went under her bed, and she could hear poor [Tina Johnson] screaming, I mean a lot of people could, but no one knew what was going on."</p>
        
            <p>"I've never seen this destruction in my life."</p>
        
            <p>He had spent the day giving out water and checking in on the community.</p>
        
            <p>"I've just been going house to house, no time for social media, no time for check-ups, and my day ends with a shower and a take home meal," said Greenslade.</p>
