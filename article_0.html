        <h2>Who was Pauline Hanna?</h2>
        <p>
To the outside world, Pauline Hanna had it all. Throughout the trial of her husband for her murder, the country heard a different story.

            <p>To the outside world, Pauline Hanna had it all: a high-ranking role in health, a wealthy husband and happy marriage, a multimillion-dollar Remuera home and a bach in the Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the trial of her husband, Philip Polkinghorne, for murder, the country has heard another story: one of mental ill-health, high-pressure and stressful work, and a marriage made fraught by infidelity and fights.</p>
        
            <p>The crown has alleged Polkinghorne strangled Hanna and then staged her body as a suicide. The defence maintained he came downstairs that morning to find her already dead.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland jury on Monday found Polkinghorne not guilty of murdering his wife.</p>
        
            <p>So who was Pauline Hanna?</p>
        
            <p>Hanna, 63, was an executive at Healthsource during the Covid-19 pandemic response, tasked with sourcing PPE (protective equipment).</p>
        
            <p>Her colleagues say she was dedicated to her work and seen as a reliable fix-it person, trusted to handle challenging assignments.</p>
        
            <p>Intelligent, bright, capable, determined, driven, glamorous, larger than life - just some of the words colleagues have used to describe her.</p>
        
            <p>She always dressed immaculately and professionally, with hair, nails and make-up done. She worked out multiple times a week, sharing a personal trainer with her husband but never training together.</p>
        
            <p>She lived in Polkinghorne's Remuera home, sleeping (at least on the night she died) in the guest bedroom, with a view overlooking the Ōrākei basin. They had been married for 20 years, and while they had no children, friends have said Pauline treated Polkinghorne's three sons, and grandchildren, as her own.</p>
        
            <p>She frequented Auckland's exclusive Northern Club, often meeting friends there for dinner.</p>
        
            <p>The day she died, she brought dinner - home-cooked lamb shanks - to a pair of close friends who were unwell.</p>
        
            <p>She had regular haircuts at a Remuera salon, often taking zoom meetings during appointments. After an appointment in February, she returned with a bunch of flowers for her hairdresser.</p>
        
            <p>On Easter weekend, she sent her friend a text - "Happy easter bunny" - described as being "Pauline to a T".</p>
        
            <p>Since 2001, she had been prescribed Prozac, an anti-depressant, and since 2004, had been taking Reductile, a weight loss medication.</p>
        
            <p>She drank - friends said she was always known to enjoy wine, and her GP said she drank as much as a bottle of wine a night. She was prescribed naltrexone to help reduce the alcohol intake.</p>
        
            <p>Her friends recalled her limiting what she ate, never having lunch, picking at food over dinners.</p>
        
            <p>In letters to herself, she seemed tired and despondent. In one, she lamented that she did not feel good enough or like she was adding value. She wanted to ask for help but did not know anyone who would listen.</p>
        
            <p>She spent long, late hours working. She was looking forward to the opening of a vaccine clinic.</p>
        
            <p>In the weeks before her death, she sent emails in the early morning hours, working from midnight to late the following evening with short and irregular breaks.</p>
        
            <p>She called her GP in 2019 with suicidal thoughts, saying her mother was in hospital and her husband had left her; in 1992, her sister overheard her saying she had attempted suicide in an argument.</p>
        
            <p>She and Polkinghorne sent letters to each other lamenting their relationship problems. Friends said he was abusive and controlling; some recalled her saying he was sexually demanding, pushing her into sex acts in which she otherwise would not take part.</p>
        
            <p>She knew he was having an affair with a woman in Sydney, but when she became suspicious he was having affairs in Auckland, she told friends she would leave him.</p>
        
            <p>Months before her death, she Google searched 'why do people trample over me?', looked up the Alcoholics Anonymous website, and saved documents about dealing with extra-marital affairs.</p>
        
            <p>She searched for apartments in Napier, where family had urged her to move; she searched about 'P' and 'P pipe', and took two photos on Christmas Day in 2020 of meth pipes.</p>
        
            <p>As the Crown and defence wrap up their cases, it is up to the jury to deliberate.</p>
        
            <p>But in the words of friend and colleague Clare Thompson, Pauline worked hard for those around her.</p>
        
            <p>"Pauline was a very high achiever, was immaculately dressed, presented professionally.</p>
        
            <p>"For Pauline, it was all about the community she served and she wanted to do the best job she could for the community."</p>
