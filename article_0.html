            <p>The British couple found dead in suspected murder-suicide at a property in the Wellington suburb of Roseneath on Monday night were Ben and Claire Anderson, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>A concerned family member asked officers to do a welfare check on the occupants of the Palliser Road property about 10.25pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police forced their way in and found two people dead.</p>
        
            <p>Post mortems were completed on Wednesday and the case will be referred to the coroner, as police are not searching for anyone else in relation to the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Ben and Claire Anderson had been living with their landlord at the property. Their neighbour Emma Prestidge described them as lovely people, and dream neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>Ben had been living and working in New Zealand, while Claire had been moving between New Zealand and the UK, before settling in Wellington in December, Prestidge said.</p>
        
            <p>He worked in science, she had been a teacher, and they had adult children in New Zealand. They has been considering moving to Otago to be closer to them, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Prestidge was unsure if Claire had found work in New Zealand yet.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Anderson's LinkedIn profile said he had been working at the Building Research Association (BRANZ) as a principal research scientist since January 2024. BRANZ told RNZ it was directing all enquiries to police.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to his time at BRANZ, Ben Anderson had been working at the University of Southampton, and the University of Otago which he left in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He was an EU-funded Marie Sklodowska-Curie Global Fellow, researching at Otago between 2017 and 2019, and then Southampton between 2019 and 2020, looking at local electricity demand profiles.</p>

            <p>Otago University declined to comment, and RNZ has contacted the University of Southampton.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington District Commander Corrie Parnell would not confirm the people who died were the Andersons.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not release their names until they had the authority of the coroner, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Parnell understood they were British, and had family in New Zealand, who police had been in touch with.</p>
