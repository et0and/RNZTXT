            <p>Day six of the Paris Olympics is off to a strong start, with single scullers Emma Twigg and Tom Mackintosh both storming through their semifinals.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg came first and Mackintosh came second to claim spots in the finals for the races and more chances at Olympic medals.</p>
        
            <p>There are four chances for rowing medals tonight, with the women's and men's double sculls and the women's and men's coxless fours all taking place between 9.20pm-10.10pm NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Later, sailors Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie, and Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, will contest medal races in the 49er FX skiff in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the time difference, day six begins on Thursday evening NZT and stretches into Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>So far, New Zealand has copped a gold medal in women's sevens rugby and a silver in the men's triathlon.</p>
