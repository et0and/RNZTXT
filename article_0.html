            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell disagrees with a characterisation of the police pay offer as "dismal".</p>
        
            <p>Police have described their new pay offer as "insulting", "disgusting" and "demoralising".</p>
        
            <p>After rejecting the government's offer initially in September 2023, police were presented with the same offer on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The government said it was negotiating in "tough economic times", while insisting it would not break its promise to recruit more police.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Police Association Te Aka Hāpai president Chris Cahill called it a "kick in the guts", and expected a spike in officers leaving the force as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media on Tuesday afternoon, Mitchell said the government would continue to engage in good faith.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to get into the detail of the offer. I've been in this position as police officer."</p>
        
            <p>When asked whether he would accept the offer, as a former police officer, he said "that was then, this is now".</p>
        
            <p>"We are in a tough economic situation and we are doing the best that we can. We want to start improving our own economic outlook as a country."</p>
        
            <p>He did not agree with the suggestion that he was not present, later saying: "I'm not sort of locked away in a sanitised bubble in Wellington."</p>
        
            <p>"It's no secret that I love our police service… I know that they have been under enormous pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"We are engaging in good faith with the police association."</p>
        
            <p>When asked what the government was doing now to stop violent crime, Mitchell pointed to the military academies. He said it was going to take some of the "worst violent offenders" off the streets.</p>
        
            <p>He was "empathetic" with the fact that shop owners are scared, and said further initiatives would be coming to target retail crime, but would not speculate on what they would be.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awful and like I said, there's a massive human cost to this. Most of my adult life, when you look at it, has been dedicated to public safety."</p>
        
            <p>He went to sleep thinking about retail crime, he said.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
