            <p>One of the organisers of a hīkoi held on Saturday to protest the closure of the obstetrics unit and "mismanagement" at Whakatāne hospital says they are "keen to unite" with other regions experiencing problems with health providers, after a "fantastic turnout".</p>
        
            <p>Those taking part in the hīkoi called for action to be taken, saying Whakatāne hospital was understaffed and badly managed.</p>
        
            <p>Hīkoi spokesperson and Whakatāne district councillor Nándor Tánczos said between 700 to 1000 people took part in the hīkoi "and that was just the tip of the iceberg as many others wanted to come".</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi represented the community, with families, kaumātua and kuia, medical staff and midwives, and iwi and hapū all taking part, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not the end, we are about keeping the momentum going. We are now thinking about next steps, and keen to unite with other regions who are affected by this issue," Tánczos said.</p>
        
            <p>The protest was "ignited" by the recent closure of obstetrics and gynaecology services, due to a lack of staff, which locals fear could lead to the deaths of pregnant women and babies.</p>
        
            <p>Tánczos said the area was "well served by a network of highly competent midwives" but people were understandably anxious, with the nearest hospital more than an hour away, in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi also encompassed wider concerns, "about chronic understaffing, poor management and dysfunctional systems caused by the centralisation of decision-making".</p>
        
            <p>"We asked people to wear orange if they or their whānau had been affected by [any of these factors]. There was a lot of orange in the crowd," Tánczos said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Tánczos told RNZ's Saturday Morning that while there was a global shortage of obstetricians, and "it could be hard to recruit to Whakatāne, even though we are an amazing place to live" - the recruitment process was "deeply dysfunctional".</p>
        
            <p>"When there are people to take up these roles, they're having to wait months to have their contract signed. By which time, some of them have given up and gone elsewhere," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The recent departure of several key national health figures was "deeply disruptive" and highlighted an ongoing process of change, he added.</p>

            <p>"There's just not enough time being given to the changes put in place by the previous government. The systems have not had enough time to roll out."</p>
        
            <p>"I think the resignations show there is something deeply dysfunctional going on within the health service, and it makes us really concerned about the changes that the current government is pushing through."</p>
        
            <p>Speakers at the rally included local National MP Dana Kirkpatrick, Green Party health spokesperson Hūhana Lyndon, Labour mental health spokesperson Ingrid Leary, Ngāti Awa Social and Health Services chief executive Enid Ratahi-Pryor and MERAS midwives union co-leader Caroline Conroy.</p>

            <p>Health NZ deputy chief executive for the Midland region Cath Cronin said today's hīkoi showed "how crucial the service is, and how strongly local people feel about it. We intend to do more in Whakatāne, not less".</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora was working on reinstating full maternity services, and practical supports had been set up while this happened, she said.</p>
        
            <p>They include making support and advice from a midwife available 24/7 on 0800 429 328, paying for transport, food and accommodation for those who need to go to Tauranga to give birth, and having a dedicated ambulance on standby 24/7 for emergency transfers when needed.</p>
        
            <p>"We're also working with the Independent Māori Partnership Board, community providers and iwi to create strong relationships and have local input. We're making real progress recruiting new senior doctors and have some international interest in the positions as well."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ will appoint a general manager of Whakatāne Hospital to provide local leadership and decision making, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also just appointed a taskforce director who will work with hospital and specialty services and community partners and oversee our progress in restoring sustainable secondary obstetric, gynaecology, and maternity services across the district.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to reassure the community that if people require hospital level care, they will continue to receive it."</p>
