        <p>
A law change means members of the public will be able to try to stop crimes at any time, and can defend property using "reasonable force".
</p>
        
            <p>The Justice Minister has unveiled new rules about how members of the public will be able to "arrest" people under a revamped law aimed to tackle retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said currently no one, including retailers and security guards, were protected from civil or criminal liability if they arrest and detain a person stealing goods valued at less than $1000 during the day.</p>

            <p>Sunny Kaushal is chair of the ministerial advisory group for victims of retail crime, which was given an operating budget of $1.8 million a year for at least two years and tasked with making recommendations for the government to consider as part of its law and order plan.</p>

            <p>Goldsmith said the group had come up with sensible reforms that would enable retail offenders to be more readily stopped.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith said the government would ensure that people working in the retail sector were being effectively protected and that offenders were caught and deterred from future offending.</p>
