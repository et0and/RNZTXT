            <p>The Finance Minister says Wellington's council is a "shambles" and the Local Government Minister says he is looking at options to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>The comments came after the the city council voted on Thursday to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The sale was part of the council's long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown told on Tuesday he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and the thresholds for action against the city council.</p>
        
            <p>He would not give any timeline for developments.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government has been keeping a close eye on Wellington City Council - and that Brown would have more to say soon.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis described the state of the council as a "shambles".</p>
        
            <p>Following the vote last week Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau told the councillors there would have to be cuts to the council's capital programme.</p>

            <p>However, she said she respected the vote that she did not back.</p>
        
            <p>"Democracy has spoken."</p>
        
            <p>In a response to RNZ on Tuesday, Whanau said she was now singularly focused on delivering a Long-term Plan that delivers for Wellingtonians that offers the certainty they deserve.</p>
        
            <p>"I am meeting with councillors this week to work out exactly how we get there, and how we work cohesively together to deliver a Long-term Plan that does not compromise on our must-haves, that being housing, water and climate resilience, whilst also creating financial prudence for ratepayers."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has requested for a more specific reponse to the ministers' comments.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau also declined multiple requests to speak to RNZ's Morning Report, Checkpoint or to speak to reporters for its news programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff had warned in documents prior to last week's vote that if the council stopped the sale it would have to consider two scenarios.</p>
        
            <p>One would be almost doubling their debt ceiling from $272 million to $500 million and cutting capital project spend by $400 million; the other would be tripling the council's debt ceiling to $750 million and slashing capital spend by $600 million.</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time the council's leadership had been called into question with councillor Diane Calvert calling last month for a crown observer to be installed on the council for the rest of its term which ends next year.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also faced its fair share of controversies in recent years such as its $32 million Reading Cinemas deal falling through and exhibitions at its $186 million Tākina convention centre failing to meet financial targets.</p>
