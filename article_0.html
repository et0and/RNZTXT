            <p>Police investigating the Ponsonby homicide case have named the man who they believe shot one person dead on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Hone Kay-Selwyn, 31, has been on the run since the fatal shooting two nights ago.</p>
        
            <p>Now police have a warrant for his arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry said police were keen for any information on Kay-Selwyn's whereabouts.</p>
        
            <p>"We are reiterating that Kay-Selwyn is considered dangerous and should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who sights him should contact police immediately on 111."</p>
        
            <p>He said the investigation had made progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that the community have several questions about what has occurred in Ponsonby on Sunday evening and we can reassure you police are working tirelessly to give the victim's family answers and to put this man before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone concealing his identity or whereabouts could find themselves facing prosecution for being an accessory after the fact, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Police "received a number of calls" to help identify the man.</p>
        
            <p>"We now need your help to locate him," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to ask anyone who has information or footage of the incident to get in touch with us."</p>
        
            <p>A dedicated police portal has been set up for this investigation called Operation Hurley.</p>
        
            <p>About 10.15pm on Sunday, police were called to Ponsonby Road after reports of a possible shooting.</p>
        
            <p>When officers arrived, a man was lying dead on the pavement, outside Glengarry Wines. Police immediately cordoned off the area and launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Barry said it was believed the alleged gunman had been denied access to a bar on the road as staff were preparing to close for the night.</p>
        
            <p>He lingered on the street.</p>

            <p>Barry said it was believed the man had a gun concealed in a bag he was carrying, and when a group of four men got out of a car nearby, he fired multiple shots at them, killing one.</p>
        
            <p>By the time police arrived, the shooter had left the scene.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage, Barry has said there was "no indication" the victim and the shooter were known to each other.</p>
        
            <p>The motive for the shooting was "unknown" and it was "difficult to say" whether it was gang-related, he said.</p>

            <p>On Monday, police released CCTV images of the man they believed was involved with the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, he was named as Hone Kay-Selwyn.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said police were appealing to the public to locate him.</p>
        
            <p>He said the man was considered "extremely dangerous" and the public should not approach him.</p>
        
            <p>A woman claiming to be Kay-Selwyn's partner said in a social media post she was sorry and was now thinking of their babies.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to express my sincerest condolences to the family and loved ones of the victim," she said in a post on social media.</p>
        
            <p>She asked for time and space to process the tragedy, "as our children are only babies and need the most support".</p>
        
            <p>The identity of the victim is yet to be released by police.</p>
        
            <p>Formal identification processes were underway, Barry said, and next of kin were being informed.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there had been good progress in the investigation as on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The search for Kay-Selwyn is continuing and police have said they will maintain a strong presence in the Ponsonby area in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>"We are deeply concerned that he does remain out in the community," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know, at this stage, who he is, and the best possible outcome is for us to detain him as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown has expressed his shock over the incident, saying his thoughts are with the victim's family.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council had been trying to take steps to address safety in the central city.</p>
