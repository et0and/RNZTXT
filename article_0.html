            <p>New Zealanders will today learn what the National, ACT and New Zealand First government will look like and which policies it will introduce.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition deal is expected to be released publicly before noon.</p>
        
            <p>Talks between the three parties finished on Thursday and their respective boards were due to give the proposed deal the final sign-off on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday morning the full details of the agreement will be released and the parties will sign it during a formal ceremony at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Incoming Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on Thursday said there was "massive alignment" from the three parties around their goals.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll be able to see exactly what we've delivered, and I think you'll see it's incredibly comprehensive, but importantly, also it gives us a really defined work programme for the next three years, so there's a lot of specificity there. That's very deliberate so that we all are aligned in what we're shooting for and what we're trying to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say over the process it's been a really good process, because inevitably you can talk transactionally about the tasks and the policies and the ideas but you actually get a sense of where each individual's coming from and what's motivating them and what's important to them.</p>
        
            <p>"We've actually got to know each other very well as the three leaders which I think is a very important part of the process."</p>
        
            <p>The three-way coalition was "historic", he said, and getting it right was the reason they had spent so much time on it.</p>
        
            <p>The full ministerial line-up will also be revealed later today, including who is the deputy prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>As of last night, ACT and New Zealand First were not yet fully aware of which ministerial portfolios the other party had secured.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the minor parties knew about each other's ministerial responsibilities "in the macro".</p>
        
            <p>"They have a sense of that."</p>
        
            <p>The three parties expect to move into the Beehive over the weekend, with a swearing-in on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon expected Parliament to resume on 5 December.</p>
