            <p>On the day public health officials announced a whooping cough epidemic, staff at the National Public Health Service were told their jobs were on the line.</p>
        
            <p>Management confirmed on Friday that the "reset" - to cut millions of dollars off its budget - would go ahead before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Three weeks of consultation would begin next week.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora national clinical director for protection Dr Susan Jack said the restructuring would not affect work to bring the pertussis epidemic under control.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an absolute priority for us, and we have set up national co-ordination so we can make sure we are doing everything.</p>
        
            <p>"Our regions are fantastic, they're managing cases and contacts.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got everything in hand to manage this."</p>
        
            <p>However, one staffer, that RNZ has agreed not to name, said the timing could not be worse.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very concerning on the same day it's announced [there's] a whooping cough epidemic, which we're told could last a year or more."</p>
        
            <p>In an all-staff email, management apologised for the delays in starting the process "especially with the year-end approaching so quickly".</p>
        
            <p>Kaimahi who were impacted or "significantly affected" could expect to be notified on Monday or Tuesday, with one-on-one meetings and team hui to follow.</p>
        
            <p>After a briefing to team leaders on Wednesday, the proposal would be presented to all staff and unions, they were told.</p>
        
            <p>"On Wednesday we expect that you may need to focus on your wellbeing, and we understand this may mean you need to postpone other commitments," the message said.</p>
        
            <p>The Association of Salaried Medical Specialists, which represents senior doctors, has been highly critical of the cuts to public health.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to Health New Zealand Commissioner Lester Levy and its chief executive Fepulea'i Margie Apa earlier this month, the union's executive director Sarah Dalton expressed her horror that $30 million had been slashed from the National Public Health Service budget, that nearly 300 unfilled jobs would disappear, and a further 56 roles may be cut.</p>
        
            <p>"I suggest we should meet so that we can understand what impact you predict these measures will have on our NPHS - and how you can justify these given the requirement that you deliver timely and adequate health services to the people of Aotearoa," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached Health New Zealand for comment.</p>
