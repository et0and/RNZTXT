            <p>A major provider of school lunches has gone into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>The Libelle Group was contracted to deliver about 125,000 lunches a day to the major contractor Compass.</p>
        
            <p>Libelle's shareholders appointed Deloitte as liquidators on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Liquidator David Webb said they were urgently talking to Compass to keep the service going, while they urgently review Libelle's position.</p>
        
            <p>The school lunch programme has been mired in controversy with complaints about inadequate and poorly prepared meals.</p>
        
            <p>The School Lunch Collective said it is a "difficult situation" for its team. However, its priority remains ensuring students continue to receive their school meals.</p>
        
            <p>"Deloitte, as liquidator, has asked Compass Group New Zealand to help manage the transition and ensure stability while exploring options for Libelle's future. To minimise disruption, Compass Group New Zealand has taken immediate steps to support Libelle, including ensuring staff wages are paid and keeping kitchen facilities running," the School Lunch Collective said.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise the vital role that Libelle's staff and partners play in delivering school lunches, and we are committed to ensuring the future of Libelle as part of the programme and supporting its people through this process."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
