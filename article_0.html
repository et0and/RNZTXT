            <p>The head of Helicopters Otago is dipping into his own pocket to provide a $10,000 reward to catch whoever stole critical medical supplies from a rescue helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenstown rescue helicopter was burgled at the Taieri Airfield over the weekend after taking a critically ill patient to Dunedin Hospital early on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The 48-hour reward is on offer from 8am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>It was bad weather that kept the rescue helicopter from returning to Queenstown, with the crew having to hunker down instead.</p>
        
            <p>A bag with the helicopter's medical supplies including drugs was checked before they went to bed.</p>
        
            <p>It was gone by the time they got up.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters Otago chief executive Graeme Gale is furious, going into his own pocket to pay for the reward to catch whoever was involved.</p>
        
            <p>"I want two things - I want my bag returned with the equipment in it and I also want the name of this clown that actually did it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now his mates will dob him in for $10,000, surely. It's an easy $10,000. It's more guaranteed than Lotto. All I want is the name and my bag back."</p>
        
            <p>Whoever did this broke at least two civil aviation rules by coming onto the airfield and entering the helicopter before taking the essential gear, he said.</p>
        
            <p>They were lucky to discover it was gone before they were called on a rescue mission, Gale said.</p>
        
            <p>"Potentially a patient would die, if it's that critical and we need some of the equipment that's in that bag. A builder can't build a house without his hammer and nails.</p>
        
            <p>"Our medics can not go to a job and attend to critically unwell patients without their equipment that they use on a daily basis.</p>
        
            <p>"This is, in my book, just an unforgivable act that this clown has done."</p>
        
            <p>Nothing in the bag has street value but it would be costly to replace if the bag was not returned, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Their medical equipment was funded by a local community trust.</p>
        
            <p>Gale did not believe the trust should have to fork out more money to cover costs, so he planned to replace it himself.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't go down to the shop down the road, I can't go to Kmart or Mitre 10 and replace that equipment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is specialised equipment that takes time to get and it is very important for us to get this back so we can go and do the job that we were put here to do and that is saving lives."</p>
        
            <p>Police said taking the medical supplies put patients' lives at risk, but could pose a lethal risk if someone decided to take the drugs recreationally.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation is underway and anyone with information should contact the police.</p>
