            <p>The Transport Agency says another 38 jobs could go, on top of the 145 it has already proposed as part of wider public sector cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>The agency is releasing job cut proposals in tranches - and on Tuesday, it announced a net reduction of 33 in its system leadership team, and five in its business support services team.</p>
        
            <p>That takes its total job losses to 183.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 are from programmes canned or scaled back by the new government, like Clean Car Discount, Climate Emergency Response Fund, and Let's Get Wellington Moving.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi's announcement also tips RNZ's calculation of total public sector job losses to more than 5000.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
