            <p>The national observance of Matariki is being held on Friday morning at Treble Cone skifield near Wānaka.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 people were gathering above the clouds, including Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other dignitaries.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said it was a great honour to attend the "wonderful" ceremony .</p>
        
            <p>"That was very, very special," he told RNZ's Matariki show.</p>
        
            <p>The holiday was an important chance to stop, and to reflect on the people lost over the year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A moment to take a beat to think about the year ahead."</p>
        
            <p>The theme for this year's celebrations was Matariki Heri Kai, the Feast of Matariki. It is a call for people to think not only about their kai, but the environment it came from.</p>
        
            <p>There are also other commemorations happening around Aotearoa.</p>
