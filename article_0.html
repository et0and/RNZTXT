        <h2>'Scary as hell' robot dogs with machine guns - how warfare changed in 2024</h2>
        <p>
Drones have been manufactured and launched in record numbers in conflict zones in Ukraine and the Middle East - and they're getting deadlier all the time.

            <p>With its distinctive, pulsating, motorbike-like sound, the V1 flying bomb - or "buzz bomb" - was one the most fear-inducing weapons of World War II.</p>
        
            <p>Launched by Nazi Germany to wreak havoc on England, Londoners were terrorised by the noise of the bomb approaching.</p>
        
            <p>Once the buzz stopped, people had about 12 seconds to take cover before the missile would plummet from the sky and explode.</p>
        
            <p>Today, that similar nightmare has been recreated with drones.</p>
        
            <p>The weaponry has evolved, but the ominous buzzing overhead remains.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout 2024, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East illustrated the growing impact of drones in modern warfare.</p>
        
            <p>They have been manufactured and launched in record numbers.</p>
        
            <p>New artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, jammer-evading fibre optics, and even dog drones entered the battlefield.</p>
        
            <p>Drones managed to bypass Israel's sophisticated Iron Dome air defence system.</p>
        
            <p>They were reportedly used to stalk and harass civilians in Ukraine, and hunt down militant leaders in Lebanon and Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Analysts say 2024 showed the threat of drones was not going away, and countries needed to take note.</p>
        
            <p>These are some of the developments that defined the year in drone warfare.</p>

            <p>Drone production was virtually non-existent in Ukraine before Russia's invasion in February 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the country is capable of ramping up production to 4 million annually, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>
        
            <p>In October, he announced Ukraine was set to produce 1.5 million drones by the end of the year.</p>
        
            <p>That was compared with about 300,000 in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Russia has also been boosting local manufacturing.</p>
        
            <p>The country had produced nearly 1.4 million drones throughout 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"This year, the production of drones is planned to increase significantly," Russian President Vladimir Putin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, to be more precise, almost 10 times."</p>
        
            <p>The increase in numbers led to Russia's drone strikes on Ukraine this year surging to record levels, primarily using Shahed-type kamikaze drones.</p>
        
            <p>The cheaply-produced attack drones were mostly imported, but Russia has tweaked the model and now mass produces them locally.</p>
        
            <p>According to figures from Ukraine's air force, Moscow deployed a total of 2576 drones during November.</p>
        
            <p>Some attacks were using about 200 drones at a time.</p>
        
            <p>Similar scenarios have been playing out in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Iran launched an attack on Israel using about 185 drones.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, analysts said it was one of the largest drone attacks in history.</p>
        
            <p>Israel said 99 percent of the weapons used were intercepted, including all the drones.</p>
        
            <p>However, some swarm drone strikes throughout 2024 from Hezbollah - the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon - managed to bypass Israel's air defences.</p>
        
            <p>Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, said we had witnessed how countries involved in drone development had "really progressed" this year.</p>
        
            <p>And more and more militaries around the world were adopting both tactical and mid-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).</p>
        
            <p>"For instance, in the civil wars in Sudan, Myanmar and Syria, and the war between Israel and Hezbollah," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"Clearly, unmanned systems of all kinds are having an impact."</p>

            <p>Drones serve a variety of purposes, including reconnaissance, collecting intelligence, terrorising troops, and direct attacks.</p>
        
            <p>FPV drones</p>
        
            <p>First-person view (FPV) have become especially destructive and prolific on the battlefield.</p>
        
            <p>After gaining prominence in 2023, the Ukrainian government set out to make a million FPV drones last year.</p>
        
            <p>FPV drones - originally designed for civilian racers - are operated using a remote controller and a headset providing a front-on-view camera feed.</p>
        
            <p>They carry an explosive warhead that can be dropped with more accuracy than most artillery because they are guided to their target.</p>
        
            <p>Depending on the drone's size and payload, the range can vary from 5 kilometres to more than 20km.</p>
        
            <p>Bendett said both Russia and Ukraine had scaled up development and production of FPVs over the year and were experimenting with new models.</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian military was increasingly using new fixed-wing FPV strike drones with a longer range.</p>
        
            <p>FPVs have been used to drop munitions down tank hatches, and chase down troops on the battlefield.</p>
        
            <p>The incidents are often caught on camera and posted to social media.</p>
        
            <p>Ukrainian soldiers have cited FPVs as their biggest threat, saying there are now so many in the air that it was difficult to move to and from trenches.</p>

            <p>Fibre optic drones</p>
        
            <p>Bendett said the new drone that shaped 2024 was the fibre optic UAV.</p>
        
            <p>They are a variation of the FPV drones, fitted with a fibre optic cable to transmit signals from the drone to the operator.</p>
        
            <p>Defence analyst Sam Cranny-Evans said the cable-connected design made the drone's signal "unjammable".</p>
        
            <p>"There is no way for an electronic warfare system to insert its own signals into the link between the FPV and its operator," he wrote in analysis for Calibre Defence.</p>
        
            <p>"These drones still use radio frequency signals to operate, but they aren't sent via fragile radio waves carried through the air, instead they travel over a fibre optic cable that is spooled underneath the drone."</p>
        
            <p>Electronic warfare (EW) systems have proved to be the most effective way of stopping drones.</p>
        
            <p>When a drone's signal is jammed, the pilot loses the ability to control it, or the operator can no longer see the video signal, depending on which frequency has been disrupted.</p>
        
            <p>The tethered FPV drones are generally equipped with a 20km cable, and can reportedly fly for 20 minutes at a speed of 60 kilometres per hour.</p>
        
            <p>They carry a payload of about 5.5 kilograms, but some of the weight is taken up by the fibre optic cable spool.</p>
        
            <p>Kamikaze boat drones</p>
        
            <p>Kamikaze drones continued to be a prominent fixture in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, none of the other drones have gone away," Bendett said.</p>
        
            <p>"Throughout it all, we have seen both sides (in Ukraine) use long-range, one-way kamikaze drones to strike each other's energy, military, and industrial infrastructure."</p>
        
            <p>The cheaply-produced "suicide" drones were also commonly used in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah was using the Iranian technology to challenge Israeli air defence systems.</p>
        
            <p>The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen started targeting US-owned and other merchant ships in the Red Sea with aerial kamikaze drones early in the year.</p>
        
            <p>They then switched to using new kamikaze drone boats in attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Dimitris Maniatis, CEO of maritime risk managers MARISKS, said the boat drones represented a sophisticated shift in tactics.</p>
        
            <p>These drones enabled the Houthis to strike with more precision and at a greater distance, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Robotic dogs and uncrewed vehicles</p>
        
            <p>There has been greater use of buggy-like uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) this year, Bendett said.</p>
        
            <p>They are used in kamikaze missions, and to shuttle ammunition and supplies to troops in the trenches and evacuate wounded soldiers.</p>
        
            <p>"We're witnessing a lot of those developments take shape in Ukraine … there are several hundred companies working on drone developments, including on unmanned ground vehicles," Bendett said.</p>

            <p>Robotic dogs, which have been described as "ground-based, stealthy drones" also made an appearance on the battlefield.</p>
        
            <p>The dogs were being used to conduct reconnaissance missions and deliver medicines to soldiers on the front line.</p>
        
            <p>However, the US and China revealed this year they were experimenting with robot dogs fitted with machine guns.</p>

            <p>AI drones</p>
        
            <p>In response to the increasing challenges posed by electronic warfare systems, both Ukraine and Russia were racing to develop drones guided by AI.</p>
        
            <p>AI drones have the potential to identify and lock onto their targets without the need for communication with their pilot, making them impervious to signal jamming.</p>
        
            <p>Developments in Ukraine had been broadly split between visual systems helping identify targets and fly drones into them, and terrain mapping for navigation.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Lushenko, director of special operations at the US Army War College, said the integration of AI could herald the fourth drone age.</p>
        
            <p>But he was hesitant to say the technologies would be game-changing.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really cautious when people start talking about the so-called Oppenheimer moment that hearkens back to the development of the nuclear bomb," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>He said AI would likely continue to play a predominantly supportive and informational role.</p>
        
            <p>And it was unlikely that swarms of AI killer robots would enter the battlefield anytime soon.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a tendency to dramatise the potential for drone swarms, and oversell how easy it is to incorporate AI into these capabilities. It's very, very challenging," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's different for robotic dogs fitted with machine guns, they are scary as hell."</p>
        
            <p>While drones were capable of shifting the offence-defence balance between countries at war, they were not creating huge battlefield "breakthroughs," Professor Lushenko said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that this year has been excellent to determine the merits and the limits of this emerging practice of drone warfare," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't really achieved strategic level effects … drones have been tactically effective."</p>
        
            <p>Bendett said several trends were tracked throughout the year, and militaries around the world would be taking note.</p>
        
            <p>"I think 2025 can also bring its own surprises," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It may be AI, it may be greater use of unmanned ground vehicles with UAVs … I guess we're going to stand by and see what happens."</p>
