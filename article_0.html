        <h2>Peters sacks Goff over Trump comments</h2>
        <p>
The foreign affairs minister says Phil Goff's position as UK High Commissioner is untenable after public comments about the US President, but Helen Clark has called it a 'very thin excuse'.

            <p>The foreign affairs minister says Phil Goff's position as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is "untenable," following public comments about US President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Video shows Goff speaking at a Chatham House event with Finland's foreign minister, and during a Q&A the two were discussing how Finland kept the peace in its border with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>"I was re-reading Churchill's speech to the House of Commons in 1938 after the Munich Agreement, and he turned to Chamberlain, he said, 'You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war'," Goff said.</p>

            <p>"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?"</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Winston Peters said Goff's comments were deeply disappointing, and did not represent the views of the New Zealand government. They said the comments had made his position untenable.</p>
        
            <p>"We have asked the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bede Corry, to now work through with Mr Goff the upcoming leadership transition at the New Zealand High Commission in London," the spokesperson said - effectively confirming Goff's sacking from the role.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, former prime minister and long-time Goff colleague Helen Clark described it as a "very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former Foreign Minster".</p>
        
            <p>"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 & US actions now," she said.</p>
        
            <p>This looks like a very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former #NZ Foreign Minister from his post as High Commissioner to the UK. I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 & US actions now: https://t.co/zvp4kC93Mc</p>
        
            <p>Goff, a former Leader of the Labour Party and former Mayor of Auckland, has been in the role since January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Goff offended the Māori King at an event for the New Zealand delegation in London.</p>
        
            <p>He forgot to perform a karakia to open the event at the High Commission, and then went on to say, in front of Kīngi Tuheitia, that no one in the room had experienced a coronation before.</p>
