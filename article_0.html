        <h2>Ashburton loses 'turtle town' title with speed changes</h2>
        <p>
The man who said Ashburton would be turtle town after school speed zones were introduced is happy to see them changing.
</p>
        
            <p>
Ashburton District Council will soon begin installing about 80 new signs, advising motorists that 30km/h speed limits outside schools will become variable speed limits only.

            <p>Ashburton is "turtle town" no more as the council ends permanent 30kph school speed zones.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers will only need to slow down near Ashburton schools for the hour around drop-off and pick-up times under the changes.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Grant McFaul said he was pleased the permanent lower speed limit around schools was ending, which followed a Government speed rule change last year.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, the Labour-Government aimed to improve road safety by lowering speed limits around schools.</p>
        
            <p>During the consultation at the time, McFaul described the permanent 30kph school zones as "preposterous" and pleaded with the Ashburton District Council not to "turn Ashburton into turtle town".</p>
        
            <p>McFaul also acknowledged the council was "hamstrung by dopey legislation" as he felt the councillors wanted to introduce variable speed zones but couldn't do so under the laws at the time.</p>
        
            <p>After a year and a half of living in "turtle town", McFaul said he was happy to "see common sense finally prevail".</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen many drivers taking notice of the 30kph outside of school times anyway," McFaul said.</p>
        
            <p>The 30kph school speed zones will change in time for the start of the school year.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA) has given the council sign-off to install new signs advising motorists that the 30kph school speed zones only apply at the beginning and end of the school day.</p>

            <p>Ashburton District Council had opted for permanent 30kph speed zones outside urban schools, rather than spending thousands on electronic variable signs as the static signs weren't an option.</p>
        
            <p>When the council introduced them in May 2023, the decision was met with frustration from the community who wanted the zones to be variable, and after a month Ashburton Mayor Neil Brown called for a review, claiming they were not working.</p>
        
            <p>Before that review occurred, the new Government signalled it would amend the speed limit rules which came in October last year.</p>
        
            <p>The council had hoped to have the changes in place before Christmas but the sign-off from NZTA only came this week.</p>
        
            <p>The 30kph limits will now apply from 8.30-9.30am and 2.30-3.30pm on school days.</p>
        
            <p>Council infrastructure and open spaces group manager Neil McCann said the lower limit around schools had plenty of support, but the main complaint was that the 30kph limit was permanently in place.</p>
        
            <p>"The change to a variable speed limit will mean outside of school days and the peak morning and afternoon periods, the speed limit will be the same as surrounding roads.</p>
        
            <p>"While the variable limits apply in the morning and afternoon on school days, motorists should always be cautious near schools," McCann said.</p>
        
            <p>The council's roading maintenance contractor HEB will install the signs before January 27.</p>
