            <p>Potentially damaging thunderstorms are moving towards parts of the upper North Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a severe thunderstorm warning, which will be in place until 1pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>It said the storms were in the east-southeast and will be near people in Kaipara, the Far North and WhangƒÅrei until about 10.30am.</p>
        
            <p>There were likely to be damaging winds and frequent lightning, which MetService said would be a danger to people and livestock.</p>
        
            <p>Very strong wind gusts could break branches from trees, damage roofing and make driving hazardous for high-sided vehicles or motorbikes, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The National Emergency Management Agency advised people to take shelter indoors, preferably away from windows, avoid sheltering under trees if outside and secure any loose objects around your property as storms approach.</p>
