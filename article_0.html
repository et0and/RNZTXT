            <p>A wild day of weather has led to flooding in Tararua District and road closures on the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Police are urging motorists to consider delaying unnecessary travel this afternoon, with conditions poor around the region.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 is closed from Springfield to Castle Hill, with numerous vehicles reported stuck at Castle Hill and the Lake Lyndon area, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The Tararua District town of Pahiatua has experienced flooding, with the mayor saying it cut off some houses and closed roads.</p>
        
            <p>Other alpine areas are also experiencing heavy snowfall.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere across the country there have been reports of surface flooding and snow.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers are urged to use NZTA's Journey Planner before hitting the road in some regions.</p>

            <p>Reduced speed limits are also in place on the Auckland Harbour Bridge because of strong gusts of wind.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency said vehicles travelling over the bridge need to take care, especially high-sided ones and motorbikes.</p>
        
            <p>It said there may also be lane reductions and motorists should consider using the Western Ring Road - Highways 16 and 18 - as an alternative route.</p>

            <p>Flooding and slips closed roads in and around the northern Wairarapa town of Pahiatua on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The town's stormwater system reached capacity about 5am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Tararua District Council said Huxley Street, Tiraumea Road and Halls Road were closed and people were being asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Pahiatua Track - the road linking the town west, to Palmerston North - had also been closed due to slips and fallen trees.</p>

            <p>Tararua mayor Tracey Collis asked people to avoid travel in or near Pahiatua.</p>
        
            <p>"The Pahiatua-Pongaroa Road [to the east] being closed off limits people getting to town from Pongaroa, from Makuri, where we understand Makuri's got a lot of water around it.</p>
        
            <p>"But the Pahiatua Track is also closed, so the only road available for use is the Saddle Road."</p>

            <p>One Pahiatua resident said he had not seen Mangatainoka River run this high in more than seven years living in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Sam Te Tau checked on the marae this morning and found parts of the town submerged.</p>
        
            <p>The town's ageing infrastructure would struggle to clear flood waters if heavy rain continued to fall, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our drainage systems here are quite old in the town, so they are often slow to clear the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Where the flood waters are quite high, I can't see them draining off quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"I think if we get a lot more water this morning, that could be problematic."</p>
        
            <p>The wharenui and whare kai of the Pahiatua Marae remained clear of the high waters at this stage, he said.</p>
