        <h2>Defence plane breakdown: 'Things were pretty grim yesterday afternoon'</h2>
        <p>
Air New Zealand's boss will be personally apologising to delayed passengers after the flight stopped at Brisbane to pick up a stranded trade delegation to Japan. Audio

            <p>The boss of Air New Zealand says he'll spend a flight to Japan personally apologising to passengers for the inconvenience of diverting to pick up a trade delegation stranded after the Prime Minister's plane broke down.</p>
        
            <p>Otherwise his seat is at the back of the plane - row 66 right next to the loo.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was forced to fly commercial to Japan after the Defence Force 757 clapped out in Papua New Guinea on Sunday after two fuses blew while refuelling.</p>
        
            <p>That meant leaving behind 52 people who were travelling with him.</p>
        
            <p>But as luck would have it Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran was one of them and he told Checkpoint they were able to thumb a ride for the group by diverting a flight to Japan through Brisbane.</p>
        
            <p>"Things were pretty grim yesterday afternoon, as you can imagine as things unfolded."</p>
        
            <p>But one of the options was to check on the availability of seats on an Air New Zealand flight to Narita.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the options that we looked at was to make a quick call back and say, well just how many seats do we have on this flight tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"With a bit of luck, it did actually work out just about perfectly. So we've got a very full plane now."</p>
        
            <p>Passengers already on the flight experienced about a two-hour delay due to the the Brisbane detour, said Foran.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm forever grateful, that hopefully they're going to be OK with that. I'll be on that plane in a few minutes and I'll make sure that I personally go around and thank them all and do my job on making sure that we look after them."</p>
        
            <p>He did not know how much all of this would cost, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day, we've actually been flat out ... just doing the logistics."</p>
        
            <p>Foran believed it was still worth going to Japan despite arriving nearly a day later than planned.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "really great tourist market" for Air New Zealand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of Kiwis heading out to Japan and we're putting on a bigger gauge flight, a 777 will start running on that particular route and that's got another 40 or 50 seats on it, so over the season that's another 30,000 seats.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're very keen to get out there and promote Japan as a tourist destination and interestingly, it's been a massive ... inbound market for us over the years."</p>
        
            <p>Foran said that had not rebounded after Covid so this was a chance to get more Japanese visitors to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>When asked whether Air New Zealand had the capacity for charter flights for Luxon due to Defence Force plane troubles, Foran's response was, "It depends".</p>
        
            <p>He said while this time they could accommodate everyone, it was also the slowest point of the season.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes it could be leasing a plane for a period and other times it could be just using a flight that's already going."</p>
