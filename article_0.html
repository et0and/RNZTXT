        <h2>Erebus disaster: Hunt for memorial site 'tricky and a bit heartbreaking'</h2>
        <p>
Almost 45 years since an Air NZ flight crashed into the side of Antarctica's Mount Erebus killing everyone onboard, there is still no memorial. Audio

            <p>Finding a site willing to host a memorial for the 257 victims of the Erebus plane crash has been "tricky" and "heartbreaking", the Ministry of Heritage and Culture's deputy secretary of Māori Crown Partnerships says.</p>
        
            <p>In just two days' time, it will be 45 years since the Air New Zealand scenic flight over Antarctica crashed into the side of Mount Erebus killing everyone onboard.</p>
        
            <p>Plans for a memorial in Auckland's Dove Meyer Robinson Park divided opinions with objectors claiming it would change the tone of the gardens.</p>
        
            <p>That proposal was eventually abandoned after cyclone damage and land instability meant it was no longer safe to build on the site.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, both Auckland's Cornwall and Monte Cecilia parks have declined to host a memorial.</p>
        
            <p>Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington has also been shortlisted as a suitable location but the RSA does not want it.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Heritage and Culture's Glenis Philip-Barbara told Checkpoint they were asking for a 100-year commitment - something many landowners were not willing to make.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been tricky, and a bit heartbreaking."</p>
        
            <p>The pushback impacted families, Philip-Barbara said, and they had promised not to establish a memorial in a place where it was not welcome.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, the ministry continued its hunt to find a suitable location.</p>
        
            <p>It was an "opportunity" to hold on to a precious piece of Aotearoa's history, she said.</p>

            <p>But families were ageing and the length of time it was taking to find a location was "always a worry for us".</p>
        
            <p>"What's critical for them is that the stories of the 257 and the learnings from the Erebus disaster are never lost to this country."</p>

            <p>David Allan, who lost his parents and sister in the disaster, told Checkpoint the likelihood of any memorial being a place for directly affected family members to go and pay their respects was becoming slimmer as time went on.</p>
        
            <p>He believed it may be better suited in Christchurch's International Antarctic Centre for educational purposes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's extremely frustrating that it takes this long," Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed if someone had suggested a memorial shortly after the crash, it would have gone up anywhere.</p>
        
            <p>But he now found it "really hard to understand" the rationale for locations not wanting it.</p>
        
            <p>Allan said he was an "optimist" but at 77, he had lost confidence that he would see a memorial in his lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>Philip-Barbara said the RSA had expressed the focus of Pukeahu National War Memorial Park was to be on war memorial.</p>
        
            <p>The RSA had looked at the kaupapa of an Erebus memorial "and they are not seeing alignment".</p>
        
            <p>"I wish I could give you a date to deliver by, I really can't do that until we pin down a site."</p>
