            <p>Kiwi cruiserweight David Nyika headlined a card stacked with homegrown talent at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Nyika met American Tommy Karpency for the first time as he continued his impressive run to a cruiserweight world title. He sent the American packing with a few well-placed shots.</p>
        
            <p>The American was a late-notice replacement after Nyika's original opponent, Blake Caparello, was forced to withdraw after failing a pre-fight drug test.</p>
        
            <p>The bout was Nyika's first time headlining a major boxing pay-per-view card - and the first of four annual headline fights for the Olympian and two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi star's homecoming party followed an impressive KO win over undefeated German, Michael Seitz, on the undercard of the massive Tyson Fury v Oleksander Usyk showdown in Saudi Arabia in May.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ sports reporter Jonty Dine is at the fight and brings you all the live action here: </p>
