            <p>Three people have now died in New Caledonia as the death toll rises amid escalating unrest.</p>
        
            <p>Charles Wea, a spokesperson for international relations in the president's office, confirmed the deaths to RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a drive by shooting by "French people" not Kanak melenesian people. Many more were injured and in hospital, he said, adding that the sitution was "very, very difficult".</p>
        
            <p>A number of shops have been burned. All schools, shops and government services had been closed in the capital, Noumea.</p>
        
            <p>It is the French territory's third day of violence.</p>

            <p>France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said hundreds of people had been injured in rioting, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>French High Commissioner Louis Le Franc said "I sense dark hours have arrived in New Caledonia".</p>
        
            <p>"So what we must remember from what I am going to tell you is a call for calm, stop, stop.</p>
        
            <p>"Stop what has been started."</p>
        
            <p>When asked whether a state of emergency has been declared, Le Franc did not answer the question directly. "What is important is to respect the curfew, it is not to go into armed confrontations, it is not to burn businesses, pharmacies, schools, dispensaries, medical centres.</p>
        
            <p>"There are armed groups on both sides who, if this call for calm is not heard, are going to kill people."</p>
        
            <p>It follows France sending in more than 600 reinforcements to back up local police, with 300-400 more arriving on Wednesday evening from France, Wea said.</p>

            <p>More than 130 people have been arrested and fears are turning to how these people will be detained, with the prison population already at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Local journalist Coralie Cochin told RNZ a curfew had been announced for Wednesday evening starting at 6pm local time.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealander holidaying in New Caledonia earlier told RNZ residents in the territory believed the situation could get worse.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Lightfoot and his family are stuck in New Caledonia until at least Friday after the government imposed curfews and a drinking ban to try to quell protests.</p>
        
            <p>The violence was provoked by a proposal by France which would allow French residents who've lived in New Caledonia for 10 years, to vote in provincial elections - a move local leaders fear will dilute the vote of the indigenous population.</p>
        
            <p>Lightfoot said the situation seemed peaceful as his family returned from a beach north of Noumea, but the number of protests escalated as they entered the capital. Intersections were blocked and some on fire. There were riot police throughout the city.</p>
        
            <p>He and his wife had to leave the hotel at night to find a doctor after she developed a chest infection.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a frightening experience. We could hear gunshots. We heard explosions."</p>
        
            <p>They had to drive through a roundabout on fire, blocked by 150 protesters.</p>
        
            <p>Lightfoot said locals and staff in the hotel had told them they believed protests could escalate with the presence of more riot police and latest moves from France.</p>
