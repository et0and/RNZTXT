            <p>Police in Auckland have spent over $3 million on a central station they moved out of five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Staff left the station on Vincent Street for their current base on College Hill in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The building was partially occupied before closing, though was now fully unoccupied, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, police still paid for essential services like rates, electricity and security at the site.</p>
        
            <p>From July 2019 to July 2024, police paid $3,346,080.07 on the building. More than $1,240,000 went towards rates, while $706,953 was spent on energy and nearly $470,000 on cleaning and rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>For the 2022/2023 financial year, police employed First Security guard services at the site, costing $164,573.</p>
        
            <p>Other costs included vehicle running expenses as well as repairs and maintenance, equipment purchases, property maintenance and consultancy.</p>
        
            <p>Police were in the process of relinquishing ownership of the land through Toit큰 Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand, the agency responsible for managing the disposal of Crown-owned land.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner of Crown Lands Craig Harris told RNZ the Vincent Street headquarters was in the Treaty settlement stage of the disposal process, the land being offered to M훮ori subject to a right of first refusal under the Ng훮 Mana Whenua o T훮maki Makaurau Collective Redress Act 2014.</p>
        
            <p>The next step would be to sell the land on the open market, and police said they were actively working with real estate agents but had no exact time frame.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown disposal process was expected to conclude in late 2024 or early 2025.</p>
