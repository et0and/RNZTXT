            <p>Resources Minister Shane Jones says accusations that he may be too close to industry executives are minor details and political games.</p>
        
            <p>Jones is one of three ministers granted decision-making powers in the Fast-Track Approvals Bill, which is currently before select committee.</p>
        
            <p>Newsroom last month revealed he had failed to disclose a dinner on the West Coast in February, at which he encouraged a mining company to write to National Party Minister Chris Bishop to seek inclusion in the fast-track regime.</p>
        
            <p>Jones subsequently said the omission was a "cock-up" rather than a conspiracy, and he would update his diary.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday he confirmed progress had been made.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh yes, work in progress," he said. "I explained at the time, it's a bit of a cock-up."</p>
        
            <p>He said some engagements did not need to be included, and it was "not necessarily" the case he was always a minister.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, it depends what pōtae I wear. A pōtae is a cap. Some caps are NZ First, some caps are ministerial.</p>
        
            <p>"Some matters are not declared ... in the diary because they represent the political connections between NZ First and the other governing parties.</p>
        
            <p>"I do think that meetings that take place are not always ministerial, and conflicts of interest are important - however it can be catastrophised as well."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if he was too cosy with mining executives, he said he thought he talked to "as many people as possible".</p>
        
            <p>"I would have thought I was more cosy with the fishing people ... I am a pro-industry champion. And I'm not too bothered by these political games of trivial pursuits, it's a relatively minor detail. No New Zealander should doubt that I am the megaphone of industry in this government.</p>
        
            <p>"I met with the leader of the mining industry this morning, and when I go to the rugby or go have a beer or go fishing I may bump into people who have a connection with mining. And that's not going to change."</p>
        
            <p>He said the comment about trivial pursuits was not about conflicts of interest, and when questioned on whether it could undermine trust in the the fast-track regime, said he was waiting for the select committee to report back before making comment.</p>
        
            <p>"That dinner, as I've talked about, it was less a conspiracy, just a cock-up, it's all been tidied up now."</p>
