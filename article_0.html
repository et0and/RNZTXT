            <p>World Rugby's rookie of the year Jorga Miller has set her sights on Olympic success alongside players she watched when she was at primary school.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old is the toast of Timaru - she is the current South Canterbury Sportsperson of the Year - and has the chance to seal the region's first ever gold medal.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns Sevens take on China overnight at 4am, then Canada at 7.30am.</p>
        
            <p>South Canterbury has enjoyed some Olympic success over the last 16 years - track cyclist Marc Ryan (2008, 2012), shot putter Tom Walsh (2016, 2020) and trap shooter Natalie Rooney in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>But it's been 88 years since it could claim a gold medallist - Jack Lovelock who went to Timaru Boys' High won the 1500m at the Berlin Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Miller recently signed a four-year contract with New Zealand Rugby which was "exciting and special", she says.</p>
        
            <p>It also confirmed her right to be playing alongside the likes of legends Sarah Hirini and Portia Woodman-Wickliffe.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember when I was at primary school I went down to Dunedin to see them and meet a few of them. That was really special and sparked a drive for me to play and be like them.</p>
        
            <p>"So now to play with them, I give them a bit of banter for being old and they give it to me back."</p>
        
            <p>However, she regards them as legends.</p>
        
            <p>Her goals include winning Olympic gold as well as more world series titles after being part of the squad that won the 2023/2024 world series.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I've got a lot more to give to this team so I'm excited to keep on going both on and off the field and see where that gets me."</p>

            <p>Born: in Timaru on 8 February 2004</p>
        
            <p>Growing up: Took up rugby early, playing with and against boys</p>
        
            <p>Educated: Timaru Girls' High, Christchurch Girls' High</p>
        
            <p>Influences: Dad Craig a club rugby stalwart, mum Tracey a South Canterbury rep</p>
        
            <p>Interests: Highland dancing, basketball</p>
        
            <p>Olympic event: Women's sevens</p>
        
            <p>Miller is a talented highland dancer and hasn't given up hope of picking it up again after the Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>However, she had high hopes to make her mark in rugby - so much so she left her home town to board in Christchurch in the hope of playing against stronger opposition.</p>

            <p>She credits playing with and against boys up until her teens as being a major reason she doesn't mind the physicality of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>Playing with boys "probably shaped me into the player I am .. my robustness, I guess,'' she told Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"I loved playing with the boys. When I moved to high school and had to play girls' rugby I was almost a bit bummed out."</p>
        
            <p>As for the dancing, it "has added a lot to my game, especially with the stepping and agility", she says.</p>
        
            <p>"Dancing is an individual sport and so you have to be determined and self motivated to train by yourself and do heaps of self-directed training which I think has certainly helped with my rugby."</p>
