        <h2>Sir Sam Neill: 'I don't need to bleed all day so I just avoid the news'</h2>
        <p>
International news is so "uniformly bleak" that Sir Sam Neill feels better for not following it too closely these days. After filming two TV shows last year, the 77-year-old is enjoying a low-key summer on his farm. Video, Audio

            <p>A cup of Irish breakfast tea is the first thing Sir Sam Neill reaches for in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>A little while later it's time for the 77-year-old actor and winemaker to make a coffee run in his old car before getting into the garden.</p>
        
            <p>At home on his Central Otago farm this summer, Sir Sam tells Summer Times he is feeling healthy after enduring what he calls some "cancer stuff" in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm doing my exercises - well, not as many as I probably should be. I'm a little bit lazy in that regard. But now I feel good and optimistic and and looking forward to a long future.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things that these issues teach you is life is short so make the most of it and that's what I'm doing."</p>
        
            <p>By world standards, Aotearoa seems like "an oasis of calm and reason", Neill says, although our country is of course far from perfect.</p>
        
            <p>"We have problems which we need to address. I'm concerned with some of the directions the country is going in but in the meantime, I'll go out and have a word to Helena Bonham Carter, who's my favourite cow, and talk things over with her."</p>

            <p>In recent years, Neill has stopped following the international news cycle and says he feels better for making that choice.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't just bad. It was bad for me. The news from the Middle East and from Ukraine and from the US is so uniformly bleak. I don't need to bleed all day so I just avoid it, you know, because what can I do about it? There's nothing I can do.</p>
        
            <p>"So instead I go for a walk. I've got a lovely pig up just in the paddock across from me called Bryan and she goes for walks with me and we're perfectly content.</p>
        
            <p>"I keep myself informed but what you pretty much see before you is a man with his head firmly in the sand."</p>
        
            <p>We all have to work on our own sense of wellbeing, Neill says.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't just sort of sit around going 'I'm not happy'. You've got to do something about it, you know."</p>

            <p>Neill spent eight months working as an actor in 2024 on Eric Bana's upcoming Netflix series Untamed and Season 3 of the Australian courtroom drama The Twelve.</p>
        
            <p>Brett Colby QC - Neill's character in The Twelve - is a "big windbag lawyer" based on a couple of his Christchurch barrister friends.</p>
        
            <p>In the third series, he's joined by fellow Kiwis - Danielle Cormack as his opposing counsel and singer Marlon Williams as his son.</p>
        
            <p>The Twelve also reunited Neill with his old friend Sir Ian Mune appears as a tough retired cop.</p>
        
            <p>Mune, 84, who Neill first acted with in the 1977 film Sleeping Dogs, is doing the best acting of his life, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"He was fantastic and it was so, so good to be in his company."</p>

            <p>Neill recently broke up his summer on the farm with an eight-day cruise around New Zealand's subantarctic islands, south of Rakiura.</p>
        
            <p>For him, the highlight of an all-round fantastic adventure was seeing the unique cliff-climbing Snares penguins.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't have any ropes or crampons or anything. They just have two little claws and a beak and they climb these cliffs up to the top - they're the only penguins in the world that do this.</p>
        
            <p>"They live in a forest - that's where they raise their young and that's where their social lives are. They have sort of streets and there's a plaza in the middle where they all meet and socialise. They're highly organised and they raise their fluffy chicks up there."</p>
        
            <p>Written by Don McGlashan and performed by the Mount Raskil Preservation Society and Hollie Smith, this "quintessentially New Zealand" song featured in Neill's friend Toa Fraser's film No 2.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of the great New Zealand tracks, I think."</p>
