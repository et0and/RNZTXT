        <p>
She believed she was going to get a hysterectomy. But the plan was changed when she was already medicated.

            <p>A woman who believed she was getting a hysterectomy got an entirely different surgery - without her consent, the health watchdog says.</p>
        
            <p>The Health and Disability Commissioner said the woman had agreed to a hysterectomy due to pelvic organ prolapse six months prior.</p>
        
            <p>But the surgery - done in 2014 at a public hospital which the report did not name - was changed just prior to the woman entering the operating theatre.</p>
        
            <p>She had already been premedicated when she signed a consent form agreeing to get an implant made of surgical mesh instead.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Rose Wall said the woman had no understanding of the procedure that was done.</p>
        
            <p>"The standard of care was not met for the patient - as she clearly wanted and expected a hysterectomy at the time," Wall said.</p>
        
            <p>"She did not get a hysterectomy but instead underwent a procedure involving surgical mesh."</p>
        
            <p>Wall said the timing of the change is surgical plan was "entirely inappropriate".</p>
        
            <p>The woman was alone, prepped in her surgical gown and just outside the theatre room.</p>
        
            <p>She was "pressured and nervous".</p>
        
            <p>"In my view, anticipating that a consumer is in a position to make an informed choice and give informed consent in such a circumstance is a fundamental failing, and should not have occurred in any circumstance."</p>
        
            <p>The consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist said they believed the woman was aware that she would not be having a hysterectomy.</p>
        
            <p>They said that the surgery involved surgical mesh, and that there was a discussion with the woman prior to the surgery to repeat the consent and the specific risks of pelvic organ prolapse surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The doctor who did the work is no longer practising in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Wall recommended if the doctor was to practice in New Zealand again, they should implement a system to ensure all treatment options and their associated risks were discussed clearly with patients and documented.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommended the doctor consider how they can improve the informed consent process to ensure patients are provided with sufficient time to fully consider the information they are entitled to, before seeking their consent.</p>
