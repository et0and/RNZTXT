            <p>Transpower is disconnecting some North Island power assets in response to an extreme solar storm.</p>
        
            <p>The grid emergency now affects transmission throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>An "extreme" geomagnetic storm is affecting Earth at present.</p>
        
            <p>The storm has the potential to disrupt power and satellites.</p>
        
            <p>It is the result of a large coronal mass ejection flinging electro-magnetically charged plasma from the Sun across the solar system.</p>
        
            <p>The US Space Weather Prediction Centre says G5 (extreme) geomagnetic storms can impact power grids, satellites, and radio communications.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Saturday, Transpower said it was taking action to prevent power cuts as the strong solar storm affected the planet.</p>
        
            <p>It said it did not expect power supplies to be affected.</p>
        
            <p>It's the first time in 19 years that the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a severe solar storm warning.</p>
        
            <p>This solar storm is one of the strongest events in a long time (since 2005).It has the potential to affect communications, GPS, satellite navigation & power grids.Transpower has issued a Grid Emergency Notice due to its severity.https://t.co/JCAqOuXBi8</p>
