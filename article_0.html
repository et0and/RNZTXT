            <p>Departing all Blacks halfback TJ Perenara has slipped a message of support for protests surrounding the Treaty of Waitangi hīkoi into the haka performed before New Zealand's game against Italy this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Toitū te mana o te whenua, toitū te mana motuhake, toitū te tiriti o Waitangi" translates as "the sovereignty of the land remains, the sovereignty of the people remains, the Treaty of Waitangi remains".</p>
        
            <p>The haka came after 40,000 people marched on Parliament on Tuesday, to oppose the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the year Perenara expressed support for the Hurricanes Poua, when they used their haka to criticise the government.</p>
        
            <p>"We use haka to express ourselves for whatever emotion we are feeling," he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Perenara said the hīkoi showed the unity of Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"For us to be able to acknowledge that unification of our people, all of our people, not just tangata whenua, but tangata katoa (everybody) of Aotearoa, it's something that was important for us, and important for me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson said Perenara had discussed with him before the match the concept of his haka remarks.</p>
        
            <p>"TJ when he got the right to call (the haka), there's a part of it at the start he gets in his own words to call it," Robertson told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"And he's decided to say that and he has done it with the aspect of unity.</p>
        
            <p>"It's his right to say that."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said Perenara had discussed with management the concept of what he was going to say.</p>
        
            <p>"He said it's sign of unity.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is across it. He gets his chance to call that and the rest of the team gets to do the haka."</p>

            <p>Te Pāti Māori said it was great to see Te Tiriti o Waitangi ambassadors in the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>Halfback TJ Perenara used his haka before New Zealand's game against Italy to voice his support for last week's hīkoi to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said it was a really important message for New Zealand at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>She said protecting Te Tiriti is about protecting all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks won the game that followed the haka 29-11, but in unconvincing fashion.</p>
        
            <p>It was Italy who looked the better side at the start, taking an early 6-3 lead, before New Zealand finally scored two tries through Cam Roigard and Will Jordan, both converted by Beauden Barrett, to go in 17-6 up at the break.</p>
        
            <p>Italy came out stronger in the second half before a Mark Tele'a try increased the visitors' lead, with Tommaso Menoncello then going over for Italy before a late Barrett try.</p>
        
            <p>Perenara's 89th cap will be his last, as eligibility rules dictated that players must play their rugby domestically to be able to suit up for the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>The halfback was heading to Japan to play for the Black Rams Tokyo, which would end his 10-year career with the All Blacks.</p>
