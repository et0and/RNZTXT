            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has said he would work with both Winston Peters and David Seymour again, as he likes working with them.</p>
        
            <p>When pressed on whether he might change his mind, however, he was not definitive.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, I've enjoyed working with him ... we've got a really constructive relationship," Luxon told reporters when asked if he would work with Peters in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>And of Seymour: "same thing, different players, different personalities, but we're working very well and I think New Zealanders recognise we have a coalition government that's very united on the things that matter most to New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a "long long way away from an election", however.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister had been speaking after visiting Massey High School in Auckland - which includes hospitality, automotive and building academies.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Luxon drew the ire of local council leaders after his address at the Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) conference on Wednesday</p>
        
            <p>In his speech, the prime minister called for councils to rein in spending and focus on basics.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also faced a challenge at the annual Koroneihana celebrations for M훮ori King T큰heitia, held at T큰rangawaewae Marae, this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We've watched your government dismantle everything that is meaningful to M훮ori in this country," Tukoroirangi Morgan told Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Next week, Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters will travel to Tonga for the 53rd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' week.</p>
