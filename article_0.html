        <h2>Independent panel to review 2050 methane target, government announces</h2>
        <p>
Ministers say agriculture's contribution to climate change targets need to be "fair and appropriate" compared to other sectors.

            <p>An independent panel is to review the country's methane target, the government has announced.</p>
        
            <p>Climate change minister Simon Watts and agriculture minister Todd McClay announced the review on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>They said a panel of experts would review the available agricultural biogenic methane science before reporting back to the government by the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>They would "provide evidence-based advice on what our domestic 2050 methane target should be, consistent with the principle of no additional warming", McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, farm animals, including cattle and sheep, are the source of most biogenic methane emissions - those brought about by living organisms.</p>
        
            <p>Food scraps in landfills are also a source of methane.</p>
        
            <p>Watts said the review would complement a review by the Climate Change Commission of the 2050 targets, also due this year.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] will provide an input into the government's response to the commission's advice in 2025."</p>
        
            <p>The Climate Change Response Act sets out New Zealand's existing domestic biogenic methane emissions reductions targets.</p>
        
            <p>The country has pledged to lower biogenic methane emissions from 2017 levels by 10 percent by 2030 and by 24 to 47 percent by 2050.</p>
        
            <p>Associate agriculture minister Andrew Hoggard said agriculture was the backbone of New Zealand's economy and contributed over 80 percent of our goods exports.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to ensure its contribution to the 2050 Climate Change targets are fair and appropriate compared to other parts of the economy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important that domestic efforts to cut emissions do not drive a drop in our agricultural production. New Zealand farmers are the world's most carbon-efficient producers of high-quality food and fibre, and it is in no one's interest to see this production filled by other countries with higher emissions profiles."</p>
        
            <p>Associate agriculture minister Mark Patterson said the government was investing in research and development to give farmers practical tools and solutions to reduce methane.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to ensure that our farmers remain the best in the world and at the forefront of global methane mitigation efforts."</p>
        
            <p>McClay said the government remained "steadfast in our commitment to meet our international climate change obligations".</p>
