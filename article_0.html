        <h2>Police hold grave fears for missing wife of man killed at Ellerslie home</h2>

            <p>Watch - Police believe the missing wife of a man found dead in his Ellerslie home may also be the victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty-six-year-old Fuk-Fu Joseph Kwok, was named today.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to his house at Celtic Crescent on Monday evening after his body was found by a relative.</p>
        
            <p>They have been seeking his 67-year-old wife Mei Han Chong.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Beard, from Auckland City CIB, said inquiries to date also suggest that the wife may also be the victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>They have grave concerns for her safety and welfare. Their son says it's totally out of character for her not to contact them, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We still need the public assistance in trying to locate where Mei is and where that blue Kia motor vehicle is."</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle's registration number is NJN927, although the plates may have been changed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's son is grieving and struggling with the fact his father has been killed and that his mother cannot be found, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mei Han Chong was last seen at home on the weekend. She is of Asian descent, 5 foot tall (1.5 metres) and 48kg, and has grey hair and wears glasses.</p>
        
            <p>Beard said information from the public is vital to making progress in the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone out there must know something or have seen something and it may seem trivial to them but it could very well be important to the police investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Kwok was killed in a violent manner and some of his injuries would suggest more than one person was involved.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know the motive and that's one of the aspects of the investigation we're looking at, but as I say someone out there may be able to help us and that's what we need."</p>
        
            <p>He added: "We know that Mr Kwok left work at 11pm on Saturday night and drove home, it takes about half an hour and from there the vehicle is missing."</p>
        
            <p>Answering journalists' questions, Beard said the circumstances and some of the property found in the house would suggest Chong did not leave of her own accord.</p>
        
            <p>The indication was that she did not drive, so that would suggest someone has taken that car.</p>
        
            <p>"We're piecing things together, we're dealing with the family and they've got support."</p>
        
            <p>It was very early in the inquiry, with the scene investigation not yet completed and the post mortem only completed on Wednesday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a jigsaw puzzle and there's a lot of pieces here and just trying to find the pieces to put in so we can see the picture."</p>
        
            <p>Police have not found a murder weapon, he said, and don't yet know if it was a targeted attack.</p>
        
            <p>There were no other properties of interest at this time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>They are assessing information from the neighbours, but there is nothing that has been particularly helpful at this stage, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The family had lived in the property for up to 12 years.</p>
