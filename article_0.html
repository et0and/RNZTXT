        <h2>Penk explains why he wants to roll back insulation standards</h2>
        <p>
Reducing insulation standards could lead to more - and more affordable - houses being built, he says. Most experts advise against it. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Plans to reduce insulation standards for new buildings could make new houses more affordable and mean more houses are built, the building minister says.</p>
        
            <p>But the Green Building Council said the move would take New Zealand back to standards that were decades out of date compared with most of the OECD. And in consultation with experts, 90 percent of those who responded wanted to keep the existing standards.</p>
        
            <p>A new standard to keep homes warm and dry was introduced just last year, but Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk has confirmed he is looking at rolling it back as part of changes he is considering.</p>
        
            <p>Penk told Checkpoint new houses could include costs of $40,000 to $50,000 extra depending on the insulation standard they were held to.</p>
        
            <p>After listening to what people wanted, he believed there should be more choice because of the need for affordable houses.</p>
        
            <p>He confirmed he would recommend changes and he said he had not decided what, but confirmed he was considering the standards being set back to 2022 levels - "not the distant past".</p>
        
            <p>On the streets of Waikato on Wednesday, people RNZ spoke to were overwhelmingly against reducing the standards, with several people describing the idea as "silly" or "stupid".</p>
        
            <p>In May, a building industry housing symposium was told that even the even with last year's upgrades, New Zealand's existing building code was already being left behind when compared to other Western countries.</p>
        
            <p>The effectiveness of insulation - and the standards - are measured with R-values, representing how easily heat can be lost through a material, or how energy efficient it is.</p>
        
            <p>The higher the R-value, the less heat is lost, and the more insulated the building or material is. They typically fall between 0 and 7.</p>
        
            <p>New houses are checked to see they meet the insulation standards when they are assessed for the building consent, and their R-value should be noted on the plans. Different R-values are required for different climate zones of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Building Code is set out in the Building Regulations 1992, and the codes for insulation are called the H1 Energy efficiency provisions.</p>
        
            <p>As well as heat loss, New Zealand's standards for insulation also measure the durability of the material, how much protection from fire it offers, moisture transfer and accumulation, and its electrical safety.</p>
        
            <p>Government agency Building Performance New Zealand said on its website that when it comes to insulation it was a case of "the more the better," and they recommend: "It's well worth spending a little extra and exceeding the minimum Building Code requirements".</p>
        
            <p>New houses may need very little heating or cooling if they are designed, insulated and ventilated well, they said.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand also has separate insulation standards for rental houses.</p>
