            <p>In a statement, Nicola Willis said Deputy Governor Christian Hawkesby would be Acting Governor until 31 March.</p>

            <p>"I wish him well for the future," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, Willis - taking advice from the RBNZ Board, will appoint a temporary Governor for up to six months.</p>
