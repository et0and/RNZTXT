            <p>Four people have been confirmed dead and there is widespread devastation from the storm. The full extent of the damage is not yet clear as some areas are not yet accessible due to weather conditions, flooding and debris.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another storm in the Atlantic, Leslie, has strengthened into a category 2 hurricane. However, it has "likely peaked in strength", the US National Hurricane Centre says.</p>
