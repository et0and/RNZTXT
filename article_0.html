            <p>A precautionary notice is being placed on a small free-range poultry farm after a number of chickens died, MPI says.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the culling of 80,000 birds at the centre of the bird flu outbreak has started at Mainland Poultry, a commercial egg farm in rural Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Movement of material on and off the second farm which is near Dunedin has been halted from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"As is normal in biosecurity responses we always investigate where illness is identified," Biosecurity New Zealand deputy director-general Stuart Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The property has around 6000 birds, with a number of deaths, and testing is under way."</p>
        
            <p>The property was not owned by Mainland Poultry, and MPI was trying to establish if there were any links between the two.</p>
        
            <p>In a bid to stamp out the high pathogenic strain of avian influenza, H7N6, Biosecurity New Zealand has begun the culling of birds at the first farm.</p>
        
            <p>"Work started this morning to humanely cull chickens in two sheds on a farm managed by Mainland Poultry where testing confirmed cases of an H7N6 subtype of avian influenza in birds," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>The cull was expected to take two to three days, using the industry standard practice of CO2 containerised gas, which farms regularly use to euthanise chickens.</p>
        
            <p>The carcasses would be transported to a secure landfill in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to point out the landfill has specific features to prevent the leaching of materials into the environment, including impermeable layers, and a process of routine monitoring," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The disposal will be in a deep pit and in an area well away from any public access, and the landfill will be closed during this process."</p>
        
            <p>He said testing was continuing at Mainland Poultry and other poultry farms in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"There had been no reports of concern about other ill or dead birds on other poultry farms.</p>
        
            <p>"Contract tracing has revealed limited movements between Mainland Poultry's affected farm and some of the other poultry farms in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand will be increasing its presence on the ground in Otago and has set up a regional control centre today to manage the situation.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 MPI staff, including frontline biosecurity staff, veterinarians and food safety staff were contributing to the response.</p>
