The Biosecurity Minister has also confirmed the farm at the centre of the outbreak had an outbreak of another virus in 2019.

            <p>All poultry exports are on hold until New Zealand is free of the highly pathogenic bird flu detected at a Moeraki egg farm, Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries earlier said laying hens foraging outside were thought to have been infected with the H7N6 strain through a low pathogenic virus from wild waterfowl.</p>
        
            <p>There are 40,000 chickens in the shed where the virus was identified, and teams will begin eradicating birds on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand deputy director-general Stuart Anderson said there had been no signs of further infection so far.</p>
        
            <p>"While it is not the H5N1 type circulating among wildlife around the world that has caused concern we are taking the find seriously," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Low pathogenic viruses are present in wild birds here, especially waterfowl like ducks, geese, and swans and the virus can mutate on interaction with chickens.</p>
        
            <p>Chickens in other sheds at the infected farm were not showing any signs of influenza.</p>
        
            <p>A 10km buffer zone had been placed around the farm, along with restrictions to prevent the movement of animals, equipment, and feed.</p>
        
            <p>Hoggard has confirmed the farm at the centre of the highly pathogenic bird flu outbreak also had an outbreak of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Type 1 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The virus was discovered in layer hens at the egg farm.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was informed on Sunday about the case. The farmer understood the risk and had worked closely with MPI to control its spread.</p>
        
            <p>There was no further risk and no safety concerns, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>The government was concerned about the arrival of H1N1 - likely to be via wild birds from Antarctica - and MPI had been undertaking long-term planning around the issue.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
