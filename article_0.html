            <p>The owners of toy company Zuru have been named the country's wealthiest people - knocking packaging, property and investment magnate Graeme Hart off the spot he has held for more than 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Mowbray family, who started the company in their Cambridge garage, top NBR's 2024 Rich List, released on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Zuru is wholly owned by brothers Mat and Nick Mowbray, who the NBR has estimated are worth $20 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Hart is valued at an estimated $12.1b.</p>
        
            <p>Zuru Group was started more than 20 years ago and now spans three divisions - toys, consumer goods and construction - with more than 5000 staff across more than 30 locations worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with the NBR, published last week, 39-year-old Nick Mowbray said Zuru was on track to hit $3b revenue this year, with a plan to grow to $10b of annual turnover within the next five years.</p>
        
            <p>The NBR said based on interviews with the Mowbrays and analysis against comparable listed company valuations, the publication had clearly undervalued the Mowbrays for several years.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, it estimated their worth was $3.2b.</p>

            <p>"Zuru describes itself as a robotics and automation company with a relentless focus on continuous improvement, which sees it automate at least one new process a week, resulting in some of the most efficient factories in the world," NBR List editor Hamish McNicol said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has resulted in the group being highly profitable and debt free, and Zuru must now surely be considered one of New Zealand's most remarkable business successes."</p>
        
            <p>The group is now working on a project to automate property construction, the NBR said.</p>
        
            <p>About a year ago, Zuru purchased a 25-acre factory in China which would be its first full production factory for houses - the first of which should be complete by early next year.</p>
        
            <p>"If Zuru manages to completely disrupt how a building is built, then the scale of what it can achieve is almost endless," McNicol said.</p>
        
            <p>The collective wealth of this year's NBR List has come in at $95.68b - well up on last year's $72.59b.</p>
        
            <p>The top 10 are all billionaires with a collective net worth of more than $50b.</p>
        
            <p>Baby boomers' wealth is set to be transferred to the next generation, with some 'Listers' considering investments on a 100-year horizon, the NBR said.</p>
        
            <p>It analysed who was next in line to inherit the wealth, and what might they do with it - finding while some were giving it all away, others were establishing family offices and investment vehicles in the hopes the next generation would continue their legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"This historic wealth transfer is likely to have multiple ramifications on jobs, real estate and the economy overall," McNicol said.</p>
