            <p>Wellington artist Vera Ellen has won the prestigious Taite Music Prize for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Her album Ideal Home Noise was honoured at an exclusive ceremony at Auckland's Q Theatre on Tuesday night. The honour includes a $12,500 cash prize from Recorded Music NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The Taite Music Prize, named after late music journalist Dylan Taite, highlights outstanding New Zealand albums released in the previous calendar year.</p>
        
            <p>Ideal Home Noise is an album born from personal turmoil. In a 2023 interview with RNZ's Tony Stamp, Ellen revealed the album reflected a rough time in her life.</p>
        
            <p>"To be super blunt, I was suicidal. I was struggling with depression and had a bit of an existential crisis over a long period of time."</p>
        
            <p>Ellen's latest work was recorded at Wellington's The Surgery and was produced by multi-instrumentalist Ben Lemi.</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time Ellen has been recognised for her work - her last album, It's Your Birthday, won her Best Alternative Artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards and was shortlisted for the 2022 Taite Music Prize.</p>
        
            <p>The ceremony on Tuesday night honoured the contributions of many local artists and featured performances from previous winners Princess Chelsea and Lawrence Arabia.</p>
        
            <p>Jujulipps took home the Auckland Live Best Independent Debut for her EP, Get That Shot. </p>
        
            <p>"Honestly I really wasn't expecting to win, being alongside such amazing artists," the South African born singer said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to say thank you so much to everybody at Big Pop, this has been a crazy journey ever since I put myself fully into doing music, I've had zero regrets, only positive experiences, I was not expecting this."</p>
        
            <p>Teremoana Rapley was awarded the Independent Spirit Award, recognising her longstanding contributions to music and advocacy for Pacific artists.</p>
        
            <p>"I love music, music is me, there's no way to separate it from who I am and what I do," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for all of you musicians and managers and mums and dads and everyone who makes up this ecosystem, mauri ora."</p>
        
            <p>Cushla Dillon and Andrew Moore received the NZ On Air Outstanding Music Journalism Award for their documentary on legendary rock band King Loser.</p>
        
            <p>"It took us seven years to make this film .. there were lots of ups and downs but we kept plugging away at it, thank you everyone, we've been through complete chaos making this but we got there," Moore said.</p>
        
            <p>"What kept us going is NZ music and how much we love it - it's kept me going this whole time."</p>
        
            <p>Iconic Dunedin band Look Blue Go Purple received the Independent Music NZ Classic Record award for their 1991 compilation album.</p>
