            <p>Bird flu has spread to another shed on an Otago farm, the Ministry for Primary Industries has confirmed</p>
        
            <p>MPI's chief veterinary office, Mary van Andel, said 80,000 chickens would now need to be culled at Mainland Poultry's Hillgrove Egg Farm, doubling from 40,000.</p>
        
            <p>She says there's no indication the H7N6 virus has spread beyond the farm.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Federated Farmers' Luke Kane told Morning Report he wasn't surprised by the spread as it appeared the sheds were in close proximity to each other.</p>
        
            <p>The detection of the virus on the farm would be difficult for those involved, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's taking a toll on all the people that are involved here, the staff, the owners, everybody."</p>
        
            <p>Kane said the industry needed to be aware of the risk of farm birds interacting with native or wild birds.</p>
