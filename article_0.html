            <p>The cancellation of this year's New Zealand Fashion Week is just the latest loss for the beleaguered fashion industry.</p>
        
            <p>The event's owner Feroz Ali announced on Thursday that the event would transition to a biennial, rather than annual, event.</p>
        
            <p>It would next be held in the later months of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is that consumer confidence is at an all-time low and the fashion retail industry has been particularly affected by the reduced consumer spending," Ali said.</p>
        
            <p>"Although we had a strong cohort of committed designers, we didn't have enough for a robust weeklong schedule to make the event viable this year."</p>
        
            <p>News that the 2024 event was being canned came just weeks after designer Kate Sylvester announced she would be closing her business.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2023, Carly Harris Design - which had been running since 1998 - went into liquidation. She told the New Zealand Herald that Covid-19 lockdowns and rent rises had taken their toll on the business.</p>
        
            <p>A handful of smaller New Zealand designers, including Maaike, Mina and Hej Hej, had also closed their doors in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>Ali told Checkpoint that many designers were going into "survival mode".</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people are hunkering down and are really concerned about the viability of their own businesses, their retail store, and also I think they're trying to ride this immense wave of economic pressure, retail pressure, but also the flow-on of foreign business coming into New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped Aotearoa would not lose any more of its iconic brands.</p>
        
            <p>However, "if things don't turn around and we don't support our New Zealand and local designers, I do anticipate that perhaps a few of them will find it challenging in the months coming ahead".</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young previously said it was a "really, really difficult time" for retail - particularly for luxury or designer brands.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether you're priced at the bottom end or the higher end, you can still be successful, but it is much more difficult [at the high end] and converting customer interest into sales is taking a lot longer."</p>
        
            <p>Designers like Sylvester would likely not be the last to close their doors this year, Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm certainly concerned that there will be some closures of stores, I think there will be further closures before we get out the other side of this economic downturn."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the most recent figures from Stats NZ showed electronic card transactions in March were down 0.7 percent ($45 million) compared to February's figures.</p>
        
            <p>Apparel sales in particular took a big hit, with spending down 2.2 percent, or $7.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>In the wider retail sector, Trade Aid is shuttering its 24 shops nationwide due to the cost-of-living crisis, and Target has closed its flagship store on Auckland's Dominion Road after 31 years.</p>
        
            <p>In February, The Warehouse Group sold its underperforming sports brand Torpedo7 for $1.</p>
        
            <p>The group had lost nearly $24 million in the six months prior, with sales down 5 percent across its stores.</p>
        
            <p>Silvermoon has also gone into liquidation and announced earlier this year it was closing its 10 jewellery stores.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision comes as the culmination of an arduous battle against the challenges that have beset not only our industry but the retail sector as a whole," the company said, in a message to customers on its website.</p>
        
            <p>According to a recent Retail NZ survey, one third of retail businesses thought they might have to close this year.</p>
        
            <p>About two thirds did not meet their sales targets in the first quarter.</p>
