            <p>A man who allegedly stole critical equipment from a rescue chopper is now facing three more burglary charges and made an unusual court appearance on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old appeared in the Dunedin District Court last month on an array of charges following the theft of potentially life-saving medical supplies from the Queenstown Rescue Helicopter when it was grounded at the North Taieri air base because of bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>Just over a week after his arrest, police announced they had executed a search warrant and found the medical equipment as well as a swag of other goods from other Dunedin break-ins.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant, who has interim name suppression, appeared in court again this morning facing fresh allegations and sacked his lawyer Karlena Lawrence.</p>
        
            <p>Reading from a piece of paper, the man made a sovereign citizen speech.</p>
        
            <p>"I take the liberty of challenging your jurisdiction. How can it be that you have jurisdiction when I'm rangatira?" he said.</p>
        
            <p>Judge David Robinson allowed the monologue but said the issue of the court's jurisdiction was well settled in law.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going round in circles and I'm starting to think you might be wasting my time," he told the defendant, after the man repeated his questions.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant was remanded in custody until next month.</p>

            <p>Mental-health reports were requested in the meantime.</p>
        
            <p>According to court documents, he is accused of dishonestly taking a cleaning company's Mazda van on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>The following day he allegedly burgled Torpedo 7 in Andersons Bay Rd and Off The Chain bike shop in Cumberland St, then the next day targeted a King Edwards St address.</p>
        
            <p>On 16 January, the day of the defendant's original arrest, he is accused of failing to supply identifying details to police and resisting a constable.</p>
        
            <p>In the original charges, police alleged that on the same day as the Taieri Airport yard incident - 12 January - the man burgled 2degrees on George St and another Dunedin address.</p>
        
            <p>On that day he allegedly unlawfully took a vehicle and was also charged with stealing $810 of gear from Rebel Sports Dunedin on 7 January and unlawfully taking a Queenstown Cleaners Ltd van on 10 January.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters Otago chief executive Graeme Gale previously said he was ''absolutely thrilled'' about the quick arrest.</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier offered the $10,000 reward following the incident but acknowledged it may not have been a factor in the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Burglary carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.</p>
