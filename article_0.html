            <p>Cabinet has approved a new way of delivering water services after it unwound the previous Labour government's Three Waters reform.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simeon Brown has announced council-controlled organisations - known as CCOs - can immediately receive increased borrowing from the Local Government Funding Agency.</p>
        
            <p>That support will be up to 500 percent of a CCO's operating revenues - providing they're supported by parent councils.</p>
        
            <p>Brown says that is twice that of existing councils' leverage.</p>
        
            <p>The Government and funding agency are also exploring increasing debt limits, potentially up to 350 percent of revenue, for high-growth councils, and allowing lending to CCOs not supported by parent councils.</p>
