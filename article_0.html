        <h2>Watch live: Labour leader Chris Hipkins reveals new opposition line-up</h2>
        <p>
Labour leader Chris Hipkins says the new Labour line-up is "going to hold the coalition of chaos to account over the next three years".
</p>
        
            <p>The Labour Party has announced its shadow Cabinet to face off against the coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>The party endorsed Chris Hipkins as leader and voted Carmel Sepuloni the new deputy earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the roles are a continuation of the portfolios MPs served while ministers in government, though some roles have had to be changed due to the departure of two senior figures.</p>
        
            <p>David Parker has picked up Foreign Affairs, after former minister Nanaia Mahuta was not returned to Parliament. His former Environment role has gone to Rachel Brooking, who served as Associate Environment Minister for the final few months of the Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>The departure of Andrew Little means Phil Twyford has been given the Immigration portfolio, while Dr Ayesha Verrall will be the Public Service spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>Ginny Andersen will keep the Police portfolio, but her Justice role has been given to Duncan Webb.</p>
        
            <p>Leader Chris Hipkins said the line-up brought experience and energy to the job of opposition.</p>
        
            <p>"The election didn't go Labour's way and we have work to do to make sure Kiwis know and feel that Labour backs them. I have absolute confidence our team will work with communities right across the country to build this support back," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"With the start this coalition has had, it's clear New Zealanders will need an Opposition that stands up for their values and what is right."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins had already confirmed every MP, including the two newcomers Cushla Tangaere-Manuel and Reuben Davidson, would have a portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>Tangaere-Manuel, the MP for cyclone-hit Ikaroa-RƒÅwhiti picks up Tourism and Hospitality, Forestry, and Cyclone Recovery.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins had already confirmed Grant Robertson would be finance spokesperson, while Dr Ayesha Verrall would remain in the health portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson's decision to run as a list-only candidate at the election had prompted speculation he would retire from Parliament if Labour lost the election, but on Wednesday, at a press conference accusing the government of a fiscal hole, he confirmed he would stick around.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm here, and this first few days has indicated to me exactly why I'd like to be here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins says the new Labour line-up is "going to hold the coalition of chaos to account over the next three years".</p>
        
            <p>"The front bench includes a mix of very experienced and newer former ministers, who are going to bring the skills and energy we need to those jobs and to their portfolios. We've got roughly three times more ministerial experience in our top 20 than National, NZ First and ACT combined."</p>
        
            <p>"There are six women and four men in our top 10 - it's a diverse line-up."</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
