        <h2>Watch: 'A disgrace' - Harris on attack as Trump fires off wild claims</h2>
        <p>
The Republican took only minutes to dive into claims about people eating dogs as Kamala Harris called her rival "weak and wrong". Video

            <p>Republican Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris immediately went on the offensive in the opening segment of their first presidential debate, each seeking a campaign-altering moment in their closely fought election.</p>
        
            <p>Harris, 59, attacked Trump's intention to impose high tariffs on foreign goods - a proposal she has likened to a sales tax on the middle class - while touting her plan to offer tax benefits to families and small businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression," Harris said, referring to his years as president from 2017-2021. Unemployment peaked at 14.8 percent in April 2020 and at 6.4 percent when he left office. It was far higher in the Great Depression.</p>
        
            <p>Trump, 78, criticised Harris for the persistent inflation during the Biden administration's term, though he overstated the level of price increases. He also pivoted quickly to his top issue, immigration, claiming again without evidence that immigrants from "insane asylums" are crossing the US southern border with Mexico.</p>
