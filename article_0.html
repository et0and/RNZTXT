        <h2>The private landlord that wants to home public hospitals</h2>
        <p>
A multi-billion-dollar company wants the government to hurry up and help it build hospitals, in what could be a seismic shift in health infrastructure.
</p>
        
            <p>
The prospect has become a lot more real under an ACT party health policy to establish public-private partnerships (PPP) with "large, global infrastructure developers and investors".

            <p>A multi-billion-dollar company wants the government to hurry up and help it build hospitals, in what could be a seismic shift in health infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a number of shovel-ready projects across New Zealand that the government could be an anchor tenant or partial tenant of," Vital Healthcare Property Trust fund manager Aaron Hockly told RNZ on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Sharemarket-listed Vital is one of the country's biggest hospital landlords. It has spotted an opportunity in National's coalition agreement with ACT that commits the government to explore taking long-term leases with privately-owned health facilities. That is, the delivery of health services would remain public, but their location would shift, to inside hospital buildings that are privately built, owned and managed.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd be delighted to work with them because that would provide quicker access to healthcare across New Zealand," Hockly said.</p>
        
            <p>Building full-scale hospitals with operating theatres was less likely "because I think there's probably some political considerations, which we probably wouldn't want to go near".</p>
        
            <p>"But there's no reason why we couldn't co-own even some of those [major] facilities with the likes of ACC and New Zealand Super, iwi etc, which might alleviate some public concerns around essentially a private landlord owning a public hospital."</p>

            <p>Vital is looking for partners in the coming months for two expansions, in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>If the government signed on as a "cornerstone" tenant, it would speed things up, Hockly said.</p>
        
            <p>The prospects of that have become a lot more real under an ACT party health policy to establish public-private partnerships (PPP) with "large, global infrastructure developers and investors" to refurbish or build new facilities with long-term lease arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour-led government previously banned PPPs in health and education.</p>
        
            <p>National professed the desire in August to to find other funders for building hospitals - mentioning ACC, the Superannuation Fund, KiwiSaver funds.</p>
        
            <p>It also added: "We have no specific plans for private funding for hospitals or other health infrastructure at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Hockly said Vital could build and manage hospital buildings significantly more cheaply than the government could: it gets a building constructed, maintains it, and the tenant does the fit-out with medical gear - and could do much more of it if the government signed on.</p>
        
            <p>It was about to embark on a new outpatient day-stay facility at its public-serviced maternity unit in Christchurch. "The government taking at least a partial stake will enable us to start building quickly," by early 2026, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Its consented plans to double the size of its private Ormiston hospital in south Auckland was another option for public buy-in.</p>
        
            <p>"We would be open to all types of arrangements."</p>
        
            <p>Four years of raising this with the previous government had gone nowhere, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the new government's policy on leaseback was "exactly our wheelhouse".</p>
        
            <p>However, he had not heard from the new ministers of health or infrastructure, plus Vital did not know whom to talk to at Te Whatu Ora. The agency's long-drawnout restructure meant "the decision makers are quite hard to find in terms of who can commit to taking space".</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora told RNZ that while it was aware the government was considering different funding models, it had yet to talk to ministers about infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>ACC said it did not comment on prospective or potential investments.</p>
        
            <p>NZX-listed Vital leases out a fraction of its billion-dollar New Zealand portfolio to Te Whatu Ora already; Australasia-wide, public services make up just 3 percent of its $3b-plus of health space.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University health professor Robin Gauld said the leaseback approach was worth looking at.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an element of privatisation to it, however, it's really a funding arrangement which, if you've got an ACC-type partner, would have some endurance to it," Gauld said.</p>

            <p>However, former senior doctors' union head Ian Powell said it was a form of PPP that had "a lot of sting in the tail".</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever the private participant is, and in whatever shape or form, they have to make a rate of return, a profit. And that's an extra cost margin for the system," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The experience in the UK ... has been disastrous in terms of quality of facilities, quality of care and fiscally - they're a big drain now on the health dollar in the UK."</p>
        
            <p>Vital has half a billion dollars of developments under way in Australasia.</p>
        
            <p>Its 2023 annual report said it targeted places with high rates of health insurance - Australia - or "government supported ... catchments with growing populations".</p>
        
            <p>"Despite recent heightened market volatility, healthcare property remains a defensive asset class, underpinned by a high level of government support and non-discretionary spending," said the company, which is managed by Toronto-listed Northwest Healthcare Properties Real Estate.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital tenancies were at least 30 years long.</p>
        
            <p>"We see the more immediate opportunities is really building new facilities ... that the public wouldn't otherwise have, and probably extending our existing hospitals," Hockly told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Private-public arrangements could vary, say, for a hospital's ownership to revert to the Crown when it was 90 years old, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Vital's 15 properties in New Zealand include Auckland's Ascot bought in 1999 and worth $187m, and Wellington's Wakefield hospitals bought in 2017 and worth $156m.</p>
        
            <p>He had had "a few productive discussions" with the previous health minister Andrew Little, but overall it was frustrating, Hockly said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a bit disappointing, that full utilisation of skills and capital in the economy isn't being used by the government, or hasn't been used to date.</p>
        
            <p>"So it would be good for maybe a less ideological basis on which some of these decisions are made."</p>
        
            <p>Gauld said any leaseback could be negotiated in the best public interest.</p>
        
            <p>But Powell said a private investor would want a big say in a building's design and capacity, possibly "short-changing patients".</p>
        
            <p>"We should not be designing a system to fit around a particular company's needs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We should be looking at this suggestion with a lot of apprehension."</p>
