            <p>Four fire engines and two helicopters are fighting a vegetation fire on Christchurch's Port Hills.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) was alerted to the fire about 11.15am.</p>
        
            <p>They said there were currently four appliances and two helicopters in attendance working to bring the fire under control. A third helicopter was on its way.</p>
        
            <p>A video taken by witness Callum Templeton showed a helicopter using a monsoon bucket to dump water on the fire.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ was asking the public to avoid the area to allow its crews to battle the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said State Highway 76 was closed between Port Hills Road and Chapmans Road due to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke is billowing over the hills and is visible from the central city.</p>
