            <p>The All Blacks produced an error-ridden performance but got their game together when it mattered to beat England 24-22 at Twickenham.</p>
        
            <p>Down 22-14 heading into the final quarter the All Blacks managed to settle their game with a couple of solid scrums while Mark Tele'a scored his second try and Damian McKenzie kicked a penalty and a conversion to go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>The home team had a chance to snatch victory at the end, but George Ford missed a penalty and a drop goal attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Marcus Smith opened the scoring for England with a penalty, before Tele'a grabbed his first try.</p>
        
            <p>Will Jordan got the second after 28 minutes, but the boot of Smith meant the All Blacks led by just two points at half time.</p>
        
            <p>An intercept try to Immanuel Feyi-Waboso put England ahead until the All Black comeback.</p>
        
            <p>With time up England had a chance for victory as they set at scrum in front of the posts, but pressure from the All Black scrum meant the home side couldn't get a clean drop goal attempt.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks captain Scott Barrett had mixed feelings after the final whistle.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew they had George Ford in the pocket there and he's probably when of the best to have in the pocket in those moments," Barrett told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we just put enough pressure on in there and I think it could have gone either way... either team could have won it."</p>
