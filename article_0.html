            <p>More than 400 jobs are likely to go at Oranga Tamariki, with the evidence centre proposed to be significantly impacted, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>In total, possibly a third of roles could be affected - possibly changed or disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>The evidence centre produces research evaluation, analytics and insights about tamariki, rangatahi, their whƒÅnau and the work of Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki chief executive Chappie Te Kani earlier said workers would be able to provide feedback on the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a priority to ensure we do as much as we can to connect with our kaimahi, to keep them informed with regular updates, to share information around the process we are using, and be open about the fact that the document we will release on Wednesday is a proposal and everyone will have a chance to provide feedback before a final decision is made."</p>
        
            <p>He said the change would help put children at the centre of the ministry's work.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
