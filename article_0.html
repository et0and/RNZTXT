            <p>Charter schools are a recipe for disaster that will loot resources from state schools, MPs have heard.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's Education and Workforce Committee is hearing submissions on an education bill that will introduce the publicly-funded private schools.</p>
        
            <p>Submitters today told the committee aspects of the bill were preposterous and outrageous and the proposed changes would breach labour, human rights and free trade agreements.</p>
        
            <p>Others said the schools would give families more choice about their children's education and raise achievement.</p>
        
            <p>NZEI Principals Council chairperson Stephanie Madden told the committee it opposed many aspects of the bill.</p>
        
            <p>She said giving the education minister the power to force state schools to become charter schools was undemocratic and authoritarian.</p>
        
            <p>Madden said the power could be misused to stop principals speaking out against government policies.</p>
        
            <p>"The destabilising effect this would have on a community is absolutely enormous," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Council member Martyn Weatherill said converting state schools into charters would result in confiscation of property such as halls and other facilities that communities had paid for themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"Communities tend not to like people stealing from them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Weatherill said schools did not suffer from a lack of flexibility - one of the main reasons the government said charter schools were needed - rather, they suffered from a lack of resources.</p>
        
            <p>Maxim Institute researcher Maryanne Spurdle said unlike New Zealand, most other OECD countries provided more than half the income of private schools.</p>
        
            <p>She said charter schools would take pressure off the public system and were more cost-effective than state schools.</p>
        
            <p>Spurdle said countries with more government-funded private schools tended to have higher public satisfaction with their education systems.</p>
        
            <p>She said the current education system did not provide families with choice.</p>
        
            <p>"The system on paper may be set up to provide choice but in fact it does not. This would."</p>
        
            <p>Submitter Andrew Riddell said allowing state schools to convert to charters was a way of looting resources from the public school system.</p>
        
            <p>School principal Wayne Leighton said charter schools were a recipe for disaster.</p>
        
            <p>He said the schools were not needed and were fundamentally wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Submitter Natalie Jump said allowing charter schools to make a profit was despicable.</p>
        
            <p>She said research showed the schools would try to select their students to avoid those with more expensive needs.</p>
        
            <p>Long-time charter school opponent Bill Courtney said the bill introducing charter schools was pure ideology.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically it doesn't work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Courtney said charter schools had the same student achievement as state schools and setting up more small schools would only increase the costs of education to the government.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no evidence of innovative teaching practices the last time charter schools were allowed to operate.</p>
        
            <p>Educational Institute Te Riu Roa president Mark Potter said the union strongly opposed the bill.</p>
        
            <p>He said charter schools offered no benefit for New Zealand children as state schools already had a lot of freedom to innovate.</p>
        
            <p>Potter said the $153 million allocated to reintroducing charter schools would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>The union's national secretary Stephanie Mills said allowing state schools to convert to charter schools was an insult to the generations of people who had contributed to their local schools.</p>
        
            <p>Mills said there was no requirement for charter schools to have regard for the Treaty of Waitangi, which was not appropriate given the large number of Māori children.</p>
        
            <p>She said the union was deeply concerned that charter schools would be allowed to employ people who were not qualified teachers, which would put children at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Post Primary Teachers Association acting president Kieran Gainsford said the suggestion that charter schools were needed to introduce flexibility was outrageous and a red herring.</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand schools were already among the most innovative in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Gainsford said proposals for converting state schools to charter schools were an over-reach of ministerial power and preventing charter teachers from joining multi-employer collective agreements would breach international law.</p>
        
            <p>He said the idea that schools needed individual employment agreements to be innovative was preposterous.</p>
        
            <p>Gainsford warned that charter schools overseas tended to use narrow curriculums with teachers who taught to the test.</p>
        
            <p>E tū spokesman John Ryall said the union was worried about the bill's provisions for workers at state schools that became charters.</p>
        
            <p>He said the bill would steam-roller over vulnerable workers' collective agreements and the protections those agreements provided.</p>
        
            <p>Epsom Girls Grammar PPTA branch member Lisa Murphy said teachers were dismayed by the bill.</p>
        
            <p>She said allowing charter schools to hire people who were not registered teachers was a bad idea.</p>
        
            <p>"It is insulting to think anyone can do this job without training or expertise," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Murphy said keeping charters out of multi-employer collective agreements was a sly way of keeping teachers beholden to charter school sponsors.</p>
        
            <p>Former Labour Party MP and principal Marian Hobbs told the committee state schools could already try different approaches to teaching and there was no need for charter schools.</p>
        
            <p>She urged the committee not to allow state schools to convert to charters because her experience in the UK indicated it was very disruptive to children's learning.</p>
        
            <p>She said a clause that would allow charter schools to ignore rulings from the Teaching Council regarding their teachers was dangerous.</p>
