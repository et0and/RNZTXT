            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Police Minister Mark Mitchell have announced a 22 percent drop in assaults in the Auckland CBD in the past year.</p>
        
            <p>The two are speaking to media on Sunday afternoon at the Auckland Central Police Station.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister went on a ride-along with police Saturday night during the course of their duties, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The government has just released a statement that police data shows that from 1 January to 31 July this year, there was a 22 percent reduction in serious assaults within the Auckland CBD compared with the same period last year, and an 18 per cent reduction in serious assaults resulting in injury.</p>
        
            <p>"This shows that Auckland is turning a corner," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell agreed, saying in a statement that "a whole of system co-ordinated approach is working to make Auckland a safe city and one we can be proud to showcase as a gateway to New Zealand for overseas visitors".</p>
        
            <p>"The job isn't done yet. Despite the promising results so far, our government will keep working every day to ensure every Aucklander living or working in the CBD feels safe."</p>
        
            <p>There have been a flurry of homicide investigations in Auckland in the past several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said 97 people have also been referred for addiction and family wellbeing, and accommodation support between July and 10 September, using a new joined-up approach.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative has been running since May, and links police up with the Ministry of Social Development, KƒÅinga Ora and other social services.</p>
