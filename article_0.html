            <p>The National Land Transport Programme for the next three years has a hard focus on more state highways, road maintenance, and greater public transport in the country's main cities.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown announced the programme alongside the New Zealand Transport Agency in Wellington on Monday afternoon, and didn't mince his words on the Coalition's new focus.</p>
        
            <p>"There's less money going into cycleways, and I think New Zealanders are sick and tired of the amount of money going into cycleways."</p>
        
            <p>He said the move away from prioritising public transport was in the coalition agreement with New Zealand First with the new focus being put on "economic growth and productivity".</p>
        
            <p>Brown said National campaigned on 17 roads of national significance, which were being delivered on.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA chief executive Nicole Rosie acknowledged it would be "challenging to deliver everything within the confines of our budgeted funding" but that the agency was "up for the challenge".</p>
        
            <p>The programme has $32.9 billion of investment, which has four key priorities:</p>
        
            <p>Brown said New Zealanders "rejected the previous government's transport policies which resulted in non-delivery, phantom projects, slower speed limits, and an infestation of speed bumps".</p>
        
            <p>"The government is turning this around with record investment in transport projects that reduce travel times, improve public transport options, and build and maintain our roading network to the safe and reliable standard Kiwis expect.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased to see that this NLTP adopted by the NZ Transport Agency board, which boosts funding by 35 percent compared to the last three years, strongly reflects our government's priorities of economic growth and productivity, increased maintenance and resilience, safety, and value for money.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwis will see fewer potholes on our roads as we invest significantly in resealing, rehabilitation, and drainage maintenance to prevent pesky potholes from forming in the first place."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said $6.4b would be invested in completing and undertaking the following public transport and infrastructure projects.</p>
        
            <p>In response to whether it was fair that walking and cycling funding had been halved, Brown said a lot of money had been spent on "nice-to-haves" and the new programme was about "getting back to basics" and focussing on road maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>Funds for the NLTP is collected from fuel excise duty, road user charges, vehicle registration and driver licensing fees.</p>
        
            <p>The Roads of National Significance listed in the NLTP are:</p>
