            <p>The 2024 Olympic Games in Paris officially get under way on Saturday with the opening ceremony along the River Seine.</p>
        
            <p>It's expected to be a unique ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Some have called it risky for not being held in a stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Despite Saturday being the official start of the Games, some sports have already started. Friday was a rough day for the All Blacks Sevens who were kicked out of medal contention in the quarterfinals and the Football Ferns who lost their opening game to Canada after the spying scandal that rocked the team.</p>
