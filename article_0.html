            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith is due to announce changes to citizen's arrest powers, with clearer rules aimed at helping retailers deal with shoplifing.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmsith told Morning Report the government did not want "wild west vigilante-ism" but current laws were not working.</p>
        
            <p>"The general direction is we need to have some better tools available to retailers dealing with people walking out of their shops without paying for things."</p>
        
            <p>Many people would have witnessed supermarket staff being unable to stop someone walking out with a trolley full of goods that hadn't been paid for, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't carry on like that without undermining people's confidence in law and order."</p>
        
            <p>Current rules were very limited - including only making a citizens arrest at night, he said. People were worried about getting into trouble if they tried stop someone leaving their shop or stealing something.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue that we're trying to deal with is coming up with some clearer rules that enable people to defend their property and actually detain people for longer."</p>
