            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has ruled out several recommendations from the Independent Electoral Review set up by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>The minister has released the final report of the review today, which makes more than 117 recommendations, after it was delivered to him at the end of November 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Goldsmith ruled out action on some recommendations, including:</p>
        
            <p>A further recommendation for a referendum on the term of Parliament was a matter already being looked at by the incoming government, with agreement to introduce legislation for a four-year term subject to a binding referendum.</p>
        
            <p>The review was set up by former justice minister Kris Faafoi in May 2022. The reviewers released their initial findings in an interim report in June last year.</p>
