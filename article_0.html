            <p>Police are looking for a Nissan Sentra in relation to the killing of Lower Hutt toddler Ruthless-Empire Ahipene-Wall, also known as Baby Ru.</p>
        
            <p>Baby Ru died last month just shy of his second birthday after suffering violent injuries at a home in TaitƒÅ, Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard told media at Lower Hutt Police Station they were speaking with three people of interest.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was seen going to the Hutt Valley Hospital. It's a light coloured Nissan Sentra Sedan, which took Ru to hospital. The registration number is TE6972.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle took Baby Ru to the hospital, returned to the address, and removed property from the scene that was relevant to the murder investigation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police are building a timeline of movements of the vehicle, and are appealing for footage of it between 22 and 24 October.</p>
        
            <p>The movements of the vehicle could be anywhere within the Wellington region, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have already seized the vehicle and it has undergone forensic examination - but they were looking to map its movements between 22 and 24 October.</p>
        
            <p>"The scene examination has been completed and items of relevance are undergoing forensic testing," Pritchard said.</p>

            <p>There were "varying levels of cooperation" from the three people of interest, he said. He believes they know they have the complete truth with what happened to Baby Ru, and he urged them to come forward with it.</p>
        
            <p>All Baby Ru's injuries were to his head, Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"This poor child suffered a violent death," that could have been from a weapon, or slamming his head on a hard floor or table, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police are monitoring claims of what happened shared on social media, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pritchard would not confirm what items were undergoing forensic testing.</p>
        
            <p>Ruthless-Empire Ahipene-Wall, who was nearly two years old, died from violent injuries on 22 October.</p>
        
            <p>His death is being treated as a homicide, with post-mortem results suggesting he died from multiple blows to his body.</p>
        
            <p>Ahipene-Wall was taken to Hutt Hospital at 10.30am on 22 October in an unresponsive state, but efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said they were looking into the background of all the individuals concerned, and were working with Oranga Tamariki and other family members to understand the history of Ru and the family.</p>
