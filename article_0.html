            <p>Passengers travelling on a LATAM airline which lost altitude en route to Auckland yesterday say they're still in shock and afraid to board a replacement plane tonight after the harrowing experience.</p>
        
            <p>Chilean airline LATAM said flight LA800 had a "technical problem during the flight which caused a strong movement" on its way from Sydney to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance says it treated 50 people at the airport and took 12, including a child, to hospital.</p>

            <p>The airline says three crew members were among the injured.</p>
        
            <p>Passenger Valentina said the plane "just stopped" about 50 minutes out of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"People were flying around and everything was super scary," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Blood was on the ceiling, people [flew] and broke the ceiling of the plane."</p>
        
            <p>The flight was due to continue to Santiago, Chile. A replacement aircraft will now make the trip at 8pm Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger who escaped with minor scrapes told RNZ she was scared about getting on the replacement plane.</p>

            <p>An Australian woman said she was still in shock.</p>
        
            <p>"It woke me up, I jumped. Drinks went everywhere. And we weren't so bad because we were in business class but the people down the back, because they were closer together, a few people got injured.</p>
        
            <p>"We're ok now, a bit of a shock, it doesn't, well I hope it doesn't happen often."</p>
        
            <p>Others described the ordeal as lasting about four seconds and said there were people with neck and head injuries, and dislocated joints.</p>
        
            <p>St John's District Operations manager Andy Everiss told Morning Report the injuries treated ranged from "bumps and bruises, to more serious traumatic injuries".</p>
        
            <p>14 units, including seven ambulances, were at the airport and staff worked hard to calm patients down, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was obviously a lot of emotion on the plane."</p>
        
            <p>Everiss said there would be debriefs about the incident, but he was proud of the reponse of ambulance staff.</p>
        
            <p>"This one today [Monday] will certainly be one that stands out."</p>
        
            <p>Aviation expert Peter Clark says the flight radar shows the flight was cruising at 41,000 feet and at 15.27pm on Monday it dropped to 40,692ft.</p>
        
            <p>Clark told Morning Report it was not a big drop but something had forced the nose of the plane down.</p>
        
            <p>"So all those people that were not strapped in with their seatbelts became a flying object."</p>
        
            <p>It could have been human error or a software or mechanical fault, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand and Qantas also fly Boeing 787 Dreamliners and a thorough investigation was needed, Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>However he doubted other 787 needed to be grounded.</p>
        
            <p>He said the same thing had happened to a Qantas Airbus flying on Australia's east coast.</p>
        
            <p>It was a timely reminder for people to wear their seatbelts, Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you are in your seat wear your seatbelt, some people are very complacent about this."</p>
