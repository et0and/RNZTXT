            <p>Things haven't been going quite how Liam Lawson would have planned in his new drive at the Red Bull team, however things can change very quickly in F1. He starts at the back of the grid in Shanghai after another bad qualifying stint, however the good news is the weather is looking a lot better than the constant rain that disrupted last weekend's season opener in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Racing is expected to start at 8pm NZT.</p>
