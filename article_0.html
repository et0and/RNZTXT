            <p>Would you open your home to a child you didn't know? Letitia Dowie-Lewis has done just that, at least sixty times, sometimes with only half an hour's notice.</p>
        
            <p>She is the 2025 recipient of the Excellence in Foster Care Award, New Zealand's highest caregiving honour, a title that was presented to her by Governor General Cindy Kiro.</p>
        
            <p>The 53-year-old told RNZ Night's Maggie Tweedie that sheltering tamariki has been a lifelong calling, a passion she inherited from her parents.</p>
        
            <p>"My parents were caregivers... I was brought up in the environment."</p>
        
            <p>Growing up on Matakana Island, Lewis said her parents would often provide shelter for tamariki who ran away over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>And while she said her experience in that environment was incredibly rewarding, for a child it can also be a difficult adjustment.</p>
        
            <p>That's why, she believes bringing a new child into the home, should be a family decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I have children living with me that are foster children, we all make the decision together, and they all have to agree before a child comes into the house."</p>
        
            <p>However, the experience can provide whānau members the chance to "learn about caring about other people besides yourself".</p>
        
            <p>"You learn humanity... it changes your perspective on the world."</p>
        
            <p>But while the role is incredibly fulfilling, it also involves a lot of hard work.</p>
        
            <p>"You're a taxi driver because you're running them to doctors' appointments, to colleges, social workers, whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"You're also a life coach, psychologist, a counsellor to these children."</p>
        
            <p>The tamariki and rangatahi she fosters sometimes come from troubled homes. Challenges can include everything from bedwetting to violent behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Some children will come in and not talk for a day or two, so they'll just sit and they observe often to see if it's a safe environment.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to adapt... for every child that comes in."</p>
        
            <p>But the rewards, she said, are "absolutely huge", and include witnessing these youngsters flourish.</p>
        
            <p>"Some may have been expelled... to see the complete turnaround, where they, within months, are succeeding at a new school.</p>
        
            <p>"They get awards... finding that they're actually good at music or good at drawing, and they've been able to thrive.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredible."</p>
