            <p>Two lines company workers have saved a woman stuck inside her car in rising floodwaters south of Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Police say when the woman called emergency services at 1pm and she was on a flooded patch on Waikaukau Road at Ngakuru and the vehicle floated into deeper water and started sinking.</p>
        
            <p>Water was up to her chest while she was on the phone and she could not open doors or windows of her car.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter and swift water rescue team was deployed but a lines crew saw the incident unfolding and jumped into the water, smashing the window before pulling the woman out.</p>
        
            <p>Her car was submerged to its roof minutes later.</p>
