            <p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump have met in a tightly controlled television debate in their fight to be the next US president.</p>
        
            <p>Neither acknowledged the other as they arrived on stage.</p>
        
            <p>The debate has been without the interuptions and interjections of the last campaign, when ugly shouting matches broke out.</p>
        
            <p>Rules are in place this time to prevent that, and both men know their microphones are off when it's not their turn to speak.</p>
        
            <p>The topics covered have included the economy, the Covid pandemic, abortion rights and immigration.</p>
        
            <p>The debate runs from 1pm to 2.30pm NZT on Friday.</p>
