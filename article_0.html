            <p>An advocacy group is calling for mandatory reporting of elder abuse and for it to be recognised as a specific criminal offence.</p>
        
            <p>Government data showed that 75 percent of elder abuse cases involved family members, with only one out of 10 cases reported.</p>
        
            <p>Positive Ageing Trust Hawke's Bay chair Wendy Schollum said she has heard "harrowing" examples of elder abuse, which included an elderly man being physically restrained by his own family.</p>
        
            <p>"His whƒÅnau was actually restraining him during the day, as a way of trying to deal with him, so there was nothing wrong with him but he was being restrained in his own home."</p>
        
            <p>There were examples of emotional abuse as well.</p>
        
            <p>"An elderly woman was being constantly ridiculed, told she was useless, she was a drain on the family, and that really wore her down over time."</p>
        
            <p>Schollum said in New Zealand, existing laws that covered general offences like fraud and assault were used to address elder abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"But they don't actually go far enough and cover all forms of abuse," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She pointed to examples in the US of specific criminal offences for elder abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"They [also] have dedicated enforcement units that take care of that, so they have high prosecution rates and much better protections for those victims as a result of those laws."</p>
        
            <p>But Seniors Minister Casey Costello said the US had a very different criminal system.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a range of offences that can provide protection for those who are vulnerable, those who have lacked the capacity to consent, a whole range of protections in place and there's no real evidence in New Zealand that we're not prosecuting because there's a lack of suitable offending.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're not prosecuting because there's a lack of reporting, a lack of willingness to report."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to focus on building awareness.</p>
        
            <p>Costello said she was also cautious about introducing mandatory reporting of elder abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"I would be really concerned that you would have older people who would be reluctant to talk about their problems if they thought that their family member, who they have a close relationship with, would get in trouble."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to see more information about how compulsory reporting would affect reporting rates.</p>
        
            <p>Today is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.</p>
