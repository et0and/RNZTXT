            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has directed her council staff not to remove a mural in the city calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>On Instagram, Whanau said another 'Free Palestine' mural was removed yesterday by council officers from the same area in Waitangi Park.</p>
        
            <p>"As the Creative Capital of Aotearoa, I do not agree with the approach to remove art from dedicated spaces that speaks to the hard, complex and at times abhorrent issues of the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Art helps us digest unimaginable harm and things that we may struggle to comprehend. It can be confronting, uncomfortable, difficult, a call for peace, or a stamp of the heartache of a city."</p>
        
            <p>She said art should be "embraced" for the huge contribution it made to "our collective culture and conscience".</p>
        
            <p>"Murals should only be painted over if they incite hate or are inappropriate for children."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau's statement comes a day after the US Consulate and Ministry of Foreign Affairs buildings in Auckland had red paint splashed on them and were tagged with messages calling for a ceasefire.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Wellington City Council voted to become the sister city of Ramallah in Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau's office has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Medical officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 11,000 people are confirmed dead from Israeli strikes, about 40 percent of them children, and countless others trapped under rubble.</p>
