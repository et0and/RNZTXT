        <h2>Live: Government won't reveal cost of new Cook Strait ferry plan</h2>
        <p>
Nicola Willis says a new Crown-owned company will now work how to get new ferries by 2029, but won't say how much it will cost. Meanwhile, Winston Peters has been made "Minister for Rail".
</p>
        
            <p>The government has at last unveiled a plan for replacing the Interislander ferries - almost one year after it scrapped Labour's project.</p>
        
            <p>Under the new arrangement, just announced at Parliament, the government will set up a new Crown-owned company to purchase two new ferries, to begin operation in 2029</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis has not revealed the cost of the project, saying it is "commercial confidential" while negotiations are underway, but are "expected to be much less" than the previous scheme.</p>
        
            <p>The government cancelled a previous replacement plan, called iRex, because the two mega ferries needed major terminal and port upgrades at Wellington and Picton, which would have pushed the overall cost to $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Interislander and its competitor Bluebridge have faced recurring mechanical challenges, with sailings cancelled and passengers reporting difficulty getting alternative bookings.</p>
