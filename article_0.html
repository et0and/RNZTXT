            <p>A police call-out that saw five schools and a kindergarten locked down was sparked by a knife fight between a man and woman.</p>
        
            <p>The schools were locked down for more than three hours following the incident, in the Taupō suburb of Hilltop on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō area commander Phil Edwards said police were called to the area after receiving reports of "an altercation between a man and a woman who were both armed with knives".</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured, Edwards said.</p>
        
            <p>The man fled, but police located and seized his vehicle and a gun shortly after the initial call-out.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards said the man was believed to be armed with another gun.</p>
        
            <p>"This man knows who he is, and so do we.</p>
        
            <p>"Come forward sooner rather than later, there is no need to make it harder than it needs to be."</p>
        
            <p>Police's message to the man was "if you refuse to come to us, we will find you", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The cordon was shrunk about 5pm on Thursday following a search by the police Armed Offenders Squad and dog team.</p>
        
            <p>Officers would be out in force in the area on Friday, conducting reassurance patrols, door-knocking and executing search warrants in their search for the man, Edwards said.</p>
        
            <p>They would also be questioning associates, friends and family of the wanted man.</p>
        
            <p>"We are taking this seriously and realise how unsettling this has been particularly for the younger members of our community whose schools went into lockdown."</p>
        
            <p>It was safe for students to go to school on Friday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will also be visiting schools to provide reassurance and thank those children for their bravery and listening to instructions when it was important."</p>
        
            <p>The official police callouts database showed the Thursday incident was initially logged as 'firearms offending', on Kōtare Street, and officers attended at 1.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the wanted man was asked to contact police on 111, referencing the event number P057866209.</p>
