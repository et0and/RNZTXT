        <h2>Taxi operators urged to use $1m fund to make vehicles accessible</h2>
        <p>
"You feel useless at different times of the day," says wheelchair user Barney Koneferenisi, who struggles to find a mobility van to help him get around Auckland city. Audio

            <p>Nearly $1 million set aside for fitting out wheelchair taxis is sitting unused, as the window to claim it draws near.</p>
        
            <p>Taxi companies around the country had claimed just a quarter of the $1.2m fund and some operators said the funding model was leaving them out of pocket.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, wheelchair users said there was a shortage of accessible taxis, meaning they were sometimes left stranded.</p>
        
            <p>Barney Koneferenisi is a wheelchair user with multiple limb amputations, and said he often found it difficult to get around.</p>
        
            <p>When he first started studying at Manukau Institute of Technology in Auckland, he tried to call a taxi to get home after class, but had trouble getting one.</p>
        
            <p>"I called [South Auckland taxis] for a wheelchair van and they told us they had none available. I went from South Auckland taxis to Re-Li-On-Us to Blue Bubble, literally list by list by list and they all told us there were none available."</p>
        
            <p>Koneferenisi previously made a petition to Waka Kotahi on the issue, but did not feel there had been much progress.</p>
        
            <p>Experiences like this one left him frustrated, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You feel useless at different times of the day. It demotivates you to go to an early class. You have to make excuses to your lecturer ... it's mentally draining."</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi NZ Transport allocates money that can be used to purchase and fit out wheelchair vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Regional councils decide how much they need each year, but three-quarters of the money for the current three-year window, which ends in June 2024, had not been touched.</p>
        
            <p>In Hawke's Bay, for example, taxi companies had claimed just 22.4 percent of their allocation, while some regions had not claimed any at all.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council covers 60 percent of the fit-out cost.</p>
        
            <p>But Hawke's Bay Combined Taxis general manager Wayne England said it was not enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the individuals [taxi operators] haven't got $30,000 or $40,000 sitting in their bank account."</p>
        
            <p>The amount varied between regional councils, with some offering a flat fee, and some covering the full installation cost.</p>
        
            <p>Ideally, his company would provide a 24/7 service for wheelchair users, but that would require more money, England said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think any person or any person in a total mobility vehicle should have the right to move around. So they should be able to ring up and get a total mobility vehicle at 10pm because they've come home from the pictures, they've been out at a restaurant with the family."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson City Taxis chair Graeme Page said it took a long time for a taxi operator to make back the money they spent on installing a wheelchair hoist.</p>
        
            <p>He would like to see the whole cost covered by councils.</p>
        
            <p>"Just recognition I think, more recognition into the investment that we have to make, so 100 percent back would be good."</p>

            <p>KoneferenisiÂ got tired of waiting for the system to change, so he started working on his own app, called Safe Rides.</p>
        
            <p>He initially planned to cater just to the disabled community, but decided that to make it profitable, he would need to have a broader appeal.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to create an Uber-like service, so literally open to everyone, but having extra segments that cater to the underserved part of the community."</p>
        
            <p>In a briefing to the incoming Transport Minister, the Small Passenger Service Association suggested the transport agency should mandate a certain amount of funding for fitting out vehicles across the country.</p>
        
            <p>It said the subsidy should be set at a level which would encourage operators to invest in the service.</p>
