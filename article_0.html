        <h2>'Cloak of secrecy' concerns over Migration 5</h2>
        <p>
The group of nations, which exchanges millions of traveller details, should be subject to greater oversight, opposition MPs say.

            <p>Immigration Minister Erica Stanford has dismissed concerns the Migration 5 operation is "a very significant intelligence gathering and data sharing operation" developed "under a cloak of secrecy".</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, MPs grilled the immigration minister and officials over the network, which was detailed in an RNZ investigation published this week.</p>
        
            <p>The Migration 5 countries of New Zealand, the US, UK, Australia and Canada - which mirror the membership of the Five Eyes intelligence grouping - collaborate on border policies, technology and data-sharing.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party immigration spokesperson Phil Twyford said Migration 5 was operating under a cloak of secrecy, in a murky area exempt from privacy rules.</p>
        
            <p>And Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March said New Zealand should rethink its involvement, calling on the government to make the case for its existence.</p>
        
            <p>But Immigration Minister Erica Stanford told the education and workforce select committee that it was an operational matter and crucial to New Zealand's security.</p>
        
            <p>"We are operating now more than ever in a very, very high risk environment - more asylum claims, more high risk cases. And we need to make sure that our borders are not compromised and so being able to share information with our partners is a crucial part of making sure we're keeping New Zealanders safe, and ensuring the integrity of our borders," Stanford said.</p>

            <p>"It's a long-standing agreement, I don't think there's been any particular secrecy around it and it's been in place since 2008."</p>
        
            <p>Immigration New Zealand (INZ) head Alison McDonald said so far this year it had received 727,000 data-checking requests from its four partners, and matched 185 people. It had sent biometrics on 865 people for checking with the M5 members, and received information on a quarter of them.</p>
        
            <p>If errors, such as ones which happened with the No-Fly list occurred involving children, they could be rectified, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would make sure that credentials were given so that when that child crosses the border, there's a very clear notification of what happened that it was a mistake and it shouldn't happen.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been several examples in my tenure where we've done that, issued a notice to someone where perhaps we've declined an application and subsequently approved it, we've then gone on to give that person a letter to take with them in case there's any border stops."</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment chief executive Carolyn Tremain said strict protocols covered data-sharing, and Migration 5 was one of many such transnational collaborations.</p>
        
            <p>"Similar groupings occur over many dimensions of government operational activity. Police, customs - we all have worked in an informal kind of arrangement with our Five Eyes partners."</p>

            <p>Labour's Phil Twyford described Migration 5 as "a very significant intelligence gathering and data sharing operation".</p>
        
            <p>"[It] has largely developed over the years under a cloak of secrecy and the public New Zealand public, including people whose own data has has been shared, had no idea this was going on.</p>
        
            <p>"It was all operating in a rather murky area completely exempt from the Privacy Act and the way that New Zealanders would expect data to be treated."</p>
        
            <p>He was surprised at the extent of the work with the Five Eyes countries.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really good that this is out in the open now. I think it's pretty clear that there should be some oversight mechanism to hold Immigration New Zealand accountable and provide some oversight to reassure the public."</p>
        
            <p>That could be the Privacy Commissioner, he said, but given how significant intelligence gathering had become to the border operation, it might need to be the inspector-general of intelligence and security.</p>
        
            <p>The border needed to be protected, Twyford added. "But that doesn't contradict the need for people's personal information to be treated in a way that's consistent with the Privacy Act and the expectations of New Zealanders."</p>

            <p>Green MP Menéndez March called on INZ to make data publicly available, saying it should not take media and opposition MPs to search for information.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not confident that the minister has enough oversight of an operation that is deeply sensitive in nature and I would claim goes far beyond an operational minor issue that she doesn't need to have oversight of, which seems to be what has happened over successive governments," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Immigration New Zealand and the minister should be making the case clear to the public as to why we should be participating in Migration 5 at all. That case hasn't been made politically to the public of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Data-sharing could have life-changing consequences for migrants, travellers and asylum seekers, he said, and redress options needed to be much clearer.</p>
