        <h2>Watch live: Greens vote waka-jump Tana, implore 'one final time' for her to resign</h2>
        <p>
The Green Party's membership has voted to kick former MP Darleen Tana out of Parliament.

            <p>The Green Party's membership has voted to kick former MP Darleen Tana out of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party Co-Leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick confirmed the party voted unanimously to notify the Speaker and told Tana it was time for her to "do the right thing" and resign.</p>
        
            <p>Tana quit the party in July amid allegations of migrant exploitation at her husband's bicycle business.</p>
        
            <p>She stayed on as an independant while the Greens - historically opposed to the party-hopping legislation - sought its members' support to get rid of her.</p>
        
            <p>Tonight's meeting is now over - with a consensus of all 185 delegates at the special general meeting approving the use of the waka jumping law.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leaders Chloe Swarbrick and Marama Davidson said they had written to Tana to inform her - and repeat their request she resign.</p>

            <p>"Following the Special General Meeting to discuss the potential use of the Electoral Act to remove Darleen Tana as a Member of Parliament, party delegates have endorsed notice being given to the Speaker under section 55A(3)(b) of the Act," Swarbrick said in a statement on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposal to provide the Speaker with notice under the Electoral Act was approved by the consensus of all 185 delegates present at the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"Hon. Marama Davidson and I have written to Darleen Tana to inform her of this, and for the last time request she finally do the right thing, take accountability and resign as a Member of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also written to the Speaker outlining that we believe Darleen's resignation from the party but not from Parliament has affected the proportionality of the House, triggering the next step of the legislation.</p>
        
            <p>"From the outset, we have done all we can to navigate the situation in front of us with our values as the guiding star. I am proud of how we have held true to these throughout this process."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party members were meeting this evening to decide whether to use the so-called "party-hopping" legislation to remove Tana.</p>
        
            <p>Despite an eleventh-hour appeal from Tana through the courts, the vote has gone ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Party members needed to reach a consensus over whether the legislation - which the Greens have historically opposed - should be used.</p>
        
            <p>On the process and the discussions regarding the vote, Swarbrick said: "The Green Party loves a yarn and loves pulling things apart ... we mean it when we talk about having robust and fulsome discussions about these things."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if she wished she'd done anything differently during this saga, Swarbrick said "ask me that in a few days".</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody had an opinion and all I can really say is that I can genuinely tell you, hand on heart, that we did everything that we could with our values at the forefront."</p>
        
            <p>Former MPs including Kevin Hague and Metiria Turei gave input to the hui tonight. Swarbrick says they brought a lot of nuance and different perspectives to the issue.</p>
        
            <p>The hui wrapped up a little earlier than the party expected, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tana took the party to court last month to argue the Green Party's disciplinary process had been unlawful, unauthorised by the party's constitution, unreasonable and unfair.</p>
        
            <p>However, the judge rejected her claims, leaving the Greens free to proceed with the Special General Meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The waka-jumping law has not been used since the early 2000s, when ACT kicked Donna Awatere Huata out over allegations of fraud.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
