            <p>All Newshub operations are to be shut down and 250 people will lose their jobs. The shutdown includes the company's website.</p>
        
            <p>The last 6pm news bulletin will air on July 5.</p>
        
            <p>Warner Bros Discovery said talks were ongoing with third parties to provide a pared-back news service - such as a 6pm bulletin for the Three channel. However, no deals have been reached yet.</p>
        
            <p>Follow all the reactions here:</p>
        
            <p>Head of networks Glen Kyne said Warner Bros Discovery had been clear it would listen to all feedback both internal and external over the five-week consultation period.</p>
        
            <p>"Our door has been open and some conversation have taken place. They're continuing to take place in confidence but there is no deal."</p>
        
            <p>He promised to let staff know immediately if any new deals could be finalised.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked staff for their feedback.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement of the definite shutdown came at an all-staff meeting at a hall close to Newshub's office in Auckland's Eden Terrace on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Newshub staff were told by Warner Bros Discovery managers in February it planned to axe the entire news operation.</p>
        
            <p>The newsroom was losing too much money, staff were told.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, it is understood there have been talks between Warner Bros Discovery and a number of media firms, including Stuff, about ways that part of the business could be preserved. It has been suggested that could include the production of a "slimmed-down" news bulletin by a third party.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, TVNZ staff will today hear the fate of its Sunday current affairs show, after the company confirmed on Tuesday it was axing the on-air version of Fair Go, and the Midday and Tonight news programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Spinoff founder Duncan Greive said the changes would be irreversible, and a "tragic" outcome for those affected.</p>
