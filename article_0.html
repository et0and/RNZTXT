            <p>Worried New Caledonian expats in Aotearoa admit they are "terrified" for friends and family amid ongoing violence and civil unrest in the island nation.</p>
        
            <p>The death toll remains at four on Thursday evening, and hundreds have been injured after electoral changes sparked widespread rioting by pro-independence supporters in the capital of Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>French president Emmanuel Macron has declared a 12-day state of emergency and about 1200 police enforcements are due to arrive from France.</p>
        
            <p>Many terror-stricken locals have been confined to their homes.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand-based New Caledonians have explained how the situation in their homeland has left them on edge.</p>
        
            <p>Pascale Desrumaux and her family have been in Auckland for two years.</p>
        
            <p>With parts of the country in turmoil, she said she is scared for her family and friends back home in Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm terrified and I'm very stressed," Desrumaux said.</p>
        
            <p>"[My family] are afraid for their lives."</p>
        
            <p>The precarious situation is illustrated by the fact her family can't leave their homes and neighbouring stores have been ransacked then torched by rebels.</p>
        
            <p>"They are locked in at the moment, so they can't move - so they feel anxiety of course," Desrumaux said.</p>
        
            <p>"On top of that, shortly they will run out of food.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation is complex."</p>

            <p>Desrumaux is checking in with family members every few hours for updates.</p>
        
            <p>Amid the current climate, she said she has mixed emotions about being abroad.</p>
        
            <p>"This shared feeling of being relieved to be here in New Zealand and grateful because my kids and husband are not in danger.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time I feel so bad for my friends and family over there."</p>
        
            <p>She stressed her home country remained "a beautiful place" and hopes the situation can be resolved peacefully.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Auckland-based New Caledonian Anais Bride said she had been left distraught by what was unfolding.</p>
        
            <p>In the past 48 hours, her parents have vacated their Nouméa home to stay with Bride's sister as tensions escalated.</p>
        
            <p>Based on her conversations with loved ones, she felt that international news coverage had not fully conveyed the fluid crisis facing citizens on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"It took my mother a little while for her to accept the fact that it was time to leave, because she wanted to stay where she lives.</p>
        
            <p>"My sisters' just told her 'at the end of the day, it's just your house, it's material'.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been hard for my parents."</p>
        
            <p>She said there was only one supermarket left standing in Nouméa, with many markets destroyed by fire.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin, who did not want his surname to be published, is another New Caledonian living in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>While his family has not seen much unrest first hand, explosions and smoke were constant from where they were, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was hard to predict how the unrest can be straightened out.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to tell.</p>
        
            <p>"The most tragic thing of course is the four deaths, and many businesses have been burned down so many people will lose their job.</p>
        
            <p>"The main thing is how people rebuild connections, peace and of course the economy."</p>

            <p>"There was a heavy police presence out at the airport with two tanks at the entrance and heavily armed military police roaming around.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we got into the airport we were relieved to be there in this sort of peaceful oasis.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't really have a sense of what was still to come."</p>
        
            <p>She admitted she did not fully comprehend the seriousness of it all until she had left the country.</p>

            <p>Flights through Nouméa are currently grounded.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said it is monitoring the situation in New Caledonia, with its next flight NZ932 from Auckland to Nouméa still scheduled for Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Operational Integrity and Safety Officer Captain David Morgan said this "could be subject to change".</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of our passengers, crew, and airport staff is our top priority and we will not operate flights unless their safety can be guaranteed.</p>
        
            <p>"We will keep passengers updated on our services and advise customers currently in Nouméa to follow the advice of local authorities and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade."</p>
