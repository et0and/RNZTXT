            <p>Hundreds of more civilian New Zealand Defence Force jobs are set to go as part of a major restructure, the Public Service Association says.</p>
        
            <p>The union said NZDF staff were told today of plans for changes in the civilian workforce resulting in a net reduction of 374 roles.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after 145 civilian workers took redundancy last year.</p>
        
            <p>At which time NZDF warned more cuts were likely.</p>
        
            <p>The NZDF has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The office for the Minister of Defence Judith Collins, when approached for comment, said it was an operational matter for NZDF.</p>
        
            <p>"I trust the NZDF is ensuring taxpayer dollars are being spent to achieve maximum effect while prioritising military outputs."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the union called Prime Minister Christopher Luxon a "hypocrite".</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has previously said he wanted to get New Zealand's defence spending close to 2 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, New Zealand spends just over 1 percent of its GDP on defence, but that's expected to be boosted in it's soon to be revealed Defence Capability Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"He said his government would spend more on defence but is now responsible for cutting critical civilian expertise that are critical to ensuring that we have a combat-ready Defence Force," PSA National Secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said.</p>
        
            <p>"The current unstable international climate means government must invest in all areas of defence, but we are seeing the opposite with these dangerous and damaging proposed cuts."</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons said the civilians cuts would have a knock-on effect and more uniformed staff would also leave as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"Defence can't operate without a well-resourced civilian workforce to maintain IT systems, provide healthcare for military personnel, provide engineering support for military equipment and other critical functions."</p>
        
            <p>"These cuts mean already heavy workloads will increase, and uniformed staff will pick up some of the duties of civilian workers. That will only worsen NZDF's retention problem. More skilled uniformed staff will leave, further weakening our frontline civil defence and military capability."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, in a briefing to Collins, NZDF admitted the most significant issue it was facing was high levels of attrition, while at the same time requests for its help was expected to increase.</p>
        
            <p>In the 20 months to 28 February 2023, the NZDF lost 30 percent of its full-time uniformed and trained personnel.</p>
        
            <p>In that briefing, some months before 145 civilian workers took redundancy, it said the NZDF was around 1300 uniformed personnel and 130 civilians short of what was needed.</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons said the PSA would be opposing the cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"These cuts should be stopped if it's serious about prioritising the security of the nation."</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour, who is the acting prime minister while both Christopher Luxon and Winston Peters were overseas, said he didn't believe Defence Force cuts meant national security was under threat.</p>
        
            <p>He said defence spending was increasing and would continue to do so under this government.</p>
        
            <p>"I can guarantee you that, because the world's changing and we will change with."</p>
        
            <p>But he said it wasn't the government's role to tell NZDF who they should employ.</p>
        
            <p>"Which people the Defence Force employ and whether they employ them as civilian contractors, or as uniformed sworn soldiers and service people, that's a decision for them."</p>
