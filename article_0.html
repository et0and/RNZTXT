            <p>The victim, 66-year-old Fuk-Fu Joseph Kwok, was named today.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the man's house at Celtic Crescent on Monday evening after his body was found by a relative.</p>
        
            <p>They have been seeking his 67-year-old wife Mei Han Chong.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Beard, from Auckland City CIB, Beard said the inquiries to date also suggest that the wife may also be the victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>They have grave concerns for her safety and welfare. Their son says it's totally out of character for her not to contact them, Beard says.</p>
        
            <p>"We still need the public assistance in trying to locate where Mai is and where that blue Kia motor vehicle is."</p>
        
            <p>Mei Han Chong was last seen at home on the weekend. She is of Asian descent, 5 foot tall (1.5 metres) and 48kg, and has grey hair and wears glasses, he said.</p>
