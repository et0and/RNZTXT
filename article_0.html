            <p>New Zealanders were among the first in the world to celebrate the arrival of 2024 with fireworks displays around the country last night.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland the fireworks illuminated the cloudy night sky and were accompanied by a laser light and animation show.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington went ahead with its waterfront concert and fireworks, despite high winds that forced the cancellation or delay of flights through the city earlier yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Crowds gathered on the waterfront thorughout the evening.</p>
        
            <p>But rain, thunder and high winds dampened celebrations in many centres.</p>
        
            <p>The Grey District Business Association on the West Coast cancelled last night's party in the town square and fireworks display because it was too dangerous to set up electrical equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga District Council also pulled the pin on five community events and one fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>There were no reports from police of any major incidents overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sydney hailed 2024 with a dazzling fireworks display featuring silver and gold pyrotechnics to mark the 50th anniversary of its the Opera House.</p>
        
            <p>And at his Sunday prayers at the Vatican, Pope Francis said he wished everyone a peaceful end of the year.</p>
