        <h2>Watch live: Prime Minister Christopher Luxon speaks from Queenstown</h2>
        <p>
Earlier today it was revealed Luxon will be claiming $52,000 to cover his accommodation expenses for an apartment he owns mortgage-free.

            <p>Earlier today it was revealed Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is collecting a $52,000 accommodation supplement to live in his own mortgage-free home in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A $31,000 supplement is available for all MPs living away from home when in Wellington, but the Prime Minister's is a higher subsidy that tops up his $471,000 salary.</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister campaigned on wasteful public spending and a need for cost cutting across the public service and under the coalition government ministries have been asked to find at least 6.5 percent of savings.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Ministers have Premier House available to live in but Luxon was choosing not to due to long-standing maintenance issues.</p>
        
            <p>...more to come</p>
