            <p>The Public Service Association says "savage" cuts to 268 roles in Te Whatu Ora's commissioning team will be felt for years to come.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were told on Thursday 126 roles will be disestablished, and another 142 vacant roles will go unfilled, bringing the total number of roles to be disestablished to 268.</p>
        
            <p>The total number of staff in commissioning when Te Whatu Ora was formed was 1004.</p>
        
            <p>Cuts had reduced that to 756 in the first round of restructuring, and now to 482 - more than half.</p>
        
            <p>PSA national health sector lead Ashok Shankar said this was the team which funded, monitored and commissioned health-based services, including the management of thousands of contracts within the sector.</p>
        
            <p>An employee in the commissioning team, who RNZ has agreed not to name, said it was a tough time.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's fair to say we are all feeling weary after all of the changes we've been through in the past two years, and especially as a lot of staff actually worked extremely hard through Covid to support the public health response. It's just been a tough four years for us."</p>

            <p>Shankar said the cuts were "savage", employees were feeling "shell-shocked", and it would certainly result in the cutting of services.</p>
        
            <p>The distinction between frontline and backline was "a political creation to make the community feel that there's all of these unessential people out there being paid for doing nothing".</p>
        
            <p>"Within health there isn't a frontline and a backline, it is a team, and the team delivers healthcare," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have people in the backline who aren't essential, they ensure that the people who actually touch the patient have all the resources to actually deliver the care.</p>
        
            <p>"Without them, the clinicians on the frontline are not going to be able to do their work."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Te Whatu Ora said: "Health New Zealand is continuing work across the organisation to ensure we live within our budget and focus on providing New Zealanders with easier and faster access to healthcare".</p>
        
            <p>It said other than some leadership changes, there was no formal change process at this stage for commissioning.</p>
