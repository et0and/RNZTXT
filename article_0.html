            <p>A Bluebridge Cook Strait ferry had to turn back after it hit a wharf as it was leaving Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the ferry departed about 8.15 on Wednesday and hit the southern end of Glasgow wharf.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry was sailing towards the entrance to the channel when the operator Straits NZ made decided the vessel should turn back.</p>
        
            <p>"The company made the decision that they wanted a closer look at the ship so they brought it back into the berth," Nalder told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said there was "a decent dent" on the hull and a "very small hole" above the waterline.</p>
        
            <p>The risk was low given the size of the hole, its height above the water, and that it was going into a relatively small compartment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were able to safely disembark once the ferry returned to port.</p>
        
            <p>Repairs to the vessel were likely to be carried out in the afternoon and the ferry was expected to be back in service on Wednesday evening, Nalder said.</p>
