            <p>A Wellington man thought he was about to dig up an old copper pipe with his metal detector before finding two AK-74s and ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday Dan O'Donnell was trying out a metal detector for the first time in the suburb of Berhampore when he detected a faint signal, so he started digging he told Midday Report. </p>
        
            <p>"It got bigger and bigger as I got down deeper in the hole and my curiosity was definitely growing and I just thought I'd be digging up some old copper pipe."</p>
        
            <p>O'Donnell said when he hit a bag that turned out contained the gun and ammunition, he thought it was a bit suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest I just had no idea what to expect - like it could have been some old rubbish."</p>
        
            <p>
The items were buried deep in the ground.

            <p>He said the items were buried very deep and had tree roots growing over them, so it was clear they had been there a long time.</p>
        
            <p>"When I fully uncovered it, I could see that there was newspaper on there dating to 1993 so it had been there for 30 years."</p>
        
            <p>He called the police immediately but wasn't concerned due to the obvious age of the items.</p>

            <p>O'Donnell said he posted the photos to a metal detecting group with people telling him it was "the find of a lifetime".</p>
        
            <p>He said he would continue metal detecting but acknowledged his future finds might not be as exciting.</p>
        
            <p>"The dream is to find a gold coin or something like that, something with a bit of historical significance but it's going to be a bit of a comedown from here I think."</p>
        
            <p>Police have told O'Donnell that the guns are AK-74s.</p>
        
            <p>The AK-74 is a 1974 update of the better known AK-47 rifle.</p>
        
            <p>Police have told RNZ enquiries are being carried out and a forensic examination of the items will be conducted.</p>
