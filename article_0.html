        <h2>First Home Grants scrapped from today</h2>
        <p>
But Housing Minister Chris Bishop has also announced $140 million in new funding for 1500 new social housing places from July next year.
</p>
        
            <p>The government has confirmed it plans to scrap the First Home Grants scheme, with applications ending from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>This would recoup about $245 million over four years.</p>
        
            <p>It has also announced $140 million in new funding for 1500 new social housing places from July next year, to be provided through Community Housing Providers rather than Kāinga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop announced the moves this afternoon at a media briefing called with just half an hour's notice.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora is no longer accepting new applications for First Home Grants. They will still process applications that have already been received," he said.</p>

            <p>"The government has made a deliberate choice to reprioritise low value expenditure to more important policy priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"At a time when the waitlist for social housing is over 25,000 applicants, we have made the tough but necessary call to focus support on New Zealanders who need it most."</p>
        
            <p>He said the First Home Grant was an "expensive and inefficient way to support first home buyers" and had gone from covering about 10 percent of a standard deposit when it was introduced in 2010, to just over 4 percent of a standard deposit in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Evidence shows the grant brings forward the purchase of a first home - but in most cases it does not make a difference to whether someone can buy a home or not," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was expected to have "minimal effect on home ownership rates".</p>
        
            <p>Labour's housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty earlier said scrapping the grants would be a cynical move.</p>
        
            <p>"It will mean that there are people that would have been able to buy a home, and now they can't. There's sort of a social contract with people when you announce a plan to assist them to do something so crucial and so significant in their life like buy a home, that you don't fiddle with it."</p>
        
            <p>He said removing the grants, while also restoring interest deductibility for landlords, would make things even harder for renters to get on the ladder.</p>
