            <p>The family of a surfer killed on Western Australia's remote south coast says he would not have supported a shark cull and understood the ocean's risks.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand-born Steven Jeffrey Payne was surfing at Wharton Beach, 90 kilometres east of Esperance, when he was bitten just after midday on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>He was five weeks into a six-month caravan trip with his partner of 12 years and their dog, Poppy.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released to media on Wednesday afternoon Mr Payne's family remembered him as a six-foot-four "gentle giant" who "loved his partner deeply, cherished his family, thought the world of his best mates, and was devoted to his dog".</p>
        
            <p>"Steven Payne was a beloved partner, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Steve was one of the best. A gentle giant â€¦ he was smart, kind, funny, laid back, and very practical.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a week ago Steve surfed one of the best waves of his life, sharing the wave with a dolphin. He was stoked.</p>
        
            <p>"Steve was a staunch Hurricanes and All Blacks rugby union supporter and still played touch rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a volunteer firefighter with the CFA near where he and his partner and dog lived in Geelong and a well-respected colleague."</p>
        
            <p>They said Payne would not support a shark cull or any attempt to kill the shark responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"He and his partner spent a lot of time in the ocean together, had enjoyed many dives with sharks, and knew the risks," the family said.</p>
        
            <p>They thanked the Esperance community and emergency services for their support.</p>

            <p>Wharton Beach, which had been closed since Monday's attack, reopened on Wednesday afternoon after the final phase of the search was suspended mid-morning.</p>
        
            <p>The fatal attack was the fourth off the Esperance coast in eight years.</p>
        
            <p>Esperance shire president Ron Chambers said the shire would soon seek a meeting with government departments, emergency services, and community groups about shark mitigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to talk about whether the current system is working. If not, what are the issues? Options to address those issues? And the government's ongoing plan for shark mitigation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be a conversation, and the conversation needs to include all the relevant voices. That is how we're going to get the best result for our community."</p>
        
            <p>But he first wanted to give Payne's loved ones and the community time to grieve.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now we need to allow our police, SES, and other emergency services personnel to complete their demanding work for this incident, to pay respect to the memory of a young life lost too soon, and the family, friends, and loved ones mourning his loss," Cr Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"And to acknowledge that our community are really feeling the effects of this tragedy."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell Capelli, who formed the Ocean Safety and Support Group following the death of Laeticia Brouwer in 2017, said the community was reeling.</p>
        
            <p>"It brings up a lot of raw emotion. It's devastating for our town going forward. So many people are affected by it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His group has long called for stronger state government action to prevent shark attacks.</p>
        
            <p>They believe if a shark is hanging around a popular beach, Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) should attempt to catch, tag, and re-locate it.</p>
        
            <p>Following a shark attack they believe DPIRD should try to catch the shark involved and remove it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got to the point now where I'm getting approached by people wanting to set up a rally out the front of parliament house," Mr Capelli said.</p>
        
            <p>"Calling on the Premier to actually pull some strings here and save some lives by responding following an attack."</p>
        
            <p>The state government has a network of shark monitoring receivers with four based off the Esperance coast to alert the public if a tagged shark is nearby.</p>
        
            <p>These are linked to land-based warning towers which use lights, sirens, and audio to warn beachgoers when a tagged shark is in the region.</p>
        
            <p>These are currently at Twilight Beach, West Beach, and Kelp Beds, but not at Wharton Beach.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether the network should be expanded DPIRD said it would "continue to assess the most effective shark mitigation measures" and build on its current efforts.</p>
        
            <p>It said each acoustic receiver cost around $30,000.</p>
        
            <p>It also said it was working to increase shark tagging efforts with nine tagged off the Esperance coast between November 2024 and February 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2009, 206 white sharks have been tagged in WA waters.</p>
        
            <p>The shark species involved in this week's attack has not yet been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Payne's board has been recovered, which has bite marks in it, and will be sent to Perth where DPIRD will run tests to determine the species and size of the shark involved.</p>
