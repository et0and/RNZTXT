            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he intends to step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March.</p>
        
            <p>That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on 20 January when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won re-election twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers.</p>
        
            <p>But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.</p>
        
            <p>Polls show the Liberals will badly lose to the official opposition Conservatives in an election that must be held by late October, regardless of who the leader is.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament was due to resume on 27 January and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March.</p>
        
            <p>But if Parliament does not return until 24 March, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau made his remarks in a live address a short time ago.</p>
