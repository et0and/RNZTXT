            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman has been convicted for shoplifting and ordered to pay a fine of $1600, plus $260 in court costs.</p>
        
            <p>Reading her decision at the Auckland District Court on Thursday, Judge June Jelas said Ghahraman's show of remorse and repayment of stolen items, as well as her good credit as a first-time offender, meant imprisonment would not be applied.</p>
        
            <p>The sentencing was delayed on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old earlier entered guilty pleas on four shoplifting charges involving boutique stores in Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The judge previously said Ghahraman would not be receiving a custodial sentence, her lawyer had asked for discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
