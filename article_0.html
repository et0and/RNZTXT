            <p>The government is launching an inquiry after RNZ revealed more than 100 new classroom builds were in doubt.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford, speaking alongside Prime Minister Christopher Luxon at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing, said the government had inherited a school property system "bordering on crisis".</p>
        
            <p>"Within weeks of forming a government, the Ministry of Education had already paused 20 building projects and informed me that there could be up to 350 projects in various stages, from design through to pre-construction, where expectations far exceeded what could be delivered," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been a number of cost escalations and some schools expecting exciting, bespoke building projects that are not able to be delivered on."</p>
        
            <p>She announced an inquiry would be set up - with a lead reviewer and review team to be appointed immediately - tasked with reporting back in three months.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a clear need to review the school property system to evaluate the sustainability and efficiency of current arrangements and ensure we can deliver the school property our children deserve, while protecting taxpayers from further inefficiencies and poor value for money," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said some of the projects were weeks away from shovels in the ground, but "funding available hadn't been managed well enough to meet what schools understood had been approved".</p>
        
            <p>One example was the Te TƒÅtoru o Wairau Marlborough schools co-location project, she said, "which had years of cost escalations with construction estimates of up to $405 million, despite originally only having $170 million allocated by Cabinet in 2018".</p>
        
            <p>It follows reports by RNZ which revealed major projects at 20 primary schools and colleges - some of the roughly 300 new classrooms promised in last year's Budget - had been put on hold.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the schools were all in different phases of their build, and it was difficult to have a good view of what had been promised.</p>
        
            <p>The pipeline of projects the government was unable to deliver on "runs into the billions". The cost of redesigning and rescoping would be a lot less, she said, instead of the bespoke rebuild and upgrades the previous government promised.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said there was evidence that previous education minister Chris Hipkins knew about the financial problems the entire time.</p>
        
            <p>In the case of Marlborough, the ministry decided to pause the project, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Hipkins appeared to have allowed them to design whatever they wanted, and there was no one telling the schools to "pull up" and that there was too little funding.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if the government could guarantee the schools would all get the classrooms they need, Stanford said the priorities needed to be reviewed.</p>
