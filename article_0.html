            <p>Body guards then crowded around Trump as he ducked below the podium and armed officers took up positions at the front of the stage.</p>
        
            <p>Trump repeatedly raised his fist to the crowd and shouted as he was escorted to a vehicle by the US Secret Service.</p>
        
            <p>"The Secret Service has implemented protective measures and the former president is safe," a Secret Service spokesperson said on X after what the agency called an incident.</p>
        
            <p>"This is now an active Secret Service investigation and further information will be released when available."</p>
