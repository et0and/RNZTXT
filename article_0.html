        <h2>The controversial tenure of Fonterra boss Theo Spierings</h2>
        <p>
Spierings, who died over the weekend, was a high-profile chief tied to Fonterra's global ambitions and whose paycheque was never far from public debate.

            <p>The former high-profile and controversial head of dairy co-operative Fonterra, Theo Spierings, has died.</p>
        
            <p>A brief statement issued through a consultancy he worked for said Spierings had died over the weekend in the Netherlands after a brief illness.</p>
        
            <p>"His legacy, and the impact he had on those he worked with and who knew him, will be remembered fondly."</p>
        
            <p>"At this difficult time, Theo's family has requested privacy. They appreciate the outpouring of love and support from around the world during this sad time."</p>

            <p>Spierings, a 30-year veteran of the dairy industry in Europe and New Zealand, had returned to Holland after his resignation from Fonterra in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>He was appointed to Fonterra in 2011 after its first decade following its creation from the mega merger of the country's two major dairy producers and the Dairy Board.</p>
        
            <p>Spierings had previously headed the Dutch dairy co-operative Friesland Foods and led its merger with Campina in 2008.</p>
        
            <p>Spierings' appointment in 2011 was widely welcomed by dairy industry figures as bringing wide experience in dairy co-operatives but a fresh view.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra was still restoring its reputation and standing after the melamine contaminated milk scandal and failed investment in Chinese dairy company San Lu in 2008.</p>
        
            <p>However, he was wedded to Fonterra's global ambitions and expansion in China, Latin America and Asia resulting in joint ventures, acquisitions, and direct investment in Chinese dairying operations.</p>
        
            <p>But milk prices gyrated during the period exacerbating the tension between farmer payouts and the co-operative's commercial operations and profitability.</p>

            <p>Fonterra weathered another contamination scare in 2013 when it conducted a world wide recall of product because of suspected botulism contamination.</p>
        
            <p>The handling of the scare battered Fonterra's reputation again and prompted a major confrontation with leading customer Danone, as well as government inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The topic of Spierings' salary was never far from discussion through much of his tenure, with his ever rising multi-million dollar salary and incentives contrasted with many farmers struggling to make ends meet and job cuts at Fonterra.</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra always maintained that Spierings was running the country's biggest business and needed to be paid appropriately, although Spierings himself asked for a pay freeze in 2015 when the salary was already touching $4m.</p>
        
            <p>His departure was speculated on by Australian media in 2016 with a suggestion that then Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon would replace him.</p>
        
            <p>By the time he left in 2018 he was earning $8m, including bonuses, just as Fonterra was about to announce disastrous financial losses in 2018 and 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Spierings said he was looking for a better job, not a bigger job.</p>
