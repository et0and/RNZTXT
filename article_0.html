        <p>
The public health system is making slow progress on achieving the government's health targets, with three actually getting slightly worse or flat-lining over winter.

            <p>The public health system is making slow progress on achieving the government's health targets, with three actually getting slightly worse or flat-lining over winter.</p>
        
            <p>Results for July to September: </p>
        
            <p>Chief clinical officer Dr Richard Sullivan said it was "heartening to see the health system begin to stabilise" and thousands more people getting treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's results show that we are making real progress on our commitment to deliver quality, compassionate, affordable healthcare, at the right time, in the right place."</p>
        
            <p>Winter was always a challenging time for the health system, and it expected a drop in performance.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the usual winter pressures, including over 18,000 additional attendances to our EDs compared to the same time last year, performance across four of the five health targets remained relatively stable this quarter."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was encouraged by the "gradual improvement" in faster cancer treatments and shorter wait times for elective surgery, while the number of patients waiting less than six hours was "stable" compared with last winter.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there is still work to do to improve childhood immunisation rates, which continue to decline. Health NZ is working closely with healthcare providers to make it easier for families to access vaccinations and ensure children receive their full vaccinations by 24-months-old."</p>
        
            <p>There was also a long way to go to reduce variation between hospitals and regions, he conceded.</p>
        
            <p>"Our relentless focus on improvement so New Zealanders receive the best care and support, regardless of where they live, is driving our collective efforts. We know it can be done, as some hospitals are already demonstrating, and we are committed to achieving this across the rest of the country."</p>
        
            <p>In the three months to the end of September, the number of two-year-olds who were fully immunised dropped by more than 1500 compared with the same period last year, to 11,642 (75.7 percent).</p>
        
            <p>That was down from 76.5 percent in the previous quarter, and 77.2 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The target this year was to have 84 percent of children fully immunised at 24 months, ultimately reaching 95 percent by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ said the decrease was partly due to more children being "identified as eligible" due to a system change.</p>
        
            <p>However, it conceded that immunisation rates had been decreasing steadily over the past few years, "a trend also seen overseas".</p>
        
            <p>"Anecdotally, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and disinformation have contributed to the decline, but there is still work to do to make it easier for families to get their children fully vaccinated."</p>
        
            <p>Nationally, 67.5 percent of patients waited less than six hours in emergency departments, down 3.7 percent on the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The worst region in the country was central, with just 56.4 percent of patients waiting less than six hours.</p>
        
            <p>The target this year was to have 74 percent of patients discharged, admitted or transferred within six hours, reaching the 95 percent target by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>However the result was the same as it was in the same period last year, despite EDs treating 18,632 more patients (336,243 in total).</p>
        
            <p>The percentage of patients waiting longer than four months for a first specialist appointment also got slightly worse with just 61.2 percent getting those appointments on time, down 0.3 percent on the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The target for this year is 62 percent, with the aim of reaching 95 percent by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>However, overall thousands more patients got first specialist appointments - 188,000 in those three months, 12,000 more than in the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>"This indicates that wait times for specialist assessments are beginning to stabilise."</p>
        
            <p>More patients received cancer treatment within a month of the decision to treat, 84.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That was up 1.1 percent on the previous quarter, inching closer to the target for this year of 86 percent.</p>
        
            <p>There remained considerable variation between the regions, from 80 percent in Te Manawa Taki to 86.3 percent in Central region.</p>
        
            <p>Of patients waiting for elective treatment, 62 percent got those operations within four months - up 0.8 percent on the previous quarter - and just under this year's milestone target of 63 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The 2030 target is for 95 percent of patients to wait less than four months.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ said performance was "stable" compared with the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is encouraging in the context of increased ED presentations this quarter, which can often lead to cancellations of elective treatment to make way for acute cases, causing even longer wait times."</p>

            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said the government's focus on targets was "putting the brakes on the steep decline in delivery seen over the past five years".</p>
        
            <p>"Our health system is providing more care for more New Zealanders than ever before," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Between July and September, we saw improvements in faster cancer treatments and shorter waits for elective treatment, while wait times for specialist assessments stabilised.</p>
        
            <p>"Almost 4550 New Zealanders were treated for cancer in those three months, with just under 4000 of those Kiwis receiving their first treatment within a month.</p>
        
            <p>"The health system provided 87,890 elective treatments, including over 1500 knee replacements and more than 1700 hip replacements."</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged childhood immunisations and ED wait times "continue to be a challenge", although that was not unusual for winter.</p>
        
            <p>The government had invested $50 million in Māori health providers to deliver immunisations, he said, but more work was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"I am encouraged by the overall trend of these results and look forward to seeing more improvements in the coming year."</p>
