            <p>Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman has returned to New Zealand, having been accused of shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman had been away on a personal trip that had been planned months ago when allegations surfaced last week that she had shoplifted from Auckland clothing retailer Scotties Boutique before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The party confirmed last week she had stood down from all of her portfolio responsibilities until the matter had been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>Police later confirmed they were investigating reports of an incident on 23 December. They received the report the same day.</p>
        
            <p>Green co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson on Friday said the party had been aware of the accusation since 27 December, but had not made a statement at the time because the store did not want the matter made public and was happy to wait for Ghahraman to return.</p>
        
            <p>They also confirmed a second allegation of shoplifting had been made.</p>
        
            <p>Scotties Boutique has continually refused to comment when approached by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Police also had nothing to say about the second alleged incident.</p>
        
            <p>A Green Party spokesperson has confirmed to RNZ Ghahraman was back in New Zealand on Monday.</p>
