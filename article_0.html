            <p>Vanuatu has been experiencing aftershocks following Tuesday's large 7.3 magnitude quake, the ABC reports.</p>
        
            <p>People living in coastal areas were told to move to higher ground. Meanwhile, the extent of damage in the country is being assessed.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Thompson earlier told RNZ multiple buildings have come down, including some that have pancaked possibly still with people inside. Instructure in rural areas is said to be crippled.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in need of help in Port Vila," he says. The New Zealand High Commission is among buildings that have been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>He says most of the communications to Vanuatu have gone, and he is able to post due to Starlink. A journalist living in Vanuatu, Dan McGarry, says police have confirmed to him the quake has claimed at least one life.</p>
