        <h2>'Fully in shock': Passerby saves man at house fire that killed two</h2>
        <p>
Jonathan Asafo was on a morning daycare drop-off when he spotted flames and turned around.
</p>
        
            <p>Two people have died in a house fire in the Auckland suburb of Hillpark and a third has been seriously injured.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency said it received reports of a well-involved house fire in Freshney Place shortly before 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters had extinguished it by around 9.45am, but remained at the scene .</p>

            <p>Jonathan Asafo, who lives two minutes from the fire scene, was on his way to drop off his son in daycare.</p>
        
            <p>"And as I drove past, I saw the whole house on fire and then I quickly reversed back and seeing as noone was on the road and noone knew the house was on fire, I quickly ... drove up the driveway and I started tooting my horn and then calling, running around for any response."</p>
        
            <p>He saw a truck in the driveway, and with flames coming out of the house he ran to the neighbour's house and alerted them.</p>
        
            <p>A woman and four children emerged from that house.</p>
        
            <p>By the time he returned a survivor had made it onto the back lawn. He had been sleeping downstairs, Asafo said, but he feared for his two friends who had been sleeping upstairs.</p>
        
            <p>The young man was in shock, Asafo said, and the skin had burnt off his hands.</p>

            <p>He escaped the fire after hearing Asafo's horn.</p>
        
            <p>"He quickly went through the back door ...[he was] fully in shock."</p>
        
            <p>By the time Asafo was talking to him firefighters had arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Asafo did not know anyone living at the house.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just sad that we weren't able to do anything more to rescue the other two but I guess being able to help one victim is better than [nothing]."</p>

            <p>He was also worried for his three-year-old who was in the car in the driveway so moved his car away from the property.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said five crews and one command unit were sent to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Around 20 firefighters are at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The wooden two-storey home's windows have broken due to the force of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbour Lee Veo said she heard banging and glass breaking as the fire took hold.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounded like someone was bashing down walls, breaking glass ... so I looked out the window and the flames were really tall."</p>

            <p>Now she was waiting to find out the identity of the victims.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Daniel Newman, who has dealt with the family previously on stormwater issues, said the deaths were devastating.</p>
        
            <p>He said the family were engaged members of the community.</p>

            <p>Police have asked drivers to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>The road has been blocked off from traffic.</p>
