            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau is speaking to Midday Report ahead of an urgent council meeting after the government threatened to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown told media he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and thresholds to intervene in the city council.</p>
        
            <p>It came after the council voted last Thursday to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Former Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby told RNZ the systemic problems of trust between Wellington City Council's executive and its elected members mean it is "incredibly close" to needing intervention.</p>
