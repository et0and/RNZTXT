            <p>The Black Caps are one win away from ultimate glory in the ICC Champions Trophy, which they last lifted back in 2000.</p>
        
            <p>They have made it to the final despite a lot of travel back and forth between Pakistan and the UAE, while India's suspicious draw has seen them play all their games in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>Needless to say, the Black Caps will have a lot of support from the rest of the cricketing world in this one.</p>
        
            <p>Play starts at 10pm NZT.</p>
