            <p>A provider of school lunches has gone into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>The Libelle Group was contracted to deliver about 125,000 lunched a day to the major contractor Compass.</p>
        
            <p>Libelle's shareholders have appointed Deloitte as liquidators on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Liquidator David Webb said they were urgently talking to Compass to keep the service going, while they urgently review Libelle's position.</p>
        
            <p>The school lunch programme has been mired in controversy with complaints about inadequate and poorly prepared meals.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
