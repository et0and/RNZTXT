            <p>All Black coach Scott Robertson has recalled former skipper Sam Cane and reshuffled his backline after their shock 38-30 loss at Sky Stadium last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Cane comes into the match day 23 for the first time in 2024 and will have the opportunity to add to his 95 Test caps from the reserves.</p>
        
            <p>There are three changes in the backline where wings Caleb Clarke and Will Jordan start on the left and right wings respectively and Rieko Ioane reclaims the No.13 jersey.</p>
        
            <p>It will be Jordan's first start of the season after returning via the reserves against Argentina in Wellington from a shoulder injury that had kept him out of the first three Tests of the year. The 26-year-old will wear the No.14 jersey for the 26th time, while Clarke returns to the squad after a standout performance against Fiji in San Diego in July.</p>
        
            <p>Ioane switches back with Anton Lienert-Brown, who moves to the reserves alongside fellow demoted back Mark Tele'a.</p>
        
            <p>The starting forward pack has just one change with Tamaiti Williams gaining his third test start at loose head prop in place of Ethan de Groot, who is having a neck injury assessed.</p>
        
            <p>The side will again be led by Ardie Savea, with Dalton Papali'i and Ethan Blackadder completing the loose trio.</p>
        
            <p>"We've reflected deeply on our performance and our preparation individually and collectively is something we have all owned. Our intent and focus has shifted solely to Eden Park," Robertson said.</p>
