            <p>It was "pretty spectacular" to be part of such a magical hour for rowing, Ollie Maclean says.</p>
        
            <p>Maclean was a member of the men's coxless four team that took silver at the Vaires-sur-Marne course.</p>
        
            <p>Women's double sculls team Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won gold in their event, while the women's four took bronze.</p>
        
            <p>"Having the two mums lead that as well with the gold medal that was a huge confidence booster for us. To get the trifecta today is just incredible."</p>
        
            <p>It was daunting and added pressure to be the last race of the day, however, pressure helps him perform better, Maclean believes.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the men's and women's medal races in the skiff class were postponed due to light, shifty conditions in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand duo Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie are in bronze position heading into the double-points medal race. But with 12 points separating second to seventh, several crews are in with a shot of snatching a medal.</p>
