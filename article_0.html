            <p>The neighbour of a home in Miramar where someone was injured by an intruder says he heard raised voices and "bad language" outside the house in the early hours of Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a Wellington resident had been hurt in a fight with an intruder in their home, while a second person was found unconscious on a nearby street shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>Brian More, who lives next door, told RNZ he heard a fight and his wife rang the police.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard our neighbour actually shouting at someone in the back yard... and then basically some naughty language to get out the place in quite a rapid way. It went on for about two minutes."</p>
        
            <p>Police were also investigating a second incident, where half an hour later, a person was found unconscious and critically injured on a nearby street.</p>
        
            <p>"When it occurred we had a quick look around, and it looked okay, but the noise had gone away, so we didn't realise how serious it was at the time."</p>

            <p>Colin Ward, who lived at the same address, said he woke up to see police on the driveway with torches.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly a concern, because Miramar's a pretty quiet place really, and we don't have too much trouble around this area, but it's pretty serious."</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked for the public's help as they work out if the two overnight incidents are linked.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the Darlington Road home at 2am on Monday, where a resident had found an intruder inside.</p>
        
            <p>"One occupant received minor injuries following an altercation with the suspect, who fled before police arrived," Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch said.</p>
        
            <p>Three other residents at the address were unharmed.</p>

            <p>A police dog unit tracked the intruder north of the bus turnaround for several hundred metres until the trail was lost.</p>
        
            <p>About 30 minutes later, officers on patrol found a person unconscious and critically injured near the intersection of Camperdown Road and Totara Road.</p>
        
            <p>The victim was taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police officers, crime scene technicians and at least six police cars were at the scene on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said three large splatters of blood and several chalk circles were on the edge of the pavement on Camperdown Road.</p>
        
            <p>The left side of Camperdown Road is partially obstructed by a police cordon, but the road is still open.</p>

            <p>"We are making a number of enquiries into both of these incidents and are working to determine whether they are linked," Leitch said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be a visible police presence in the area while we carry out this work and speak with residents."</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone with information that may help their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Leith said it is possible the intruder had gone to other homes in the area.</p>

            <p>Police are asking that residents on upper Darlington Road (north of Camperdown Road), and residents near the intersection of Camperdown Road and Totara Road to report any unusual or suspicious activity overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also asking residents to check their sections and yards for any items that may have been stolen or discarded by the offender, described as a tall man of thin, athletic build, wearing a white cap," Leitch said.</p>
        
            <p>"Also of interest, is any CCTV that may assist the investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Police have called for anyone with information to call 105, referencing the case number 250317/6324.</p>
