            <p>Golfer Lydia Ko says her plan remains to retire within three years, before hitting 30, despite recent wins.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off an Olympic gold medal in Paris, Ko became the British Golf Open champion earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Her Olympic win was enough to win her a spot in the LPGA Hall of Fame, and the combined wins have seen her jump to number three in the latest world golf rankings.</p>
        
            <p>Ko, 27, told RNZ's First Up programme the past few weeks were like a dream but haven't changed her thoughts on retirement.</p>
        
            <p>"I know for a fact I'm probably never playing past 30. And you know what has happened in the last few weeks doesn't change the my I think timeline of things."</p>
        
            <p>The exact timing was an ongoing discussion with her family, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I still need to keep thinking more about (it) because it is a big one... I want to leave the game while I'm still playing well.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to leave it still feeling like maybe I could have done more and still with the love of the game."</p>

            <p>It was eight years since Ko last won a major. She said her life had changed a lot in that time.</p>
        
            <p>"I got married to an amazing person that, you know, now that I can call my husband. And and I'm a dog, mom. Just so you know, so many crazy things on and off the golf course."</p>
        
            <p>Ko said 2023 was her worst ever golf season and it was hard to come back from that low.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm definitely the type where I kind of sit on my feelings and all that and not always super vocal about, I guess about, you know what I'm going through, but my family has always been there for me, and especially my sister."</p>

            <p>And meeting her husband had helped to realise golf was only a part of her, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To know that golf doesn't complete me golf, it's just part of me, but that's not like me as a whole."</p>
        
            <p>But for now, there's still several months of golf left to see out this season.</p>
        
            <p>Then "hopefully" she'll get to make a trip home to New Zealand for a visit.</p>
