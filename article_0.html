            <p>Murder-accused former eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne sobbed loudly in court as his 111 call was played to jurors again.</p>
        
            <p>The jury in Polkinghorne's trial has had a delayed start to the morning on Thursday, before beginning their deliberations.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is on trial in the High Court at Auckland accused of murdering his wife, Pauline Hanna, and staging it as suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The defence argues Hanna took her own life.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday morning began with Justice Graham Lange clarifying a few points about injuries found on Hanna's body, and questions that weren't put to experts, including when they could have been made.</p>
        
            <p>Jurors had requested to listen to the 111 call Polkinghorne made after his wife's death, as well as a recording of Pauline Hanna taken by her niece before they begin their deliberations.</p>
        
            <p>The 111 call was played after a few false starts, but proceedings were disrupted again by Polkinghorne loudly sobbing from his seat in the courtroom, his head in his hands.</p>
        
            <p>He was excused briefly and jurors retired before listening to the second recording.</p>
        
            <p>The jury returned to the courtroom to listen to the recording taken by Hanna's neice Rose Hanna, in which Pauline Hanna described Polkinghorne as a sex fiend.</p>
        
            <p>In the recording, Pauline Hanna lamented her marriage to Polkinghorne, to her brother Bruce Hanna and her niece, but asserted that Polkinghorne loved her and she still loved him.</p>
