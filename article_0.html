            <p>An inmate at Auckland's Wiri prison has died after an assault in the facility's kitchen, the jail's operator says.</p>
        
            <p>A Serco spokesperson said in a statement a prisoner assaulted two other prisoners while working in the prison kitchen on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, one of the men who was assaulted has died. The police have notified his next of kin. A second prisoner remains in hospital being treated for non-life threatening injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"The perpetrator has been secured, segregated and will be transferred to another prison. Police are currently at the prison and are actively investigating.</p>
        
            <p>"Serco will ensure that all evidence, including CCTV footage, is provided to police. All deaths in custody are referred to the Coroner for investigation and determination of cause of death. Serco will also carry out a review."</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Warrick Adkin of Counties Manukau CIB said police were notified about 11.40am of a serious incident inside the prison.</p>
        
            <p>"One man was found unresponsive and was worked on by medical staff, but sadly he has died at the scene. Another man has been injured and transported to hospital in a serious condition."</p>
        
            <p>One person was assisting police with inquiries, Adkin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police remain at the site, and we will be working with the Department of Corrections as part of our investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Serco, which operates the prison, said staff and other prisoners were being provided with support.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland South Corrections Facility (Kohuora), also known as Wiri men's prison, is a high security prison. It holds up to 960 prisoners.</p>
        
            <p>Corrections Association president Floyd du Plessis said they were notified about the incident at 12.30pm and the site was in lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
