            <p>Parliament's speaker has now granted temporary Press Gallery accreditation to journalist Aaron Smale for Tuesday's apology for abuse in care. He must, however, be accompanied by a Newsroom reporter at all times.</p>
        
            <p>It follows significant backlash from survivors and advocates to the initial decision.</p>
