            <p>Police have confirmed they received a report about a Ponsonby store from two days before Christmas, after a Green MP stood aside from portfolios over accusations of shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party on Wednesday confirmed MP Golriz Ghahraman had stood down from her portfolios, after being accused of shoplifting from upmarket clothing store Scottie's Boutique in Ponsonby.</p>
        
            <p>A worker at the store told RNZ they were scheduled to speak with police again on Thursday, after the accusations surfaced the previous day.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed an incident was believed to have taken place on the 23rd.</p>
        
            <p>"Police can confirm a report was received about an incident at a Ponsonby retailer on 23 December 2023," the spokesperson said. "Initial enquiries are still being made into this report and Police are not able to comment further at this stage".</p>
        
            <p>Police clarified they received the report on the same day. They said they were unable to confirm, deny or comment on whether a named individual was under investigation, however.</p>

            <p>The Green Party statement on Wednesday said they were in contact with the store, but would not be commenting further.</p>
        
            <p>"The Green Party is aware of allegations regarding MP Golriz Ghahraman and is in contact with Scotties Boutique to better understand and address them," a spokesperson for the party said.</p>
        
            <p>"Green MPs are expected to maintain high standards of public behaviour. Ms Ghahraman will stand aside from all portfolio responsibilities until the matter is resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"The Green Party and Ms Ghahraman will not comment further at this time."</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman was the party's spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Trade, Women, Justice, Refugees, Defence, Human Rights, Ethnic Communities, Democracy and the electoral system, and the Government Response to the March 15 Attack.</p>
        
            <p>She was ranked 7th on the party's list at the 2023 election.</p>
