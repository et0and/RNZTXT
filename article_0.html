            <p>Wind gusts have reached more than 140km/h in exposed parts of Canterbury and some flights in and out of Wellington have been affected as a cold snap brings heavy rain and gales to many parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport spokesperson Phil Rennie said a number of flights had also been cancelled at Wellington Airport due to bad weather at other destination airports.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has placed much of the upper South Island and lower North Island under heavy rain, strong wind or thunderstorm warnings.</p>
        
            <p>Follow the RNZ liveblog:</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told RNZ the strongest gusts so far had been recorded at Aoraki Mount Cook, while the heaviest rainfall had been seen in Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty to even 40mm of rain in one hour - and that is mostly at the top of the South Island, especially in more mountainous areas. So quite a lot of rain to fall in such a short space of time."</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said conditions were now easing in the South Island, but they were set to intensify through the central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService earlier said a trough would bring unsettled weather to western parts of both islands, followed by heavy showers and thunderstorms across southern and central New Zealand.</p>
