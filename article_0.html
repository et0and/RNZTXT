            <p>MetService is warning the long weekend may finish with thunderstorms in parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Poor weather conditions over the weekend have settled, with only scattered showers expected on Sunday, predominantly in western areas.</p>
        
            <p>But MetService meteorologist Alec Holden said in the North Island, thunderstorms are expected to stretch from southern Manawatū down to northern Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile in the South Island, Holden said afternoon thunderstorms are expected for north Otago and parts of Canterbury High Country.</p>
        
            <p>"Stretching down from southern Manawatū down to northern Wellington, and then over looking at the South Island, a similar sort of story of afternoon thunderstorms for northern Otago and the northern parts of the Canterbury High Country … Hanmer Springs."</p>
        
            <p>There were no official weather warnings or watches in place.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said snow around Aoraki/Mount Cook saw temperatures in the region drop to -3.9C on Monday morning.</p>
