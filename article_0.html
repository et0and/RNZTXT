            <p>Hundreds of people have begun their walk from Petone to Wellington city as part of the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd is being led by kairākau - men with rākau - and is making its way along Petone esplanade toward State Highway 2. There have been karakia, waiata and haka ringing out.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter says it's a positive vibe, and marshalls are doing their best to keep people to footpaths.</p>
        
            <p>When they hit State Highway 2, people will be on the walkway and cars will drive slowly on the motorway alongside.</p>
        
            <p>Māori Queen Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po will join the hīkoi's final stage to Parliament, where tens of thousands are expected to congregate.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill architect, ACT leader David Seymour, says he supports the right to protest, but thinks participants are misguided and have a range of different grievances.</p>
