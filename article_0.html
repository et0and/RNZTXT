            <p>Kiwi sailors Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson have claimed bronze medals in a late upset in the mixed multihull Nacra race in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>They were trailing the UK team on points, but gained a place after the British sailors were taken out of the race due to a false start, and came in for third.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Thursday night, the men's kayak fours crew squeaked a spot in the Olympic final after coming fourth in their semifinal in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>There were just five boats in their race, and they needed to place in the top four to progress.</p>
        
            <p>And speed climber Julian David has just been eliminated in the men's speed climbing quarterfinal after taking on the world record-holder, Sam Watson of the US.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lydia Ko is continuing her campaign at Le Golf National in the second round of the women's individual golf. Earlier, she moved up the leaderboard and tied for third after scoring another birdie.</p>
        
            <p>Maddi Wesche is also through to the Olympics shot put final after throwing 19.25m on her second attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Later, Dame Lisa Carrington and her women's kayak fours crew will take to the water for their final. Carrington, Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan flew through their heat and are the ones to beat in this final, at 11.40pm.</p>
