        <h2>'Cyberstalking damaged my reputation, relationships and opportunities' - councillor</h2>
        <p>
"I had no recourse for this, and it has been a major reason for my decision to step down from my current position," says a South Auckland councillor who has endured cyberstalking.

            <p>A South Auckland councillor who has endured cyberstalking is calling for proposed legislation aimed at tackling stalking and digital harassment to be prioritised.</p>
        
            <p>Angela Dalton spoke about the personal toll that cyberstalking had on her as a community leader.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past year, I have been subjected to cyberstalking, which has damaged my reputation, relationships, and opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I had no recourse for this, and it has been a major reason for my decision to step down from my current position."</p>
        
            <p>The councillor, who represents the Manurewa-Papakura ward, said she supports the Bill and urges the Law and Public Safety Committee to prioritise its passage.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) has also voiced its support for the Crimes Legislation (Stalking and Harassment) Amendment Bill.</p>
        
            <p>LGNZ - which represents councils around the country - emphasised its importance in safeguarding elected officials and the broader public from the rising tide of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>The Bill, introduced in late 2024, aims to criminalise stalking behaviours explicitly.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions on the proposed law change are under review by the Justice Committee, and Dalton presented her views to the committee earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>"The Bill's proposal to expand the legal definition of stalking and harassment is long overdue," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She says social media, texting, and other digital communication methods have provided stalkers with new ways to invade the privacy and well-being of their victims - affecting younger, vulnerable individuals as some</p>
        
            <p>parents relax age restrictions on social media use.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton emphasises the Bill's broader definition of stalking, which includes repeated surveillance, unwanted contact, and digital harassment. The legal change will better protect individuals facing such threats, who are often left vulnerable due to outdated laws.</p>
        
            <p>She highlights the urgency of protecting at-risk groups, particularly women, children, and marginalised communities, who are statistically more likely to experience stalking and harassment.</p>
        
            <p>Studies show that stalking frequently leads to physical violence. A 2019 report from Women's Refuge revealed that 39 percent of stalking cases involving ex-partners resulted in physical violence.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2024, the Family Violence Death Review Committee reported that stalking behaviours were involved in all 12 intimate partner violence and child abuse homicides between January 2020 and June 2024.</p>
        
            <p>A study from 2015 found that 87 percent of New Zealand politicians experienced harassment, including disturbing messages and physical threats.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton references the tragic case of Farzana Yaaqubi, an Auckland woman murdered by her stalker in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"By strengthening the laws surrounding stalking and harassment, the Bill will provide crucial support to these groups and help reduce the risk of further harm," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The extension of legal protection to those who face cyberstalking, in particular, will allow victims to seek legal recourse without having to prove direct physical contact with the offender, which can often be difficult in the digital realm."</p>
        
            <p>LGNZ is also backing the proposed law change, stating that the anti-stalking legislation will help protect individuals from stalking and harassment, ensuring that local government environments remain safe.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Susan Freeman-Greene said the legislation is critical for a functioning democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the stories I hear of abuse and harassment are truly shocking - and it's not just the elected members, it's their families who endure it too. Everyone should be able to go to work and feel safe, and I know that's not happening in local government right now," Freeman-Greene said.</p>
        
            <p>A 2022 LGNZ survey revealed that 43 percent of elected members experienced harassment, prejudice, or threatening behaviours. Half of them faced harassment in their communities, and a third encountered abuse while shopping or picking up children from school.</p>
        
            <p>A survey conducted last year among council mayors, chairs, and chief executives showed that nearly two-thirds had faced aggressive and abusive online behaviour while 74 percent had experienced such behaviour during public meetings.</p>
        
            <p>In celebration of International Women's Day, Freeman-Greene participated in Auckland Council's 'Empowering Women in Government' panel last weekend, highlighting LGNZ's concerns over the growing abuse faced by women in local government.</p>
        
            <p>After the 2022 local elections, women comprised nearly 40 percent of elected members, with the number of female mayors increasing to 23 (34 percent), up from 27 percent in the previous term.</p>
        
            <p>"Evidence shows that women elected members are significantly more likely than their male colleagues to experience gendered abuse, sexualised comments, threats to their family, and threats of sexual violence," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It also recognises that aggressive and abusive behaviours can represent stalking or serve as an early indicator of it.</p>
        
            <p>She said New Zealand needs more measures to manage these behaviours, "so we are pleased that the government is taking action.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to keep people in public office safe, and it's especially important in an election year that people who are considering standing can feel confident about the safety of local democracy," Freeman-Greene said.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton, who is also a member of the National Council of Women NZ (NCWNZ), supports their appeal for comprehensive and victim-focussed stalking legislation. She wants it included in The Crimes Act.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton also advocates for raising penalties for stalking and harassment, stressing the importance of stronger deterrents.</p>
        
            <p>She said the clarity of the legislation will send a clear message that such actions, regardless of the offender's status, will not be accepted, reinforcing societal standards of respect, dignity, and safety.</p>
        
            <p>"This Bill is an essential step forward in creating a safer, more just society. It addresses critical gaps in our legal system and ensures that individuals facing stalking and harassment can access the support and protection they need."</p>
