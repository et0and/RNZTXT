            <p>The Black Caps have broken a 36-year drought by beating India by eight wickets in the first cricket test in Bengaluru.</p>
        
            <p>Needing 107 runs on the final day, New Zealand reached their target just before lunch a short time ago for the loss of two wickets.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand have only beaten India twice before on Indian soil, with the most recent occasion being 1988.</p>
        
            <p>First innings centurion Rachin Ravindra was unbeaten on 39 and Will Young reached 48, with the pair putting on an unbeaten 75 runs for the third wicket following the early loss of openers Tom Latham and Devon Conway.</p>
        
            <p>Victory was set up on the first day's play, when India were skittled for 46 - the lowest innings total by any team against New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>More to come. </p>
