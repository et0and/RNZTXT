            <p>Freyberg High School says the behaviour of some of its students after a protest while associate education minister David Seymour was visiting was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, a student spat on the ground in front of the ACT leader during his visit to the school in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>A video shared online showed students performing the haka Ka Mate as he came outside.</p>
        
            <p>At the conclusion of the haka, a student holding a tino rangatiratanga flag approached Seymour and spat at the ground by his feet.</p>
        
            <p>In another video, students could be heard screaming "f... you".</p>
        
            <p>School staff could be seen creating a human barrier between the students and Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Graeme Williams said in a statement that some students' behaviour at the end of their protest was "totally unacceptable and contrary to the values and the high standards we hold ourselves to".</p>
        
            <p>"Upholding the mana of our young people recognises the reality of their world but also that we must respect and uphold the dignity of each other and all guests at our kura/school.</p>
        
            <p>"The matter will be managed appropriately through our disciplinary process."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has come under fire in recent weeks for his plan to review the Ka Ora, Ka Ako programme, which provides free lunches to more than 220,000 students throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>According to its website, Freyberg has been a part of the programme since October 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour also faced opposition at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds this year, with the biggest challenge being lain down for him during the p≈çwhiri.</p>
        
            <p>The other politicians were only greeted by one kaiwero (warrior), but Seymour had to face a group.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour was also heckled by spectators while giving his speech at Waitangi, with some calling on him to sit down.</p>
