            <p>The Sydney to Hobart yacht race has suffered a double tragedy after two sailors died in separate incidents.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Police said a crew member of one Sydney to Hobart entry was struck by a sail boom just before midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow crew members performed CPR but they could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>About two hours later, a crew member of another yacht was also struck by a sail boom, and died.</p>
        
            <p>Police have not released the name of the yachts involved.</p>
        
            <p>Seven boats have now retired, including race favourite, Master Lock Comanche, which has pulled out due to main sail damage.</p>
        
            <p>The super maxi, which is the race record holder, and has claimed line honours four times, was leading the race off the far south coast of New South Wales, when she announced she was pulling out.</p>
        
            <p>LawConnect, which won line honours last year by just 51 seconds from Comanche, is currently race leader.</p>
