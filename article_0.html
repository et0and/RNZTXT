            <p>Wellington councils which take more water than they are allowed under their resource consents could be penalised in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water is preparing for an acute water shortage in the capital this summer.</p>
        
            <p>If the region reaches that level, it is likely they will have to take more water than allocated in their resource consents.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council chair Daran Ponter has written to councils warning that breaching those conditions falls short of their duty under the law.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said the situation was untenable for the regional council as both a regulator and bulk water supplier - so it needed to consider all options to protect water sources and supplying the region's cities.</p>
        
            <p>One of these options was charging councils for breaching their water allocations.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Regional Water Board Act 1972 gives the regional council power to set allocation limits and impose surcharges on their four councils - Upper Hutt City Council, Hutt City Council, Wellington City Council and Porirua City Council.</p>
        
            <p>To enact the changes - which have never been implemented before - they need to consult with the councils on the allocations and the amount of the surcharge.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said he would discuss the need for the changes and whether to start implementing them in the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>The letter also detailed the regional council's position for the need to implement universal water metering.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Wellington Water Committee Meeting indicated there was varying support to install smart metering among councils, he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"This situation does not reflect the Water Shortage Summit agreement that we plan for all three measures to address our projected water shortage - fixing leaks, universal water metering and increasing supply.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge the fiscal constraints you face but generally it seems your councils are relegating our shared resolution behind other priorities."</p>
        
            <p>Ponter has asked the city councils to communicate their intentions to formally consult with their communities on water metering as part of their Long-Term Plans and their initial comments on imposing surcharges before 31 January.</p>
