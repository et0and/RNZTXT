            <p>The economy was in a deeper than expected recession in the middle of the year with widespread contraction across many sectors.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data shows gross domestic product, the broad measure of economic growth, fell 1 percent in the three months ended September, to be 1.5 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Significant revisions to previous figures resulted in a fall of 1.1 percent in the June quarter, meeting the definition of technical recession.</p>
        
            <p>These were the biggest quarterly falls since late 2021 at the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, but excluding those the six monthly fall was the largest since mid-1991.</p>
        
            <p>However, previous negative readings for 2022/23 have largely disappeared.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said extra data had shown a different performance of the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"The data incorporated this year shows stronger growth over the last year, followed by two significant falls in the latest quarters," spokesperson Jason Attewell said.</p>
        
            <p>The big falls in the June and September quarters were the biggest quarterly drops since late 2021 at the height of the pandemic and lockdowns.</p>
        
            <p>But excluding those the six-monthly fall was the largest since mid-1991.</p>
        
            <p>The main contributors to the latest contraction were a 2.6 percent fall in manufacturing, 3.7 percent in electricity and gas, 2.8 percent drop in construction, and 1.1 percent decline in retail.</p>
        
            <p>The fall in manufacturing in part reflected the energy crunch in mid-winter which forced some businesses to reduce or halt production.</p>
        
            <p>The growth spots were agriculture on the back of the strong dairy production, information and technology, and rental and real estate industries.</p>
        
            <p>Individual shares of the economy shrank again, by 1.2 percent during the quarter, the eighth consecutive quarterly fall.</p>
        
            <p>The latest GDP reading is expected to be the low point of the recent economic cycle, with falling interest rates expected to give a spark to household spending and business investment.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts are for tepid but positive growth from the end of this year picking up pace in the second half of next year to average 2-3 percent over the next few years.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's economic activity was the weakest of all its major trading partners.</p>
