            <p>A West Auckland councillor says the government's proposed pothole prevention fund isn't worth the cost to public transport.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the government unveiled its $20 billion draft plan for transport, promising more than a dozen new highways and a new fund to fix potholes.</p>
        
            <p>But the cost of petrol and annual car registration will go up to help pay for the policies, prompting outrage from Opposition parties.</p>
        
            <p>The draft plan also includes a pothole fund of $500 million and a reduction in public transport funding of more than $1 billion over the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>WaitƒÅkere Ward councillor Shane Henderson said people who drive over potholes every day were understandably angry but fixing them should not come at the expense of public transport.</p>
