            <p>Former politician Dame Tariana Turia has died.</p>
        
            <p>The founder and former co-leader of Te Pāti Māori suffered a stroke earlier this week and was said not to have long left.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ranga Tupua said in a post on Facebook that she had passed away early on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"A mother of six; grandmother; and great-grandmother of over 80 mokopuna, Kahurangi (Dame) Tariana will be remembered for spearheading a movement of transformation inspired by her belief in whānau being able to define their own solutions," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Her introduction of Whānau Ora in 2002 was instrumental in changing how the state interacted with Māori, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kahurangi Tariana championed the drive for self-determination; becoming co-leader of the Māori Party in 2004 after she famously 'crossed the floor' to vote against the Foreshore and Seabed Bill."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana served as a member of parliament for 18 years, initially as a list MP for Labour, then in the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate.</p>
        
            <p>She left Labour in 2004 and returned to parliament after winning a by-election for Te Pāti Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"The loss of her beloved husband, George, in April 2019 took a significant toll on Dame Tariana, as has her declining health over the last two years.</p>
        
            <p>"It was her heartfelt wish to return home to lie in the house of Rangitāhuahua; her last days surrounded with the laughter of mokopuna, the waiata of her whānau; the karakia and kōrero that had always given her comfort."</p>
        
            <p>Friday and Saturday would be a time for her whānau and iwi to gather at Putiki Marae and in Whangaehu.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday and Monday, others were welcome to visit and pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Tariana's nehu would be held on Tuesday 7 January.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon paid tribute to Dame Tariana on social media.</p>
        
            <p>She had made a significant contribution for Māori and to New Zealand as an MP, minister and political leader, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Among many things, she will be remembered for her work establishing Whānau Ora, and for always being guided strongly by her principles.</p>
        
            <p>"My thoughts and condolences are with her whanau. Moe mai rā."</p>

            <p>Te Pāti Māori said it was a sad day for te iwi Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"Whāea Tariana crossed the floor against all odds and what was popular, to ensure our people's voice would never be silenced, exterminated or assimilated. Her legacy will forever be etched in the fabric of our nations history," a post on Instagram said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is the absolute epitome of strength and steadfast determination and leadership our people needed at a time of great uncertainty. She gave us hope and courage to believe in ourselves to determine our own future."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Dame Tariana was as true leader who left a strong legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"Through her life, Dame Tariana gave a loud voice to those who were historically and wrongly heard less, particularly those in the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins called Dame Tariana a "driving force" in the Labour Party in the mid-90s and referenced the creation of Whānau Ora.</p>
        
            <p>"The Labour Party sends condolences to Dame Tariana's many whanau. May she rest now, with her loving husband George."</p>
