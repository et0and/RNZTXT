            <p>Three men have been charged with homicide after the death of a New Zealand woman outside a shopping centre in California yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was hit by a car and killed during a robbery in Newport Beach on Tuesday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>Newport Beach police have named the woman as Patricia McKay, 68.</p>
        
            <p>McKay was killed outside the Fashion Island shopping centre at about 3.30pm. US media are reporting she was with her husband.</p>

            <p>RNZ's correspondent in California Ira Spitzer told Morning Report it was an "upscale" shopping centre in an Orange County town about an hour away from downtown Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>"It is typically a relatively safe place, not somewhere where people would be scared to walk around in a shopping centre."</p>
        
            <p>California had seen an increase in car break-ins, car jackings and armed robberies in recent times, Spitzer said.</p>
        
            <p>He said McKay's death was likely to reignite debate about recent law changes to lower the consequences for those stealing goods worth less than US$900.</p>

            <p>Local man Jim Shab told CBS News it was a nice shopping area in a generally calm area.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of wealth in this area so I guess people come where the wealth is."</p>
        
            <p>Newport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill said McKay's death was a heartbreaking tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"We're mourning the loss of someone today, a loss that never should have happened. Frankly, the hell with these guys, they came into our city knowing the were going to commit a crime and a woman is dead because of it.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Newport Beach Police Department said two people, one armed with a gun, attempted to rob McKay and another person near Santa Rosa and Newport Centre drives.</p>
        
            <p>"During the robbery, one suspect fired a handgun three times, though no one was struck by gunfire."</p>
        
            <p>McKay was hit by a car being driven by a third suspect.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim tragically died at the scene," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Newport Beach Police Public Information Officer Steve Oberon said McKay was pulled into the street and that was where she was hit by the car.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a struggle and they were attempting to rob them.</p>
        
            <p>"When the vehicle fled the scene, struck the female, in the street."</p>
        
            <p>The three men left in the white sedan and a police chase on the freeway ensued.</p>
        
            <p>The three, all Californians, eventually fled on foot and were arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Leroyernest McCrary, 26, Jaden Cunningham, 18, and Malachi Darnell, 18, were charged with homicide, robbery with a firearm and criminal conspiracy.</p>
        
            <p>Newport Beach police said they were continuing to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand consular officials say they are providing assistance to the family of Patricia McKay.</p>
        
            <p>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) spokesperson said officials were in contact with the family but were could not provide any more information for privacy reasons.</p>
