            <p>Officers will be patrolling Franklin Road in Ponsonby and moving on vendors who are not meant to be there, Auckland Council says.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Franklin Road in Ponsonby have complained after hawkers selling food, inflatable toys, and light-up accessories refused to leave when asked.</p>
        
            <p>For 30 years those who call Franklin Road home have decked out their properties with Christmas decorations for the rest of the city to enjoy.</p>
        
            <p>But they were fed up with street vendors who they said are ruining the tradition.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's compliance manager Adrian Wilson said he "could understand the frustration" of the residents over the illegal vendors.</p>
        
            <p>The council became aware of the issue on Franklin Road a couple of days ago and officers were out in the area yesterday evening.</p>
        
            <p>"We had two officers visit the site and they found various people trying to sell balloons, I think there was a Cookie Time seller as well and we advised them to move on," said Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be continuing those proactive patrols over the next few nights as well."</p>

            <p>Those wanting to sell on streets needed to apply for permits from council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said council had not issued any permits for selling products on Franklin Road.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very busy with people going up and down at that time so we haven't issued any permits for people to trade in that area," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson warned those who still wanted to flout the rules that there would be consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll issue them with, what's called a bylaw notice and that basically tells them to stop doing what they're doing ... they're given an opportunity to do that.</p>
        
            <p>"If they fail to do that we have the ability to seize their goods ... and then there's a charge to have those goods returned."</p>
        
            <p>Big events, whether it was a concert or a sports game, always attracts vendors wanting to sell their wares, said Wilson.</p>
        
            <p>While it was "not the most serious offence in the world", there were valid reasons why permits were necessary, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We try to encourage people to go through the proper process so that it can be managed properly and we haven't got people obstructing the footpaths."</p>
