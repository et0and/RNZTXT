            <p>A former meth addict says she was triggered after her son and younger brother accidentally tried methamphetamine disguised as lollies.</p>
        
            <p>Blocks of methamphetamine, wrapped and labelled as pineapple lollies, were unknowingly handed out in Auckland City Mission food parcels.</p>

            <p>When Sarita Kaukau picked up her food parcel on Tuesday, she did not think about checking the apparent lollies that came with it.</p>
        
            <p>She said by the time she found out they were methamphetamine, her younger brother and son had already tasted them, and thrown them away.</p>
        
            <p>"[Her brother] said it tasted like poison," Kaukau said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then I said 'what did you with it', and I told my friend, she searched it all up on Google and said that we had to call the police, so I called the police straight away."</p>
        
            <p>The former addict is four-and-a half years sober and said the experience was triggering.</p>
        
            <p>"I went to taste it to see if it was a lolly, and it wasn't a lolly, it was definitely methamphetamine."</p>
        
            <p>Kaukau believed the strong taste was why kids had not swallowed the fake sweets.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty much so potent that you cannot even consume to swallow it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's how it's so lucky that no kids have consumed it, because it is such a strong drug, and it is pure, there is no lolly at all."</p>
        
            <p>In Manukau, community leader Dave Letele - who ran his own foodbank - said it was difficult to check food for illicit substances when they were pre-packaged.</p>
        
            <p>"It's almost impossible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We purchase most of our food, and the stuff that gets donated is from corporates, so you wouldn't think, if it's coming in a pre-made package, that you have to check it for drugs."</p>
        
            <p>Letele said while they've had trouble in the past, a situation like this was unheard of.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had our food bank robbed, we've had people take food and then on-sell it to dairies and things like this, but I've never heard of something like this happen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just crazy."</p>
        
            <p>The drugs were packaged to look like Malaysian company Rinda Food Industries lollies.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, general manager Steven Teh said they were aware of the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It has come to our attention through recent news reports in New Zealand that our products may have been misused in connection with illegal substances, specifically methamphetamine."</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make it clear that Rinda Food does not use or condone the use of any illegal drugs in our products," Teh said.</p>
        
            <p>He said they would work with New Zealand police to address the issue and protect the integrity of their brand.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognize the seriousness of this situation and understand the concerns it raises.</p>
        
            <p>"Our company is dedicated to ensuring that our products meet the highest safety and regulatory standards."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the drugs presented a massive risk to the public and they were treating the matter extremely seriously.</p>
        
            <p>They would collect all fake lollies that are found and reported to them.</p>
