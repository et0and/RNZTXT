            <p>The Ministry of Health has apologised to Associate Health Minister Casey Costello for failing to inform her that one of its officials had a conflict of interest.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after NZ First leader Winston Peters used Parliamentary privilege to accuse the official of attending meetings with Costello and advising her on tobacco reform, without telling her she was the sister-in-law of Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
