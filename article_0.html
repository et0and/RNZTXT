        <h2>The ingenious NZ-designed hijab breaking ground overseas</h2>
        <p>
Zeena Ali asked if she could wear her hijab as part of her NZ police uniform. The response was, "What's that?"

            <p>A New Zealand-designed hijab, created after the 2019 Christchurch terror attacks, is breaking ground with its slick design deemed suitable for emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>The hijab - which Massey University fashion designer Deb Cumming and fashion educator Nina Weaver spent 16 months creating for NZ Police, - has been adopted by Australia's Queensland Police, is being explored by Victoria's Police, and in trial stages by NZ Corrections staff.</p>
        
            <p>It's designed to be breathable and antibacterial, with a moisture-wicking sports fabric.</p>
        
            <p>
Designers Deb Cumming and Nina Weaver say they had to consider a contoured fit so there was no excess drape that could be grabbed from anywhere.

            <p>Hato Hone St John and Wellington Free Ambulance have also put in orders for their frontline staff, and Corrections have been supplied some for prisoners too, the designers say.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just been really excited that there have been so many people that have been interested in this," Cumming said. "It's just fantastic to think that we have created a product that is representing greater inclusivity and cultural diversity."</p>
        
            <p>"Very few organisations had recognised that there was a need and have acted on that need. I think it's well overdue," Weaver added.</p>
        
            <p>Safety was essential - NZ Police couldn't find a design from overseas that met their criteria, the designers said.</p>
        
            <p>There were elements the designers never had to consider before: an easy release closure system at the neck, removing excess drape that a hijab typically has, and a style that worked with the rest of the officers' uniform, including communication devices.</p>
        
            <p>Magnets and velcro were used as a safer alternative to pins, which are commonly used by Muslim women to keep a hijab stable, and a contoured fit was achieved with seams and panels around the curves of the head and neck.</p>

            <p>Constable Zeena Ali, 35, was the first to trial the design after seeking approval to, one once she graduated from the Unitec Pre-Police Course in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"I was standing in front of [the course staff member], with a hijab on my head, and this is after hajj (a religious pilgrimage to Mecca), and I said, 'I've just come back from the pilgrimage and I'm wanting to wear a hijab,' and he looked at me and he said, 'What's that?'"</p>
        
            <p>She explained to a recruitment officer the traditional head covering, which is worn by some Muslim women for modesty.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [the recruitment officer] became a celebrity in his own office because he just started getting all these emails, these phone calls like, 'Who is this person? We've actually been working to get a hijab in place, we just wanted someone to come in and trial it.'"</p>
        
            <p>After 30 different samples were trailed and researched, as well as carrying out consultations with Muslim women. A final version was formally approved as an elective item of police uniform in November 2020.</p>

            <p>Three years later, across the Tasman, Queensland Police were looking for a uniform hijab after liaison officer Aulia Ibrahim joined the South Brisbane District force.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old said she had been using her own hijab, but sought an official one because of the trouble of trying to match the colour with her uniform every day.</p>
        
            <p>That's when she heard about Ali - New Zealand's first and only sworn officer wearing an approved hijab - and managed to secure a sample of the hijab via her department. It happened to match the colour of the Queensland Police's uniform.</p>
        
            <p>"The next day, I was set, I didn't have to think about what I need to wear every morning anymore," Ibrahim said.</p>
        
            <p>"I love it, especially because we live in Queensland, it's really hot, [but the hijab is] breathable so it doesn't really get as hot. But I still get asked the questions [like 'aren't you hot?', but I'm like no, it's breathable and I'm like, trying to sell it basically to people who don't wear it."</p>
        
            <p>When she speaks at schools, young Muslim girls surround her in surprise and awe, Ibrahim said.</p>
        
            <p>"They love it because I talk about how it's made and the magnetic [button]. Everyone loves the magnets - obsessed with the magnets. I have a friend who's trying to get one of my hijabs off of me. I'm like, 'I'm not sharing, honey. It's for work'."</p>

            <p>Ali said while there was still room to improve the hijab design, she was happy to see Muslim policewomen had suitable attire to go to work safely.</p>
        
            <p>Ibrahim said younger generations need to see themselves represented to understand they aren't limited in career options.</p>
        
            <p>The hijab design was named as one of the top 50 most influential projects in 2021 by New York's Project Management Institute and awarded the Tahunui-a-Rangi award by the Royal Society Te Apārangi in 2022.</p>
