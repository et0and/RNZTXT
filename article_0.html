        <h2>Watch live: Luxon faces questions at weekly briefing</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister is expected to face questions about the country's new tourism slogan, Brian Tamaki's latest protest and big resignations in the health sector.
</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced a $30 million spend on tourism, infrastructure and biodiversity projects.</p>
        
            <p>Conservation Minister Tama Potaka, alongside Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, made the announcement at the post-Cabinet brief on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It includes $11m spent to improve popular visitor sites and further $19m towards biodiversity efforts.</p>
        
            <p>The $11m tourism funding would go towards:</p>
        
            <p>The $19m biodiversity funding would go towards:</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said the spending came from the government's International Visitor Levy which is paid for by tourists entering the country, from the funds raised before the government increased the cost from $35 per tourist to $100.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the announcement on Sunday of a further $500,000 spent on an ad campaign for attracting Australian tourists during the off-peak "shoulder season".</p>
        
            <p>Labour and the Greens supported tourism growth at the time but said there should instead be more funding for tourism infrastructure, which was already struggling to cope with demand in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>The "Everyone Must Go" slogan also faced criticism and mockery from the parties as well as as well as the public.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Luxon is also facing questions about health officials, golden visas and the country's new tourism logo as he fronts after a meeting of the government's top ministers.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will be hosting his regular post-Cabinet brief about 4pm on Monday. We'll be livestreaming the press conference.</p>
        
            <p>He is joined by Potaka.</p>
        
            <p>Topics of conversation are likely to include the actions of a group associated with Destiny Church who protested a children's event at the Te Atatū library on Saturday, the country's new tourism slogan, the new visas, senior officials quitting the public health service and more.</p>
