            <p>The prime minister has faced questions over NZDF deployments, Gaza, and relationships with Māori at the first Cabinet meeting of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting took place as the clock ticks on the government's first 100 days in office.</p>
        
            <p>It still has several policies from its 100-day plan to roll out, including stopping all work on He Pua Pua and repealing the controversial Three Waters reforms.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon confirmed in Christchurch last week the government had until 8 March to tick off all 49 policies listed.</p>
        
            <p>The year has also started with controversy surrounding the government's approach to Māori policies.</p>
        
            <p>Today Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer told RNZ the government was displaying "all the traits of typical white supremacists".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Luxon said her characterisation was "ridiculous, baseless and we absolutely reject it".</p>
