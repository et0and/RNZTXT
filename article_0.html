        <h2>Watch live: Ministers reveal plans after call for banking overhaul</h2>
        <p>
The Commerce Commission has called for Kiwibank and open banking to be boosted in a long-awaited report on the sector.
</p>
        
            <p>Government ministers are set to reveal how they'll respond to a major report calling for changes in the banking sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission report on personal banking found there was little competition in the sector, with the dominant big four Australian-owned banks making high profits, while Reserve Bank's rules make it difficult for smaller banks and new entrants to challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank needed to be strengthened and open banking must be brought in to bring more competition to the bank sector, the report found.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly are set to speak from the beehive from about 11.30am.</p>
