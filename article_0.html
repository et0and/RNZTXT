            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill will be changed to include hapū and iwi, but the Prime Minister says no changes will get National to support it.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet discussed the controversial legislation on Monday with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying ACT's David Seymour would have more to say on it soon.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after nearly 450 Christian leaders have signed an open letter calling on MPs to vote down the Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The final version will be considered again by Cabinet before it is introduced to Parliament in November.</p>
