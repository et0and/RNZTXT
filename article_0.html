            <p>The Bluebridge ferry Connemara has arrived back in Wellington, about five and a-half hours after it lost power and started drifting in Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Harbourmaster Grant Nalder says it blacked out around 10.30pm, not long into its freight sailing bound for Picton, near Sinclair Head.</p>
        
            <p>By 2am Friday, the tug boat Tapuhi was towing Connemara back to Wellington, and a second tug, Tiaki, was providing steerage.</p>
        
            <p>By 6am it was towed to Pipitea Wharf but all people remained on board.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said Connemara had 88 people on board, and although the situation was not a rescue, Maritime New Zealand and the Rescue Co-ordination Centre had been keeping an eye on them.</p>
        
            <p>Both the privately owned Bluebridge and the state-owned Interislander have had engine failures in their ferries this year.</p>

            <p>In May, passengers on board a different Bluebridge ferry, Strait Feronia, were briefly plunged into darkness when their ship lost power coming into Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, the Connemara hit a wharf while it was leaving Wellington, causing a "decent dent" on the hull and a "very small hole" above the waterline, Nalder said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel returned to port and passengers were able to disembark safely.</p>
        
            <p>The Connemara underwent repairs and was back in service later that day.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander ferries have also been plagued by issues in recent months - most notably the grounding of the Aratere near Picton in June.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry, which was on a crew-only sailing, ran aground after a staff member mistakenly changed its course.</p>
