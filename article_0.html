            <p>Posties in Wellington have refused once to deliver pamphlets containing misinformation about the council and Islamic calls to prayer, but the leaflets could be hitting mailboxes today.</p>
        
            <p>Written by political campaign group Better Wellington, they contain claims about wasteful council spending, city-wide speed limits, and the assertion that the council "wants the city's six mosques to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer across the city".</p>
        
            <p>Postal Workers Union co-national president John Maynard said he visited three branches in Wellington on Monday morning, and posties told him they did not feel comfortable delivering the pamphlet.</p>
        
            <p>It would do harm to community relationships, and it went against NZ Post's mandate to "be an organisation that exhibits a sense of social responsibility", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The pamphlet was set to be delivered to 80,000 houses, but he understood none of them were delivered on Monday; instead, the issue was escalated to NZ Post management.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Post said in a statement: "It is not appropriate for NZ Post to act as a censor in determining what it will and won't deliver."</p>
        
            <p>Maynard disagreed. "Just to accept any flyer from anybody is hardly exercising social responsibility," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know what happened in the mosques in Christchurch. There is a lot of sensitivity about Islamophobia, and this looks to us like a dog-whistle about exactly that."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City councillor Rebecca Matthews said the pamphlet's claim was likely to be a reference to recent changes to the district plan, which sought to change the rules to allow mosques to use speakers to broadcast a call to prayer on special occasions.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently mosques in Wellington can never broadcast a call to prayer," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is the community are thinking about perhaps a couple of times a year, for a short period of time, at not antisocial hours, to be able to broadcast."</p>
        
            <p>She said the pamphlet was clearly an attempt to make people angry, and was to some extent fuelled by Islamophobia.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot that should be fact checked, and if I was getting it in my letterbox, I would take it with a very hearty grain of salt."</p>
        
            <p>The council said in a statement staff had been asked to clarify district plan rules relating to calls to prayer.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers have not been asked to investigate daily calls to prayer; rather, the rules as they relate to specific events such as future commemorations of the 15 March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Officers will be reporting back next month."</p>
