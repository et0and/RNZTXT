            <p>The Green Party's co-leaders say they had no prior knowledge of a fresh intimidation allegation made against MP Julie Anne Genter.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday evening, Newshub reported accusations made against Genter by a Wellington florist.</p>
        
            <p>Laura Newcombe, who runs Newtown's Four Seasons Florist, told Newshub she had a heated exchange with the Rongotai MP last week and felt intimidated.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Newcombe for comment.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Genter confronted National minister Matt Doocey in the House on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>As MPs were debating roading projects as part of the Annual Review - Transport, Genter rose from her seat and walked across the chamber towards Doocey.</p>
        
            <p>She then waved a book in his face and repeatedly yelled: "Read the report!"</p>
        
            <p>She later apologised, saying she was motivated by "a desire to share information that I believe would be of benefit to everyone in this House".</p>
        
            <p>Multiple political parties have complained to the Speaker about the outburst, and the Green Party has since launched disciplinary action against Genter.</p>
        
            <p>Genter was not in Parliament on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Green Party co-leaders said they had "no prior knowledge" of Newcombe's complaint.</p>
        
            <p>However, a spokesperson confirmed that Genter took out her phone and filmed the florist during the exchange.</p>
        
            <p>"Julie Anne's actions in the House last night were unacceptable and fall short of the high standards the Green Party expects of its MPs," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"The co-leaders took immediate action to initiate a disciplinary process and will be working with Julie Anne to make sure this behaviour is not repeated."</p>
