            <p>Two people have been spotted alive in the water off Gisborne - but they have since been lost to sight.</p>
        
            <p>A search was launched yesterday afternoon after a fishing boat with three people on board was reported overdue.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre said this afternoon, a container vessel, the African Tiger spotted two people in the water off the Māhia Peninsula while on its way to Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>They could no longer be seen but searchers were urgently trying to find them again and rescue them. Its operation's manager Michael Clulow said vessels had been sent to the location.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working as quickly as possible to relocate and rescue these people in the water. They have been in the water for a long-time now, and will be cold and tired."</p>

            <p>Clulow said weather conditions in the area were atrocious, making it extremely difficult for responders on the water and in the air.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking at a number of ways to try and safely get these people out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those caught up in this rapidly evolving situation and are taking all practical steps to save lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>This response was being supported by the NZDF, Napier Harbour Tugs, NZ Coastguard and rescue helicopter providers.</p>
