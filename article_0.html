            <p>The Interislander ferry Aratere has run aground just outside Picton after a steering failure.</p>

            <p>Passengers have been given lifejackets and are being checked over.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander general manager Duncan Roy said the vessel, with 47 people on board, departed Picton at 9.45pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It ran aground following a steering failure.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a freight only sailing with eight commercial vehicle drivers and 39 crew on board. There are no injuries and the vessel is watertight.</p>
        
            <p>"The Picton Harbourmaster is on board and we are working with him to move the vessel back to Picton."</p>

            <p>Maritime New Zealand said in a statement that the crash occurred about 2.8km north of Picton.</p>
        
            <p>"The vessel will be refloated as tidal conditions allow."</p>
        
            <p>According to MetService, the tide was going out. It would be at its lowest around 2.20am.</p>
        
            <p>High tide was expected around 9am.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand would be investigating the cause of the grounding, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack said it would have been a "pretty frightening" incident for those on board.</p>

            <p>"I have heard that the Harbourmaster is on board doing checks but I'm trying to find out further information. Obviously it's a pretty concerning incident."</p>
        
            <p>Boyack said she had been advised everyone on board had been given a lifejacket.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt City councillor Brady Dyer posted about the incident on X, saying: "Looks like the Interisland ferry Aratere has (run aground) shortly after leaving Picton this evening! Hope everyone on board is ok!"</p>
        
            <p>A man whose father was on board told the New Zealand Herald he understood the ferry had hit a bank. He said all on board were safe.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com showed the ferry was near Pine Bay and not moving just after 11pm Friday. It was about half an hour out of Picton.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel's status was "aground", the website said.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance said it was notified of the incident at 10.04pm.</p>
        
            <p>"We ... are currently on scene with two ambulances, one first response unit, one manager and a Major Incident Support Team. There are no reports of injuries."</p>

            <p>The Maritime Union said the vessel had run aground at Pine Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The union would release further information on the incident when it was available.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said in a social media post that he had been advised there was no indication of injuries, danger to life, or danger of oil polluting the marine environment.</p>
        
            <p>"The vessel is watertight. Both KiwiRail and Maritime NZ are actively dealing with the situation."</p>
        
            <p>In January 2023, the Interislander ferry Kaitiaki broke down in the Cook Strait and ended up drifting, resulting in a mayday call.</p>
        
            <p>Tug boats had to escort the ferry, which had 880 people on board, to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A report later found the breakdown was partly due to KiwiRail not replacing critical engine parts.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ has since filed a charge against KiwiRail under the Health and Safety at Work Act in relation to the incident. The maximum penalty is $1.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, all passenger sailings on the Interislander's Kaiarahi ferry were cancelled for several days due to a mechanical fault.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a project to build two new ferries and redevelop the ports was canned by the coalition government after spiralling costs meant it was no longer economically feasible to proceed.</p>
        
            <p>The project would still be $1.5 billion in the hole after 2050, documents revealed.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
