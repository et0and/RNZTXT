            <p>The final major event of award season, the 2025 Oscars, had it all.</p>
        
            <p>Shock wins, lengthy acceptance speeches, show-stopping performances and plenty of political statements filled the three hour ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>Here are the key moments from the 2025 Oscars.</p>

            <p>The 25-year-old star of Anora, Mikey Madison, has shocked viewers by winning Best Actress at the 97th Academy Awards.</p>
        
            <p>Madison scored an upset over Demi Moore, who had been favoured to claim the gong for her role in The Substance.</p>
        
            <p>"I grew up in Los Angeles, but Hollywood always felt so far away from me," Madison said on stage.</p>
        
            <p>"To be here standing in this room today is really incredible."</p>
        
            <p>She said she wanted to "thank and honour the sex worker community".</p>
        
            <p>"I will continue to be an ally."</p>
        
            <p>The film also won Best Picture following an unpredictable Oscars race.</p>
        
            <p>Conclave and The Brutalist were initially thought to be frontrunners for Best Picture.</p>

            <p>In one of the moments audiences had been excited for weeks, Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo took to the stage to sing a medley of songs from the Wizard of Oz universe.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ethereal in a red and sparkly gown with rainbow lights flooding her face, Grande began the medley with a rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.</p>
        
            <p>Cynthia Erivo then entered stage right, crooning the song Home, originally sung by Diana Ross in the 1978 musical The Wiz.</p>
        
            <p>And the singers joined each other for Defying Gravity, with the emotion of the moment obvious for each star.</p>

            <p>Now that Wicked part two has finished production, the pair may have sung the iconic song together for the last time.</p>
        
            <p>The audience gave a standing ovation.</p>
        
            <p>The song followed an opening montage of films such as La La Land which were shot in Los Angeles - a homage to the city which endured wildfires earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The pair sang in front of a backdrop of the city throughout the performance.</p>

            <p>It was a historic night for several winners but no-one had a night as eventful as Anora's Sean Baker.</p>
        
            <p>Baker has won the most personal awards for one film ever.</p>
        
            <p>Baker, who directed, wrote and edited the film took home the Oscars for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Picture.</p>
        
            <p>Walt Disney also won four Oscars in 1953, but that was for four different films.</p>
        
            <p>Mikey Madison also took home Best Actress for her role in Anora.</p>
        
            <p>In Baker's third speech of the night, for Best Director, the filmmaker encouraged people to keep going to movie theatres and supporting cinema.</p>
        
            <p>After winning Best Picture, Baker thanked the academy for recognising a "truly independent film" which cost $US6 million ($9.64) to make.</p>
        
            <p>Zoe Saldana also took home the Supporting Actress honour, making her the first actress with Dominican heritage to win the category.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy award, and I know I will not be the last. I hold the fact that I am getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish."</p>
        
            <p>Paul Tazewell became the first black man to win Best Costume Design.</p>

            <p>And, in big news for Latvia, Flow won the Best Animated Feature award, giving the small European country its first Oscar.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Best Actor winner Adrien Brody gave a heartfelt but pretty long speech.</p>
        
            <p>The actor had a long list of people to thank and was determined to get through it.</p>
        
            <p>He spent a large majority of the speech talking about having the "privilege of perspective".</p>
        
            <p>"Acting is a very fragile profession. It looks very glamorous, and in certain moments it is, but the one thing that I have gained, having the privilege to come back here, is to have some perspective," he said.</p>
        
            <p>When the orchestra began to play Brody off, he demanded it stop and said he would finish quickly.</p>

            <p>"I'm wrapping up, please, please, please, I will wrap up. Please turn the music off. I've done this before. It's not my first rodeo. Thank you."</p>
        
            <p>He then went on.</p>
        
            <p>"I pray for a healthier and happier and more inclusive world, and I believe if the past can teach us anything, it is a reminder: Do not let hate go unchecked."</p>
        
            <p>He was played out once again and hastily wrapped up after saying: "OK, I'll get out of here."</p>

            <p>Iranian filmmakers Hossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani, the duo behind the Oscar-winning animated short In the Shadow of the Cypress, almost didn't make it to the ceremony.</p>
        
            <p>In their acceptance speech, they said they stepped off a plane to LA three hours before the ceremony began, having had great difficulty securing visas to the United States.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a miracle, and speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us," Molayemi said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen."</p>
        
            <p>The film is about a captain living a remote life by the sea with his daughter while struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
        
            <p>In the weeks leading up to the ceremony, Variety reported that the filmmakers also saw promised government aid rescinded, leaving them with limited options regarding international travel.</p>
        
            <p>Molayemi told Variety that they had always faced great difficulty travelling overseas but it had become worse since Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p>

            <p>French composer duo Clément Ducol and Camille took home the Best Original Song award for their track, El Mal, which appears in Emilia Perez.</p>
        
            <p>"We are so grateful," Camille said in her acceptance speech.</p>
        
            <p>"We wrote El Mal as a song to denounce corruption, and we hope it speaks to the role music and art can play and continue to play as a force of good and progress in the world."</p>
        
            <p>Camille and Ducol, who are married, finished their speech by singing in harmony "Emilia Perez" repeatedly.</p>
        
            <p>The camera panned to some viewers in the crowd looking a little puzzled, clapping, or laughing.</p>

            <p>Following on from other award ceremonies this season, the Oscars ceremony included a section paying homage to firefighters who fought the LA wildfires.</p>
        
            <p>Host and comedian Conan O'Brien brought numerous members of the Los Angeles and Pasadena fire departments on stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Please welcome members of the fire service who bravely responded to and battled the Palisades and Eaton wildfires. On behalf of everyone in greater Los Angeles, thank you for all that you do," O'Brien said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but there are some jokes even I'm not brave enough to tell. So on behalf of myself, would you please read what's in the prompter. And remember, everyone in this audience has to laugh. These are heroes!"</p>
        
            <p>LAFD Captain Erik Scott read the first joke, which took aim at box office bomb Joker: Folie à Deux.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts go out to all of those who lost their homes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And I'm talking about the producers of Joker 2."</p>
        
            <p>Pasadena Fire Department Captain Jodi Slicker said: "It's great to be back with Conan. Usually when he calls, he's stuck in a tree."</p>

            <p>A film showing the alliance that develops between a Palestinian activist and an Israeli journalist amid their people's conflict on the occupied West Bank won the Oscar for Documentary Feature Film.</p>
        
            <p>Accepting the award for No Other Land at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre were Palestinian Basel Adra, and journalist Yuval Abraham.</p>
        
            <p>The film shows Adra resisting the forced displacement of his people by the Israeli army in the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta and Israeli soldiers tearing down homes and evicting residents to create a military training zone.</p>
        
            <p>Adra said: "No Other Land reflects the harsh reality that we have been enduring for decades and still resist as we call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people."</p>
        
            <p>Abraham said they made the film because together their voices were stronger combined.</p>
        
            <p>"We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7 which must be freed.</p>
        
            <p>"When I look at Basel I see my brother but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military law that destroys his life and he cannot control.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a different path. A political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say as I'm here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path.</p>
        
            <p>"And why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel's people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It's not too late for life, for the living."</p>
