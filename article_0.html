            <p>Health NZ has apologised after an 11-year-old girl was mistaken for a 20-year-old woman and admitted to a mental health facility.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald has reported the girl was handcuffed by police and injected with medication at Waikato Hospital's Henry Bennett Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora deputy chief executive for Te Manawa Taki Cath Cronin said the girl was taken to Waikato Hospital's emergency department by police who told staff she was a missing patient.</p>
        
            <p>"Police advised our staff a short time later that they had identified the young person as a missing patient, subject to Section 29 of the Mental Health Act, and they were admitted to our care.</p>
        
            <p>"Police called about 12 hours later to advise they had misidentified the young person. It was not the person they had originally thought."</p>
        
            <p>Instead police advised they now believed the girl to be a missing young person.</p>
        
            <p>Her family arrived to take her home.</p>
        
            <p>Cronin acknowledged it was a distressing and traumatic experience.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very sorry. We have apologised to the young person and their whānau and will remain in contact with them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A review was being carried out, including into any medication or treatment given to the girl, Cronin said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to fully understand what happened and will review every step taken while the young person was in our care.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also working alongside NZ Police to review what happened."</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey said he expected to be kept fully informed of the condition of the 11-year-old, and the 20-year-old she was mistaken for.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an incredibly distressing set of circumstances. What occurred is not acceptable and my heart goes out to the two young people involved and their families," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand Health New Zealand has launched an investigation into this incident, and both myself and the Minister of Health expect to be kept fully informed of the outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>
