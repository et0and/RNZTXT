            <p>An investigation into the police shooting of Kaoss Price in 2022 has found the officer who fired the fatal shot used excessive force.</p>
        
            <p>An Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) report into the shooting on State Highway 3 between New Plymouth and Waitara has been released today.</p>
        
            <p>Kaoss Price was shot and killed after he rammed a police dog van and attempted to hijack a member of the public's vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>An officer fired six times at the 22-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>The watchdog found in its 34-page report the force used was excessive, but it did not recommend charges be laid against the officer or an employment process take place.</p>
        
            <p>Police have acknowledged the findings.</p>
        
            <p>Central District Commander Superintendent Dion Bennett said the staff involved took swift action to keep themselves and the public safe.</p>
        
            <p>"They had to make split-second decisions under extreme stress, and I'm confident they acted with professionalism, in the best interests of public safety.</p>
        
            <p>"No officer wants to use lethal force, and our thoughts remain with the Price family as they too process these findings."</p>
        
            <p>Police acknowledged too that the officers failed to advise police communications or their supervisor that they were armed, as police policy required.</p>

            <p>Price was later found to be unarmed at the time of the incident.</p>
