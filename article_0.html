            <p>Multiple people have been arrested after a part of the Treaty of Waitangi exhibition at Te Papa was defaced, police say.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a museum spokesperson said a wooden display panel showing an English version of Te Tiriti o Waitangi was damaged with spray paint and some kind of power tool at midday on Monday as protesters took to level four of their building.</p>
        
            <p>The museum display, 'Signs of a Nation', shows English and te reo Māori versions of the Treaty, with the information panels highlighting the differences.</p>
        
            <p>No museum collection items were damaged</p>
        
            <p>Police removed the protesters and multiple people were arrested following the protest.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were advised at around midday that a group of protesters were on level 4 of Te Papa, defacing parts of the Treaty of Waitangi exhibition," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition to that group, a man abseiled within the building and used an angle grinder and spray paint to damage the exhibition."</p>
        
            <p>The number of people arrested and the charges they faced would be confirmed later this afternoon, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa Liberation League and Te Waka Hourua - the Māori group affiliated with Extinction Rebellion - have claimed responsibility for the demonstration.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Te Waka Hourua said the English display was not accurate, and had repeatedly called for it to be taken down, including in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The group said they believed the English text was displayed in a way that misled visitors.</p>
        
            <p>They wanted an "an accurate translation for all New Zealanders to be able to read and understand."</p>
        
            <p>They said they had tried all means of communication with Te Papa about the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa said it had engaged with Te Waka Hourua before, including releasing information under the Official Information Act - but the group claimed this was heavily redacted.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa said its focus was on the safety of everyone and the protection of taonga in its buildings.</p>
        
            <p>"We respect the right of people to express their views and to protest but we are disappointed that the group has damaged this museum display."</p>
        
            <p>Level four of the museum will be closed for the rest of the day, and the 'Signs of a Nation' display would be closed until further notice.</p>
