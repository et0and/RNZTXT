            <p>An epidemiologist is warning a summer wave of Covid-19 is approaching, which will see an increase in infections and deaths.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as cases of a new highly transmissible subvariant XEC have been reported in New Zealand this month.</p>
        
            <p>While University of Otago professor Michael Baker told Sunday Morning it is easier to reduce transmission in summer, summer waves can still be very harmful.</p>
        
            <p>"The trouble with these waves isn't so much that the new subvariants that are causing them are more harmful, it's mainly that they just infect a whole lot more people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of deaths might increase from, say, five a week up to maybe 30 or 35 per week. And we're going to get more cases of long Covid."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said people had become "very complacent", and while the Covid-19 pandemic had officially ended in May 2023, there are still two waves - a winter and a summer one - that can cause a lot of harm.</p>
        
            <p>"We all want this to go away. I mean, it's been very disruptive and we can't wish it away," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Baker wanted more people to have access to booster shots.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we should lower that age of eligibility," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't allow people under 30 years of age to get any boosters. And I think that's a mistake because they can get long Covid. They need protection."</p>
        
            <p>Baker added the booster shots were continuing to provide reasonable protection against infection, hospitalisation, death, long Covid - as well as improve outcomes in pregnancy - even with the new XEC subvariant.</p>

            <p>Long Covid was probably the biggest health impact of the virus, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>He said around 6 or 7 percent of adults across the globe are now affected "significantly".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a complex, multi-system disease. It can affect almost every organ in the body. It can be severely disabling."</p>
        
            <p>The economic cost is estimated at about 1 percent of the global economy, Baker added.</p>
        
            <p>He warned repeat infections increase the risk of long Covid too.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's a major source of concern, even if the infections actually appear to be quite mild, even if they're asymptomatic."</p>
        
            <p>He also warned there was a "small signal of increasing resistance" against antivirals.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things about microorganisms is they're constantly evolving and they almost inevitably get a degree of antimicrobial resistance over time.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a signal coming through with the main component of Paxlovid, for instance, and also Remdesivir, which is used for people in hospitals, that there is a small signal of increasing resistance.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not clinically important yet, but it is a warning on the horizon that we need to manage the use of these antivirals carefully."</p>
