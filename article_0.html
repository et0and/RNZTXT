        <h2>'Life threatening' - Warning after mum dies after inhaling helium at child's birthday party</h2>
        <p>
A coroner is calling for stronger warnings on helium after a mother died at her daughter's first birthday party.

            <p>
The mother died due to hypoxia, low blood oxygen levels caused by the helium in a balloon displacing the oxygen in her lungs.

            <p>A coroner is calling for stronger warnings on helium after a mother died at her daughter's first birthday party.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old Te Puke woman bought a "parties for everyone" branded canister of helium to blow up balloons at her daughter's party on 24 September 2022.</p>
        
            <p>During the party, her husband inhaled the helium to make his voice higher. The woman did the same, but fell to the ground and became unresponsive.</p>
        
            <p>She was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner found her death was caused by hypoxia, low blood oxygen levels caused by the helium displacing the oxygen in her lungs.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be considered funny and entertaining in a party environment to inhale helium which produces a high-pitched noise similar to that of a chipmunk," the coroner's report said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a known party pleaser. Many people are however unaware of the potential threats of inhaling helium in such a situation. What may seem like harmless fun is potentially life threatening."</p>
        
            <p>The coroner noted that several warnings were written on the canister, but said they were in "very small print."</p>
        
            <p>"I am concerned that the warning sign advising of the dangers of helium inhalation is not given sufficient prominence on the canister."</p>
        
            <p>The coroner recommended that a clear warning stating "DO NOT INHALE - RISK OF SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH" be printed in bold at the top of the canister.</p>
