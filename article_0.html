            <p>All Newshub operations are to be shut down and 250 people will lose their jobs.</p>
        
            <p>The last 6pm news bulletin will air on July 5.</p>
        
            <p>External talks are still ongoing but no outside deals have been confirmed yet, staff have been told.</p>
        
            <p>Warner Bros Discovery said talks were ongoing with third parties to provide a pared-back news service - such as a 6pm bulletin for the Three channel.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement comes after an all-staff meeting which has been held at a meeting hall close to Newshub's office in Auckland's Eden Terrace on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Newshub staff were told by Warner Bros Discovery management in February it planned to axe the entire news operation with the possible loss of up to 300 jobs from 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>The newsroom was losing too much money, staff were told.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, it is understood there have been talks between Warner Bros Discovery and a number of media firms, including Stuff, about ways that part of the business could be preserved. It has been suggested that could include the production of a "slimmed-down" news bulletin by a third party.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, TVNZ staff will today hear the fate of its Sunday current affairs show, after the company confirmed on Tuesday it was axing the on-air version of Fair Go, and the Midday and Tonight news programmes.</p>
        
            <p>Spinoff founder Duncan Greive said the changes would be irreversible, and a "tragic" outcome for those affected.</p>
        
            <p>More to come</p>
