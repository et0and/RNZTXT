            <p>The coalition government has put the boot into ANZ's boss after she threw her weight behind a capital gains tax.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on RNZ's interview show 30' with Guyon Espiner, ANZ chief executive Antonia Watson said she believed taxing investment properties at the point of sale was fair.</p>
        
            <p>"People are investing in housing for the purpose of getting a capital gain on it. And if that's the purpose of it, why not have that as part of the tax take?"</p>
        
            <p>Asked for his response on Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon laughed.</p>
        
            <p>"I love it that the CEO of a big bank from Australia wants to take more money off New Zealanders," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't tax your way out of a recession. You grow your way out of a recession."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said Watson was "more than welcome to enter the political domain" but offered some free advice in return.</p>
        
            <p>"As a former CEO, I understand what she's doing... the big Australian banks make a lot of money off the New Zealand public, and I would just suggest to her that maybe taking more money off New Zealanders isn't the road forward."</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis also made a pointed suggestion to Watson: "If she's really worried about the wellbeing of New Zealanders, then there's a lot the bank could be doing".</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour said the unfairness was not in New Zealand's tax system, but in its difficulty building houses.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of countries have capital gains taxes. A lot of people like it. Doesn't make it right," he said. "If you want a fairer society, make it easier to build a house.</p>
        
            <p>"House prices go up because there are not enough houses for the demand that there is. Having a capital gains tax just makes the government a silent partner in that speculation."</p>
        
            <p>While Labour has yet to settle its final tax policy, housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty said Watson's comments added some weight to the argument for a capital gains tax, as did the support of outgoing Treasury head Caralee McLiesh.</p>
        
            <p>"I certainly didn't expect [Watson] to express a view either way, but I think what is obvious is that more and more people are expressing that view," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last time we had a debate, it was pretty divisive... perhaps it won't be this time, who knows?"</p>
        
            <p>McAnulty said he was also surprised by Luxon's dig at Watson, suggesting it was unbecoming of a leader.</p>
        
            <p>"The CEO of a company surely is capable of making their own mind up and expressing it without the prime minister having a crack," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's starting to show a bit of pressure, that bloke, I reckon."</p>
        
            <p>Labour deputy Carmel Sepuloni said Labour would put its proposal before the public before the next election - "potentially next year".</p>
