            <p>"My auntie and her husband live at this property, they've lived here for about eight years. Unfortunately they've both lost their lives through a tragic accident.</p>
        
            <p>"They're nice people, they don't deserve what happened. I guess it is what it is.</p>
        
            <p>"The family are requesting privacy, please, and everyone's in shock as to what's happened. They're very upset."</p>

            <p>Burrell said the couple were hobby farmers and kept sheep, cattle and chickens.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I was dreaming it. It was a bit of a shock being told what had happened and I just didn't believe it, so I've come down here to support my cousins and the wider family."</p>
        
            <p>They were found by their son, and their deaths were not suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said the family had not heard from the pair in a couple of days, and described the deaths as a tragic accident.</p>
