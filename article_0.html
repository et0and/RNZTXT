            <p>New Zealand's Finn Butcher has won gold in the men's kayak cross at the Paris Games.</p>
        
            <p>After progressing through the quarters and semis, he beat three other competitors in the "big final" of the men's event at the Vaires sur Marne Nautical Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old from Central Otago beat the world champion and favourite, Joe Clarke from Great Britain.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so stoked. Just a kid from Alex on top of the world! It feels special to bring it home.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew I had to execute the last upstream and then it would be as good as gold. All the way down the course, the New Zealanders were running beside me, screaming. so loud - they pushed me to the end."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand's women pole vaulters have all qualified for Thursday's final at the Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Eliza McCartney cleared 4.55m on her second attempt to go through.</p>
        
            <p>Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris missed that height, but go through to the final by virtue of clearing 4.40m on their first attempt.</p>
        
            <p>In shotput, Connor Bell missed out on a place in the final by the narrowest of margins.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's Alex Rose grabs the last spot with the same distance as Bell - 62.88m - but he achieved that mark with his first attempt, while Bell did it with his second.</p>
