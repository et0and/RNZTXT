            <p>Former Green MP Darleen Tana has responded to the co-leaders request they resign, saying they have no intention to do so.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party co-leaders formally wrote to Tana last month, to indicate their refusal to resign distorted Parliament's proportionality.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Tana said they were fairly elected as a list MP at the last election, and they had done nothing that would require the Speaker to expel them from the House.</p>
        
            <p>Party delegates will vote next month on whether to apply the party-hopping legislation, which the Greens have historically been opposed to.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
