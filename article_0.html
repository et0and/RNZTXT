            <p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is expected to address supporters on Thursday (NZT) after her Republican rival Donald Trump claimed victory in the United States presidential election.</p>
        
            <p>CNN has projected that Trump will win the election, clinching 276 electoral college votes so far. The candidates needed 270 to win.</p>
        
            <p>Votes are still being counted in some areas, with the winners in a handful of states - Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Michigan and Nevada - yet to be announced as of 5am Thursday NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters reported that Harris was not planning to make her concession speech until Wednesday afternoon in the US (about 10am Thursday NZT).</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Trump called his win "a magnificent victory for the American people" and said it would usher in "the golden age of America".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Harris' supporters have told CNN they are feeling "terrible" and that they were shocked at the results.</p>
