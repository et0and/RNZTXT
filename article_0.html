            <p>Media publisher NZME has come under fire for admitting it used artificial intelligence to create editorials that ran in the Weekend Herald and other publications, with a media commentator saying it "can only damage trust".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's Mediawatch revealed late Wednesday that NZME had used AI to write an editorial about "Who the All Blacks should pick to play at centre" that ran first in the Weekend Herald on 20 July and another piece about MMA professional Israel Adesanya.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from NZME editor-in-chief Murray Kirkness said AI was used in a way that fell short of its standards and "more journalistic rigour would have been beneficial".</p>
        
            <p>A co-author of the annual AUT Trust in News report, Dr Greg Treadwell, told Midday Report it was a poor experiment in AI use.</p>
        
            <p>Treadwell said NZME should be an opinion leader.</p>
        
            <p>"What is lacking here, even if you ask [AI] to take positions, is the original argument we would look to our senior journalists to put into the public dominion for us about important issues."</p>

            <p>Public trust in the media was falling and media companies needed to reassure the public it could be trusted, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When the public hears that AI is being used in places - and perhaps most importantly here is that it wasn't acknowledged that was being used to create this editorial - then that can only damage trust."</p>
        
            <p>Former Herald editor-in-chief and prominent media commentator Tim Murphy joked on social media the editorial may "have achieved another world first for NZ".</p>
        
            <p>On the upside, this has got to have achieved another world first for NZ https://t.co/e6UvHMRwXg</p>
        
            <p>The revelation was also panned by some competitor publications, with the National Business Review's official X account noting that "NBR journalists are intelligent. Not artificial."</p>

            <p>RNZ also approached New Zealand Rugby to ask their thoughts on NZME using AI to analyse the All Black team selection.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement NZR said it recognised the need for media organisations to have well-established editorial policies and standards.</p>
        
            <p>"These ensure high quality sports journalism and play an important role in telling rugby's stories.</p>
        
            <p>"NZR is satisfied that the New Zealand Herald has made the appropriate steps to amend the story in question."</p>
