            <p>Team NZ - and the rest of the nation - are hoping Day 4 will finally deliver our first medal of the 2024 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>With the men's individual triathlon postponed until tomorrow, our medal hopes on the fourth day of competition rest on the women's rugby sevens team.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns face the United States in their semi-final after 1.30am. If they get through - and it would be a major upset if they don't - the Kiwis will be going for gold against either Australia or Canada around 5.45am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In other disciplines, New Zealand teams will be competing in shooting, swimming, sailing, rowing, dressage, canoe slalom and rugby sevens.</p>
        
            <p>First to compete will be Waikato shooter Owen Robinson, who is in the qualifying rounds of the men's trap from 7pm. If he progresses, the final starts at 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>Rowing action kicks off from 7.30pm, with quarter-finals and semi-finals of the women's and men's single sculls and double sculls.</p>
        
            <p>From 9pm, Kiwi swimmers Lewis Clareburt (200m butterfly), Cameron Gray (100m freestyle) and Eve Thomas (1500m freestyle) are back in the Olympic pool at La Defense Arena for their respective heats. If they make the semi-finals, follow along here from 6.30am on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The equestrian competition continues at Versailles, with Melissa Galloway in the individual dressage from 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>In sailing, windfoil and 49 FX races are set to kick off around 10.15pm.</p>
