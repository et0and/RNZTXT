            <p>Three people died and two are in hospital after a car collided with a freight train in Hamilton, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the crash about 4.30am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said a vehicle collided with one of its freight trains on Peachgrove Road.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were taken to Waikato hospital in a serious condition, St John said.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City Area Commander Inspector Andrea McBeth said police were working to establish what occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be speaking with the surviving occupants of the vehicle and those who witnessed the crash," she said.</p>

            <p>Such incidents were "particularly hard" for everyone involved.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge the actions by members of the public and emergency services who responded and managed what was a difficult scene.</p>
        
            <p>"We will ensure there is support in place for those involved, their families and our staff who attended," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A resident who lived on the road said she woke to a massive bang.</p>
        
            <p>Her partner was one of the first people at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just taking instructions from the first police officer on the scene. I think he pulled two people out of the vehicle and performed CPR on one," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A local who lives near the crossing described what she heard in the night.</p>

            <p>"So I heard, four am, just like an earthquake - BOOM! - then silence. That was it. Tragic."</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour who has lived by the level crossing for 23 years said nothing like this has happened before.</p>
        
            <p>Another woman who lived near the scene of the crash said she heard a long drawn-out sound early in the morning, but did not realise what it was.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who did not want to be named, said the crossing had barrier arms and bells and she could not understand how the crash happened.</p>
        
            <p>She was unsure if the crossing bells sounded at night because of surrounding houses. The woman said the crossing and 50km/h road were usually safe, and she felt for the train driver.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just really a terrible tragedy and really awful for the train driver."</p>
        
            <p>The train was travelling from Mt Maunganui to Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said the level crossing where the train and car collided was protected with lights and barrier arms.</p>
        
            <p>Manager of freight and rolling stock operations Paul Ashton said the train driver would be given leave, and all staff would be offered support and counselling.</p>
        
            <p>The bells, lights and barrier arms at the level crossing were all working, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The East Coast Main Trunk Line between Ruakura and Hamilton was briefly closed, and reopened shortly after 10am.</p>

            <p>Earlier a section of Peachgrove Road was closed, commuter traffic backing up on Boundary Road, and motorists were advised to take an alternative route.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit has finished its scene examination.</p>
        
            <p>An adjecent Woolworths supermarket was briefly closed, but has since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said they were assisting police with the investigation and providing support to their team.</p>
        
            <p>By 11am the road was reopened and trains running again.</p>
        
            <p>The barrier arms have been damaged and warning signs were up.</p>
        
            <p>Rail safety charity TrackSAFE said the accident was a "reminder to everyone of the risks at railway level crossings".</p>
        
            <p>"Incidents like these leave lasting trauma," manager Megan Drayton said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Always slow down and be prepared to stop. If the bells and lights are operating, then motorists should always stop. If there are signs at a crossing, then always look both ways and let any train pass before crossing the tracks.</p>
        
            <p>"Trains cannot swerve or stop suddenly if the driver sees someone on the tracks in front of them."</p>
