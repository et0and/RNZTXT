            <p>A 100-year-old Ballantynes sign, evidence of 19th-century fraud and tobacco pipes made of clay are among thousands of early Christchurch artefacts on display in the country's first online archaeological museum.</p>
        
            <p>More than a million artefacts were unearthed from sites including the Christchurch Town Hall following the 2011 earthquake, as a result of a requirement for archaeologists to be present during earthworks at certain pre-1900 sites.</p>
        
            <p>A selection of items were photographed, catalogued and digitally preserved by the new Museum of Archaeology Ōtautahi, funded by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage.</p>

            <p>Some pieces were reunited with the descendants of their original owners, while many others were destroyed because of asbestos or other contaminants.</p>
        
            <p>Museum director Katharine Watson said the database painted a vivid portrait of 19th-century Christchurch and was designed to make the city's history accessible to everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether it's someone looking for a family link or someone interested in the subject of colonialism, no matter who you are you're bound to find something of interest in the collection," she said.</p>

            <p>Jessie Garland, who worked with Watson on the project, was shocked to find a personal link to her family.</p>
        
            <p>"We uncovered a time capsule and inside it was a deed signed by my great- great-grandfather in 1894. It was found at the St Albans Methodist Church on Papanui Road," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It looked like it could have been written yesterday. To see my great-great-grandfather's name among the words made the experience so special and made the past familiar."</p>

            <p>Christchurch deputy mayor Pauline Cotter said the database was a rich resource filled with fascinating stories.</p>
        
            <p>"Every piece has got a story. It's not until you actually tap into the expertise of these people that know how to identify and tell those stories that you get incredibly interested in it all and you don't know what you're going to find next," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had some [knowledge of my genealogy] on my father's side, but very little on my mother's side. Talking to young people now, they're really interested. It's going to be an incredible resource."</p>
        
            <p>Other treasures on the site included century-old "Frozen Charlotte" porcelain dolls, remnants of brick fireplaces, an early 20th century Ballantynes sewing machine and metal belt buckles.</p>
        
            <p>The oldest artefact was a British silver half-crown from 1835, featuring the profile of William IV, the King of England between 1830 and 1837.</p>
