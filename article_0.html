            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for Selwyn, Waimakariri and Ashburton, says MetService.</p>
        
            <p>Its weather radar detected severe thunderstorms near Rakaia, Winchmore, Lauriston, Te Pirita and Dromore just before 4pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The weather systems were expected to move towards the east and northeast, affecting Rakaia, Darfield, Hororata, Dunsandel, Charing Cross and Greendale just before 4.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Then just before 5pm, Lincoln, Rolleston, Leeston, West Melton, Selwyn, Burnham, Irwell and Springston were set to be affected.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said these thunderstorms were expected to be accompanied by very heavy rain and hail.</p>
        
            <p>The very heavy rain could cause surface and/or flash flooding about streams, gullies and urban areas, and make driving conditions extremely hazardous, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Several weather watches are still in place for parts of the North Island but a severe thunderstorm warning in Gisborne has now been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned that frequent rain and thunder looked likely in Northland on Tuesday, with localised downpours in the late morning and afternoon set to bring up to 40mm of rain an hour at times.</p>
        
            <p>It said the intense rain could cause flash flooding, especially around low-lying areas near streams and rivers.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch remained in place for the Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and the Hawke's Bay until midnight tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a heavy rain watch was also in place for the Bay of Plenty east of Rotorua and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>A local resident Roger Handford said that dark clouds could be seen piling up over the hills to the west just after 1.15pm and then minutes later the rain burst over Gisborne, accompanied by thunder.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane advised people to stay updated on the weather forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"Severe thunderstorms bring a risk of very intense downpours and the possibility of surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>"While festivities are underway, it's prudent to stay updated on the latest forecasts ... as a Red Thunderstorm Warning will be issued for any storms that become severe."</p>
        
            <p>For the eastern South Island though, Tuesday marked a shift to cooler, fresher air, extending to the lower North Island on Wednesday, temporarily lowering temperatures in those regions.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said this brief cooldown, following warm and humid days, preceded a return to warmer conditions on Friday, potentially reaching 30Â°C in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>As warmth dominates the east, Friday brings a wetter narrative elsewhere, courtesy of one of the last active weather system of the year.</p>
        
            <p>But wet weather was set to remain for western parts of the North and South Island, accompanied by strong winds in the South Island and lower North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane encouraged everyone to "take full advantage of the good weather when it's there" during this changeable week.</p>
