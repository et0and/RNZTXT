        <h2>What to expect from this year's Koroneihana</h2>
        <p>
It's not all going to be doom and gloom, but expect Māori to "unequivocally" state their position during the celebration of the Māori King's coronation. Audio

            <p>The Koroneihana, the annual week-long celebration of the coronation of the Māori King Tūheitia, begins on Friday at Tūrangawaewae marae in Ngāruawāhia.</p>
        
            <p>Politicians including the prime minister are expected to attend on Monday when Māori issues will be top of the agenda in face-to-face discussions.</p>
        
            <p>Kīngitanga spokesperson Rahui Papa said the repeal of section 7AA, the gang patch legislation and the Treaty Principles Bill would all be discussed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not all doom and gloom, there are areas [where] we are collaborating across the various iwi of the motu, but there are some things of national moment that we need to unequivocally state our position."</p>
        
            <p>Beyond visits from politicians, the celebrations would include a national kawe mate, a mourning ceremony where relatives of the deceased visit another marae.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday would also see the attendance of Pacific leaders, including the King of Tonga, at Tūrangawaewae.</p>
        
            <p>The Koroneihana was a celebration of being Māori and a celebration of coming together, Papa said.</p>
        
            <p>"After the Covid-19 situation we didn't have to sit together, to talk together, to eat together, to discuss together, but over the last couple of years we've had that opportunity back," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So this will be the 18th year of Kīngi Tūheitia maintaining the position of the head of the Kīngitanga."</p>
        
            <p>Celebrations would begin with a tinge of sadness, as Friday marked 18 years since the death of the Māori Queen Dame Te Atairangikāhu, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The anniversary would be marked by a dinner in her honour.</p>
