            <p>A fisherman has described the moment he pulled a bag of human remains out of Auckland's Gulf Harbour on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Middleton said he was in the Whangaparaoa area to do some fishing, trying to catch some some decent-sized kahawai or snapper.</p>
        
            <p>He had gone to Army Bay this morning, but had not found much fish so he came back around the ferry terminal.</p>
        
            <p>"I [threw] my lure out ... and nothing much was happening but there was a bag out there."</p>
        
            <p>He said at the time he did not know it was a bag, and thought it was a log or a dead animal.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyway the wind changed, brought it in to the coast. I think yeah, anything floating in the water bring fish around, so I'm targeting it. I got that perfect shot, like millimetres to the side of it. Just hooked it. Just hooked it."</p>

            <p>He pulled it into the shore - it was heavy but easy to move - and managed to pull it up the rocks a little.</p>
        
            <p>"Took the hook out and thought 'Right, let's see if it's a bag of rubbish and I need to dump it in a rubbish bin or something'."</p>
        
            <p>He struggled through "layer and layer" of plastic to open the bag and "lo and behold, a hand appears".</p>
        
            <p>He said it looked "like a Halloween-type hand".</p>
        
            <p>It was at that point that he called police.</p>

            <p>Police earlier confirmed that a body had been found in the water near Laurie Southwick Parade on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They were treating the death as unexplained and the area was cordoned off while officers made enquiries in the nearby area, they said.</p>
        
            <p>There was no immediate risk to the public in relation to this death, said police.</p>
