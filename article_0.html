            <p>Labour is doubling down on criticism of the minister's handling of disability funding changes, calling for her to be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Finance Minister Nicola Willis confirmed any further decisions the ministry makes on changing its criteria or funds will need to be properly consulted, and go to Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins on Tuesday said that was a "massive vote of no confidence" in Disability Issues Minister Penny Simmonds, but took that a step further in a media release the next day.</p>
        
            <p>"Christopher Luxon doesn't have faith in his Minister's decision making, so he can't have faith in her continuing to hold the portfolio or continue as a minister," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an extraordinary step and a massive vote of no confidence for Cabinet to intervene because a minister is failing to make decisions in her own portfolio ... Christopher Luxon should remove her as a minister altogether."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister has indicated all ministers should bring any decisions that may impact frontline services to Cabinet for a full discussion with all three coalition parties.</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds has been under fire since her ministry, Whaikaha, unveiled changes last week to purchasing rules for disabled people's equipment, and respite funding.</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds and Luxon have both acknowledged the changes were not communicated properly at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Labour disabilities spokesperson Priyanca Radhakrishnan said the whole situation had been a debacle.</p>
        
            <p>"Penny Simmonds was warned as far back as December that there were issues, did nothing, then signed off on changes that would hurt the disability community anyway," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"She has blamed everyone but herself: Whaikaha - the Ministry of Disabled People, the previous government, and even the very carers who were losing the funding. I think that is disgraceful. The government should act immediately to fix Penny Simmonds' mess and reinstate funding flexibility for carers and the disabled community."</p>
