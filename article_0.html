            <p>The Cancer Control Agency, Te Aho o Te Kahu, admits ongoing radiation treatment delays for patients in Southland and Otago are "stressful".</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive, Rami Rahal, said a lot of effort had gone into supporting the Southern Cancer Service after criticism of long wait-times by the Health and Disability Commission last year.</p>
        
            <p>"I am aware the ongoing difficulties to deliver timely radiation treatment services in Southern have been stressful and disruptive for many cancer patients and their whƒÅnau," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora have taken meaningful steps to support Southern cancer services."</p>
        
            <p>As a result of these efforts, the current waiting list for first specialist appointments with a radiation oncologist had nearly halved to 56 people, down from 113 a year ago, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, specialist shortages continued to plague services, as the Health and Disability Commission has concluded in a follow-up report this week.</p>
        
            <p>Rahal said workforce growth and development were vital to creating "sustainable solutions".</p>
        
            <p>Necessary measures included "intensified efforts" to recruit overseas clinicians, retaining current staff by ensuring a good practice environment, and providing advanced training to nurses, general practitioners, pharmacists and allied health professionals "to take on more of the load from oncologists where safe and effective".</p>
        
            <p>"We are working closely with Health New Zealand on these issues and remain committed to helping drive improvement in Southern and across New Zealand for those living with cancer," he said.</p>
