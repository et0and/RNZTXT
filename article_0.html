        <h2>Watch live: Wellington mayor on Crown Observer being appointed for council</h2>
        <p>
An urgent council meeting has ended, after the government called the situation in the capital "a shambles".
</p>
        
            <p>An urgent meeting of Wellington City Councillors has concluded.</p>
        
            <p>It was called after Minister of Local Government Simeon Brown announced he planned to appoint a Crown Observer to Wellington City Council, to help with the long-term plan process and report back to him.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after news the council would be required to rewrite its 2024-34 Long Term Plan following a back-track on the sale of shares in the city's airport.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers had been threatening to intervene at the council, calling it a "shambles".</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Diane Calvert and Ray Chung told RNZ it was a fairly positive meeting, where they discussed the terms of reference in Brown's statement.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau is expected to speak to media at 4pm.</p>
