            <p>The public will now have until next week to submit on the Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's justice select committee has agreed to re-open submissions from 1pm Thursday to 1pm Tuesday 14 January after technical issues.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands there were more than 300,000 online submissions, roughly half of which were received on the last day.</p>
        
            <p>It easily surpasses the previous record of about 107,000 on the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill in 2021.</p>

            <p>Submissions on the Treaty Principles Bill that were emailed between Monday and Thursday morning will also be accepted.</p>
        
            <p>Those who were unable to submit would now be able to do so over the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>Problems with the website meant people were not able to make a submission by the original deadline of 11.59pm on Tuesday, 7 January.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was contacted by dozens of people who couldn't get their submission in and one case where the feedback was altered.</p>
        
            <p>The committee met on Thursday to decide whether an extension was merited.</p>
        
            <p>Tech consultant Louisa Taylor said the errors she observed on the website could be caused by low server capacity or an attack.</p>
        
            <p>"If a nefarious actor sent a lot of traffic to the site they could actually take it down," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It's not clear how many people were affected by technical problems but RNZ has seen evidence they could date back to late November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Back then, a submitter emailed their feedback to Parliament, flagging they had experienced problems with the official submissions portal.</p>
