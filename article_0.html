            <p>Dozens of protesters wearing Man Up t-shirts have met the start of the Wellington Pride parade, performing a haka.</p>
        
            <p>The parade was about five minutes in when around 30 to 40 Man Up members appeared.</p>

            <p>The crowd yelled "you are not welcome" and police formed a line, trying to move them away on Taranaki Street.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau is at the start of the parade, joined by Wellington Paranormal actor Karen O'Leary.</p>
        
            <p>The parade has now resumed, moving down Courtenay Place and Dixon Street to the end point at the rainbow crossing on Cuba Street.</p>

            <p>There were concerns about protests by Man Up following events at the Auckland Pride Festival last month.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses had reported about 30 people were barricaded into a room in Te AtatÅ«'s library after men wearing 'Man Up' t-shirts had interrupted an event hosted by a drag king, who read a book to children.</p>
        
            <p>The Man Up group is linked to Destiny Church.</p>
        
            <p>Church leader Brian Tamaki said he told protesters: "I want you to storm the library they're in."</p>
        
            <p>The group's actions were widely condemned, with police saying it "crossed a line" and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said, "We respect people's right to free speech, we respect people's rights to peaceful protest, [but] they went too far."</p>
        
            <p>Before Saturday's parade, event manager Craig Watson said they were prepared for possible incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"The appropriate way for people to respond to any kind of protest that happens here is to keep peaceful and remain calm. Their advice to us is to sing a waiata or to continue with our celebrations, and to really ignore their protest.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been asking our community to take that approach to anything that might happen on Saturday."</p>
        
            <p>"Wellington is a place that loves the queer community, that really supports the queer community and we invite everyone to come down and have fun, and just really enjoy the day. Remain peaceful and keep that celebration going for the whole Pride," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Rainbow Youth and InsideOUT said there is no place for hate and violence in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>InsideOUT, Managing Director, Tabby Besley said loud bigoted voices are only being drowned out from the growth of visibility in the rainbow community.</p>
        
            <p>"It is time the government takes serious action to prevent and respond to violence towards rainbow communities. The recent incidents at Auckland Pride are part of an organised ongoing attack on rainbow people's rights to be themselves and come together."</p>
        
            <p>More to come. </p>
