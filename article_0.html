            <p>The top Australian side meets the top Kiwi side on Anzac Round in a battle of the capitals. The good news for the Brumbies is they are too good a team to play as poorly as they did last weekend twice in a row. However, it did give the Canes plenty of areas to target - not that they really need the help given how well they're playing.</p>
        
            <p>The one big setback for Clark Laidlaw is an injury to form hooker Asafo Aumua, which will sideline him for six weeks. However, Bailyn Sullivan makes his long-awaited return to action after a long injury lay-off. Kick-off is at 4:35pm NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Follow the action with RNZ's live blog:</p>
