            <p>The last few residents have reportedly been evacuated from Waipoua Settlement in Northland as the remote, forested area is threatened by a massive fire on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers of the Te Kopuru Fire Brigade reportedly brought the last two residents out of the settlement to the safety of the Waipoua River mouth on the west coast.</p>
        
            <p>Access to the Waipoua Settlement is not possible from State Highway 12 due to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed some firefighters are also unable to get out by road and will have to evacuate via the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said they were alerted to the 70 hectare fire with a four kilometre perimeter on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They said it was expected to grow larger.</p>
        
            <p>There were multiple grounds crew and seven helicopters fighting the blaze, with three more arriving from Taupō on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Houses were at risk, the a Fire and Emergency spokesperson said but none had been lost yet.</p>
        
            <p>Crews would keep fighting the fire until nightfall and would be onsite overnight to watch the blaze, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>It was likely to be a "long-duration event", they said.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is close to the former Waipoua Forest headquarters and about 6 kilometres from the kauri tree Tane Mahuta.</p>
        
            <p>It is roughly 6km south of Tāne Mahuta, the world's largest surviving kauri tree.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara Mayor Craig Jepson said he was in contact with Civil Defence about the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage our Civil Defence controller is monitoring the situation, but it's unlikely to require a Civil Defence response," Jepson said.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said to his knowledge no one had been harmed.</p>
        
            <p>"Fire and Emergency are working closely with Te Roroa, the iwi that owns that area and they have evacuation plans in place."</p>
        
            <p>Te Roroa iwi leader Snow Tane said the evacuation of the Waipoua forest settlement was still ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"The evacuation is motion at the moment, we've evacuated most of the whanau from the settlement but there are some down there still currently.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working on trying to get them out but at this stage everyone is safe, even the ones at remain in situ.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be an interesting night because if the wind changes, then things could change, and send the fire maybe towards the houses."</p>
        
            <p>He said at this stage there were not concerns the fire could threaten Tāne Mahuta.</p>
