        <h2>Watch live: PM talks to media at end of whirlwind US trip</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon has met with Gavin Newsom, the governor highly tipped to be the next Democrat President, and thrown a few baseballs at Oracle Park.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is due to speak to media at about 1pm</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister is wrapping up his whirlwind five-day trip to the US which has been crammed with meetings with world leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon is currently in San Francisco where he has met with Gavin Newsom, the California Governor highly tipped to be the next Democrat President.</p>
        
            <p>This comes as a beleaguered Joe Biden has been under pressure to step down from the Presidential election race after a string of bad public appearances.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday (NZT) Biden held his first solo unscripted press conference in weeks where he confused his deputy Kamala Harris with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day he had introduced Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin.</p>
        
            <p>Follow along RNZ's liveblog for all the latest updates:</p>
        
            <p>Newsom has had a lot of attention around him as many in the Democrat party question whether Biden is up to the job to run.</p>
        
            <p>Asked by New Zealand media whether he would step up if Biden decides not to run, Newsom said: "No, he's our nominee and I look forward to supporting him at our convention and on election day."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Newsom held their bilateral at Oracle Park - home of the Giants baseball team.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister was tossed a few balls at the park and Newsom later complimented him on being the only man in a suit who has visited and hit every ball.</p>
