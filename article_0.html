            <p>The Wellington region may have to go into level three water restrictions in the next two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Councils and emergency authorities have been preparing for the possibility of an acute water shortage this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Currently Wellington, Upper Hutt, Lower Hutt and Porirua are in level two restrictions which ban household garden sprinklers and irrigation systems.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water's latest modelling shows that water usage remains high, with last week's daily use peaking at 194 million litres.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said if water use stayed the same, they might need to move to level 3 in the next one to two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Level three restrictions would ban all outdoor residential water use and ask households to reduce indoor water use.</p>
        
            <p>Under this level Wellington Water would also prepare water regulator Taumata Arowai to declare a drinking water emergency.</p>
