            <p>Energy Minister Simeon Brown has ordered the Electricity Authority to review a pylon collapse that cause a power outage across Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at a media press conference in WhangƒÅrei, Brown said he had visited the site of the fallen pylon and said "getting answers to what happened is a top priority".</p>
        
            <p>"It is completely unacceptable what happened yesterday," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said Transpower had also started their own internal investigation and the government were currently considering whether to stand up an independent inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower confirmed the pylon collapse was an "isolated incident" and they were "not concerned about another tower".</p>
        
            <p>- More to come ...</p>
