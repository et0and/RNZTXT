            <p>The Reserve Bank has cut the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%.</p>
        
            <p>Expectations had been rising the central bank might cut the rate for the first time in four years.</p>
        
            <p>Wholesale interest rates have been falling recently as financial markets surmised the rate might fall for the first time since March 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank started increasing the cash rate in late 2021 in response to high inflation, with the OCR reaching its current peak of 5.5 percent in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, in recent months, economic data shows inflation slowing, unemployment rising and economic growth stalling.</p>
        
            <p>A Reuters poll of 31 analysts showed 19 expected the cash rate to be held steady.</p>
