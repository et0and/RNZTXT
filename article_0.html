            <p>Firefighters know where a blaze at a Christchurch car workshop began but are still investigating what caused it.</p>
        
            <p>An alert has been issued because of the smoke coming from the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Incident Controller Dave Key said the fire was contained but still burning.</p>
        
            <p>He said roads around the workshop would be closed for much of the day but crews aimed to get at least part of Colombo Street reopened by about 10am.</p>

            <p>Crews would be at the scene all day and using heavy machinery to turn over the site.</p>
        
            <p>That meant the smoke would be coming and going throughout the day, Key said.</p>
        
            <p>Other businesses ran out of the same building that the workshop was in and would be affected, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The large fire at the car workshop in Christchurch's Sydenham, has caused smoke to billow across the city.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Auto Inspection Services on Colombo St shortly before 4.30am on Thursday, a Fire and Emergency NZ spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>The large fire was still burning, the spokesperson said and part of Colombo and Durham St, around the building were closed and would remain so for some time.</p>
        
            <p>Eleven fire engines were at the scene, the spokesperson said. A police car and ambulance were also at the site, an RNZ reporter said.</p>
        
            <p>The smoke drift was affecting the Sydenham, Addington and Spreydon area, Fire and Emergency said.</p>

            <p>It issued an emergency alert warning people in to stay indoors if possible, keep doors and windows closed and be mindful about using air condititioning units.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have any health concerns please call Healthline or 111 in an emergency".</p>
        
            <p>At this stage it was too early to say what had caused the fire, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>It was believed it would take some time to extinguish the fire due to the size of the building.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries have been reported.</p>
