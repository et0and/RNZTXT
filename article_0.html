            <p>Flames were seen coming out the back of a Boeing 737 that departed from Queenstown on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Airport said in a statement this evening that Virgin Australia flight VA148 departed Queenstown Airport at 5.59pm, bound for Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>"It experienced an issue just after take-off and has been diverted to Invercargill Airport."</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Airport confirmed around 7pm the plane has now landed safely in Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>A short time later, Virgin Australia's chief operatioons officer Stuart Aggs said the flight had diverted to Invercargill Airport and landed safely following a possible bird strike on take-off this evening.</p>
        
            <p>"The aircraft has been met by emergency services at Invercargill Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"The safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority."</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public were on the streets filming the incident as the plane flew overhead.</p>
        
            <p>Video posted to social media appeared to show flames coming from an engine as it flew over the Shotover Delta, local media reported.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ listener says they heard loud back-firing noises and rushed outside to see the plane with fire coming from an engine.</p>
        
            <p>The plane is a Boeing 737-8FE, according to flight trackers.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware of reports involving a Virgin Australia aircraft. We are working to establish details and will provide an update as soon as possible," a spokesperson for the airline said.</p>
