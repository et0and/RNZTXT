            <p>The remaining five members of the Bali Nine have returned to Australia after spending two decades in an Indonesian prison for their roles in a botched drug smuggling operation.</p>
        
            <p>Australians Scott Rush, Matthew Norman, Si-Yi Chen, Martin Stephens and Michael Czugaj were serving life sentences in Indonesia for their roles in the 2005 smuggling plot.</p>
        
            <p>The two ringleaders of the plot, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in 2015; Renae Lawrence's 20-year sentence was commuted in 2018 and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen died of stomach cancer in that same year.</p>
        
            <p>The men arrived in Australia earlier today and have been provided temporary accommodation while they resettle.</p>
        
            <p>But the ABC has been told the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the men had committed serious offences "but it was time for them to come home".</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased to confirm that Australian citizens Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj have returned to Australia this afternoon," Albanese said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I have conveyed my personal appreciation to President Prabowo [Subianto] for his act of compassion."</p>

            <p>In a joint statement with Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke, Albanese also thanked the Indonesian government for its cooperation in facilitating the men's return to Australia "on humanitarian grounds".</p>
        
            <p>"This reflects the strong bilateral relationship and mutual respect between Indonesia and Australia," the ministers said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia."</p>
        
            <p>The men are understood to have returned together on a commercial flight, but it is not known whether they have been reunited with their families, or where they are staying.</p>
        
            <p>The men and their families have asked for privacy in a happy but also difficult time.</p>
        
            <p>Albanese met with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of APEC in Lima, Peru, last month when the pair discussed the return of the remaining Bali Nine members.</p>
        
            <p>But the result is the consequence of years of prolonged advocacy by Australia from the prime minister down.</p>
        
            <p>Subianto is understood to have wanted the men home by Christmas, aware of the lengthy sentences they had already served and their ageing families</p>
        
            <p>The Bali Nine were caught attempting to smuggle heroin out of Bali after a tip-off from Australian Federal Police.</p>
