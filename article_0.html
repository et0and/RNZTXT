            <p>Crews battling multiple wildfires that raged across Los Angeles today were up against a near-perfect storm: intense wind, low humidity and, most troubling for residents, inadequate supplies of water to contain the blazes.</p>
        
            <p>At least five people are dead and thousands have fled.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, at least three major blazes burned in LA County communities simultaneously, including a fire in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighbourhood, an area west of downtown LA dotted with multimillion-dollar celebrity homes built along steep canyons.</p>
