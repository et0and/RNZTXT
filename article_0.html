        <h2>'The town is pumping': Business booming in Tairua</h2>
        <p>
This year's highway closure meant the coastal town was often bypassed by peninsula travellers, but now things are looking up for local retailers.

            <p>A week on from the Coromandel Peninsula's State Highway 25A reopening, business is booming in Tairua.</p>
        
            <p>After slips washed away parts of SH25A earlier this year, many travellers bypassed the coastal town as they took different routes to other peninsula hotspots like Whitianga and Whangamata.</p>
        
            <p>But now that the key road is open again, people driving through are stopping at the local businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Tairua Business Association co-chair Peter Hunt said people were initially not sure when the road would open.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it got busier and busier as news spread that it's open and everyone could plan their journeys into Tairua.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we didn't have a definitive date of it opening, obviously some people were just leaving it until they knew for sure."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt said he felt encouraged to see the eateries packed with people and the town busier than normal.</p>
        
            <p>Maree Smith owns clothing store Get It On and said she has had to bring in extra staff this week.</p>
        
            <p>"The town is pumping. It's phenomenal and it's life changing. All the eateries are full and there's no parking anywhere (and we're not complaining about that!)."</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's obvious the change that it's made (the road opening). It's great."</p>
