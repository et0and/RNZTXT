            <p>Air New Zealand has confirmed Nouméa airport in New Caledonia is closed until Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The airline earlier told RNZ it will update customers as soon as it can.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters told Morning Report government officials had been working on an "hourly basis" to see what could be done to help New Zealanders wanting to leave.</p>
        
            <p>That included the Airforce or using a commercial airline.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 New Zealanders were registered as being in the country, his advice to them was to stay in place and keep in contact.</p>
        
            <p>Before the closure of the airport, Wellington researcher Barbara Graham - who has been in Nouméa for five weeks - said the main issue was "the road to the airport ... and I understand it still impassable because of the danger there, the roadblocks and the violent groups of people".</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
