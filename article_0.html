            <p>Talks between Russia and the United States were challenging but useful and the United Nations and other countries will be involved in additional discussions, a member of the Russian delegation told the TASS news agency.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything was discussed - there was an intense, challenging dialogue, but it was very useful for us and for the Americans," Russian Senator Grigory Karasin was quoted as saying. "Many problems were discussed."</p>
        
            <p>Karasin, a former diplomat, said that talks would continue and that the United Nations and other - unidentified countries - would be involved in them.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to do this, involving the international community, first of all, the United Nations and individual countries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, the impression was of a constructive dialogue, which is needed and necessary. The Americans are also interested in this," Karasin said.</p>
        
            <p>A Russian source told Reuters that a draft joint statement had been sent to Moscow and Washington for approval, with the parties aiming to release it on Tuesday.</p>
