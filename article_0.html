            <p>A man has been charged with murder after the death of a baby in the Hamilton suburb of Fairfield on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said a 34-year-old, who remained in hospital under police guard, had been charged with murder and attempted murder in relation to the violent incident.</p>
        
            <p>The man was in a stable condition and was due to appear in the High Court in Hamilton on 4 February.</p>
        
            <p>Saunders confirmed the victim was a baby.</p>
        
            <p>Another child and a woman remained in hospital in a serious but stable condition, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We extend our sympathies to the whānau at this tragic time and will provide ongoing support," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police know this was a distressing incident and the community is understandably feeling concerned. We would like to reiterate that this was an isolated event and there is no risk to the wider public."</p>
        
            <p>Police had returned to the house in Douglas Crescent on Thursday to conduct a scene examination.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are speaking with a number of people as they work to build a full picture of what has occurred," Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the property at 2.10am on Wednesday, following a report of an assault. They found one person dead and two seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>A 34-year-old man was found nearby with serious injuries and was taken to hospital.</p>
