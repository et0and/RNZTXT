            <p>A man whose father was on board told the New Zealand Herald he understood the ferry had hit a bank. He said all on board were okay.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com showed the ferry was near TÄ«toki Bay and not moving just after 11pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
