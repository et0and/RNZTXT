            <p>A total of 931 inmates are currently working around the clock, cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to slow the spread of California's devastating wildfires, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>Participants are paid by the department between US$5.80 (NZ$10.43) and US$10.24 (NZ$18.40) per day depending on skill level and they can earn an additional US$1 per hour from Cal Fire when assigned to an active emergency, according to a fact sheet from the department.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, there is a significant risk of rapid fire spread over the next few days with life-threatening winds and dangerously low humidity forecast, the California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection says.</p>

            <p>Some evacuated residents are angry they're no longer allowed to return to get their pets or medication after authorities stopped allowing access into the evacuation zone on compassionate grounds, ABC reports.</p>
        
            <p>And California Govenor Gavin Newsom says looters posing as firefighters "are criminals of the worst kind - preying on people at their most vulnerable". Teams of undercover police are now patrolling fire evacuation areas.</p>
