        <h2>Swarbrick replaces outgoing Greens co-leader James Shaw</h2>
        <p>
The 29-year-old has become the youngest to co-lead the party.
</p>
        
            <p>Watch the co-leaders speaking about the announcement about 1.30pm:</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Central MP Chlöe Swarbrick will be the Green Party's new co-leader alongside Marama Davidson, as James Shaw steps down.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Shaw said he would be stepping down from his duties as co-leader in March.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin-based activist and conservationist Alex Foulkes had put his hand up too for the role but announced on Sunday that he had conceded defeat.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Swarbrick thanked the party's members and reiterated the Greens' vision for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Aotearoa can be a place where everyone has what they need to live a decent life, and our natural world is restored and protected, on a foundation honouring te Tiriti o Waitangi. That is the Greens' vision, and one we work to see realised every single day."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw said there no one else he would rather take his place as co-leader than Swarbrick.</p>
        
            <p>"Ever since I first sat down to coffee with her after her mayoral campaign in 2016 she has struck me as a remarkable leader with an extraordinary belief in the power of people to make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"Her passion and strength is second to none, and alongside Marama, will lead the Greens to make even more of a difference in the future."</p>

            <p>Davidson said it was fantastic to be have Swarbrick by her side, leading their biggest caucus.</p>
        
            <p>"Chlöe is an incredible MP, colleague, and friend. She has proven time and time again her unique ability to mobilise communities to push for the change Aotearoa needs," Davidson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"It has never been more important for there to be a strong voice for an Aotearoa that works for everyone, where everyone is supported to live good lives, in warm dry homes, and where we take bold action to cut pollution and protect native wildlife," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Chlöe and I will be in communities up and down Aotearoa working with people to build an unprecedented grassroots movement fighting for the future Aotearoa deserves."</p>
        
            <p>Foulkes, who admitted defeat in the co-leadership race, congratulated Swarbrick and said she would do an incredible job.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident Chlöe and Marama will lead the party from strength to strength.</p>
        
            <p>"I have enjoyed the debate with Chlöe and the party members and would like to commend and thank the party staff for the efficient organisation of the election and the members for their engagement and respectful, intelligent, and thoughtful questions throughout this process."</p>

            <p>He described her as "one of the most talented politicians in Aotearoa New Zealand", and sid he never expected to win against her.</p>
        
            <p>"Indeed, someone suggested to me that I had more chance of spotting the fabled South-Island kokako than winning this election."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said his goal in contesting was to discuss and debate policies. Last month, he put forward a radical manifesto, outlining his vision.</p>
        
            <p>Ranked third on the party list, the Auckland Central MP appeared to be the popular choice from when Shaw made his announcement.</p>
        
            <p>After losing the mayoral race in 2016, she joined the Green Party.</p>
        
            <p>Winning the Auckland Central seat in 2020 and becoming the country's youngest MP in 42 years, she has proven her popularity from early on.</p>
        
            <p>She is the first Green MP ever to hold on to a seat for more than one term after winning again in the 2023 elections.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick denied leadership ambitions in 2022, when more than 25 percent of delegates at the party's annual general meeting voted to reopen Shaw's position.</p>
        
            <p>She has regularly registered in preferred prime minister polls ahead of the party's co-leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, she had to apologise to Parliament a week after saying in the debating chamber Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had lied - a breach of the rules.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come </p>
