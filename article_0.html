            <p>The Ministry of Health said it did not sufficiently brief the Minister of Mental Health on their restructuring plans and is committed to working on suicide prevention.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the ministry is proposing to cut 134 jobs to meet the government's demands to reduce costs.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Servants Association (PSA) released a press release on Thursday that claimed this also included shutting the Suicide Prevention Office.</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey has since stepped in and told the Director-General of Health he expected the office to stay open.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released this evening, Deputy Director General, Clinical Community and Mental Health, Robyn Shearer said the minister has stated his expectation that the Suicide Prevention Office remains open.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, we are developing options to work through with the minister early next week."</p>
        
            <p>Shearer said they acknowledge they did not sufficiently brief the Minister of Mental Health on their change proposals.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry is sorry for the confusion that this has caused.</p>
        
            <p>"Mental health, addiction and suicide prevention are health system priorities."</p>
