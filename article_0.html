            <p>A recruitment agency has seen a surge in applications from public servants as the sector faces significant job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Ministries have begun getting rid of hundreds of jobs as they scramble to find the savings demanded by the new coalition government.</p>
        
            <p>This week, the Ministry for Primary Industries announced it was looking to cut 231 staff, while the Ministry of Health was consulting on cutting 180 roles.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment called on its staff again to accept voluntary redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>It had already received 111 applications, and those staff would be leaving on 31 March.</p>
        
            <p>Bridget Clarke, a senior director at Robert Walters, said the public service cuts were set to have a big impact in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>"We've definitely seen an uplift in candidate applications and there's also been a rise in the quality of candidates applying for roles," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen applications from candidates with exceptional skills and talent ... so if you're a hiring manager, now's a great time to be looking to hire."</p>
        
            <p>Clarke said many in the public sector would have skills that were transferrable to other areas.</p>
        
            <p>It remained to be seen how many would be willing to transfer out of Wellington, to big job markets like Auckland and Australia, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Remote working will be interesting to watch. Post-Covid, we've obviously seen an uplift in remote working, so that will be something that people can consider."</p>
        
            <p>Robert Walters' eight Australian offices had already seen an uplift in enquiries from New Zealand workers, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon earlier said he sympathised with the workers affected, but the cost-cutting was necessary to get debt under control.</p>
        
            <p>Labour allowed the public sector to blow out, increasing the head count by 16,000 under its watch, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the cuts were proof of the government's misplaced priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"The government don't have to do this. They are choosing to fund things like $900 million a year in tax cuts for landlords instead of funding public services."</p>
