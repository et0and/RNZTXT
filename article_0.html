        <h2>'I'm ready for it' - Warriors half Luke Metcalf mutes critics with starring role</h2>
        <p>
The confident Aussie has heard the doubters and answered them in style.
</p>
        
            <p>Don't feel sorry for Luke Metcalf, as he struggles to win over his critics in his new role as NZ Warriors halfback - he literally asked for that intense - and often unfair - scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>In his third season at Mt Smart, the young Aussie has inherited the hottest seat on the roster, taking over from club stalwart Shaun Johnson, who retired at the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson himself suffered his share of doubters over an illustrious 14-year career, which saw him log 224 games for the Warriors and emerge as their all-time top pointscorer.</p>
        
            <p>After two campaigns playing alongside his mentor, Metcalf, 26, knew exactly what he was getting into, when he put his hand up for the No.7 jersey this year.</p>
        
            <p>"I want everything that comes with it," he told RNZ. "I said that to Webby, when I spoke to him in the pre-season.</p>
        
            <p>"I want everything that comes with being the No.7… good, bad or whatever it is. I'm ready for it and I said I'm ready for it.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever comes with that, it is what it is. You're not going to be in this game if that stuff fazes you, so it doesn't worry me."</p>

            <p>Coach Andrew Webster was - and still is - spoiled for choice in the halves, where Chanel Harris-Tavita is the preferred five-eighth currently, but Te Maire Martin has played there in a Grand Final for North Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>Tanah Boyd has previously proved a nuisance against the Warriors, before crossing the Tasman during the off-season, while teenage prodigy Jett Cleary - son of Ivan Cleary and brother of Nathan Cleary - appeals as a worthy long-term investment.</p>
        
            <p>Webster has made his decision for now and has shown before that he is prepared to allow his charges some leeway, as they settle into new surroundings.</p>
        
            <p>Like the rest of his team-mates, Metcalf stumbled out of the blocks in their season-opening defeat against the Canberra Raiders at Las Vegas two weeks ago, only amplifying demands for the Warriors to reassess their options.</p>
        
            <p>Those calls will have been muted by his tremendous bounceback performance against Manly Sea Eagles on Friday, when he scored a try, assisted three others and enjoyed a perfect night from the kicking tee in a 36-16 victory at Go Media Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought he handled the mental occasion this week really well," reflected Webster. "It was really unfair around criticism, considering we didn't tackle well or run the ball well last week, so I don't think we gave him many opportunities.</p>

Some fans still yearn for retired Warriors stalwart Shaun Johnson.

            <p>"Tonight, he was very good off the back of the pack. Early on, a couple of things didn't go his way, but he broke through that moment and the next thing, he started icing opportunities, kicked a couple of big goals, and you could see him really grow in confidence and get into the game.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought he handled the mental occasion this week really well."</p>
        
            <p>Metcalf capped his display with a glorious try in the dying seconds, when winger Taine Tuaupiki pounced on a long, floating pass along the Manly backline and broke upfield. Centre Ali Leiataua loomed on his shoulder for the offload and found his half running a perfect support line up the middle of the park to score between the posts.</p>
        
            <p>Somewhere along the way, he copped a decent whack on the snout that left a gash and a fair amount of bruising that may set back any immediate modelling aspirations.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the first half, I tried to put a big hit on and missed," Metcalf rued.</p>
        
            <p>The wound will serve as a valuable lesson in self-preservation, as he continues to hone his craft in the Warriors driving seat.</p>
