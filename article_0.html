            <p>A former political figure who has been found guilty on eight charges of sexual assault dating back to the 1990s has had name suppression lifted, but still can't be named.</p>
        
            <p>The man was tried in the Auckland District Court for sexually abusing two teenage boys in West Auckland and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>The man had name suppression for the duration of the trial, but it can be reported he is not an MP.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
