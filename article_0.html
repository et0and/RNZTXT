            <p>The Kiwis did everything right to set the best time ahead of the USA, Great Britain and Italy.</p>
        
            <p>The women's team pursuit team, consisting of Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields, set a new national record finishing in a time of 4 minutes 04.679.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will race Italy in the first round tonight with the winner getting the chance to go for the gold or silver. If they lose they will be among nations racing for the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lisa Carrington and her team mates have breezed through their heats, while Kiwis on the track and climbing wall have also advanced.</p>
        
            <p>As Aotearoa's most decorated Olympian, Carrington, along with team mates Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan led from the beginning of the women's K4 500m and never looked back. They were now straight through to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington and team mate Hoskin also won their K2 500m and were through to the semi-finals. Fellow New Zealanders Aimee Fisher and Lucy Matahaere did not advance after coming fifth in their quarter-final.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's men's team in the K4 500m and K2 500m were also through to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, first-time Olympian middle-distance runner Maia Ramsden was through to the semi-final of the 1500m after coming sixth in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>Climber Julian David made two personal best times, 5.24 in the first round, only to beat that in the elimination heat with a time of 5.20, defeating Iran's Reza Ali Pour to advance.</p>
