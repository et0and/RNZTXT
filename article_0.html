            <p>New Zealand athletes are back in action after a magic hour on Thursday saw our rowers bag three medals.</p>
        
            <p>Sailors Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie are in the medal race in the men's 49er skiff from 11.13pm after a lack of wind in Marseille postponed the race on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa's fastest-ever female 100m sprinter Zoe Hobbs made her Olympic Games debut at the heats on Friday night, coming second to advance to the next round.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather came third in her heat in the 800m freestyle to go through to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, rowers Jackie Kiddle and Shannon Cox just missed out on a medal, coming fourth in the women's lightweight double sculls.</p>
        
            <p>Later, trampolinist Dylan Schmidt will be aiming for back-to-back medals after bagging bronze at Tokyo 2020.</p>
