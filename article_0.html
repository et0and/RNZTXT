            <p>They will look to make further progress in racing from 1:30am NZT on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>In sailing the mixed multihull team of Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson were the pick of the Kiwi sailors overnight. They finished the day in second place overall with scores of 2, 2 and 3. They trail Italy by 10 and lead by 6 from the rest of the strong fleet.</p>
        
            <p>A crash that blocked the road ended any chance for Kiwis Niamh Fisher-Black and Kim Cadzow in the women's cycle road race</p>
        
            <p>Fisher-Black eventually placed 31st, finishing in a group of 18 five minutes behind the winner, American Kristen Faulkner. Cadzow finished a further four minutes back in 56th.</p>
