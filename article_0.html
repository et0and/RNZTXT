        <h2>Watch: Boat smashed to debris on rocks by strong winds</h2>
        <p>
Meanwhile, flights have been cancelled and delayed as the weather caused chaos for Wellington's airport.
</p>
        
            <p>A boat has been reduced to a scattering of debris after it broke free of its moorings in rough conditions Wellington harbour Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>The boat was blown into rocks in front of Wellington Airport - in Evans Bay - just after 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Harbourmaster Grant Nalder says gusts in the harbour were reaching up to 115km an hour.</p>
        
            <p>He said no one was aboard the vessel and he was in discussions with the owner over the clean up of the wreckage.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington City Council spokesperson said said staff were checking on the extent of damage on the Evans Bay shoreline.</p>
        
            <p>There were multiple reports of signage being swept away and contractors had cleared three fallen trees near the city.</p>

            <p>MetService said waves of up to 3m were measured near the entrance to the harbour at Baring Head.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport said there would be further disruptions on Monday after strong winds also forced flight cancellations on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>It said Air New Zealand stopped regional flights into Wellington about 7pm, and eleven further flights were diverted or cancelled - including three international arrivals from Australia which all diverted to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"The weather is fine today and normal operations have resumed, but there will be flow-on disruptions today due to the weather yesterday and crewing issues," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers should check with airlines for the status of their flights, the airport said.</p>
