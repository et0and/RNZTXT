            <p>The Prime Minister has admitted his sister-in-law works for a tobacco company but says he has not discussed tobacco policy with her.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the government faces more pressure over its connection with the tobacco industry.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, RNZ revealed Associate Health Minister Casey Costello sent notes to health officials on reforming smoke free laws and freezing excise tax on tobacco.</p>
        
            <p>But Costello doubled down on comments that she did not write notes asking for information on pausing excise tax on tobacco products</p>
        
            <p>There was a line in a document last year about removing excise tax for three years, but she did not know who collated it.</p>
        
            <p>It has sparked calls from health experts for the coalition government to disclose any tobacco industry links it has and for Costello to be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the Cabinet Office was aware of his sister-in-law's connection.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, my sister-in-law works for a tobacco company. I have never discussed tobacco policy with her."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was confident he has complied with the Cabinet Manual.</p>
