Police are cracking down on anti-social gatherings, such as the one that saw hundreds of cars gather around Levin in June.

            <p>Street racers were out in force again around the country overnight - despite police cracking down on anti-social vehicle behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter was deployed in the lower North Island and police responded to gatherings in Wellington, Canterbury, Bay of Plenty and Auckland on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, police issued 138 infringement notices, breathalysed 420 people and took 19 vehicles off the streets.</p>
        
            <p>Five vehicles were seized by bailiffs due to unpaid fines, three were impounded, and 11 were either pink- or green-stickered due to compliance violations.</p>
        
            <p>One person was arrested after failing to stop. Six people were forbidden to drive and two had their licenses suspended for excess demerit points.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Wellington District Commander Nick Thom said the gatherings were "dangerous" and would not be tolerated.</p>
        
            <p>"Our commitment to ensuring our communities are safe is what motivates us, and we will continue to take measures necessary to avoid unnecessary death and injury."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who saw such activity was encouraged to report it to the police.</p>
        
            <p>The police operations come after a string of events involving anti-social behaviour by car users.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Police Minister Mark Mitchell told RNZ he wanted to change the law so that cars seized by officers did not have to be returned.</p>
        
            <p>His comments followed a gathering of more than 200 cars in Levin that saw two people arrested and six cars impounded, after police were pelted with rocks and bottles.</p>
