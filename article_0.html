            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has won facetime and favour with global heavyweight Narendra Modi on a frenetic full day in India, where both pledged greater military cooperation.</p>
        
            <p>The interaction began with a brief hug and handshake outside New Delhi's Hyderabad House, as Luxon was formally welcomed by the Indian prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>The two leaders waved at media before heading into a tightly attended 20-minute closed door meeting, which then opened up to officials and ministers for a further 30 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Extremely tight security meant only photographers and videographers were allowed to witness the welcome, with other reporters held in gender-segregated windowless rooms and barred from using laptops.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at a joint press conference with Modi after the meeting, Luxon pledged greater military co-operation with India.</p>
        
            <p>The two had discussed the challenging geostrategic environment in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>The two countries were deepening co-operation in maritime areas, with New Zealand leading the combined taskforce to protect trade routes and counter smuggling, piracy, and terrorism in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I reiterated New Zealand's strong commitment to working with India to address shared concerns over our respective interests and contributions to ensure a strong, stable and prosperous region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Modi said the two countries will collaborate more in areas like education, immigration, and counter-terrorism.</p>
        
            <p>"We both support a free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We believe in policies of development, not expansionism," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The two men also presided over Memorandums of Co-operation on sports and horticulture.</p>
        
            <p>Agriculture and Trade Minister Todd McClay said the horticulture memorandum would foster closer ties in areas such as technical exchanges, training, and harvest management.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwi fruit will be the first significant achievement under this partnership, already worth $600 million. And this agreement has the potential to create up to $1 billion in reciprocal horticultural benefits over the next decade," McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>And there would be enhanced forestry cooperation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of our forestry exporters have long-standing relationships in India and are keen to expand. This agreement will lay the groundwork for cooperation in sustainable forest management, agroforestry, research and innovation, education, and capacity building," McClay said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, India and New Zealand formally launched negotiations towards a comprehensive free trade agreement.</p>
