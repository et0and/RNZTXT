            <p>An orange strong wind warning is in place for Auckland tomorrow with gusts forecast to reach 120km/h in some parts, made worse with thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said severe gale southwesterlies gusting 120km/h in exposed places may start around 3pm on Wednesday and last around 11 hours.</p>
        
            <p>The gusts "could damage trees, powerlines and unsecured structures. Driving may be hazardous, especially for high-sided vehicles and motorcycles", it said.</p>
        
            <p>It has also placed the region on a severe thunderstorm watch, saying while squally showers were expected there was also a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>"[The thunderstorms] will act to amplify any of those stronger winds as well, some very squally winds as those thunderstorms run past," MetService meteorologist John Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will find it's a windy story especially for that second half of the day on Wednesday and through into towards the early hours of Thursday."</p>
        
            <p>A strong wind watch was also now in place for Northland from Dargaville and Whangārei southwards.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, power cuts and damage are possible for the upper and western North Island from this evening, NIWA has warned.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, MetService issued strong weather warnings saying Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Taranaki, and coastal Waikato will be worst affected.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy winds, rain and possible thunderstorms are forecast for several parts of the country into Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>And a NIWA spokesperson also said winds of more than 100km/h were expected.</p>
        
            <p>"The strongest gusts are likely over coastal & elevated areas," a post on X said.</p>
        
            <p>"Localised power cuts and damage are possible."</p>

            <p>Drivers using the Auckland Harbour Bridge tomorrow have also been asked to take extra care.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said it was likely speed limits would be reduced and some lanes could be closed if winds reached threshold levels.</p>
        
            <p>With the strongest gusts forecast for midday and again from 6-7pm it was possible the bridge could be shut down completely temporarily, the trasnport agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers of high sided vehicles and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the bridge and use the western ring route on State Highways 16 and 18.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a long list of warnings or watches affecting Auckland and a part of Waikato in the north and extending as far south as Stewart Island.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Emergency Management warned people to stay indoors and avoid going outside unless necessary, in a post on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"If you must go out, be cautious of flying debris," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Watch for fallen branches and other obstacles."</p>
        
            <p>People were also being advised to secure outdoor items by bringing them inside or tying them down.</p>
