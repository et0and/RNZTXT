            <p>Bus drivers nationwide are in the spotlight for the Bus Drivers Appreciation Week, amid rising safety concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The celebration highlights both the role drivers play in communities and the growing calls for improved security measures to protect them on the job.</p>
        
            <p>Among those celebrated was Fiji-born Bill Lomaloma, a 73-year-old Wellington driver, whose passion for bus driving had kept him returning to the industry despite having retired three times.</p>
        
            <p>Lomaloma has been driving buses since 2005, mostly recently joining the Airport Express route in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>"I love chatting to people, and I'm an outgoing person, so I enjoy the job. The passengers really lift me up every day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Even in tense situations, he believed good communication was key.</p>
        
            <p>"A passenger refused to pay, so I explained politely that everyone needs to. He left swearing, saying abusive words, but when I looked back, all the other passengers were clapping. I always remember that day."</p>

            <p>However, Lomaloma said recent attacks on buses had left many drivers scared.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always in the back of my mind. You can be nice to people, but you just never know how people will react. You just never know."</p>
        
            <p>He said investment in security inside public transport could help attract more people to the workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"[Maybe] patrols in the buses, to have the policemen inside or even bus inspectors would help us drivers do our job properly.</p>
        
            <p>"But in saying that, there'll always be incidents. And for me I don't think the solution is to cage the driver, like barbed wire. We need to educate people.</p>
        
            <p>For many drivers, a simple "thank you" from passengers was enough, Lomaloma said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kindness is free. A small greeting can change someone's entire day."</p>
        
            <p>Marty Smith, one of Auckland's 2336 bus drivers, echoes the sentiment. For him, bus driving is about setting a positive tone for passengers' mornings.</p>
        
            <p>"Often, the first person they see is the bus driver. I want to contribute in some small way to their mood. And they pay me to do this - it's crazy!"</p>
        
            <p>Smith, who works for Ritchies, said he found fulfilment in the work.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"The first thing is that I am not 25 [years-old] anymore and the opportunity of being able to contribute in this way at my age into the community is extraordinary."</p>
        
            <p>Another Auckland driver, Shayle, had been working with Howick and Eastern Buses for three years.</p>
        
            <p>He was known as the "hydrogen expert" for his expertise in driving the country's only hydrogen fuel cell bus.</p>
        
            <p>"It is my baby", he said mentioning his beloved bus.</p>
        
            <p>Shayle said his favourite route, and one he did frequently was Route 70, connecting the suburbs of Botany to Britomart via Panmure.</p>
        
            <p>"I love driving," he said, "I found my happy place and I will be here until either they get rid of me or retire."</p>
        
            <p>The bus driving sector, long dominated by men, was seeing more women coming through, said Delaney Myers, CEO of the Bus & Coach Association.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love to see more women coming through the doors.</p>
        
            <p>"Modern vehicles are so much easier to drive. It's a complete misnomer that you need to be physically strong to drive the bus, you don't these days and all of the training is provided."</p>
        
            <p>Down in the Wellington Region, driver Paulette was one of the wahines behind the wheels.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm the type of person who's always waving at the other bus drivers," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The 65 year-old has been driving for UzaBus for 20 months, but it wasn't a job she had ever considered before.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd never driven a bus or any heavy vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't sure I would be able see over the steering wheel and reach the pedals. I love it. I love bus driving."</p>
        
            <p>Another woman behind the bus wheels in the Wellington region is Upper Hutt resident Dana.</p>

            <p>The 25 year-old is one of the youngest drivers working for Tranzurban, and has wanted to drive large vehicles for as long as she can remember.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it came from when I went with my grandparents down to the South Island on the ferries and you would see all the trucks lined up."</p>
        
            <p>"I actually wanted to become a truck driver, but when I saw the advertisements on the front of the buses, I thought, I might try bus driving first."</p>
        
            <p>Driving skills can be taught, but customer service skills were key, Myers said.</p>
        
            <p>"If people are coming from a background in customer service or something like that, those are the kind of people we are after.</p>
        
            <p>"Come along, get in touch with a local bus company if you're interested and see what's actually involved."</p>
        
            <p>Safety for drivers was an escalating concern, Myers said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport reports 33 physical assaults on drivers in the first half of this year, up from 21 in the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>Verbal abuse is also up, with 48 incidents, including threats of harm and even one involving a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>In October, a woman was tragically stabbed on the Number 74 bus in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, a driver in Saint Lukes suffered fractured ribs and eye injuries from an assault.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport's operations manager, Duncan McGrory, told RNZ reporter Finn Blackwell he condemned any abuse toward drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"They work hard so Aucklanders can move around their city and they deserve to have a safe workplace," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working closely with community groups, NZ Police and other agencies, but ultimately, public transport is an honest reflection of the communities it serves.</p>
        
            <p>Initiatives to improve safety included panic buttons, CCTV on all buses, and protective driver screens, which were set to cover 80% of buses within two years.</p>
        
            <p>McGrory believed antisocial behaviour in public transport reflected broader issues, calling for respect and courtesy from all passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Delaney Myers agreed and said buses were drivers' workplace and needed to be respected.</p>
        
            <p>"When you are boarding or hopping out of your bus, say hello, or give a quick smile sometimes. That's all it takes to really improve someone's day.</p>
        
            <p>"As everyday Kiwis, we should be taking a little bit of responsibility collectively for behaviour on buses."</p>
