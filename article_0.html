            <p>An Air New Zealand flight has landed at Sydney Airport following reports of a bomb threat on board.</p>
        
            <p>9 News said flight NZ247 arrived from Wellington about 5.40pm local time (7.40pm NZT), with a tactical operations unit, paramedics and firefighters all called to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The plane had 154 staff and passengers on board, the channel reported.</p>

            <p>A passenger on board the plane told RNZ they had been "stuck" on the tarmac for an hour and a half.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] have been told there was a bomb scare. [They're] not letting us disembark just yet," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of police and emergency vehicles on standby."</p>
        
            <p>Journalist Brian Wilson said the plane stopped on a utility taxiway, away from the airport terminals, and remained there for more than an hour.</p>
        
            <p>It then taxied to the international terminal, where it was met by Federal Police.</p>

            <p>Air New Zealand was "aware of a security incident" on board the flight, the airline's chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with the local authorities and following standard protocols established for such incidents."</p>
        
            <p>7News said no-one had been seen coming in or out of the A320 plane since it landed.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 emergency services vehicles were at the scene, including bomb squad cars and armed police, the outlet said.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared planes at the airport briefly entered a holding pattern while the aircraft landed, 7News said.</p>
        
            <p>9News reported about 9.15pm that emergency services were starting to be stood down.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes just one day after King Charles III and Queen Camilla touched down at Sydney Airport for a tour of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>An Australian Federal Police spokesperson said the force had "responded to an incident on board an aircraft that was enroute to the airport".</p>
        
            <p>Investigations were ongoing, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no threat to the community."</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Police and Sydney Airport have been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
