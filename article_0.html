        <p>
Racing has been abandoned entirely after dolphins that earlier delayed the start did not move on.

            <p>The first day of the SailGP racing event in Lyttelton has been abandoned after dolphins were sighted on the course.</p>
        
            <p>The race was due to get under way about 3pm, but was delayed after the dolphins were spotted.</p>
        
            <p>After they had not moved on about two hours later, the race was called off entirely.</p>
        
            <p>Concerns about Hector's dolphins had been raised prior to the event.</p>
        
            <p>Two dolphins had been spotted in the area, within 300 metres of the boats, during the final race in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>But despite being told to stop racing, the event director allowed it to go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>That led to an independent decision-maker being appointed for this year's event. They sit in the control room and are tasked with halting racing if any dolphins are seen.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers have acknowledged that boat strikes are likely to be fatal to dolphins.</p>

            <p>A record-breaking crowd of 11,000 visitors was predicted for each day of the weekend's racing.</p>
        
            <p>Grace Uivel from Ata Ceramics earlier said SailGP had been a "wonderful" event for the town.</p>
        
            <p>She said there had been a buzz around town. "It's a beautiful day and we've had a lot of really friendly visitors."</p>
        
            <p>SailGP's chief executive Russell Coutts earlier said the event would not return to Christchurch next year, as "minority interests" had made things too difficult.</p>
        
            <p>But Uivel said both the Lyttelton community and SailGP had done really well, working with local hapū Ngāti Wheke and the Department of Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>"We love the boats and we love the efforts of all the groups to formulate a plan that can work for SailGP, for the community and for the taonga - the Hector's dolphins - and it's disappointing that they don't want to keep doing that work.</p>
        
            <p>"Because really, at the end of the day, the minority group would be the people who want to see these dolphins harmed.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we are on the same team here and it's disappointing that we can't make it work."</p>
        
            <p>Coastal advocate Genevieve Robinson, who is also a regional councillor, earlier said she did not believe the race should go ahead at all at this time of year.</p>
        
            <p>It was still within the prime calving season for Hector's dolphins, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very vulnerable at this stage, they are still in need of their mothers, they are often still suckling.</p>
        
            <p>"The accumulated effects of human-based activity, such as fishing, on the population as well as this, it's just a little bit too much."</p>
        
            <p>A total of 17 Hector's dolphins had died in the South Island since September, according to Department of Conservation data.</p>
        
            <p>Of that number, 10 were as a result of being caught by a commercial fishing trawler.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
