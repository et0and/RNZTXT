            <p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was safe after what the FBI says appears to be an assassination attempt outside Trump's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>"The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump," the agency said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>There were shots fired outside the course, law enforcement sources said. Trump's campaign had earlier said he was safe following gunshots in his vicinity but gave no details.</p>
        
            <p>The Associated Press reported that US Secret Service agents opened fire after seeing a person with a firearm near Trump's golf club, citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, adding that no injuries were reported.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report, which said that the suspect fled in an SUV and was apprehended in another county. CNN quoted Martin County Sheriff William Snyder as saying his agency apprehended the suspect sought by Palm Beach County.</p>
        
            <p>The Secret Service said it was investigating the incident, which occurred shortly before 2pm (local time).</p>
        
            <p>Trump sent an email to his fundraising list saying there were "gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!" according to an email seen by Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on 13 July, raising questions about protection for candidates just months ahead of what looks likely to be highly contested 5 November election in which he will face off against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
        
            <p>The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed about the incident and were relieved to know that he is safe.</p>
        
            <p>"Violence has no place in America," Harris said in an X social media post.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters was not immediately able to confirm his account.</p>
        
            <p>The Washington Post said Trump had been golfing at the course when the incident occurred. Secret Service agents took him to a holding room at the club, it said, citing two people briefed on what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The Palm Beach police service said they would hold a briefing on the incident at 4.30pm (local time).</p>
        
            <p>The first shooting of a US president or major party presidential candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that forced Kimberly Cheatle to resign as Secret Service director under bipartisan congressional pressure.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was grazed in the right ear and one rallygoer was killed in the gunfire. The gunman, identified as a 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper.</p>
        
            <p>The US Secret Service's new acting director said in August that he was "ashamed" of a security lapse that led to the assassination attempt.</p>
