            <p>Ukraine's ambassador to Australia said the Oval Office showdown between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a "big shock" and warned his country will not survive without ongoing US support.</p>
        
            <p>"Emotions were high. We all know it. But Zelensky is a very direct man and a very honest man," Vasyl Myroshnychenko told Insiders on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the extraordinary clash between the two leaders on Friday, Myroshnychenko remains confident a deal between them is still possible.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm optimistic that we can find a way to move forward … but we cannot survive without an American commitment. We will continue fighting.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not surrender, but to end this war we need American involvement."</p>
        
            <p>Myroshnychenko said the fiery White House meeting was particularly difficult for his colleague, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, who was pictured with her head in her hands during the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"These are very challenging times and when you represent a country and you spend almost four years working on American support like Oksana has, that was one of those moments which was very difficult for [her] and painful," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's Shadow Home Affairs Minister James Paterson told Insiders that while diplomacy between allies could occasionally be "robust", American leadership remained critical while warning China not to "misinterpret" the tensions between the US and Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's in the world's interest, and I think that's in America's interest and I hope we are able to achieve a ceasefire on acceptable terms to Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>Paterson said a ceasefire that was unacceptable to Ukraine would be a "significant win" for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
        
            <p>"That will not just embolden [Putin], but it will involve others around the world, including our own region."</p>
        
            <p>He also warned China not to misinterpret the tensions between Trump and Zelensky.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be a mistake for China to believe the United States views the Indo-Pacific theatre in the same way it views the European theatre," Paterson said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no retreat for America from the Pacific."</p>
        
            <p>Following his clash with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance on Saturday, Zelensky flew to London for a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
        
            <p>The reception he received at 10 Downing Street was far removed from the shouting match 24 hours earlier in the US capital.</p>

            <p>Starmer welcomed Zelensky with a warm hug that was captured by the world's media as crowds cheered the Ukrainian leader's arrival.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street. That is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you … and our absolute determination to stand with you," the British PM told him.</p>
        
            <p>Starmer told Zelensky the UK would stand with Ukraine in its war against Russia for "as long as it may take".</p>
        
            <p>The Ukrainian leader will attend a summit of European leaders on Sunday, UK time, followed by a meeting with King Charles.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reaffirmed the nation's "unequivocal" support for Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the struggle of a democratic nation versus an authoritarian regime led by [Russian President] Vladimir Putin who clearly has imperialistic designs not just on Ukraine but throughout that region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian government has committed more than AU$1.5 billion to aid Ukraine in its war with Russia, including the delivery of missiles, armoured personnel carriers and more than 20 Bushmaster vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Myroshnychenko thanked both the Australian prime minister and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton for their ongoing commitment to Ukraine's war effort.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been very heartening, very heartening to the Ukrainian people who have seen those statements, who have responded very positively to them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Elections are coming and I got a commitment from both leaders that, should they win the elections, they will continue supporting Ukraine, and this is what I rely on."</p>
