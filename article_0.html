        <h2>'You're not able to free think' - Peters sacks Goff over Trump comments</h2>
        <p>
The foreign affairs minister says as UK High Commissioner, Phil Goff was acting as 'the face of New Zealand' and had to be sacked after comments about Donald Trump.
</p>
        
            <p>The foreign affairs minister says Phil Goff's position as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is "untenable," following public comments about US President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Video shows Goff speaking at a Chatham House event with Finland's foreign minister, and during a Q&A the two were discussing how Finland kept the peace in its border with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>"I was re-reading Churchill's speech to the House of Commons in 1938 after the Munich Agreement, and he turned to Chamberlain, he said, 'You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war'," Goff said.</p>
        
            <p>"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?"</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters told reporters at Parliament the decision to sack Goff was one of the most difficult things he has had to do.</p>
        
            <p>"If he'd made that comment about Germany, France, Tonga, or Samoa, I'd have been forced to act.</p>
        
            <p>"It's seriously regrettable and one of the most difficult things one has had to do in his whole career."</p>
        
            <p>"No doubt about it," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>Peters told reporters Goff would have been told his posting was up directly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the minister made the decision this morning.</p>

            <p>"I've worked with Phil Goff, I've known him a long time, I've worked in government with him. It's just a seriously disappointing decision one has had to make."</p>
        
            <p>Goff has a very specific diplomatic role, and didn't meet the government's expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand," Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said he would consider contacting Goff directly himself.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot have people making comments, which impinge upon our very future no matter what the country is, whether it's Niue, Samoa, Tonga, Japan or dare I say it the United States."</p>
        
            <p>Peters says he didn't consult the prime minister before making the decision to sack Goff, because "I'm the Minister for Foreign Affairs."</p>
        
            <p>Asked why not, given Christopher Luxon's position, Peters replied: "Look, this isn't juvenile time, I know he's the Prime Minister, I made him the Prime Minister."</p>
        
            <p>Senior ministers Nicola Willis and Judith Collins were not concerned about that comment and told reporters they did not believe they were undermining of Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in discussions with Goff about his return to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It would not provide RNZ with any further comment about whether he is still attending events representing New Zealand, or how long the appointment process for his replacement might take.</p>
        
            <p>Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bede Corry, will now work through the upcoming leadership transition at the New Zealand High Commission in London.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, former prime minister and long-time Goff colleague Helen Clark described it as a "very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former Foreign Minister".</p>
        
            <p>"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 & US actions now," she said.</p>
        
            <p>This looks like a very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former #NZ Foreign Minister from his post as High Commissioner to the UK. I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 & US actions now: https://t.co/zvp4kC93Mc</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Goff had enjoyed a distinguished career in public service and it was for Peters to judge whether his comments warranted him losing his job.</p>
        
            <p>He said the comments calling into question the US president's history knowledge did go too far for a diplomat.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly overstepped the mark, whether it's a sackable offence or not, ultimately the judgement of that rests with Winston Peters."</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the comments would have been fine coming from a politician, and noted it was a difficult transition from political life to diplomacy.</p>
        
            <p>Goff, a former Leader of the Labour Party and former Mayor of Auckland, has been in the role since January 2023.</p>
