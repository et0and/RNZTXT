            <p>The government is expanding powers for the police and courts in hopes of keeping firearms from gangs and high-risk offenders.</p>
        
            <p>From Sunday, police have been given new search powers to check compliance with Firearms Prohibition Orders (FPOs).</p>
        
            <p>Courts will also be given expanded criteria to apply FPOs, and a process has been set up for orders to be modified or removed.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Mark Mitchell said the move demonstrated this government was taking law and order seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes in the Act mean courts will be able to issue FPOs to any gang member or associate convicted of a significant offence, and police will have practical tools to ensure people with FPOs are complying with them."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee said the changes were not meant as an extra punishment for offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"It is about monitoring compliance with the order that has already been placed upon them, and of course, the ultimate outcome is about making our communities safer.</p>
        
            <p>"This is part of our commitment to reduce violent crime, restore law and order, and keep communities safe."</p>
        
            <p>The court establishes FPOs when offenders have committed serious violent offences.</p>
        
            <p>The orders are in force for 10 years and prohibit offenders from holding a firearms licence, and from being around or accessing firearms.</p>
        
            <p>Breaching FPO conditions is a criminal offence that can result in up to seven years imprisonment.</p>
