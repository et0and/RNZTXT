            <p>It was an awful end to a day that had been filled with so much hope and optimism.</p>
        
            <p>Five-year-old Khyzah went missing on Sunday afternoon in a rugged rural area near Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Search and Rescue had set up a base at the woolshed next to his home, and the muddy yard was filled with people.</p>
        
            <p>There was a helicopter in the paddock, dozens of quad bikes and utes, and a line of horses tied to a fence.</p>
        
            <p>Some people were talking quietly in groups waiting to be called up to help, while others were just arriving back from a morning of trudging up and down the boggy and steep terrain.</p>
        
            <p>You could see colourful dots on the nearby hillsides, as people clambered methodically up and down, combing the paddocks for any signs of the little boy. There was a positive feeling about the chances of finding Khyzah alive and well.</p>

            <p>Among the searchers was Leighton McNaught, who'd been out for hours searching for his neighbour.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is out here trying, but nothing's been found sadly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Khyzah's whanau were gathered at the gate of their home; children, grandparents, aunts and uncles all there supporting each other while they waited for any clues as to where their boy might be.</p>
        
            <p>His father told RNZ they wanted to wait before talking to media.</p>
        
            <p>Inside the woolshed, standing over a wool-sorting table covered in maps, was Detective Sergeant Wayne Beattie.</p>

            <p>He'd been working around the clock since Sunday afternoon on the case. At about 2pm people started to move towards the farm pond, where a police dive squad had just entered the water.</p>
        
            <p>People leaned on the fence surrounding the pond, watching the two divers begin their slow search of the muddy waters, the quiet chatter ceased and an uneasy silence fell.</p>
        
            <p>Until that moment there'd been hope, but now it was replaced with heavy sense of dread.</p>
        
            <p>About an hour later, police asked everyone to move away from the pond, and someone said 'they've found his body'.</p>
        
            <p>Those four words echoed quietly around the crowd as dozens of people processed the news, their faces falling as they turned to each other in comfort.</p>

            <p>A man rushed across the paddock to tell the whanau, who clutched at each other for support and then made their way over to the pond.</p>
        
            <p>Wayne Beattie's eyes were filled with tears and his voice broke as he spoke to media.</p>
        
            <p>Then he walked to his car, reaching in for a child-sized orange stretcher, something there was hope wouldn't be needed.</p>
        
            <p>Climbing over the farm fence with it, he trudged to the pond where a low keening sound could be heard.</p>
        
            <p>As the family carried Khyzah's body back across the paddock, they sobbed and struggled to stay upright.</p>
        
            <p>Khyzah's father yelled out in anger, nearly falling down in despair.</p>
        
            <p>His little body was placed gently on the deck of a nearby ute and there was quiet as a beautiful karakia wound its way around the crowd of family, friends, neighbours and searchers gathered outside the woolshed.</p>
        
            <p>The raw pain, sorrow and hurt etched on faces of the whanau as they paused, then lifted their child up, carrying him the short walk home, is a sight no one in that muddy carpark is ever likely to forget.</p>
