            <p>In the pouring rain and whipping winds, politicians arrived at Ngāruawāhia's Tūrangawaewae marae for te Koroneihana, the 18th anniversary of the Māori King's coronation.</p>
        
            <p>The typically apolitical event was instead this year full of challenges to the government and the Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>The speeches carried a consistent message - and nearly all of them wound back to the contentious Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The tone was set by Kiingi Tuuheitia's advisor Tukoroirangi Morgan, who said the government and its policies were throwing Māori under the bus and driving over them. </p>
        
            <p>Ngāi Tahu chief executive Justin Tipa - yelling to be heard over the stormy weather - addressed Luxon directly, demanding clarity and accountability. </p>
        
            <p>Waikato-Tainui's Rahui Papa continued the rebuke but offered an olive branch, saying coalition partners last three years, but Māori are forever. </p>

            <p>Still being drafted, the Treaty Principles Bill was a key ACT policy, promising a public vote on scrapping the principles established through the courts - such as partnership - and codifying in law a new interpretation focused on equality and property rights.</p>
        
            <p>That approach was set down in the coalition agreements, though National and NZ First promised only to send it to select committee for discussion. Both parties have said they would not pass it into law, Luxon and NZ First senior minister Shane Jones giving their parties' firmest assurances of that so far at Koroneihana on Monday. He hardened that position still further on Tuesday, confirming National would vote against it at the second reading.</p>
        
            <p>His words leave little wiggle room, but David Seymour is determined to find it.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT leader has never attended Koroneihana and this was no exception - he says he was not invited, though the Kiingitanga says all are welcome. He told RNZ his coalition partners had "probably jumped the gun" and doubled down on Twitter - saying it would be more respectful and democratic for them to wait.</p>
        
            <p>With the legislation being revealed in November and set for six months of select committee submissions, the strength of feeling on display this week seems certain to escalate. </p>
        
            <p>In this week's Focus on Politics, Deputy Political Editor Craig McCulloch examines the wero presented to the coalition at a tempestuous Koroneihana. </p>
