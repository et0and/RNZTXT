            <p>Thousands on Sunday evening are expected to show up to Auckland's Eden Park in an attempt to reclaim the Guinness World Record for the largest haka.</p>
        
            <p>The current official record is 4028, inexplicably held by France since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Gates opened for the event at 4.30pm, and will feature entertainment from Kiwi stars including Six60, Alien Weaponry, Che Fu, Rob Ruha and the Topp Twins.</p>
        
            <p>The haka attempt itself is scheduled for about 8pm and RNZ will be featuring it live with footage from Whakaata Māori.</p>
