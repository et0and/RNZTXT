            <p>A man who was found critically injured on a roadside in Miramar, Wellington, has died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The man was found critically injured on a footpath about 2.20am Monday, at the intersection of Camperdown Rd and Totora Rd.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second serious incident, following the burglary of a Darlington Rd address 20 minutes earlier, where two adults found a stranger in their home.</p>
        
            <p>After being confronted and fighting with one of the residents the intruder fled.</p>
        
            <p>Police investigating the burglary then found the injured and unconscious man a short distance from his vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Parallel investigations are under way into both incidents and police are still working to determine if there is any link between the two.</p>
        
            <p>MORE TO COME...</p>
