            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is expected, later today, to call on all parties involved in the Gaza conflict - including countries with influence in the region - to "take urgent steps towards establishing a ceasefire".</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's agenda for this afternoon states that Peters will ask Parliament to express grave concern at the ongoing violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
        
            <p>He will also "unequivocally condemn" the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October and call for the release of all hostages.</p>
        
            <p>Peters will also move that Parliament recognises Israel's right to defend itself acting in accordance with international law and that all civilians be protected from armed conflict.</p>
        
            <p>He had released a statement last Friday saying New Zealand was calling for all countries with influence in the region to work urgently towards a long-term ceasefire, but today's move will set that down on the Parliamentary record and allow the political parties to debate it.</p>
        
            <p>That statement also welcomed an extension to a pause in the fighting in Gaza, but hostilities resumed shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>"We reiterate that all remaining hostages must be released. New Zealand continues to unequivocally condemn Hamas' terrorist attack of 7 October," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have consistently supported the right of Israel to defend itself against Hamas' terrorist attacks, though we repeat our call for international humanitarian law to be observed by all sides and in all circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, there can be no military solution. We need to return to the Middle East Peace Process."</p>
