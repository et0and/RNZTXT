        <h2>Coalition numbers 'quite tight' - constitutional law expert</h2>
        <p>
Seeing how many of the National Party's first 100 days campaign promises have survived the coalition negotiations will be a key thing to look for today, a constitutional law expert says. Audio

National Party leader Christopher Luxon announced on Thursday that coalition negotiations between his party, ACT and New Zealand First had concluded, with a formal signing ceremony to take place once the parties' boards had ratified the deal.

            <p>Seeing how many of the National Party's first 100 days campaign promises have survived the coalition negotiations will be a key thing to look for when the arrangements for government are announced today, a constitutional law expert says.</p>
        
            <p>Graeme Edgeler told RNZ's Morning Report he would be interested to see how much support was "baked in" to the coalition agreement for National's headline policies.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly the thing you'd be looking for is National's first 100 day promises - are any of those promises things they haven't been able to get agreement to?"</p>
        
            <p>National's leader Christopher Luxon said on Thursday the coalition deal-making was done; and there would be a signing ceremony this morning with his party, ACT, and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he was hoping he - and his ministers - would be sworn in by the Governor-General on Monday and he would be advising Dame Cindy Kiro to summon Parliament to meet for the first time since the election on 5 December.</p>
        
            <p>Edgeler said the numbers for the coalition were "quite tight", which meant that to pass any legislation at all "fundamentally, National, ACT and New Zealand First are all going to have to agree to vote for it".</p>
        
            <p>It would be important to look at the detail of not just what the parties had agreed to do now, but also what the coalition documents said about the processes the parties had agreed on in order to settle any future disagreements, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because [if] any one party of that group decides to vote against something the government's not going to be able to do it, even if the others feel very strongly about it."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
