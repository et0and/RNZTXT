            <p>Branded as "a great marriage" of the Three brand and Stuff's reporting, veteran broadcaster Samantha Hayes takes on the lone task of presenting the new-look 6pm news bulletin on weekdays.</p>
        
            <p>Questions have been swirling about how the production - which will run for one hour on weekdays and half-hour on weekends - will look, work and whether it will be an adequate replacement for Newshub's bulletin.</p>
        
            <p>Former Newshub head of news Mark Jennings felt it might look inferior to traditional TV news broadcasts.</p>
        
            <p>But, while announcing the joint production, Stuff chief executive Sinead Boucher had promised there would be proper investment and it wouldn't be "on the cheap" stuff produced on iPhones.</p>
        
            <p>"We are producing something that will be both familiar and fresh, a great marriage of the Three brand and Stuff's live and lively news ethos," Stuff Digital managing director Nadia Tolich said.</p>
