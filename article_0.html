            <p>A mother who brutally killed her daughters has expressed her remorse and says she takes responsibility for the pain she has caused.</p>
        
            <p>Lauren Dickason has been sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment for carrying out the murders in Timaru in September 2021.</p>
        
            <p>She will begin her sentence as a patient at a mental health hospital in the custody of the state under the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act.</p>
        
            <p>Within an hour of her sentencing in the High Court in Christchurch on Wednesday she released a statement through her lawyer, saying she loved Liané, Maya and Karla "with all my heart".</p>
        
            <p>"I am horrified by my actions, and the pain, distress and trauma I have caused everyone who loved them. Like many others, I miss them every single day."</p>

            <p>She went on to say she had failed them, her husband and their families.</p>
        
            <p>"I take responsibility for taking our three beautiful girls from this world.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to take this opportunity to convey the deepest and most sincere remorse for the extreme pain and hurt caused to my children and my family by my actions."</p>
        
            <p>Her apology would seem hollow to many, she said, however, the girls had brought her joy and were the centre of her world.</p>
        
            <p>"I continue to undergo treatment for severe mental illness, and I owe it to everyone and myself to get mentally healthier. I will do whatever it takes, although I know that will never change the past."</p>
        
            <p>Dickason also spoke of the risks, warning signs and extreme impacts of post-partum depression, encouraging others to look for and act on unhealthy signs.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge women experiencing the symptoms of post-partum depression to tell the ones they love. This pain and heartbreak cannot happen to any other families."</p>
        
            <p>Dickason said many people from all over the world had provided support.</p>
        
            <p>"Your care and grace have provided us with warmth in our darkest despair."</p>
