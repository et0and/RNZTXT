            <p>People in Lower Hutt had been rushing to clean up their homes, board up any damaged windows and tie down any loose debris before the sun goes down tonight.</p>
        
            <p>The worst of the wild weather appears to be over for the capital, following a brief but powerful storm on Tuesday afternoon. But multiple roads were blocked in Hutt Central after extensive damage, with multiple reports of trees down over roads, glass across roads, and extensive damage to roofs, windows and cars, police said. People are advised to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>National MP for Hutt South Chris Bishop's office has been damaged by the storm. Salvation Army family store in Hutt City has had the windows blown out the front of the shop, as did a New World supermarket. Windows were blown out of a bus in Lower Hutt, but no one was hurt. Lighting Direct on Knights Road was seriously damaged with the front doors and windows pulled away from their frames, taking part of the storefront with them. Two trees fell on in a house on Kings Crescent.</p>

            <p>Earlier, eyewitnesses described a tornado whipping through the Hutt Valley as heavy rain, hail and thunderstorms lashed the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Mayor Campbell Barry said there had been extensive damage from the tornado, and a small number of residents would not be able to return to their homes immediately. He said they are still ascertaining the extent of the damage.</p>
        
            <p>The storm front hit the region after battering Canterbury earlier on Tuesday morning, and moved up the east coast of the country.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning earlier in the afternoon was later downgraded. By 5.45pm, the watch region had been reduced to just Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and Tararua until at least 9pm.</p>
