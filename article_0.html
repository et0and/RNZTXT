            <p>The second most powerful police officer in the country has been suspended, pending the outcome of a criminal investigation</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming is being investigated by the Independent Police Conduct Authority and the New Zealand police.</p>
        
            <p>The nature of the allegations against McSkimming cannot be reported.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement from his lawyer on Tuesday, McSkimming confirmed he had been suspended since before Christmas on full pay, spending a criminal investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"He remains on full pay, pending a criminal investigation. When any police officer faces an investigation of this nature, they are typically suspended from duty," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr McSkimming is cooperating fully with Police and looks forward to the investigation being concluded swiftly, after which he expects to resume his duties as Deputy Commissioner."</p>
        
            <p>McSkimming was one of the final two candidates for New Zealand's top cop job last year, with Richard Chambers eventually appointed Police Commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>McSkimming was promoted to statutory deputy commissioner in 2023 on the recommendation of then-prime minister Chris Hipkins.</p>
        
            <p>The role comes with a higher pay packet and status than standard deputy commissioners.</p>
        
            <p>Late last year he was overseeing road policing and operational services, which include strategy, media and communications, risk and assurance, and firearms regulation and reform.</p>
        
            <p>During his appointment process, it was noted he had a "relatively unique career path", working at police headquarters since 2010 across a range of areas: strategy, service delivery, resolution, financial planning, arms admin, ICT and infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>McSkimming joined the police in 1996 and worked on the frontline in Auckland and Southland.</p>
        
            <p>He has also been responsible for large restructures - as well as managing police IT systems, property portfolio, vehicles, and launching the 105 non-emergency number.</p>
