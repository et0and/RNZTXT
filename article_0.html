            <p>A baby died from whooping cough over the Christmas period, Health New Zealand says.</p>
        
            <p>Officials declared an epidemic several weeks ago, as cases spiked to levels not seen since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Figures from the time showed nearly 10 percent of cases - 117 people - had to be hospitalised, while two thirds of babies under 12 months ended up in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Babies are particularly at risk of catching the disease.</p>
        
            <p>The numbers have prompted the health agency to put out a fresh call for pregnant people and young children to get their whooping cough vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>About half the babies who catch pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, before the age of 12 months require hospitalisation and 1 or 2 in 100 of those hospitalised die from pertussis infection.</p>
        
            <p>More to come....</p>
