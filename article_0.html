        <h2>Live: 'Report exposes a national disgrace'</h2>
        <p>
The country's disgrace continues "to this day", chair of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry Judge Coral Shaw says.
</p>
        
            <p>The chairperson for the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry says the final report lays bare significant failings by state and faith-based care, to the most vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry's 3000 page final report has been tabled in Parliament this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It found at least 200,000 people have been abused in state and faith-based care since 1950.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Coral Shaw says the abuse was widespread and systemic.</p>
        
            <p>"Our report exposes a national disgrace, one that lasted over 50 years and continues to this day."</p>
        
            <p>The report makes 138 recommendations to overhaul Aotearoa's care system.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the survivors spoken to by RNZ say they are glad the report is finally being released, but some remain sceptical over whether the government will honour it.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to make a formal apology to survivors in November.</p>
