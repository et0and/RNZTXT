            <p>The Grinch has been seen surfing through paddocks in Taranaki and reindeer are flying overhead. </p>
        
            <p>No your eyes don't deceive you - they are there - but it's all thanks to farmers and Taranaki Catchment Communities. </p>
        
            <p>The catchment group is once again spreading festive joy with its third annual Christmas Farm Art competition.</p>
        
            <p>Lead coordinator, Nicola Bryant, shared the origins of the event with Country Life. </p>
        
            <p>"The first year was when all the Christmas parades were getting cancelled. And we were like, 'how can we bring cheer into the rural communities?'"</p>
        
            <p>The competition, born out of a desire to inject holiday spirit into the countryside, has become a resounding success, becoming an eagerly anticipated tradition.</p>

            <p>Bryant reflects, "Every year, people ask us if we're running it again. I know when I drive in the car with my kids, that we're looking to see what's out there, so it does bring a lot of cheer and brightens up the countryside."</p>
        
            <p>What makes this competition unique is the creative use of farm waste.</p>
        
            <p>Participants showcase their ingenuity by repurposing materials like filter socks, silage wrap, and chopped-up wood.</p>
        
            <p>"People are trying to be really aware of what they're using," Bryant notes.</p>
        
            <p>"We've kept our theme quite broad because we don't want people to just necessarily have just a Christmas theme. So we've gone with that summer theme or Christmas theme so that people can...not be limited to what they're entering."</p>
        
            <p>The diversity of entries is evident in the wide range of creations.</p>

            <p>When talking to Country Life Bryant reveals a sneak peek, saying, "I have seen a cow on a quad bike made from silage bales. That was pretty impressive.</p>
        
            <p>"And I must say, he's even put helmets on the cows. They've looked at the health and safety side," Bryant says with a laugh. </p>

            <p>However, since the interview, the winners of the competition have been released. </p>
        
            <p>Taking home the top prize was reindeer flying over a paddock, while Santa can be seen falling down a chimney. </p>
        
            <p>Those in Taranaki can visit the artistic creations - the road of each entry is on the corresponding photo of Taranaki Catchment Communities Facebook page. </p>
        
            <p>The community has embraced the event, with some farmers becoming regular participants.</p>
        
            <p>Bryant shares, "We have the same farmers, a few, that have entered every year now. But we have had a few new entries this year."</p>
        
            <p>One entry features two little elves attempting to slow down traffic with a speed camera, creating both amusement and a traffic-slowing effect.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually quite nice to see people are slowing down to have a look. So it's doing two purposes."</p>

            <p>The joy and camaraderie among participants are evident.</p>
        
            <p>Bryant notes, "They just love the Christmas spirit and getting in behind us. I think everyone just wants to see people happy."</p>
        
            <p>The positive response from passersby, including the sound of car horns honking in approval, adds to the festive atmosphere.</p>
