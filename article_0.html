            <p>Police are investigating possible arsons after fires at multiple churches in Masterton.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services from the town responded to four different fires at churches on Saturday morning, with the first reported at 4:25am, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said "damage to the churches ranged from moderate to significant".</p>
        
            <p>"The fires are being treated as suspicious and have been referred to police," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The four blazes were all thought to have started between 4:25am and 4:35am, and were found at: Anglican Church Of The Epiphany, St Patrick's Catholic Church Masterton, Masterton Baptist Church and Equippers Church Masterton, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they checked on other churches in the town after those fires were discovered, and had found evidence three other churches had been targeted but did not catch alight.</p>

            <p>The three additional sites were also all in Masterton: St James Union Church on High Street; the Kingdom Hall, also on High Street, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the suburb of Lansdowne, police said.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Equippers Church Pastor Matt Cornford said on Saturday morning that the community was already rallying around them.</p>
        
            <p>The congregation did not yet know if their church would be able to open to worshippers on Sunday, but had been offered other places to hold their service.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were still investigating the fire and Cornford said he would not know the full extent of the damage until they were finished. But he said he was already aware of some broken and blackened windows and that some of the rooms facing the road had been affected.</p>
        
            <p>Cornford said from the outside it looked like some of the other churches were affected worse, however.</p>
        
            <p>He said ultimately it was the people that made the church and fortunately none of them had been harmed.</p>
        
            <p>"The building that we're in has been a place that we've been able to love and serve the community in lots of different ways over the last 30 years, and we'll continue to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a shame that has been attempted to be disrupted."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said firefighting crews had responded to the fires from throughout the Wairarapa region and from as far away as Avalon Station, in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Police officers will remain at the affected churches through Saturday morning along with firefighters, and officers will be patrolling in Masterton, Featherson and Carterton.</p>
