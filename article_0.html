            <p>As she prepares for the biggest fight of her career, Kiwi boxer Mea Motu is pushing her body to breaking point and badly missing her five kids.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to encouragement, there's nothing like the "raw authentic truth" of children, she tells RNZ's Summer Times. </p>
        
            <p>"They're always getting smart and saying 'Mum, she's training harder than you. You better pick it up! They give me the drive and passion."</p>
        
            <p>Motu, who has never lost a pro fight, won the IBO super bantamweight world title in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>On 25 January in Nottingham, she will challenge English fighter Ellie Scotney (also undefeated) who holds the IBF and WBO super bantamweight titles.</p>
        
            <p>From her usual weight of around 60kg, Motu must get under 55.3 kg to fight in the super bantamweight class.</p>
        
            <p>To "cut" her weight, she's training three times a day and on a very clean diet of fruit, vegetables and fish - "It just feeds my muscles. The chicken, it's just bulking".</p>

            <p>Before facing Scotney, Motu says she'll watch a little bit of her opponent in action but because she could easily switch it up will be more focused on her own performance.</p>
        
            <p>"My priority is me … I can adapt and change real quick. So I'm always focusing on myself. That's what I feel is really important - knowing your ability, knowing your strength and focusing on that and pushing through it."</p>
        
            <p>As a kid growing up in Northland playing bull rush with older cousins, Motu first connected with her own physical power.</p>
        
            <p>"I always had to run it straight at [the bigger kids] … I had to run it hard. And I became aggressive."</p>
        
            <p>After trying netball and soccer, Motu fell in love with the extreme fitness challenges of boxing after her mum suggested she give it a go.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it was just punching and I can do that any day. Oh no. You're gassed in 10 seconds. I thought I was fit but boxing is a whole another level. It teaches you discipline and self-control.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing's harder than giving birth so I was like 'If my body can handle that, I can handle a broken rib, right?</p>
        
            <p>"I was such a wild kid and I was willing to give anything a go. But I would also lash out as well. So I didn't know how to control myself.</p>

            <p>"Being in the right environment, in the right gym, I learnt punching wasn't for just hurting people. It was actually a sport and it was art."</p>
        
            <p>With the help of her coach Isaac Peach - "my true inspiration" - boxing taught Motu to walk not only into the boxing ring with confidence but through life.</p>
        
            <p>"I had so much hate for so long and now I love giving out love, even to the people who are rude or have no respect for me."</p>
        
            <p>Motu's five kids (aged 4 to 17) include David, a professional lawn bowler, and Laylani, whose courage led to her leaving a relationship after 10 years of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>To people living in abusive relationships, Motu's number one piece of advice is 'Don't live in shame or fear'.</p>
        
            <p>"Speak up but don't speak to one person or two … speak to multiple people, especially if you're in it right now and the abuser is using you. Man, the more you tell people about that abuser, you're gonna get rid of them real quick. So just speak up.There's nothing embarrassing about getting hit or hurt and feeling like a failure."</p>
        
            <p>Ruby Tui's memoir Straight Up </p>
        
            <p>"I'm such a big fan of [NZ rugby player ] Ruby Tui. I just love that lady. I love the way she plays rugby and I just love her confidence. She carries herself so well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just such an awesome book. I could read that over and over again. I always end up going back to the start and then rereading it again because it just resonates with me. And then I see it in a different way when I read it again. She's amazing."</p>

            <p>The Kiwi crime drama Far North (screening on ThreeNow)</p>
        
            <p>"Far North is amazing. I love it. Every time I watch it it just brings back home. That's what attracts me to it, how they captured our hometown [Ahipara]. It was just so beautiful.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me emotional because it brings me back home and I feel like I'm living in it and I'm right there while watching it. We are very community based and we do help others. We're actually very loving and kind and supportive. We're so proud of where we come from and just to see our home on the TV makes us be like, 'Yeah, that's us. That's where we're from'."</p>
