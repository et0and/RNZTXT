        <h2>'Price gouging going haywire': LA landlords jack up prices</h2>
        <p>
People being forced to leave homes in fire-devastated areas of Los Angeles appear to have tempted opportunists.

            <p>Days afer an inferno razed Pacific Palisades, Maya Lieberman is desperate to find somewhere</p>
        
            <p>to live. But unscrupulous landlords who are jacking up prices are making it hard.</p>
        
            <p>"The price gouging is going haywire, it's obscene," the 50-year-old stylist told AFP. "I can't find anywhere for us to go."</p>
        
            <p>Huge fires that have torn through Los Angeles since Tuesday have levelled whole neighbourhoods, turning swaths of the city to ash.</p>
        
            <p>More than 150,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes as authorities try to keep</p>
        
            <p>down a death toll that has already reached 16.</p>

            <p>Billy Crystal and Kate Beckinsale, which - until last week - was some of the most desirable</p>
        
            <p>real estate in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>With the area now under a compulsory evacuation order, even those whose homes survived</p>
        
            <p>the inferno need to go elsewhere for the foreseeable future.</p>
        
            <p>The higher-than-average incomes of people forced to leave homes there appear to have</p>
        
            <p>tempted opportunists, who see a chance to make money from others' misery.</p>
        
            <p>"We put in an application at a house... that was listed at $US17,000 [$NZ30,000] a month, and they told us if we didn't pay $30,000, we weren't going to get it," Lieberman said.</p>
        
            <p>"They told me they have people ready to offer more and pay cash. It's absolutely insane."</p>

            <p>Similar stories of apparent price gouging abound.</p>
        
            <p>"I have friends who booked a hotel outside Los Angeles, and when they arrived there, they</p>
        
            <p>were asked for a higher price," said TV producer Alex Smith, who has been forced to leave his</p>
        
            <p>home.</p>
        
            <p>The sharp practice has drawn the ire of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who warned</p>
        
            <p>on Saturday there are laws against it.</p>
        
            <p>"Price gouging is illegal. We will not stand for it. We will hold you accountable. We will</p>
        
            <p>prosecute," he told reporters, adding that those found guilty could land themselves a year in</p>
        
            <p>jail.</p>
        
            <p>Once a state of emergency is declared - as it has been for the out-of-control fires - vendors</p>
        
            <p>cannot increase their prices by more than 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>That applies to small businesses as well as to mega-companies whose automated tools use</p>
        
            <p>supply and demand to set the cost of everything from hotel stays to concert tickets.</p>
        
            <p>"If those algorithms lead to prices higher afer the declaration of emergency than before, by</p>
        
            <p>more than 10 percent, you're violating the law," Bonta said.</p>
        
            <p>"You need to figure out how to adjust your prices consistent with the law. And if that means</p>
        
            <p>departing from your algorithm, depart from your algorithm."</p>
        
            <p>The protections had been due to expire afer 30 to 180 days - but on Sunday, California</p>
        
            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order extending them until 7 Jaunary, 2026.</p>

            <p>But for Brian, a retiree who has been sleeping in his car since the evacuation order was raised,</p>
        
            <p>the rules protecting against price gouging are almost beside the point.</p>
        
            <p>The 69-year-old, who did not want to give his full name, had been living in a rent-controlled</p>
        
            <p>studio apartment in Pacific Palisades for two decades.</p>
        
            <p>That has now gone, and along with it the guarantee that his rent cannot rise.</p>
        
            <p>His pension, he fears, will not stretch far in a city where rents have doubled in the last 10</p>
        
            <p>years - a problem likely to be exacerbated by the sudden rush of people needing somewhere</p>
        
            <p>new to live.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm back on the market with tens of thousands of people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That doesn't bode well."</p>
