            <p>Czech police say more than 15 people have been killed in a shooting at a university in Prague.</p>
        
            <p>Police said 24 people had been injured, and the gunman's "lifeless body" was found at the university following the attack at Charles University, on Jan Palach Square in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he had cancelled upcoming engagements in light of the "tragic events".</p>
        
            <p>University staff were told to "stay put", barricade themselves in rooms and turn off the lights, Reuters reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the 24-year-old gunman was a student from a village 13km outside Prague. The suspect's father was found dead earlier in the day, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Targ Patience, a British-Australian who was staying in a flat near the scene, told the BBC that he heard "a lot of gunshots".</p>
        
            <p>"I looked out of my balcony and saw the police arrive. A few officers were having a hard time stopping people walking towards the scene," he sad.</p>
        
            <p>Verified images from the scene appeared to show people clinging onto the outside wall of the university building, several storeys up.</p>
        
            <p>Students said they had barricaded themselves in classrooms.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently stuck inside my classroom in Prague," Jakob Weizman, a student at Charles University, wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>"Locked the door before the shooter tried to open it."</p>
        
            <p>The mass shooting is not linked to international terrorism, Vit Rakusan, the Czech minister of the interior, told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor of Prague, Bohuslav Svoboda, told Czech media: "We always thought that this was a thing that did not concern us. Now it turns out that, unfortunately, our world is also changing and the problem of the individual shooter is emerging here as well."</p>

            <p>"We heard four loud gunshots," Joe Hyland, 18, from Truro, Cornwall, told the BBC. "Everyone was sprinting and running for cover."</p>
        
            <p>"I have a bad knee, am on a crutch. So I hobbled as quickly as possible," added Mr Hyland, who was his first holiday with friends. "We got to the metro and went down there because we thought it would be safest."</p>
        
            <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X that she was "shocked by the senseless violence". She added: "We stand and mourn with you."</p>
        
            <p>An email to staff at the philosophy faculty of Charles University, seen by Reuters, warned staff of the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>It read: "Stay put, don't go anywhere, if you're in the offices, lock them and place furniture in front of the door, turn off the lights."</p>
        
            <p>Authorities said the whole of the square and several streets around the university were closed.</p>
        
            <p>Charles University is located in Prague's Old Town, about 500m from the historic Charles Bridge, a tourist magnet.</p>
