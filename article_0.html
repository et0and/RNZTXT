        <h2>Watch live: Hipkins criticises PM's handling of Bayly resignation</h2>
        <p>
Hipkins is also expected to speak about the hundreds of charges laid under the new Gangs Act.

            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has criticised Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's handling of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly resignation.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly, National MP for Port Waikato, resigned his ministerial positions after what he said was an "animated discussion" that ended with him putting a hand on a staffer.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly said he took the discussion "too far", and described his own behaviour as "overbearing" and "inappropriate".</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins told media on Monday afternoon, Luxon "should have acted sooner".</p>
        
            <p>"Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible to get over it.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case, we now got ministers sacking themselves when the Prime Minister should have shown leadership and done that months ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Andrew Bayly should have been sacked when he called someone a loser for working late and told them to 'f off and go home'."</p>
