        <h2>200,000 litres of diesel has already leaked from Manawanui</h2>
        <p>
And RNZ sources say concerns had been raised about potential leakage from the ship's engine before it departed New Zealand.

            <p>Authorities in Samoa say 200,000 litres of diesel has leaked from the Manawanui since it sank on a reef last week.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand navy ship ran aground, caught fire and sank off the south coast of Upolu in Samoa earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The HMNZS Manawanui - a specialist dive and hydrographic vessel - had been conducting a reef survey when it hit the reef.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>The island nation's Marine Pollution Advisory Committee said there was substantial damage to the reef from the Manawanui's collision and friction from its anchor.</p>
        
            <p>It said the leak was at about 200,000 litres of diesel on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific reporter Susana Leiataua is in Samoa and said the damage spanned 5000 square metres but there was no sign of oil contamination on the reef and coastline.</p>
        
            <p>The Manawanui was lying about 35 metres below the water off the coast of Tafitoala, according to the committee's latest report on the sinking and its aftermath.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chairperson Fui Tupai Mau Simanu told RNZ divers were at the site to gather more information and to stop the fuel leaking.</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, the plan was to remove the remaining fuel from the Manawanui, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Chief of Navy, rear admiral Garin Golding, told Morning Report some 950 tonnes of diesel fuel were onboard the Manawanui when it sank. The fuel is a lighter oil which can partially evaporate, leaving long-chain hydrocarbons that are relatively less toxic.</p>
        
            <p>Sources had suggested to RNZ concerns had been raised about potential oil leakage from the ship's engine before it left.</p>
        
            <p>Golding was asked to provide assurance the ship was fully operational, with no concerns about maintenance prior to leaving.</p>
        
            <p>"The ship was in a maintenance period," he said. "It conducted that, they did trials post that maintenance period, and the ship was determined safe to deploy for their operation."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ is expected to speak with Commodore Andrew Brown, the Defence Force's Deputy Chief of Navy, in Samoa later on Saturday.</p>
