        <h2>Watch live: Govt wants to see better competition in banking sector</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon and Nicola Willis are speaking to media in the weekly post-Cabinet press conference.
</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced steps it will take to improve the competition in the banking sector during a post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said cabinet had agreed to enable Kiwibank to access more capital so it can compete more vigorously.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the Commerce Commission's report into the banking sector found it was uncompetitive, and New Zealanders were not well-served by it.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Nicola Willis are speaking to reporters at 4pm on Monday at the Beehive. We will be livestreaming it at the top of this page.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a progress update shows more than half of the government's key targets are behind track or at risk of not being met.</p>
