        <h2>Stats NZ boss to step down after Manurewa Marae inquiry</h2>
        <p>
The probe was launched last year after allegations data was misused during the 2023 campaign.
</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry into steps government agencies took to ensure personal Census and Covid vaccination data collected at Manurewa Marae could not be misused has found the agencies failed to put appropriate safeguards in place, and fell short of their responsibility to protect and manage the sharing of personal information.</p>
        
            <p>Government statistician and Stats NZ chief executive Mark Sowden would also stand down next month, the Public Service Commissioner announced on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Commission has now asked a number of agencies to temporarily suspend entering new contracts, or extending existing ones, with Te Pou Matakana, the Waipareira Trust, and Manurewa Marae, until it is satisfied the agencies' contracts are fit for purpose, and adequately deal with their obligations.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry was started last June, following allegations Census and Covid-19 vaccination data collected at the Marae was used to target Māori voters in the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate.</p>

            <p>Takutai Tarsh Kemp, the Marae's chief executive at the time, went on to narrowly win the electorate over Labour's Peeni Henare.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry looked at the specific actions of a number of government agencies.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ contracted the Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency to assist with a "last-ditch" attempt to collect Census data from people Stats NZ had been unable to reach.</p>
        
            <p>While the report says the Census was a success due to this, Stats NZ's application of a high-trust model in relation to the collection of the data meant the usual confidentiality protections were not put in place.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry found Stats NZ had "insufficient" safeguards to protect personal information, leading to a risk personal information collected by the third-parties on Stats NZ's behalf could be used for an improper purpose.</p>
        
            <p>Risks of conflicts, privacy breaches, and poor process were identified but not dealt with.</p>

            <p>As a result, Sowden will not seek re-appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"His decision to step down reflects the standard of accountability expected of public service chief executives," Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche said.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Health New Zealand also had no safeguards in place to address possible conflicts of interest arising from the sharing of personal information.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ, the Ministry of Health, Health New Zealand, and Te Puni Kōkiri have been asked to temporarily suspend new contracts, renewals, and extensions with the three providers.</p>
        
            <p>Whether the data collected was actually misused for electoral purposes was outside the scope of the inquiry, but has been referred to other authorities for investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster said it showed government agencies must be better at protecting people's privacy.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders need to be confident that when they do activities, like filling in their Census form, or giving over information for medical services, that their information is collected, used, and shared as the law outlines it should be," he said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"The Privacy Act is very clear that agencies collecting personal information need to keep it safe and treat it with care. This responsibility extends to the use of third-party service providers.</p>
        
            <p>"Agencies need to be confident that personal information is protected wherever and whatever organisation is handling it."</p>
        
            <p>Webster said work on a new information sharing standard was underway, which would support "the information stewardship framework at the core of the Privacy Act".</p>
        
            <p>"It's important people can trust that their information is treated with care. In our 2024 privacy survey, the percentage of people who said they are 'more concerned' about privacy issues over the last few years has increased to 55 percent," up 14 percent on two years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner will now be looking into:</p>
