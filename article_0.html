            <p>Syria's army command has notified officers that President Bashar al-Assad's rule has ended following a lightning rebel offensive, a Syrian officer who was informed of the move told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Syrian rebels said Damascus was "now free of Assad".</p>
        
            <p>Earlier Assad flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.</p>
        
            <p>Follow our live updates here:</p>
        
            <p>Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting "Freedom", witnesses said.</p>
        
            <p>"We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," said the rebels.</p>
        
            <p>Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.</p>
        
            <p>A Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was reported to have been taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters could not immediately ascertain who was on board.</p>
        
            <p>The head of Syria's main opposition group abroad Hadi al-Bahra Syrian on Sunday also declared that Damascus is now "without Bashar al-Assad".</p>
        
            <p>Just hours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting, leaving Assad's 24-year rule dangling by a thread.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting "Assad is gone, Homs is free" and "Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad".</p>
        
            <p>Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military.</p>
