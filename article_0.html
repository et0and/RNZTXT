            <p>Kāpiti Boating Club says the missing jetskier who set out across the Cook Strait from the Tasman District on Monday is a retired grandfather and long-time club member.</p>
        
            <p>The man vanished after setting out to cross the Cook Strait from the Tasman District.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man launched on Monday morning but never arrived at his destination at Plimmerton Beach in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>His jetski had been found at Cook Rock, off the top off the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Commodore John Smith said the man had met up with friends and was getting ready to head back before he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>"When he arrived there weren't any issues from what I understand."</p>
        
            <p>He said the man had made the trip in a jetski many times with no issues and they were shocked he had gone missing.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully the search people and police are out in full mode. We are just hoping he will be located."</p>
        
            <p>He said the boating club was supporting the man's family.</p>
        
            <p>"They are all together at the moment and putting on a very brave face."</p>
        
            <p>The search and rescue operation began on Monday and police and SAR teams have today been conducting a water search with the assistance of Coastguard and the Rescue Coordination Centre.</p>
