        <h2>Watch live: The Treaty Principles Bill is 'dead', Peters tells Rātana</h2>
        <p>
The controversial bill will go no further, the NZ First leader has said in his speech at Rātana.
</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill is "dead in the water", New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has said in his speech at Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>The bill will "never going to go past the first reading", Peters told those in attendance on Friday at the movement's largest gathering for the year.</p>
        
            <p>It follows New Zealand First's Shane Jones telling people not to waste any more energy opposing the controversial bill, because it will never see the light of day.</p>

            <p>Earlier, a Māori leader said the Rātana celebrations would be a chance for the prime minister to front up to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Followers of the Rātana Church, called mōrehu, gather at the small settlement south of Whanganui each year in January to celebrate the birthday of the movement's founder, Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, on 25 January.</p>

            <p>The event traditionally marks the start of the political year, as politicians arrive to pay tribute to the movement and engage with Māori leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Rātana was known for its longstanding alliance with the Labour Party, with candidates from a Rātana background holding the Māori seats for several decades.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer won the Te Tai Hauāuru seat, of which Rātana Pā is a part, at the last election.</p>

            <p>Luxon was expected, along with Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins and members of New Zealand First and the Green Party.</p>
        
            <p>ACT was the only party not attending the celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Tainui leader Tuku Morgan told RNZ the gathering would be a chance for the prime minister to front up to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"He may not be fronting up in Waitangi, he made that clear, but he can't run forever."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon's decision to skip Waitangi commemorations was a symbol of the government's inability to find "meaningful solutions" for Māori issues, Morgan said.</p>

            <p>"Right now, anything meaningful has been crushed and annihilated."</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister said he enjoyed going to Rātana, adding it was not a deeply political occasion.</p>
        
            <p>"My message will be really about how do we move forward as a country a little bit, how do we make sure we respect the Treaty, how do we respect each other? It doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything, but actually it means we should still be very focussed on the goal of making New Zealand better," Luxon said.</p>

            <p>He said there were "a number of opportunities" regarding where he would attend Waitangi commemorations, which would be confirmed closer to the time.</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said the prime minister was being led by ACT, pointing to recent appointments at the Waitangi Tribunal - among them, former ACT leader Richard Prebble.</p>
        
            <p>"The political landscape has shown us that the legacy of Luxon isn't a legacy that will be largely remembered positively by te ao Māori."</p>
