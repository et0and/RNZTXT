            <p>Firefighters are battling three grass fires near Burnham in Canterbury, closing a section of State Highway 1 as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said calls came in about one big fire and two smaller ones, near the intersection on Selwyn Lake Rd with Telegraph Rd, at about 1.30pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Sixteen fire trucks, tankers and support vehicles are at the scene along with five helicopters.</p>
        
            <p>The public are asked to avoid the area and follow instructions of firefighters if they were already in the area.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said State Highway 1 was closed between Leeston Dunsandel Rd and Burnham Rd due to the fires.</p>
        
            <p>It was likely SH1 would be "closed for some time", a Fire and Emergency spokesperson said.</p>
