            <p>A woman has died following a water incident at the Rakaia River mouth in Canterbury this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Another person is in critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Around 1pm emergency services responded to the south side of the Rakaia River mouth, following reports a group had become stuck in the river after attempting to cross on quad bikes.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier told RNZ that "several people have received injuries, and we are assisting them at the scene currently."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand, police and Hato Hone St John responded, with the assistance of a member of the public in a private vessel.</p>
        
            <p>Of the six people recovered, one person was located deceased and one person was transported to hospital in a critical condition by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
