        <h2>Watch live: Collins announces $571 million Defence spend-up</h2>
        <p>
An extra half a billion dollars is going to Defence in this year's Budget for pay and equipment upgrades, the Defence Minister has announced.
</p>
        
            <p>More than half a billion dollars is going to defence in this year's Budget to improve pay for the frontline and upgrade equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins made the pre-Budget announcement at Burnham Military Camp near Christchurch on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The overall Budget boost is $571 million, to be mostly spent over four years, with the exception of $19m of capital funding, which will be allocated to the 2028 to 2031 financial cycle.</p>
        
            <p>In total $163m will be assigned to improved remuneration for uniformed personnel and $408m will go toward projects and infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The project funding will be broken down into $127m in operating funding and $281m in capital funding.</p>
        
            <p>A small portion of the new funding has been clawed back from savings within the New Zealand Defence Force.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said $99m of the $107m in savings is from the New Zealand Defence Force, which will be reinvested into remuneration and the other $8m was found within the Ministry of Defence.</p>
        
            <p>Those savings have come from projects ending and "a reduction in international and domestic travel, as well as a decrease in spending on contractors and consultants", Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>Any major projects already planned and underway are expected to continue.</p>
        
            <p>"Subject to Cabinet approval, a project will begin to replace the Unimog and Pinzgauer trucks, the NZDF's workhorses, and most frequently deployed vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>"Replacement vehicles will have integrated communications that will enhance interoperability with regional and global partners, such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States," Collins said.</p>

            <p>The other projects for which funding has been allocated through Budget 24, subject to Cabinet approval, are:</p>
        
            <p>Collins said retaining personnel and having them equipped to do their jobs is vital to ensure "New Zealand is ready, willing and - crucially - able to play its part internationally".</p>
        
            <p>"NZDF personnel are at the frontline of New Zealand's security but they cannot do their jobs without the right equipment and conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"The world is increasingly unstable. We have only to look at events in the Ukraine and Middle East to see how quickly people's lives can change," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"This Budget announcement is a signal that New Zealand is ready to step up and play its part to protect the freedoms that so many of us take for granted."</p>
        
            <p>The next step for defence is the Capability Plan, which Collins said "will shape our future investment decisions around the equipment we need as we step up".</p>
        
            <p>There is renewed interest in defence spending at present because of talks the government has been having on possibly joining Tier 2 of the AUKUS agreement between the US, Australia and Britain.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters has repeatedly played down the prospect, saying New Zealand hasn't been invited to join and he doesn't know what it would entail.</p>
        
            <p>However, if New Zealand did decide to join, it is expected more spending on defence would be required from allies.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Finance Minister Nicola Willis gave a major pre-Budget speech in the Hutt Valley, and in the process ruled out an austerity Budget and reaffirmed her commitment to tax cuts for most New Zealanders.</p>
