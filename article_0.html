            <p>Public libraries in New Zealand are playing a pivotal role in fostering a culture of community engagement and inclusivity.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been an avid user of the public libraries in New Zealand since I came here," says Jayakrishnan Sreekumar, who moved to Wellington in 2018 and has been a frequent visitor to libraries in the capital as part of his postgraduate studies in communication.</p>
        
            <p>Indeed, Sreekumar admits to spending entire days at the library - not only to read books but also taking advantage of other services such as free Wi-Fi.</p>
        
            <p>Although the 36-year-old graduated in August, he continues to visit libraries.</p>
        
            <p>"My kids love the libraries [in Wellington]," Sreekumar says. "I get books for them now."</p>
        
            <p>Zoe Miller, 46, also used to frequent public libraries in the capital when she was a teenager.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to go to the Central Library in Wellington," Miller says. "It was a wonderful place to go when you're in the city. We used to lie down in the children's section because it had pillows and everything."</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward to 2023, Miller now handles multicultural community engagement for Wellington City Libraries.</p>
        
            <p>"I work with a lot of different ethnic communities," Miller says. "We have a variety of titles for the South Asian community."</p>

            <p>Hindi was the seventh most borrowed non-English language title at Wellington City Library in 2023 and the third most borrowed Asian language after Mandarin and Japanese.</p>
        
            <p>The library also offers books in Tamil, Punjabi, Gujarati, Sinhalese, Arabic and Korean.</p>
        
            <p>Miller says Wellington's new central library, Te Matapihi, will have a dedicated section for World Languages.</p>
        
            <p>She says the library has a wide variety of books in English about diverse cultures.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a special Diwali celebrations collection," Miller says.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, public libraries in Auckland hold books and materials in six different Indian languages.</p>
        
            <p>Hindi tops the list with 2450 books, Gujarati comes in second with 1399, and Punjabi is third with 1525.</p>
        
            <p>Notably, Auckland's Panmure and Mt Roskill libraries also display books written in Tamil, a South Indian language.</p>
        
            <p>"Within our general English language collection, we hold over 7000 books about India, covering a wide range of subjects, including history, literature, culture, art, travel and politics," says Catherine Leonard, head of Library & Learning Services at Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>Leonard says the allocation of languages is decided by census data, customer and staff feedback, and usage data.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, Christchurch City Libraries has been serving ethnic communities for many years.</p>
        
            <p>"Christchurch City Libraries provide spaces for community groups to share and promote their culture, and we have hosted Diwali events annually," says Carolyn Robertson, head of Libraries & Information at Christchurch City Council.</p>
        
            <p>She says the library has hosted dance performances and musical groups to help users connect with the city's diverse communities.</p>
        
            <p>The library also offers a mix of physical and digital material on various subjects and genres relating to India, including geography, arts, history, philosophy, cooking, literature and music.</p>

            <p>Miller says public libraries are more than just a place for users to get their favorite book, offering migrants and ethnic communities important outreach opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"I think libraries are well-placed to promote bilingualism and multilingualism," Miller says. "It is important to retain your culture and heritage when you move to a new country and bring up your children."</p>
        
            <p>Miller encourages ethnic communities to use library facilities.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have to be reading," Miller says. "You can use the Wi-Fi, bring your kids so they can play with some toys. We have computers if you need that."</p>
        
            <p>Miller says a justice of the peace can be found at many libraries, offering migrants important assistannce.</p>
        
            <p>Sreekumar agrees.</p>
        
            <p>"(Libraries) helped me a lot during my studies but now the libraries are helping my kids," he says.</p>
