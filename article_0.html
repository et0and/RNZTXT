            <p>Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that fueled the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.</p>
        
            <p>In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.</p>
        
            <p>"The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.</p>
        
            <p>Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.</p>
        
            <p>He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.</p>
        
            <p>"We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, said in an email.</p>
        
            <p>Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance, brought the New York case.</p>
        
            <p>Bragg's office was separately in the middle of a criminal hush money trial against former US President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Arthur Aidala, a lawyer for Weinstein, called the decision a victory for his client and any American charged with a crime, "no matter how popular or unpopular they are."</p>
        
            <p>Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone.</p>
        
            <p>Ashley Judd, the actress and one of Weinstein's accusers, at a press conference called the decision "an act of institutional betrayal."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Madeline Singas dissented, saying the decision "perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence" and makes holding defendants accountable for sexual assault "significantly more difficult."</p>
        
            <p>She also accused the majority of whitewashing the facts and continuing what she called a "disturbing trend" of overturning jury verdicts in sexual violence cases.</p>
        
            <p>"New York's women deserve better," Singas wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The New York conviction had been considered a milestone for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.</p>
        
            <p>"Some thought the [Los Angeles] case to be superfluous," Elizabeth Fegan, a lawyer for some Weinstein accusers, said in an email. "Now we realize how important it was."</p>
        
            <p>Aidala, Weinstein's attorney, said he believed the New York decision could influence a California appeals court which was considering whether to overturn that conviction. The California trial similarly featured testimony about his alleged past misconduct as part of the prosecutors' case.</p>
        
            <p>The New York appeals court also said the trial judge compounded its error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behavior that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," said the ruling.</p>
        
            <p>Weinstein was convicted in February 2020 in Manhattan of sexually assaulting former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The charges on which he was convicted were first-degree sexual assault and third-degree rape. Jurors acquitted him on other charges.</p>
        
            <p>Weinstein's trial judge, James Burke, was not reappointed to the bench after his term expired at the end of 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Some states, including New York, responded to the #MeToo movement by passing laws that let women bring civil lawsuits seeking damages for sexual misconduct that occurred many years earlier even if statutes of limitations had already passed.</p>
        
            <p>Weinstein co-founded the Miramax film studio, whose hit movies included "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction." His own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018.</p>
        
            <p>He joins former comedian Bill Cosby among those who have had sexual assault convictions overturned.</p>
        
            <p>Cosby's 2018 conviction was overturned three years later by Pennsylvania's highest court. The majority said a 2005 agreement by prosecutors not to charge Cosby with drugging and assaulting a woman meant he should not have been charged a decade later.</p>
