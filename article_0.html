        <h2>How Israel's 'Iron Dome' stops missile attacks</h2>
        <p>
Israel says about 180 missiles were fired by Iran but most were intercepted. How does the system work and how much does it cost?

            <p>Israel's Iron Dome air defence system has intercepted thousands of rockets since it went into operation in 2011, providing the country with crucial cover during times of conflict.</p>
        
            <p>It has been heavily relied upon to protect military and civilian sites from frequent barrages of rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's air defences were in operation on Tuesday night, when Iran fired missiles at Israel in what it said was a response to Israel's killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi said that the Iranian barrage had been blunted partly by "a very strong aerial defence array".</p>
        
            <p>The system had also intercepted more than 200 drones and missiles launched by Iran on 13 April.</p>
        
            <p>Israel initially developed the Iron Dome alone after the 2006 Lebanon War, and was later joined by the United States, which has provided its defence know-how and billions of dollars in financial support for the program.</p>
        
            <p>The system has an interception rate of around 90 percent, according to Israeli defence firm Rafael, which helped design it.</p>
        
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        
            <p>The Iron Dome is one part of Israel's multi-tiered missile defence systems and is designed to intercept short-range rockets at a distance of up to 70 kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>Each Iron Dome battery is made up of three main sections: a radar detection system, a computer to calculate the incoming rocket's trajectory, and a launcher that fires interceptors if the rocket is deemed likely to hit a built-up or strategic area.</p>
        
            <p>It sits alongside other missile defence systems like the Arrow, which counters ballistic missiles, and David's Sling, for medium-range rocket or missile attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Each Iron Dome interceptor costs US$40,000 to US$50,000 to produce, according to the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
        
            <p>The think tank estimated that a complete system, including the radar, computer and three to four launchers - each containing up to 20 interceptors - costs around US$100 million to produce.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has 10 such systems in operation, according to Raytheon, which helps manufacture the Iron Dome. Other estimates have put the figure slightly higher.</p>
        
            <p>The Iron Dome is one of the strategic pillars of the US-Israeli alliance that has been followed by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>
        
            <p>In August 2019 the US Army signed a contract to purchase two Iron Dome batteries to enhance its own short-range missile defence capabilities.</p>
