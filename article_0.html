            <p>Health NZ has accepted just over 400 applications from staff to take voluntary redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>It called for voluntary redundancies in August as it tries to cut costs to head off a huge deficit.</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive, Margie Apa, said they were continuing to assess applications.</p>
        
            <p>She said front-line clinical staff were not eligible.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ said it was unable to talk about what effect the redundancies would have on budgets while the process was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Voluntary redundancy was offered to a limited number of staff working in administration, policy advisory and specialist services.</p>
        
            <p>Junior doctors warned losing admin support would hurt patients as they would have less time to care for them.</p>
