            <p>Dunedin and the Clutha District remain under a state of emergency, after the Otago region was pummelled by heavy rain Thursday and Friday, causing flooding and land slips.</p>
        
            <p>A red heavy rain alert for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha was lifted Friday night and there are now no warnings or watches in place in those regions.</p>

            <p>Nine homes have been red-stickered in Dunedin, it was announced Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Civil Defence and Emergency Management confirmed the red-sticker notices have been issued but the location of the houses couldn't be confirmed at present.</p>
        
            <p>A red sticker means the house is not safe to occupy at present.</p>
        
            <p>Rapid assessments of slip-affected properties are also underway in Dunedin, to check whether they are safe for residents to return to.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin City Council urged residents with flooded properties to contact their insurance advisor.</p>
        
            <p>Community spirit is being felt in the Otago town of Milton, with one resident opening the doors of her community space to house evacuated residents.</p>
        
            <p>Tess Potae has lived in the area for 21 years and said she thought this week's deluge was not as bad as previous storms.</p>
        
            <p>She opened the property she owns around the corner from her home, to help flood-ravaged residents.</p>
        
            <p>"We call it a whare, and we had the facilities for the doors to be open for anyone that was stranded.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably housed 20-odd people."</p>
        
            <p>Potae said she is relieved the sky is now clearing.</p>
        
            <p>A Macandrew Bay resident said he was impressed by how prepared and responsive the council and emergency teams have been to the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Footpaths on Portobello Road are still covered in a thick layer of mud.</p>
        
            <p>The local man, who did not wish to be named, told RNZ he was pleased by how quickly clean-up began.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been really impressed by the recovery, eh?</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like the council's been really prepared. You know, as soon as daybreak broke today there was people out and a big convoy of trucks all ready to go. It's been really impressive."</p>
        
            <p>Road access to the Dunedin settlement is still only open to residents.</p>

            <p>As the region moves into recovery mode, State Highway 1 north and south of Dunedin has been reopened.</p>
        
            <p>But the Port Chalmers highway, State Highway 88, will remain closed over the weekend except for residents and emergency services.</p>

            <p>The Dunedin City Council said the the welfare centre at Forsyth Barr stadium is likely to close tonight when the last three families there have temporary accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence payments are available through the Ministry of Social Development for people impacted by flooding in Dunedin, Otago and coastal Clutha.</p>
        
            <p>The payments can help with emergency food, clothing and bedding. Emergency Management Otago said it can also covers costs if you've had to leave your home; a payment if you have evacuees staying with you in places such as a private home, marae or community centres.</p>
        
            <p>If you are a farmer or grower, or a worker or live on a farming business, Emergency Management Otago said support is available through your local Rural Support Trust. The number is 0800 787 254.</p>
        
            <p>Please contact your milk supplier if you have any concerns about milk collection, it added.</p>

            <p>A precautionary boil water notice is also in effect for parts of Dunedin's West Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are being warned of the risk of gastro due to floodwater and silt being contaminated with sewage.</p>

            <p>PowerNet said it could not yet confirm when power will be restored due to road closures and unsafe conditions.</p>
