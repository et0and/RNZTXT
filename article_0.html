        <h2>Watch: Auckland Transport stripped of responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
The government is introducing "significant reforms" for the city's transport policies.
</p>
        
            <p>A shake-up of Auckland's transport agency will see it stripped of decision-making powers to focus on delivering public transport services.</p>
        
            <p>Transport and Auckland Minister Simeon Brown and Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown announced the plan on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A new Auckland Regional Transport Committee will make policy and planning decisions instead of Auckland Transport (AT).</p>
        
            <p>The alterations to AT require legislative changes over the next 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>The transport minister said the city's existing transport governance model was falling short of meeting the expectations of the government, Auckland Council and Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>"By returning decision making power to elected representatives we're enabling Auckalnders to directly influence the transport policies that affect their daily lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Under the reforms, Auckland councillors would be responsible for approving the Regional Land Transport plan and the Regional Public Transport Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"If Aucklanders feel the transport system isn't working for them or disagree with the decisions made by the elected members they can hold them accountable at the ballot box."</p>
        
            <p>Minister Brown said communities would have more say over transport issues such as parking policies, setting of speed limits, approval of cycle ways and pedestrian crossings.</p>

            <p>As part of his mayoral campaign, Wayne Brown promised to take back control of council controlled organisations including AT.</p>
        
            <p>He said returning regional transport policy and planning to Auckland Council would give the city's residents more say.</p>
        
            <p>"These changes will restore local democracy to Auckland by removing AT's independence and giving back control to elected members."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the existing model was broken because of a "badly designed system" and a legal framework that "was not fit for purpose".</p>
        
            <p>He said delivering public transport would become AT's focus instead of "a plethora of other things which council should be doing".</p>
        
            <p>"To have AT focusing on running the buses and the trains and doing the ferries is exactly what they should be doing. We don't ask bus companies to design the system in which they work, they just deliver the services. I think this is a very sensible result and it's along the lines of what I've been thinking of for three or four years now," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"Councillors are elected to run a multibillion dollar ...if we can run all the parks and reserves and planning and buildings consents this is just yet another bit where we will actually be making decisions about how AT deliver those services whereas at the moment they've been making decisions which have often not been what we want."</p>
        
            <p>AT chief executive Dean Kimpton said the agency acknowledged the planned reforms which "sets a clear direction for transport governance and decision-making in our region".</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate there is a legislative process to follow over the next 12 months, and we look forward to working with the Government and Auckland Council throughout this process," Kimpton said.</p>
        
            <p>"While that proceeds, AT is focused on delivering our biggest ever public transport investment programme with CRL and Eastern Busway, our largest ever road maintenance and renewals programme, and technology investments to improve road network safety, performance and travel times."</p>
        
            <p>The new Auckland Regional Transport Committee will be formed to develop a 30-year Integrated Transport Plan for Auckland, considering the city's needs across roads, rail, public transport, and freight.</p>
        
            <p>This plan will be agreed by both central and local government - Cabinet and Auckland Council.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council will be designated as the Road Controlling Authority with decision-making shared between the council's governing body and local boards.</p>
