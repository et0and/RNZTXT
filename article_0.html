        <h2>Three dead in Auckland motorway crash, police confirm</h2>
        <p>
Another three were injured in the multi-vehicle crash which has closed SH1 in both directions near Ramarama.
</p>
        
            <p>Three people have died and another three have been seriously injured in a multi-vehicle crash on Auckland's State Highway 1, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The crash near Ramarama was reported at 1.47pm on Monday and has closed the highway in both directions.</p>
        
            <p>Counties Manukau road policing manager Inspector Tony Wakelin said it appeared that the vehicles had collided while in the northbound lanes, but an investigation will determine exactly how this happened.</p>
        
            <p>"The three deceased were travelling in the same vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"This many fatalities at once is shocking and our thoughts go out to all those affected.</p>
        
            <p>"Incidents like this are hard on everyone involved and we are making sure there is support in place for those involved, their families, and our staff who have attended the scene."</p>
        
            <p>Wakelin said another person was in a critical condition and two others are seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists heading south are being diverted at Ararimu Road, Ramarama and northbound motorists are being diverted at Mill Road, Bombay.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit is in attendance, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who witnessed the crash is asked to contact police, especially if they have dashcam footage.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the crash at today's post-Cabinet media briefing, Transport Minister Simeon Brown said: "Obviously it's a very tragic incident, there's been a number of fatalities but obviously there's an investigation and closure in place."</p>

            <p>Tamati Cassin, a motorist who arrived at the scene about 30 seconds after the crash, said he saw three bodies in a van as well as three other people with injuries.</p>
        
            <p>As he approached the scene in his car, Cassin said he saw a "big dust cloud" across the motorway and the wire from a metal barrier was strewn across the lanes.</p>

            <p>"I had to pull over and I got out of my car - I wish I didn't now, I wish I didn't see the bodies.</p>
        
            <p>"There were several cars involved but the van was the worst and even the truck was pretty smashed up on the cab it's a tragic, tragic accident."</p>
        
            <p>Cassin said everyone got out of their cars to try and help the injured and dead but it was "chaos" and no one was sure what to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I just really feel for the driver of the truck and the people who have passed, I get to go home to my partner and kid but they won't get to."</p>
        
            <p>He said over an hour later, he was still in traffic trying to get home to Papakura.</p>

            <p>St John said it sent 10 vehicles to the scene, including a helicopter, at 1.45pm and treated eight patients in varying conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Six patients were transferred to "various destinations" including Auckland City Hospital and Middlemore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Of the eight patients treated, St John said one was critical, three were moderate and four had minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said all lanes on SH1 between Bombay and Ramarama are closed due to the significant crash.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Checkpoint, NZTA Auckland systems manager Paul Geck said the worst case scenario would be the road remaining closed until 5am on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>At this stage, Geck said the closure will "go into tonight" but he could not give an exact time.</p>
        
            <p>Geck said there were "reasonable queues" on the motorway and traffic was slow on the detour route through Great South Road.</p>
        
            <p>He said parents should still be able to get to local schools but there would be "significant delays".</p>
        
            <p>Geck said people should check NZTA's social media updates and travel times before they travelled - and plan to delay travelling both north and south in the area if possible.</p>
        
            <p>A livestream video from the scene of the crash showed a van and a car which appeared to be badly damaged, along with a truck which was off the side of the motorway.</p>
        
            <p>UPDATE - ROAD CLOSED 2:15PMAll lanes are CLOSED in both directions #SH1 between Bombay & Ramarama. Delay your journey or allow extra time for detours. Follow directions of response crews at scene. MORE:https://t.co/VZ58sV07as https://t.co/CY3pjcHdRf</p>
        
            <p>A crowd of people could be seen helping those involved in the crash, and giving first aid to a person lying on the ground.</p>
