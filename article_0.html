            <p>Former climate change minister James Shaw has revealed he came "really close" to resigning his post under the previous Labour government over disagreements on climate change and biodiversity.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw, who entered Parliament as a list MP in 2014, announced his resignation as Green Party co-leader in January.</p>
        
            <p>He said at the time it had been the "privilege of my lifetime" to serve as climate change minister for six years and Green co-leader for nearly nine.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very proud of what the Green Party has achieved over the last eight years."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw, who also served as associate environment minister (biodiversity) during the Labour government's second term, will give his valedictory speech on Wednesday,</p>
        
            <p>In an interview aired on Sunday, he told Q+A host Jack Tame there were a "few times" that he got "really close" to resigning his ministerial portfolios over the years.</p>
        
            <p>The most significant was when the government was debating whether to increase its greenhouse gas emissions target under the Paris Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's target had been set by the previous National government. It really wasn't equal to our kind of position," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a really hard-fought battle. There were days there where I thought, 'I'm not sure that I can represent the country as climate change minister' if we don't have a target that is, at least on average, the equivalent of other OECD countries."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw said the other instance where he nearly resigned was during discussions on the National Policy Statement on Indigenous Biodiversity.</p>
        
            <p>"That got really difficult and I ended up storming out of the Cabinet meeting that decided it."</p>
        
            <p>He said he had drafted his resignation letter over the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Indigenous biodiversity was in "absolute crisis" at the time, he said and Aotearoa had "gone 30 years without national direction on it".</p>
        
            <p>Former conservation minister Nick Smith had started trying to tackle the problem under John Key's National government, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm like, 'If the National Party could find themselves to fix this problem, surely we can, right?'</p>
        
            <p>"It just kind of outraged me that it was that hard."</p>
        
            <p>Shaw said minutes after he stormed out of the Cabinet meeting, the-environment minister David Parker "materialised" in his office to try and figure out a way forward.</p>
        
            <p>The Labour government should have been more courageous on climate change, and the agricultural sector was now ahead of politicians, he told Q+A.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got organisations like Fonterra and Silver Fern who have committed themselves to something like a 30 percent reduction by 2030 ... [it's] a very, very different position from where we were three, four, five, six or 10 years ago."</p>
        
            <p>Those businesses were being "led by their customers", Shaw said.</p>
        
            <p>"At Fieldays last year, you know, Cadbury had a tent where they were handing out leaflets saying, 'we're looking for  30 percent reduction, and if you don't do it we're going to stop buying from you'."</p>
        
            <p>The way that He Waka Eke Noa - a project to reduce agricultural emissions - had been organised under the Labour government was wrong, Shaw said, and it should have been "parked" with the Treasury.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, it had been left to the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry for Primary Industries.</p>
        
            <p>"The kind of tensions between those agencies was a big part of the problem."</p>
