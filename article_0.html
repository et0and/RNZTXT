Mangawhai has been compared to a war zone, with houses destroyed, roofs torn off, debris scattered across roads and power poles ripped out.

            <p>It could take months for storm damage in Mangawhai to be fully repaired after a devastating tornado, Kaipara Civil Defence expects.</p>
        
            <p>At least 50 homes were damaged, and trees and about 20 power poles downed, when the storm ripped through the Northland township about 3am on Sunday, leaving roads covered in debris.Multiple houses had roofs torn off and a few homes and a business were destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Nick Berthoud, owner of a house on Old Waipu Road, said he had only lived in it for one year before it was destroyed in the storm.</p>
        
            <p>"Two years to build, been one year in it and now this," Nick Berthoud told RNZ. "Yeah, a bit devastating.</p>
        
            <p>So far, three properties have been yellow stickered - restricting entry - and another has been white-stickered, meaning it's damaged but people can go inside.</p>
