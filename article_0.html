        <h2>Watch live: 'Series of human errors' caused Manawanui to sink</h2>
        <p>
And a disciplinary process will follow, the Navy chief says. Follow the announcement live.
</p>
        
            <p>The HMNZS Manawanui grounded and sank off the coast of Samoa as a result of human error, an interim report has found.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal New Zealand Navy ship hit a reef on the southern side of Samoa on 5 October while conducting survey operations.</p>
        
            <p>Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding launched a Court of Inquiry afterwards and has just released its interim findings.</p>
        
            <p>"The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship's autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been," Golding said.</p>
        
            <p>"The crew did not realise Manawanui remained in autopilot and, as a consequence, mistakenly believed its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure."</p>

            <p>Golding said "standard procedures" should have prompted the ship's crew to check the vessel was under manual control, rather than autopilot.</p>
        
            <p>"This check did not occur. Remaining in autopilot resulted in the ship maintaining a course toward land, until grounding and eventually stranding."</p>
        
            <p>Golding said why this had happened and what would come next were still being worked on as part of the wider Court of Inquiry, expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year.</p>

            <p>A separate disciplinary process would commence after the Inquiry was over given the sinking was caused by human error, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To provide some immediate assurance, we have conducted a series of audits in the Fleet and looked to implement initial lessons identified from the interim report around training, risk management, and improving relevant orders, instructions and procedures."</p>
        
            <p>Golding said he was grateful for the support from the Transport Accident Investigation Committee (TAIC), the Royal Australian Navy, and Royal New Zealand Air Force for their support to the Court of Inquiry investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Evidence had been collected through interviews with the crew, expert witnesses and data from the ship's recordings to find the primary cause of the disaster.</p>

            <p>He said the Defence Force was thankful for Samoa's ongoing support and remained committed to working with Samoan authorities on the response.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to reassure the public of New Zealand that we will learn from this situation and that it is on me, as the Chief of Navy, to earn back your trust."</p>
        
            <p>The Interim Court of Inquiry report will not be released in full, with a public version of the final Court of Inquiry to be made available around March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
