            <p>A man searching far and wide for his missing father for three days says the disappearance 'just doesn't make sense':</p>
        
            <p>Bret Hill, 50, was last seen at 5.30pm on Sunday on Hillside Drive in the Upper Hutt suburb of Māoribank.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked locals to check CCTV and their properties for any sign Hill may have been there, such as a shed left open or items out of place.</p>
        
            <p>His son Trenton Hill, 20, told RNZ police commenced a large search effort after his father had been missing for 48 hours.</p>
        
            <p>"They are checking all CCTV in the area, we [have] found a couple of videos of him walking on Fergusson Drive by Māoribank up the top of the hill."</p>
        
            <p>He said in the video he was headed towards Totara Park or the nearby duck pond, so they had been focusing their search efforts near there.</p>
        
            <p>Trenton said they had received reported sightings across the Lower Hutt area and in Porirua, but they had not turned out to be his father.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ his father's car and most of his belongings were still at home.</p>
        
            <p>"[He took] his vape, his phone and a couple [of] smokes, but other than that it is very unusual for him to leave a full pack of smokes at home when he goes off like this."</p>
        
            <p>Trenton said his dad had just got a new job and had been doing really well for the past three years. He said he had a past of mental health issues, but it had been a long time since he had "an episode".</p>
        
            <p>"It's been three years, nearly four years since the last episode, so this coming out of nowhere, just doesn't make sense."</p>
        
            <p>Hill said the key locations for the search were Fergusson Drive, Trentham, Silverstream, Totara Park Harcourt Park, Naenae and Taita.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ if someone saw something of note, people could contact him via his Facebook profile "Trent Bone".</p>
        
            <p>The 50-year-old was described as 195cm tall, of solid build, with black hair and a short, white beard. He was last seen wearing black shorts, a dark green t-shirt, a black hoodie, black jandals and a cap.</p>
