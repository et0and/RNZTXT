Labour says the government's books show the Finance Minister's claims of self-funded tax cuts don't add up.

            <p>Labour says the government's mini-Budget shows finance minister Nicola Willis' claims of self-funded tax cuts do not add up.</p>
        
            <p>Willis unveiled her promised mini-Budget on Wednesday alongside the Treasury's Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update, outlining plans to tighten public spending while safeguarding public services - and delivering the government's promised tax relief next year.</p>
        
            <p>It set out $2.61 billion of savings made since the coalition took office, and showed she had directed government agencies to find $1.5b of savings per year, informed by their staff numbers from 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said in a statement the "so-called" mini-Budget was nothing more than "a litany of distractions, delays and diversions which leave the country without any certainty or coherent economic plan".</p>
        
            <p>"Today was a test for Nicola Willis as finance minister to finally reveal what her government was going to do and how they were going to pay for it. She has failed that test and left New Zealanders in limbo. How the government is going to pay for the inflationary tax cuts she has promised remains a mystery she refuses to solve."</p>
        
            <p>He said Willis' narrative about the previous Labour government consistently ignored reports by global ratings agencies and international organisations which backed the "strength and resilience of our economy".</p>
        
            <p>"The facts are that the New Zealand economy is around 7 percent larger than before Covid, unemployment has been at record lows, wages are rising and our debt levels are lower than most of the economies we compare ourselves too. It has been a tough year for New Zealanders with cost of living pressures as inflation peaked. But it is now on a downward track."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
