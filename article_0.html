            <p>At least 85 people were killed when an airliner veered off the runway and erupted into a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea's Muan International Airport on Sunday, the national fire agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were rescued, the agency said, and an official told Reuters they were crew members.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred as Jeju Air flight 7C2216, carrying 175 passengers and six crew on a flight from the Thai capital Bangkok, was landing shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry did not confirm the reports of casualties.</p>
        
            <p>At least 58 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, another fire official told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were found alive and rescue operations were still under way, a Muan fire official said. The official and the transport ministry could not confirm the reports of 28 dead. Yonhap said three people had been rescued.</p>

            <p>Authorities were working to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane.</p>
        
            <p>Yonhap cited airport authorities as saying the landing gear may have malfunctioned due to a bird strike.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, agency News1 reported. The person's final message was, "Should I say my last words?"</p>
        
            <p>Bird strike is among several theories that have not been verified, an official from the transport ministry's aviation department said, adding that the investigation was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers included two Thai nationals, and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry.</p>
        
            <p>Aviation tracking site FlightRadar24 said the aircraft appeared to be a Boeing 737-800. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

            <p>All domestic and international flights at Muan airport had been cancelled, Yonhap reported.</p>
        
            <p>Acting President Choi Sung-mok, who was named interim leader of the country on Friday after the previous acting president was impeached amid an ongoing political crisis, ordered all-out rescue efforts, his office said.</p>
        
            <p>A Jeju Air spokesperson said the airline was checking the reports.</p>
