            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman has been denied a discharge without conviction for shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>Judge June Jelas convicted Ghahraman and ordered her to pay a fine of $1600 fine, plus $260 in court costs</p>
        
            <p>The sentencing was delayed on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old earlier entered guilty pleas on four shoplifting charges involving boutique stores in Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The judge previously said Ghahraman would not be receiving a custodial sentence, her lawyer had asked for discharge without conviction.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
