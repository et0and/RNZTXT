            <p>The Crown Research Institutes will be merged as part of sweeping changes to the science sector.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to staff seen by RNZ, the seven CRIs will become three mega science organisations - "Public Research Organisations" (PROs) - with a fourth established to focus on "advanced technology".</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was due to announce the changes in his State of the Nation speech from 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>The changes come after consideration of the long-awaited Science System Advisory Group's (SSAG) first report by Sir Peter Gluckman.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Research Organisations will be grouped by area of focus.</p>

            <p>Earth Science will see the NIWA and GNS Science merged, and NIWA's acquisition of MetService will continue as planned.</p>
        
            <p>AgResearch, Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, Plant & Food Research and Scion will also be pooled under Bioeconomy.</p>
        
            <p>Health and Forensic Science will be formed by re-purposing ESR.</p>
        
            <p>The changes are due to see the establishment of a fourth Public Research Organisation to focus on advanced technology.</p>

Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins says it's the biggest reset in the country's science sector in 30 years.

            <p>Callaghan Innovation would be disestablished, and its functions moved to other entities.</p>
        
            <p>Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins said it had simply been spread too thinly across too many functions, "leading to poor financial performance and an over-reliance on Crown funding".</p>
        
            <p>She said it was the largest reset of the New Zealand science system in more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>"The reforms will maximise the value of the $1.2 billion in government funding that goes into the science sector each year, creating a more dynamic science, innovation and technology system that can respond to priorities and keep pace with technological advances," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting the system settings right is the best way to boost long-term economic performance and ensure our scientists can pursue meaningful careers in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>A new agency, Invest New Zealand, would be set up as the government's one-stop-shop for foreign direct investment, to help the government reach its goal of doubling exports by 2034.</p>
        
            <p>"Invest NZ will also be tasked with attracting more skilled professionals to New Zealand, to help foster innovation, raise domestic capabilities and improve international connections."</p>
        
            <p>The changes continue the trend of the government's focus on growth in the research sector, with the newly created PROs expected to respond to government priorities and focus on economic outcomes in addition to public good services.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the heads of the CRIs are supportive of the consolidation and will be involved in the design and transition process which is due to start immediately.</p>
        
            <p>The names of the new organisations are yet to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>New legislation to support the changes is expected to be passed later this year and next, while the government has indicated further moves will be made in the coming months.</p>
