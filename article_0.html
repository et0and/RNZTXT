            <p>Liam Lawson says the McLaren team should play the New Zealand national anthem rather than the British one when it wins races.</p>
        
            <p>The McLaren team was founded by famed New Zealand driver Bruce McLaren in 1963 and had been in Formula One since 1966. McLaren was killed while testing a car in Britain in 1970.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson, who has been making a name for himself with his aggressive driving for RB this season, is no less forthright off it.</p>
        
            <p>He called it ''completely bulls***" that "God Save the King" was played by McLaren at podium finishes, arguing "God Defend New Zealand" would better honour Bruce McLaren.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a New Zealand team, the name is still McLaren. I have no idea,'' Lawson said on the Red Flags podcast.</p>

            <p>"Red Bull play the Austrian national anthem and the team's based in the UK. McLaren's based in the UK, but it's a New Zealand team.</p>
        
            <p>"It's completely bulls***, that's what it is.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly! Especially if you're from New Zealand...because Bruce McLaren is an absolute legend."</p>
        
            <p>McLaren, which has had 188 F1 victories, races under a British licence. The team has won eight constructors' championships, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and two Indianapolis 500s.</p>
