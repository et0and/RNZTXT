            <p>A man who was found critically injured on a roadside in Miramar, Wellington, has died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The man was found critically injured on a footpath about 2.20am Monday, at the intersection of Camperdown Rd and Totora Rd.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second serious incident, following the burglary of a Darlington Rd address 20 minutes earlier, where two adults found a stranger in their home.</p>
        
            <p>After being confronted and fighting with one of the residents the intruder fled.</p>
        
            <p>Police investigating the burglary then found the injured and unconscious man a short distance from his vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Parallel investigations are under way into both incidents and police are still working to determine if there is any link between the two.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed on Tuesday the intruder was unknown to the residents of the property that he broke into.</p>
        
            <p>"They do not know him, and do not know why he was in their house," Detective Inspector Nick Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know these events will cause concern in the community and we are working hard to answer the many questions around Monday morning's incidents."</p>
        
            <p>However, police do not know whether there is a connection between the intruder and the deceased, but that is a focus of the investigation," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were carrying out "reassurance patrols" in the Miramar area and this would continue over coming days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>District improvement group Enterprise Miramar Peninsula Inc said following recent burglaries a community member had suggested they arrange a meeting between the community, police, and members of Wellington City Council.</p>
        
            <p>"We have previously contacted WCC to request more CCTV cameras in strategic locations," it said in a post online. "While we secured two cameras, the Peninsula needs more.</p>
        
            <p>"To further assist the police, we have been asked to encourage community members to install CCTV cameras in their homes. It is regrettable that our community has come to this point."</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours told RNZ they heard raised voices and "bad language" outside the Darlington Rd house in the early hours of Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Brian More, who lives next door, told RNZ he heard a fight and his wife rang the police.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard our neighbour actually shouting at someone in the back yard... and then basically some naughty language to get out the place in quite a rapid way. It went on for about two minutes," More said.</p>
        
            <p>"When it occurred we had a quick look around, and it looked okay, but the noise had gone away, so we didn't realise how serious it was at the time."</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour, Colin Ward, told RNZ he woke up to see police on the driveway with torches.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly a concern, because Miramar's a pretty quiet place really, and we don't have too much trouble around this area, but it's pretty serious."</p>

            <p>Police said they want to hear from anyone who saw a suspicious person or walked or drove in the area near Camperdown Rd and Totora Rd between 12.30am and 2.30am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>They asked residents in Darlington Rd, Totara Rd and Camperdown Rd, particularly the block north of Camperdown Rd, to check their properties for any missing clothing from clotheslines or missing footwear or other items.</p>
        
            <p>Police also wanted to hear from anyone who found discarded items of property on their sections.</p>
        
            <p>"You may not think you have anything to contribute, but we would like to know what you may have seen, or view any dashcam footage," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are particularly interested in any sightings of a man wearing a white cap, shorts and gumboots.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would also like to hear of any suspicious activity or people prowling in the area over the last couple of weeks, including any previously unreported thefts from properties or vehicles since early March."</p>
        
            <p>Police are still completing scene examinations and will be visiting properties to ask residents if they saw anything of relevance to the investigation and whether they have CCTV.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage it has not been established if there is a connection between the intruder and the deceased, but that is a focus of the investigation," Pritchard said.</p>
