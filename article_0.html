            <p>A 22-year-old charged with the murder of a 10-month-old baby in Te K큰iti has appeared in Hamilton District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The man did not enter a plea and was granted interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>The summary of facts is also suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>He has been remanded in custody until his next appearance on 2 July at the High Court in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Mustafa Ali was taken unconscious to Te K큰iti Hospital last Saturday afternoon, but could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>Family and friends buried Mustafa at the Te K큰iti Cemetery on Thursday. They gathered around the tiny grave, where a cross, flowers and soft toys were laid.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Graham Pitkethley said the child died of violent blunt-force trauma, and the police knew him from non-accidental injuries he received in October last year.</p>
        
            <p>When announcing the arrest on Friday afternoon, he said further charges might be laid as inquiries continued.</p>
        
            <p>The police said Te K큰iti residents could continue to see officers in the area as the investigation continued.</p>
