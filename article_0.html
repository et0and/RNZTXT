        <h2>Hoiho at risk: 'It is unthinkable that we could lose them'</h2>
        <p>
The yellow-eyed penguin could become extinct within two decades, says DOC, with the number of known nests dropping by 80 percent over the past 15 years.

            <p>Mainland yellow-eyed penguin could become extinct within two decades, says the Department of Conservation (DOC), with the number of known nests dropping by 80 percent over the past decade and a half.</p>
        
            <p>The hoiho - or yellow-eyed penguin - is one of the rarest penguins in the world, with only 143 known nests on mainland New Zealand including on Stewart Island.</p>
        
            <p>DOC says that without a serious turnaround, the 2024 Bird of the Year winner could become extinct within 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024/25 nest counts across Otago, Southland and Stewart Island show a decline of 80 percent since 2008/09.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said there were less than 100 chicks on Stewart Island and mainland New Zealand, and there was no guarantee of their long-term survival.</p>
        
            <p>Hoiho have a low reproductive rate and low juvenile survival. It is expected less than 20 percent of these chicks will survive to adulthood, DOC added.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said the declining numbers were a result of multiple threats including disease, introduced predators, human disturbance, a significant shift in adult diet, fisheries bycatch, and marine predation.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu hoiho recovery representative Puawai Swindells-Wallace had visited nesting sites from Waitaha (Canterbury) down to Rakiura (Stewart Island) and seen first-hand the hard mahi conservation rangers and volunteers were doing to try to save this species from extinction.</p>
        
            <p>"We have some really good people on the ground, but with such a large range to cover, it is extremely challenging," Swindells-Wallace said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hoiho are a taonga species for Ngāi Tahu and it is unthinkable that we could lose them - we don't really know what impact that could have on the whole ecosystem.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to collectively increase our capacity to support the hoiho to regain their rightful place on our beaches and in our moana."</p>
        
            <p>They were coined 'the people's penguin' and won the Bird of The Year competition in 2019 and 2024, but recent mainland hoiho/yellow-eyed penguin nest counts have experts worried.</p>
        
            <p>The Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust (YEPT) recently appointed Anna Campbell to lead the organisation, with a focus on innovation to accelerate restoration of coastal ecosystems.</p>
        
            <p>"Nest and chick numbers are critically low on mainland New Zealand," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now is the time to come together, be bold and brave - collaborating can enhance our potential to protect the hoiho.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to a future where hoiho thrive in the natural environment."</p>
