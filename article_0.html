            <p>Egg producers are hopeful prices have peaked and the egg shortage of early-2023 will soon be a distant memory.</p>
        
            <p>The country's layer hen population is continuing to grow, meaning there should be more eggs in-market at a cheaper price.</p>
        
            <p>Eggs have been in short supply - and expensive - since the start of the year when a ban on battery-caged hens came into effect, sparking shortages across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The layer hen population hit a lowpoint of 3.4 million in February, while the industry transitioned away from battery and colony cages too, towards more free range-like operations.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the population has grown by more than 400,000 layer hens to 3.8 million - with 100,000 more expected by January.</p>
        
            <p>Egg Producers' Federation executive director Michael Brooks said it had been a "fairly brutal" time for farmers making the costly switch.</p>
        
            <p>He said the rising cost of grain, and the decision by Foodstuffs and Woolworths, formerly Countdown, to also ban colony-caged hen's eggs by 2025, had intensified the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a very tough couple of years for the layer hen farming industry," Brooks said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been huge financial pressures on farmers ... It was a minimum of $1 million just to change from the old style cage to the colony cage, then if you were going into free range that meant buying a whole new farm, a new set up. So some really big costs and a lot of investment.</p>
        
            <p>"All those things had an impact, so it's lead to a pretty messy situation, and it's taken a while for the supply to bounce back, but it is just about there now."</p>
        
            <p>Egg prices had come off historic highs, with Stats NZ's latest figures showing them falling for the third month in a row since the peak in July.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the first time in a good couple of years we've started to see maybe it's topped out in terms of prices," Brooks said.</p>
        
            <p>"Prior to that, for the past couple of years, it's just been up and up and up - as consumers will know.</p>
        
            <p>"But consumers will understand, I believe, that there are all these external pressures that have come onto farmers. It's been pretty rugged. Not just general inflation but a whole range of other factors coming into the situation."</p>
        
            <p>Brooks said it was an extraordinary situation this year, but he was hopeful supply would be secured into the new year and prices should be more reasonable.</p>
