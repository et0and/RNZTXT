        <h2>Watch: Luxon speaks ahead of meeting Vietnamese PM</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister earlier addressed an Association of South East Nations 'future forum' while in Hanoi, ahead of meetings with Vietnamese heads of government.
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister has called for more transparency as militaries modernise in the Indo-Pacific, saying New Zealand was "clear-eyed" the risk of conflict in the wider region had risen.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon addressed an Association of South East Nations 'future forum' while in Hanoi, ahead of his meetings with Vietnamese heads of government.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is not an ASEAN member, but the two have had diplomatic relations for fifty years, and New Zealand often participates in ASEAN discussions.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to delegates at the forum, Luxon praised the economic growth of the region, but painted a somewhat bleak geostrategic picture.</p>
        
            <p>"It has become starkly apparent that we are in a world where rules are being subsumed by power as the key determinant in advancing states' interests," Luxon said.</p>

            <p>Luxon praised the regional architecture of ASEAN, saying New Zealand's prosperity was tied to an "open" Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"The Indo-Pacific is simultaneously the engine room of global economic activity and a potential hotspot for geo-political tension. Military expansion and modernisation is occurring at a scale not seen in this region for more than half a century," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As militaries modernise, we need a constant commitment to transparency. By providing plausible reassurance about the purpose of military modernisation projects, confidence will grow, creating a collective sense of security."</p>
        
            <p>Malaysian prime minister Anwar Ibrahim also addressed the forum.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now in the geopolitical inflection point. Various global disruptions that we have experienced in the last decade are the new normal, highlighting the fragility of the global order and existing structures that underpin it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's precisely the reason why such forums are not only relevant, but very critical to get the great minds in the region to reflect and share their views."</p>

            <p>Anwar also praised New Zealand for its partnership with ASEAN.</p>
        
            <p>"I can assure you that our attitude towards New Zealand is as a great friend. Therefore you are much-welcome. This is underpinned by our shared values on progress, prosperity and justice," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Anwar also participated in a Q&A session with Timor Leste president José Ramos-Horta, and Vietnam prime minister Phạm Minh Chính.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Chính will hold their bilateral meeting later on Wednesday evening NZT.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the two will discuss advancing to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, as the countries mark fifty years of diplomatic relations.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the meeting Luxon attended the signing of a number of memorandums of understanding between New Zealand and Vietnam education institutes, and announced increased numbers of scholarships and grants for Vietnamese students.</p>
        
            <p>Around 1700 Vietnamese students attend tertiary institutes in New Zealand, and Luxon has brought along the heads of some of those institutes with a view to boost numbers.</p>
