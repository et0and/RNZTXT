            <p>The prime minister's time in Washington DC is coming to a close after a packed day of meetings with both NATO leaders and Ukraine's president.</p>
        
            <p>After a late night at the White House dinner where Christopher Luxon met with both US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister chaired the IP-4 meeting, including Japan's prime minister, Korea's president and Australia's deputy prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>They were joined by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, invited to update the leaders on the latest reports surrounding Russia's invasion.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Zelensky the IP-4 countries "shared in Ukraine's outrage at Russia's callous disregard for life".</p>
        
            <p>"What you have been through and what you continue to face is horrific, and we are further reminded of this when we see the events of Monday when we were incredibly saddened by Russia's bombing of civilians' areas throughout the Ukraine, including Ukraine's largest children's hospital in Kyiv.</p>
        
            <p>"The intensifying military relationship we're seeing between Russia and the DPK and China's role supporting Russia's industrial base demonstrates the indivisibility of security issues between Europe and our part of the world in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"We are all agreed on the importance of the IP-4 countries partnering with NATO to support Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the meeting, Biden - who had just arrived at the Walter E Washington Convention Centre for the NATO council meeting - joined the IP-4 leaders for a photo and short chat.</p>

            <p>From there, Luxon, Biden and the other leaders headed to the main event. For about half-an-hour the other NATO leaders had been milling around chatting with each other while they waited for the official part of the day to start.</p>
        
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood together in deep conversation for most of that time, while Starmer - the newest member of the North Atlantic alliance - was approached by a range of leaders and officials in the room.</p>

            <p>The chair, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - who sat next to a frail-looking Biden - began the meeting by thanking Indo-Pacific countries, including New Zealand, for making the trip. He said their attendance demonstrated "a strong and deepening cooperation" with NATO.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting was focused on Russia's war against Ukraine, China's support of Russia and the "growing alignment of authoritarian powers".</p>
        
            <p>"In response we must work ever more closely together to preserve peace and protect the rules-based international order."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day Luxon met one-on-one with Stoltenberg, who personally thanked New Zealand for its support of the North Atlantic alliance.</p>
        
            <p>He said, "security is global, not regional", so it was important to have Indo-Pacific countries in Washington DC this week.</p>
        
            <p>"What happens in Europe, it matters for the Indo-Pacific and what happens there matters for us, and that's something we've seen at least in the war in Ukraine where China and North Korea are propping up the Russian's war efforts in Ukraine."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltenberg finishes his 10-year tenure with NATO in October. The Prime Minister said he should feel very proud of the legacy he has created, and the work he has done to strengthen the "most successful alliance we've seen on Earth".</p>
        
            <p>"You have shown exemplary leadership, I hope you leave feeling incredibly proud of all you've achieved here."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the Secretary General had navigated "one of the most challenging periods in Europe".</p>
        
            <p>Before leaving Washington DC Luxon will hold a bilateral meeting with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and was also expected to finally get his meeting with senior Republican Ted Cruz, after it was cancelled on Thursday (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>Cruz was unable to get back to the city from Texas because of Hurricane Beryl.</p>
        
            <p>Later on Friday (NZ time) Luxon jets off to San Francisco for one final day of meetings in the US at the weekend.</p>
