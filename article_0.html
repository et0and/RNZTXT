        <h2>Auckland housing affordability boosted by Unitary Plan - research</h2>
        <p>
The 2016 plan allowed for intensification, which is helping keep housing and rental costs lower than they would otherwise be, an economist says.

            <p>Auckland's strategy to handle growth by upzoning is improving housing affordability, new research says.</p>
        
            <p>The study, from the University of Auckland, indicates that about 22,000 new homes consented between 2016 and 2021 can be directly attributed to the city's Unitary Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Implemented in 2016, the Unitary Plan allowed for about 400,000 new homes to be built across the region.</p>
        
            <p>It expanded the rural urban boundary, opening up more land for development, and allowed for more two- and three-storey homes in urban areas, with up to six storeys permitted close to town centres and transport hubs.</p>
        
            <p>The research compared building consents in locations that were upzoned with those that were not.</p>

            <p>It found between 1996 and 2016, about 5.9 consents were issued per 1000 residents.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2017 and 2023, after the Unitary Plan came into force, there were 9.5 consents issued per 1000 residents.</p>
        
            <p>Without the Unitary Plan, there would have been 43,900 consents for new homes between 2016 and 2021, rather than the actual 65,700 consents in residential zones - a 50 percent increase.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council chief economist Gary Blick said the upzoning played a crucial role in increasing housing capacity.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been six years since the Auckland Council passed the Unitary Plan that enabled more flexible use of our residential land, and in that time, we've seen a real surge in the number of new homes being supplied.</p>
        
            <p>"That is good evidence that shows we're getting more homes than we otherwise would have."</p>

            <p>He said the low cost of development on a per dwelling basis was resulting in developers getting more yield from sites.</p>
        
            <p>"Allowing for more density reduces development costs because less land is used for each new home and there is increased competition among landowners by bringing more development opportunities into play."</p>
        
            <p>With more houses being built, Blick said Auckland's rental and housing prices were on a lower growth path than the rest of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2017 and 2024, Auckland rents increased by 22 percent, compared with 34 percent nationally, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Moreover, the University of Auckland research finds rents for three-bedroom homes were 26 to 33 percent lower than otherwise six years after the Auckland Unitary Plan was introduced."</p>
        
            <p>That did not mean Auckland was affordable, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it does show that prices are lower than they would have been without the Auckland Unitary Plan. We have a long way to go yet, but Auckland's experience shows how land use policy is a powerful lever for enabling more housing to be built."</p>
