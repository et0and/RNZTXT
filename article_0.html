            <p>Police were stationed in the carpark but have also been seen entering the tennis centre building, an RNZ reporter at the scene said.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses speaking to police could be heard giving them instructions on the layout of the building and where things were. Police were also photographing the ground.</p>
        
            <p>A person on a local Facebook group claimed someone had been attacked in the area, but RNZ has not yet confirmed this.</p>
