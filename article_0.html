            <p>Four fire engines and three helicopters are fighting a vegetation fire on Christchurch's Port Hills.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) was alerted to the fire about 11.15am.</p>
        
            <p>The helicopters have been making constant circles of the fire and releasing buckets of water. They are drawing water from the nearby Heathcote River, which is causing some traffic delays with cars slowing to watch.</p>
        
            <p>Dark plumes of smoke which can be seen across much of the city are being sent up by the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The fire appears to be in a bushy area, with no obvious buildings nearby.</p>
        
            <p>A video taken by witness Callum Templeton showed a helicopter using a monsoon bucket to dump water on the fire.</p>

            <p>FENZ asked the public to avoid the area to allow its crews to battle the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said State Highway 76 was closed between Port Hills Road and Chapmans Road due to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Angela Fitzgibbon from Avoca Valley said the fire was quite near a property where she kept her horses, so she was evacuating them to another property just to be safe.</p>
        
            <p>The weather is sunny and warm in Christchurch today with just a light breeze. It rained briefly in parts of Christchurch this morning. The Port Hills are relatively green at the moment after a moderately wet spring.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Four fire trucks and two helicopters are battling a vegetation fire in Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said crews were called to the blaze along State Highway 1 in the Riverlands at about 11am Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said two areas of grass were on fire.</p>
