            <p>Homes and businesses are without power across Northland and the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>Top Energy's website is reporting 2839 reported outages from KaitƒÅia to Cape Reinga on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Power and traffic lights are also out in Whangarei, where police have been sent to the city's main intersections to carry out traffic control.</p>
        
            <p>All three of RNZ's transmission sites in Northland are running on back-up generators due to the power outages. The sites are Waipapakauri in the far north, Ohaeawai in the mid-north, and Otaika near Whangarei.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, parts of Northland have been hit by heavy rain overnight, with schools closed and flooding in outlying areas around Kaeo.</p>
        
            <p>While the rain was easing in some places it was lingering in the eastern side of the Far North and surface flooding was expected, Northland Civil Defence said earlier.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
