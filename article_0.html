            <p>A neighbour says she heard screaming in the house at the centre of a homicide investigation over the death of a baby boy.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-month-old boy was brought unconscious to Te Kuiti Hospital on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Tragically, despite the best efforts of medical personnel, he was unable to be resuscitated," detective inspector Graham Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>Police launched a homicide inquiry and were examining the property as part of their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour of the house where the baby lived told an RNZ reporter she heard a lot of screaming on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The woman says the baby was taken to hospital after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>The neighbour said the baby's parents, a man and woman, rented the house and moved into the street before the baby was born but kept to themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki said it was was notified of the death of the baby boy.</p>
        
            <p>We are assisting police in trying to understand the circumstances that led to this, deputy chief executive, service delivery, Rachel Leota said in a statement. "However because this is a police-led investigation we are unable to comment further at this time."</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley said the homicide investigation was in its early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"An initial examination showed the baby boy suffered violent, blunt-force trauma.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe these injuries were not accidental.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of work ahead of us as we gather information."</p>
        
            <p>The full extent of the baby's injuries would be determined by a post-mortem examination, but the results would not be known for some time, Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not be releasing details of his specific injuries at this time.</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley said officers had been speaking to members of the boy's family, including his parents.</p>
        
            <p>"They are working with us as we establish what occurred in this young child's life and how he came to be so badly injured."</p>
        
            <p>Police would be conducting a scene examination at a Te Kuiti address over the coming days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That property had been under police guard since Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Kuiti locals can expect to see police in the town making enquires and we ask for the public's co-operation and understanding.</p>
        
            <p>"The death of any child is a shock to the community, and we know many in Te Kuiti will be affected by this.</p>
        
            <p>"The public can help by talking with us; we need to hear from anyone who has information that could help the investigation."</p>
        
            <p>The death was "a huge shock to the community", Waitomo District mayor John Robertson told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"We have our tragedies from time to time, but no community wants to see a 10-month-old baby apparently suffer like this baby did."</p>
        
            <p>He did not have any more details except that police were speaking with members of the community.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kuiti had a population of 4500 people, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of sympathy goes to those who knew the child but shock at the fact that this could happen in our community."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was asked to call police on 105 and reference the file number 240608/8263.</p>
