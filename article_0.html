            <p>Team NZ - and the rest of the nation - are hoping Day 4 will finally deliver our first medal of the 2024 Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>With the men's individual triathlon postponed until tomorrow, our medal hopes on the fourth day of competition rest on the women's rugby sevens team.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns face the United States in their semi-final after 1.30am. If they get through - and it would be a major upset if they don't - the Kiwis will be going for gold against either Australia or Canada around 5.45am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In other disciplines, New Zealand teams are competing in shooting, swimming, sailing, rowing, dressage, canoe slalom and rugby sevens.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a successful night on the water for NZ so far, with Emma Twigg and Tom Mackintosh comfortably winning their single sculls quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won their double sculls semi, and Robbie Manson and Jordan Parry came third in the men's event, so both duos are through to the final on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Also on the water, but further south in Marseille, Josh Armit won the third race of the men's foil to momentarily go top of the standings - but with many more races to go. Veerle ten Have is well back in the fleet in the women's foil.</p>
        
            <p>Our swimmers have been less fortunate, with Lewis Clareburt (200m butterfly), Cameron Gray (100m freestyle) and Eve Thomas (1500m freestyle) all failing to progress in their heats.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato shooter Owen Robinson is placed 11th in the qualifying rounds of the men's trap competition.</p>
