            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking to media after this week's Cabinet meeting.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the government continues on its plan to continue to progress through the ceremonial business of Parliament, while also moving ahead with actions on its 100-day plan.</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop confirmed a fortnight ago this would include putting Parliament into urgency to pass four bills repealing previous government policies through all stages, and progressing the reintroduction of 90-day trials to all businesses to the select committee stage, all by Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The projects up for repeal or cancellation included the Reserve Bank's employment mandate, Fair Pay Agreements, the replacements for the Resource Management ACT, and the clean car discount or ute tax.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon this morning also spoke about the need to better control net migration, saying Labour had kept the borders closed when employers were looking for workers, then "opened the floodgates" as the economy started to slow.</p>
        
            <p>It followed news that Australia's government was set to unveil a new migration strategy to help address pressures on housing and infrastructure. The strategy was unveiled this afternoon.</p>
