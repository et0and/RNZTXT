        <h2>Harris targets Trump's age after report of exhaustion</h2>
        <p>
Kamala Harris questioned Donald Trump's fitness for office, as the oldest major-party White House candidate in history faced speculation that he is "exhausted".

            <p>Kamala Harris questioned Donald Trump's fitness for office Friday as the oldest major-party White House candidate in history faced speculation that he is "exhausted" after backing out of a spate of interviews.</p>
        
            <p>While he has been appearing on friendly TV networks, the 78-year-old Republican has cancelled sitdowns with media outlets including NBC, CNBC and CBS. He has also refused a second debate with Harris, after being soundly bested in the first.</p>
        
            <p>Politico reported that a Trump aide had told producers at a website negotiating an interview that the ex-president was "exhausted" and refusing some appearances - a claim described by his campaign as "detached from reality."</p>
        
            <p>But Harris, who turns 60 this weekend, hammered Trump over his health and resilience.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world," Harris told supporters during a day of multiple stops across the swing state of Michigan.</p>
        
            <p>The former president has hardly been idle, pursuing a busy schedule of appearances with new and traditional media, but most have been on outlets where he is rarely challenged.</p>
        
            <p>Trump reacted angrily to Harris's jab, telling reporters that he had cancelled nothing and calling his Democratic opponent a "loser" who "doesn't have the energy of a rabbit".</p>
        
            <p>He also claimed to be "killing" her in the polls and that she did not pass the bar exam.</p>
        
            <p>Harris - a former California attorney general who passed the bar exam in 1990 - has a narrow lead in national polling averages, while numerous October surveys in Michigan show them neck and neck.</p>

            <p>Trump has surprised analysts with a programme that mixes swing state stops with appearances in regions he has no chance of winning, but where he is guaranteed big crowds.</p>
        
            <p>He was in the liberal stronghold of New York for a Catholic charity dinner on Thursday, where he mocked Harris in an occasionally mean-spirited speech that earned gasps for its off-colour remarks and profanity.</p>
        
            <p>But he was back on home turf Friday morning for a soft Fox News interview, before heading to Michigan for counterprogramming against Harris.</p>
        
            <p>Both candidates are spending their final campaign days in pivotal battleground states where early voting is already underway.</p>
        
            <p>With less than three weeks to go, Harris has seen encouraging signs in her push for supporters to vote as soon as possible, as a bulwark against the traditional Republican edge among Election Day voters.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 12 million votes had been cast by Friday evening - around a third of them in the seven swing states expected to decide the election - according to data tracked by the University of Florida Election Lab.</p>
        
            <p>Georgia has been smashing records, while North Carolina reported a first day of voting Thursday that beat 2020, when there was a pandemic-linked surge of early ballots.</p>
        
            <p>Where party breakdowns were available, registered Democrats accounted for roughly half of the total, while Republicans - who have spent much of the Trump era casting aspersions over drop boxes and mailed ballots - were responsible for around a third.</p>
        
            <p>After her event in Grand Rapids, Harris targeted blue-collar voters with remarks at a union hall in Lansing, giving a more manufacturing-focused speech in which she argued that the future of the labour movement was "on the line" in November's election.</p>
        
            <p>She was set to hold an evening rally in Oakland County before returning to Detroit on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The Democrat has found herself on eggshells as she upholds President Joe Biden's support for key ally Israel, while Muslim and Arab American voters - particularly in Michigan - have voiced outrage over the death toll in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar drew optimism from Harris for a Gaza ceasefire, but Israel quickly said his death is not the end of the campaign launched in response to the militant group's 7 October, 2023 attack.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to journalists ahead of a speech in Detroit, Trump said Sinwar's death had increased the likelihood of a peaceful solution to the war in Gaza - while warning Biden not to try to restrain Israel.</p>
