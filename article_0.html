            <p>New Zealand First would be out of Parliament, and Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori would have enough seats to form a government together, according to the latest 1 News Verian Poll.</p>
        
            <p>National is on 36 percent, down two points on the previous poll from February.</p>
        
            <p>ACT is down a point to 7 percent, while New Zealand First is down two points to 4 percent - below the 5 percent threshold needed to get into Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Labour is up two points to 30 percent , the Greens are up two to 14 percent, and while Te Pāti Māori is steady on 4 percent and so also below the threshold, the poll assumes it keeps its electorate seats.</p>
        
            <p>With New Zealand First out, National's 48 seats and ACT's 9 would not be enough to cross the line.</p>
        
            <p>Labour would have 40 seats, the Greens 18, and Te Pāti Māori 6.</p>
        
            <p>In the preferred Prime Minister stakes, Christopher Luxon is down two points to 23 percent, while Chris Hipkins is up a point to 16 percent.</p>
        
            <p>New Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick is on 6 percent, up two points. David Seymour is down one point to 5 percent, and Winston Peters is down two points to 4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The poll was taken between 20-24 April with a sample of 1000 people surveyed by mobile phone and online, with a ±3.1 percent-point margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level.</p>
