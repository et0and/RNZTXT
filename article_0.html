            <p>An estimated 5500 people turned out to enjoy the oldest country show in New Zealand on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>While livestock displays have yet to return, following the M. Bovis scare of some years ago, this year's show featured other regular attractions, such as pet lamb and calf competitions, miniature horses, two equestrian rings, a food and wine festival called Savouring the Source, live music, plenty of kai, children's rides, and more than 150 trade stalls.</p>
        
            <p>Founded in 1842, the Bay of Islands Pastoral and Industrial Show is only a couple of years younger than the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>It has been held on the current site in Waimate North, midway between Kerikeri and Kaikohe, since 1888.</p>
        
            <p>The Bay of Islands Show is the first of the season in Northland each year, and is famous for its picturesque grounds, dotted with ancient puriri trees.</p>
        
            <p>It's also a stone's throw from the historic Church of St John the Baptist, and Te Waimate Mission Station, the second-oldest building in the country.</p>
