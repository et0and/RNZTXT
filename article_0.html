            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand is investigating and boosting trapping after new Auckland fruit fly was found on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>An operation is under way and extra field teams are in the suburb of Birkdale, on Auckland's North Shore, after the discovery of the single male Oriental fruit fly.</p>
        
            <p>The fly was found in a surveillance trap in a suburban backyard, Biosecurity New Zealand Commissioner North Mike Inglis said.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after another oriental fruit fly was found in South Auckland's Papatoetoe at the start of January.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the same species of fruit fly that we responded to in Papatoetoe recently, but it is too early to say whether the two finds are linked.</p>
        
            <p>"Our lab will do further DNA analysis of the fly over the coming days," Inglis said.</p>
        
            <p>The fruit fly was considered a significant threat, with maggots capable of feeding on more than 300 different fruit and vegetable crops. It posed no risk to human health.</p>
        
            <p>The fly's favourite hosts are apple, guava, mango, peach, and pear.</p>
        
            <p>MPI restricted the movement of fruit and vegetables around Papatoetoe for a time, but restrictions were lifted a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>Trapping and inspection would now ramp up on the North Shore, Inglis said, with daily checks in a 200-metre zone from the original find and checks every three days in a second zone out to 1500 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"The capture of a single male does not mean we have an outbreak. However, while we do our checks for any other fruit flies, we need community help to prevent any possible spread.</p>
        
            <p>"As a precautionary measure, we'll be putting legal restrictions in place on the movement of fruit and vegetables out of the area where the fruit fly was found."</p>
        
            <p>Instructions about the controls would be released on Friday, Inglis said, and he asked anyone in the affected area not to take any whole fresh fruit or vegetables out of their property until then.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity staff would be in the area on Friday providing people with information, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You may notice increased activity in the neighbourhood as we go about inspections and trapping. Our field officers may ask to look at fruit trees on your property.</p>
        
            <p>"They will always show you a form of official identification and will only enter your property with your permission."</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity NZ was working closely with international trading partners, Inglis said, to minimise any risk to New Zealand growers and exporters.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been 13 incursions of different fruit fly in Auckland and Northland since 1996 and all have been successfully eradicated thanks to the work of Biosecurity New Zealand, our horticulture partners, and local communities who have stepped up to help.</p>
        
            <p>"Our trapping network involves nearly 8000 traps set nationwide, and these are checked regularly."</p>
