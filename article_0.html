            <p>A digger has been used to smash into a Wairarapa café in an attempt to break into an ATM.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Kitchener's Café on Kitchener Street, in Martinborough, at around 11.40pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Building owner Bruce Sullivan told RNZ all the neighbouring bars were full when it happened.</p>
        
            <p>"This guy had stolen this loader from a firm about a kilometre away and made his way around here.</p>
        
            <p>"And then when he got to 50m away back where the truck is, just went flat-out into the building and then tried to use the loader to get hold of the ATM machine and take it away… didn't get into it, but smashed it."</p>

            <p>Sullivan said bar owners ushered everyone inside, fearing the driver of the digger was "just smashing the buildings up".</p>
        
            <p>"They didn't realise he was trying to steal the ATM machine."</p>
        
            <p>The suspect then "jumped out of the digger and ran off down the road", Sullivan said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was wearing a balaclava. No one's come forward and said 'we know who it is'... I'd be upset if it was a local."</p>
        
            <p>Sullivan said the front of the building was seriously damaged.</p>
        
            <p>"Gutted, you know? My daughters have just taken over the business a few months back now… coming to the busiest time of year… there'd be at least a month or two to rectify this. So it's just downtime, you know? Girls trying to make a bloody living, somebody does this. It's bloody heartbreaking, you know?</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard enough to make an earning without this, you know, but we've got a good community here. The boys, quite a number of guys, tradies have all put their hands up and said they'll give us a hand. We're gonna have to knock this part down today because it's too unstable… It's too broken."</p>

            <p>Police said anyone with information could call them on 105 and cite reference number 241116/2640, or call Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
