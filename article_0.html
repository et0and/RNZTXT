            <p>Owners of plug-in hybrids, like the popular Outlander plug-in, will pay less in road user charges after a change of heart by the Government.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown announced owners of plug-in hybrids will pay 38 dollars per thousand kilometres driven, under new taxes to pay for road upkeep.</p>
        
            <p>The Minister originally proposed a rate of 53 dollars, but a select committee recommended dropping the fee.</p>
        
            <p>Owners of plug-in hybrids had argued they would end up paying more than others because they used both electric batteries and petrol, which especially affected older vehicles with less battery power.</p>
