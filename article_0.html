            <p>New Zealand is aware of the Chinese naval task group that operating off Australia and is monitoring it, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Australian Defence Department, the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class Cruiser named Zunyi and the Fuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu have continued sailing down the coast after being spotted to the north east of the country last week, the ABC reported.</p>
        
            <p>The ships are understood to be sailing east of Sydney.British newspaper the Financial Times is reporting that the ships are about 150 nautical miles from the coast.</p>
        
            <p>The visit comes as the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, is in Australia, and is due to meet Australia's Chief of Joint Operations in Canberra on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said the New Zealand Defence Force was monitoring the task group, alongside Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to monitor these vessels."</p>

            <p>Chinese ships sailed into Sydney harbour in 2019, however, that visit was done in coordination with the Australian government.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry was unable to answer questions on Wednesday afternoon about the three ships sailing near the east coast, saying he was not familiar with the situation.</p>
