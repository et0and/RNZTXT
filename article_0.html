            <p>The Department of Conservation (DoC) is alerting swimmers to look out for great white sharks after sightings in the Kawhia harbour in Waikato over recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>A video posted on a Kawhia community Facebook page showed what appeared to be a great white approaching a fishing boat.</p>
        
            <p>"Two great whites were seen in the harbour yesterday by our local kids swimming quite close to the wharf," the post reads. "Thought I better post before everyone lets their tamariki go swimming."</p>
        
            <p>DoC has issued a warning on its social media page, urging people to avoid swimming in areas where sharks have recently been seen.</p>
        
            <p>"If you do see a great white shark while swimming you should quickly and calmly get out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"They often come into harbours in search of food and are attracted to recreational fishing vessels using berley," it said in the statement.</p>
        
            <p>DoC said it is not unusual for more sharks to be seen along coastlines at this time of the year, as waters start warming up.</p>
        
            <p>Great white sharks are a protected species, and DoC is asking the public to report any sightings or accidental captures by calling 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468) or emailing sharks@doc.govt.nz.</p>
