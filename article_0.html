            <p>Ryan Bradley and Hattie Adams are part of a trio which won the NZ on Air Best Music Video award at the Show Me Shorts Film Festival earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The music video, for the song 'Tōtara' by husband-and-wife duo Aro, showed two siblings converge on their childhood home to reflect on what they have lost and still have.</p>
        
            <p>So what goes into making an award-winning music video?</p>
        
            <p>Bradley and Adams met at the New Zealand Broadcasting School in 2018, "and have been friends ever since," Adams said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the reason it works is because our friendship is our main priority, we communicate really well in order to protect that, and what comes out of that is just a really loving kaupapa," she told Susana Lei'ataua on RNZ's Labour Day special.</p>
        
            <p>"It reflects in the work - the respect that we have behind the scenes."</p>

            <p>Bradley added he and Adams balance each other out.</p>
        
            <p>"We find ways to fill in the gaps in each other's knowledge and each other's talents within the industry, whether that be post-production or production or managing money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's awesome having a duo, and having Hattie understand me in that way, and having me understand her.</p>
        
            <p>"Years of knowing each other helps that, but also finding our little pockets to collaborate with and to create a new product that reflects both of us."</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first time Bradley and Adams had created a music video for Aro, who introduce themselves as "a blend of stories in song expressing the people, the culture, and the heart of Aotearoa".</p>
        
            <p>"We know Emily and Charles' music quite well, we've worked on three of their videos, so we always knew their style," Adams said.</p>
        
            <p>In regards to the 'Tōtara' music video, Bradley said there is not a lot of time to tell a big story in four minutes - "So we kept it simple."</p>
        
            <p>"Two siblings starting apart, and learning to come together through the memory of someone that they both once loved in their own way."</p>
        
            <p>Adams said the waiata was "stunning", about grief and the loss of Charles' aunt.</p>
        
            <p>"They played us the song, and then we went away and listened to it and just discussed what grief meant to us.</p>
        
            <p>"We found that there was a lot of really universal themes and links, especially with our Māori background and then New Zealand as a whole, [which] I think, is always very family orientated.</p>
        
            <p>"So we worked out basically a narrative that just told the privilege of knowing someone that you've lost, as opposed to the pain of losing them."</p>

            <p>The shoot itself only took two days - one day inside a studio inside a West Auckland house, half a day outside a rundown house in South Auckland suburb of Rosehill, and another half in Tōtara Park.</p>
        
            <p>As for the award, Bradley said they were not expecting to win.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't quite know what to say."</p>
        
            <p>"It's very nice to be recognised for these things, but we're both also very good at playing ourselves down a little bit, so we weren't expecting it."</p>
