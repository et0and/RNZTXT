            <p>The men's kayak fours crew has squeaked a spot in the Olympic final after coming fourth in their semifinal in Paris on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>There were just five boats in their race, and they needed to place in the top four to progress.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lydia Ko is continuing her campaign at Le Golf National in the second round of the women's individual golf. Earlier, she moved up the leaderboard and tied for third after scoring another birdie.</p>
        
            <p>Maddi Wesche is also through to the Olympics shot put final after throwing 19.25m on her second attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Later, Dame Lisa Carrington and her women's kayak fours crew will take to the water for their final. Carrington, Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan flew through their heat and are the ones to beat in this final, at 11.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>And speed climber Julian David takes on the world record-holder, Sam Watson of the US, in the men's quarterfinal from 10.28pm.</p>
