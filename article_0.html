            <p>The hospitality sector says a good summer will set it up for the year ahead, even in the face of recession.</p>
        
            <p>Economists said this week that the country was in a deeper than expected recession - the worst six-month period since 1991, excluding Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury's Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update also painted a bleak picture, forecasting the country was likely to stay in the red until 2029.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality NZ's Sam McKinnon said customer sentiment strongly affected the sector, and consumers had been buoyed by recent official cash rate (OCR) cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"Customer sentiment is a key driver in terms of spend in the economy and discretionary spend, especially in tourism and hospitality.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen some of the positivity return with announcements around the OCR cuts and that sort of thing. It remains to be seen what the impact of a negative update from Treasury will be, but the weather is a good influence for customer sentiment as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We're certainly hopeful that over the summer months, people will feel positive about spending out on hospitality and making the most of the warm weather."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, MetService said it was anticipating a hot summer when it issued its first heat alerts for the season. McKinnon said that would set hoteliers, restaurants, cafes and bars up for the year.</p>
        
            <p>"Even in the main centres, as people return to work, if you've got a good couple of months of summer weather and they're in the office, they might be able to leave a little bit early or go for an after work drink or meet up with friends for dinner.</p>
        
            <p>"So good weather anywhere in the country tends to be positive for hospitality. We're hoping that we will have a really strong summer and they will set us up for success in 2025."</p>
