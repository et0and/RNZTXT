        <h2>Live: Dozens still without power after floods</h2>
        <p>
The Transport Agency still has numerous road warnings around Otago and Southland. Follow RNZ's blog for the latest weather updates.

            <p>Emergency response teams in Otago say floodwaters in the city are receding, while crews are cleaning up and restoring power.</p>
        
            <p>PowerNet said it still does not know when power can be reconnected in Toko Mouth and Glenledi.</p>
        
            <p>About 110 households have been without power since the storm which caused flooding around Otago brought down lines in the coastal Clutha settlement.</p>
        
            <p>PowerNet said a worker got through to the community this morning to assess the situation and found a power pole damaged and lines down. The lines company said a bucket truck and crane is needed to repair the lines and cannot get through at present due to road closures and unsafe conditions.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson told RNZ it is unclear when power will be able to be restored.</p>
        
            <p>Some roads and highways are still affected and NZTA is aiming to have State Highway 1 north of Dunedin re-opened by this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are working to remove 300 cubic metres of rock from a slip south of Waikouaiti and there are many smaller slips on the highway's shoulders.</p>
