            <p>A funeral with full police honours will be held next week for slain Nelson police officer Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming.</p>
        
            <p>Police have confirmed the beloved 38-year veteran will be farewelled at a special service on Thursday 16 January from 1pm at Nelson's Trafalgar Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was one of two officers struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square about 2am on 1 January.</p>
        
            <p>She later died from her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old man charged with her murder appeared in court on Friday before being remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said Fleming made the "ultimate sacrifice as a police officer", and it was appropriate she was honoured with a formal police funeral.</p>

            <p>"This is something I wish we didn't have to plan for, but I am grateful to Lyn's family for allowing her police family to be an integral part of her final farewell.</p>
        
            <p>"My staff have already commenced planning with Lyn's family, and I want to ensure we are able to support Lyn's family in providing a fitting tribute for her."</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's family had been overwhelmed by the love and support they had received from the Nelson community and across New Zealand and they were very grateful, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The family had also agreed to the service being livestreamed.</p>
        
            <p>The service will include a motorcade, honour guard, police piper, and flag presentation to Fleming's family.</p>

            <p>Tasman District Commander, Superintendent Tracey Thompson said local police were "hurting", but had been buoyed by messages of support.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to acknowledge the overwhelming response that we've had from our community and from around the country.</p>
        
            <p>"The expressions of grief and condolence and offers of support help give us strength.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a reminder, in these sad times, of the reason that we come to work everyday - to serve our communities and work to keep everyone safe."</p>
