            <p>There was supposed to be an open home at 81-year-old Alan Johnson's house on Sunday, but it had been torn to shreds during the storm that hit Mangawhai overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"Top floor is gone, but every room is damaged," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Two people from Mangawhai were taken to hospital in a serious condition. One was flown to Auckland Hospital by helicopter and the other was taken to North Shore hospital.</p>
        
            <p>One of them was Johnson's daughter, who was at his Old Waipu Road home at the time, and escaped by jumping down on top of the carport.</p>
        
            <p>She is now in Auckland Hospital, awaiting surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"She's got lacerations and broken bones," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said he was still in shock, but was relieved his daughter is okay.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson had worked for years to get his house ready to sell.</p>
        
            <p>"It was supposed to be an open home today. It was an open home yesterday. The house was in beautiful condition, like tip-top condition. Now look at it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really devastating. We'd worked four years to get it up to this stage."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Zoe Gimring said she woke to "the loudest roaring" and the sound of all of the outdoor furniture smashing against our deck railing.</p>
        
            <p>"Across the road from us there's part of someone's roof through the neighbour's roof - luckily they weren't home."</p>
        
            <p>Julie Wall's house had its roof torn off, and her family told her some of the debris ended up about 300 metres away.</p>

            <p>Close to 5000 properties were without power in the Mangawhai, Mangawhai Heads and Langs Beach areas overnight. Power has since been restored to all except approximately 250 households on Moir Street and Old Waipu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) was working through all the calls for help with property damage, and checking homes in the wider area. A specialist drone team had also been called in.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said people should treat all power lines as live, and avoid driving in the area so as not to hold up emergency services.</p>
