            <p>Labour has inched ahead of National in a new poll, with National dropping 4.6 points and Labour gaining 4 points since December.</p>
        
            <p>The Taxpayer's Union-Curia poll now has Labour on 30.9 percent, just ahead of National at 29.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first time Labour has led National in their poll since April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens are up as well, by 1.2 points to 9.5 percent, while ACT is down 2.2 points to 10.8 percent. </p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First is up 2.7 points to 8.1 percent, while Te Pāti Māori is down 0.2 to 5.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>These numbers would give National 38 seats in parliament, down six from last month.</p>
        
            <p>Labour would have 39 seats, up five seats since last month.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens would have 12 seats, up by one, while ACT would lose three seats at 14.</p>
