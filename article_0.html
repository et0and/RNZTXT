            <p>The defendant, who has name suppression, has been on trial at the Auckland District Court over four charges of assault on a person in a family relationship, two charges of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, suffocation, and threatening to do grievous bodily harm - tracking back to events that happened in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Of those charges, the jury found him guilty of one charge of assault on a person in a family relationship and one charge of threatening to do grievous bodily harm.</p>
