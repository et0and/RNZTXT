            <p>The Labour Party has criticised government spending on an advisory group on retail crime launched by Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith in September.</p>
        
            <p>Labour police spokesperson Ginny Andersen criticised the government for paying advisory group chair Sunny Kaushal $920 a day for his work.</p>
        
            <p>In a reply to a parliamentary question in August, Goldsmith confirmed Kaushal's daily remuneration rate.</p>
        
            <p>"The chair will be remunerated in accordance with the Cabinet fees framework at a rate of $920 per day," the minister said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition, the chair will be reimbursed for actual and reasonable travel, meal and accommodation costs."</p>
        
            <p>Information released under an Official Information Act request revealed that Kaushal had been compensated $86,480 for 94 working days as of 17 December.</p>
        
            <p>It also noted that Kaushal was unable to work more than 250 days per year, making his maximum annual compensation $230,000.</p>
        
            <p>The OIA request also revealed the advisory group on retail crime had spent $136,100 through 30 November.</p>
        
            <p>The advisory group had been given an operating budget of $1.8 million a year for at least two years when it was launched.</p>
        
            <p>Andersen criticised the spending on the group to date.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of focusing on real solutions, the government has wasted millions on an advisory group that took several months to release a report," Andersen said. "These are millions of dollars that could have gone to resourcing frontline police."</p>
        
            <p>No recommendations from the advisory group have been released, but Goldsmith told reporters at a media standup on Monday that an announcement was coming later this week.</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal justified the compensation he had received for his work as chair of the group.</p>
        
            <p>"The role of the advisory group chair is a full-time role, and 250 [working] days per annum is factually correct," the former Crime Prevention Group president said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am a small businessperson, who needs to employ people to cover my time away from the business when I am doing the advisory group work," Kaushal said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Cabinet fees framework is set by the government and, I believe, is paid to all the chairs of ministerial advisory groups.</p>
        
            <p>"[Labour's criticism] shows why that party is no longer the party of small business. They don't get that for the self-employed, there's no leave, no holiday pay, there's no recess and there's no magical sick leave either."</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal said Goldsmith was expected to announce the recommendations put forward by the advisory group shortly.</p>
        
            <p>"I am proud of the solutions we have put forward to make retail stores safer for law-abiding workers who continue to be victimised by criminals," he said.</p>
