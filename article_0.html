            <p>Hunger-striking inmate Dean Wickliffe will be released from prison after appearing before the Parole Board on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 77-year-old was taken to hospital on Monday after having refused food since 10 March, claiming he was beaten by multiple guards at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to prison for breaking his parole conditions, because he was living in his car and not at an approved address.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared before the New Zealand Parole Board today after his recall hearing date was moved forward from 3 April, following requests from his lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Sam Vincent confirmed to RNZ that Wickliffe has been granted parole and his hunger strike was now over after 16 days.</p>
        
            <p>He is set to be released on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Vincent told RNZ Wickliffe's immediate release was "what we really needed".</p>
        
            <p>"We're relieved by this. He doesn't pose a threat to the community and he has good support around him."</p>
        
            <p>The board considered Wickliffe's accommodation and support proposal "adequately addressed the risk" and a full written decision would be available in 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Steve Abel viewed the hearing at Wickliffe's request and told RNZ his release was "very good news".</p>
        
            <p>"It's justice done, to my view. He should never have gone to prison in the first place, in this instance."</p>
        
            <p>Abel said Wickliffe was "stoic" when the judgement to release him was made.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the course of his time in prison, he has advocated for better prison conditions within the justice system, and in this latest instance, did that again.</p>
        
            <p>"That is something he feels very passionately about, that there needs to be a basic tenant of humanity in the way that prisoners are treated even while they're in incarceration - he is a strong advocate for that."</p>
        
            <p>Wickliffe's lawyers allege the 77-year-old's head was beaten into a concrete floor after he refused to enter his cell and be double-bunked.</p>
        
            <p>They are calling for the public release of the footage related to the incident.</p>
