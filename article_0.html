            <p>An Auckland engineering student said her sister texted from Bangkok last night to say she was stuck in a mall and wasn't sure if she'd survive the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the region, killing at least 140.</p>
        
            <p>Tharaya Poorisat is doing her PhD in built environment engineering at Auckland University of Technology.</p>
        
            <p>Poorisat said she was at her job as a teaching assistant when she received a text from her sister Kanwipa Chindahporn at 8.18pm.</p>
        
            <p>She said her sister, an orthodontist, was on her way to work when there had been an intense earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>The clinic was in a huge retail and business complex. Poorisat said her sister had just got inside the mall when the quake hit.</p>
        
            <p>"She hadn't reached the clinic... she texted me. [It said] 'You know there is an earthquake, intense one in Thailand. It's very sudden, if I don't survive, all my money and stocks are all yours. It's so sudden, I have no time to write a will or anything. I was inside the building, there was an intense earthquake in BKK.'"</p>
        
            <p>Poorisat said she was shocked.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest, I cried. I think there was probably a network failure but I couldn't contact her and she disappeared... I thought what would I do if my sister passed away? We are best friends."</p>

            <p>Poorisat then went online.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so shocked, it's the first earthquake in Thailand. We don't have any history of earthquakes and some of those buildings may be earthquake-prone, although normally I think we do well."</p>
        
            <p>Poorisat finally heard back from her sister two hours later.</p>
        
            <p>"She contacted me at 10.40pm to say, 'I'm home. I'm not dead.'"</p>
        
            <p>Poorisat said her sister was "very lucky".</p>
        
            <p>The mixed-use building, Siamscape, also housed several tutoring schools.According to local news outlet the Bangkok Post, some students were reportedly trapped in it for a while, but they were all evacuated out safely later.</p>
        
            <p>Poorisat, from Bangkok originally, said her parents and brother were out of town and they were also safe.</p>
        
            <p>She contacted friends on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"My friend told me her partner was running for her life - she was working on 25th floor and had to run down, it was horrible."</p>
