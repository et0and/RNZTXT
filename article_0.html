            <p>Kiwi shot putter Tom Walsh is out of medal contention after throwing three fouls and apparently suffering an injury.</p>
        
            <p>His teammate Jacko Gill is still in contention.</p>
        
            <p>And sprinter Zoe Hobbs managed a quick 11.13s time in her 100m semi-final, but it was not enough to qualify for the final.</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Erika Fairweather is also up in an Olympics final on Sunday morning - the 800m freestyle at 7.09am.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Emma Twigg has been pipped for the gold by the Netherlands in the event she won at Tokyo 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg was unable to defend her Olympic title, settling for silver as she was beaten in the women's single sculls final by Dutch rower Karolien Florijn. Tom Mackintosh came fifth in the men's single scull final.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the week, New Zealand rowers won three medals - a gold, silver and bronze - in quick succession in a magic hour on the water.</p>
