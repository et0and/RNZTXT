            <p>Renee Joblin runs a small engineering company that has been built up through hard work over the years.</p>
        
            <p>Right now, she's waiting for $10,000 in payments that should have come in on the 20th of the month and she has suppliers "breathing down her neck" for $6000. "My family has to go without groceries because I have to pay my rent and staff wages."</p>
        
            <p>It's often bigger companies that try to set their own payment terms, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though we ask those big companies for deposits on bigger jobs they don't pay them, just wait until the whole invoice is due - which creates a knock-on effect... we have no debt older than 30 days but there is stuff owed to us that is older than 50 days and that's why sometimes we don't pay on time."</p>
        
            <p>Accounting platform Xero has released new data that shows an 81 percent increase in the cost of late payments to small businesses, from an estimated $456 million in 2021 to $827m in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Another business owner, who did not want to be identified, said late payments created a "vicious cashflow circle" that had been going on for more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>People who were waiting for their bills to be paid ended up being late with their payments to other people. "A lot of people are owed a lot of money so they can't service their debt.. It only takes one business to throw a spanner in the works of a whole industry."</p>
        
            <p>He said many of his conversations with other business owners were about how much they were owed and how long they had been waiting.</p>
        
            <p>Xero country manager Bridget Snelling said some big businesses were "using small business community as a bank of easily accessible capital".</p>
        
            <p>She said when the Business Payment Practices Act was repealed, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment acknowledged late payments were an issue for large market players.</p>
        
            <p>A voluntary code is being considered but Snelling said that had not proved effective in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"The impact of these late payments is profound, locking substantial funds out of the small business economy, restricting growth, and preventing new businesses from thriving."</p>
        
            <p>She said big businesses should commit to paying their bills within 10 business days.</p>
        
            <p>"In a high inflation, high interest rate economy, the cost of not getting paid on time is higher.</p>
        
            <p>"Think about the fact that our economy is made up of 97 percent small businesses, they're a quarter of GDP, if small business is having a tough time it really does have a detrimental impact on the rest of the economy and the standard of living for many Kiwis. It's really important we do everything we can to help small businesses with cash-flow."</p>
        
            <p>She said big businesses tended to have more bargaining power than their small counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>"Often it's the case that small businesses are held to ransom and have to abide by whatever the big business's payment terms are. Sometimes they are really onerous and it's a long time for a business between supplying the goods or doing the mahi and getting paid.</p>
        
            <p>"Small businesses don't usually have cash reserves on hand to get through ... we're asking big businesses to think about their payment terms and commit to 10 days."</p>
        
            <p>Small businesses could also help by setting up invoice reminders and offering more payment options on their invoices, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Employers and Manufacturers Association head of advocacy Alan McDonald said late payments had become more of an issue in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>He said in regions where a number of small businesses were dependent on a large business, they would really struggle if payments were slow.</p>
        
            <p>"It tends to be small businesses not paying small businesses. It's all down to cash-flow - there's a knock-on effect, if someone doesn't get paid then further down the track someone else doesn't get paid."</p>
        
            <p>He said his organisation tried to communicate to members that late payments could be a sign of of problems ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are starting to see customers become slow payers it could be a sign they are under stress and you are probably going to be under stress and need to do something about it."</p>
        
            <p>He said debt management was something that many businesses were not good at and they should be more proactive, particularly when things were tight.</p>
