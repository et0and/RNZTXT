            <p>Wellington businesses are waiting on what water restrictions might mean for them this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water is currently working with emergency agencies to deal with potentially critically low water levels this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The capital is currently under level 1 water restrictions, meaning households can only use sprinklers every second day.</p>
        
            <p>Due to warmer weather and leaky pipe infrastructure, the water provider is preparing for level 3 restrictions - which would see all outdoor residential use for water banned.</p>
        
            <p>But, it does not yet have a plan for what restrictions might mean for businesses.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington Water spokesperson said it was working with local councils on how restrictions might apply to businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Currently, businesses are not subject to specific restrictions, but we do ask them to be pragmatic and responsible with their water use this summer."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the utility had yet to determine how restrictions may apply to businesses in an emergency response, but it was liaising with respective councils on their individual by-laws.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be better placed to provide an update in the coming weeks."</p>
        
            <p>Rodney Wayne on Manners Street manager Lloyd Saunders said it would be concerning if the hairdressing salon had to cut down its water use.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd just be worried we couldn't meet the needs of our clients.</p>
        
            <p>"Every single service we do comes with a wash and a blow dry - and without that, it might mean we really have to cut the volume of clients we can see or we'll have to adapt the services we do.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe we'll try and transition to doing more dry cuts but that really does change the nature of the services we can offer."</p>
        
            <p>Saunders said the salon had faced numerous challenges throughout the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been hammered for the last couple of years so I think we are quite resilient. We'll figure out a plan - it will suck a bit though for a while we figure it out.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses like ours - where we are washing and using water all day - I can see some angry hairdressers on the horizon."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Chamber of Commerce chief executive Simon Arcus said the city was in a dynamic situation where the potential impacts of a shortage were not yet clear.</p>
        
            <p>"What we need is planning, and we need really good communication. The earlier these businesses get the information they need, the better."</p>
        
            <p>Arcus said it related to how government communicated with businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"The earlier we got information about traffic light systems and changes, the better it was for business. Ultimately, its a shock absorber in the economy if it is going to suffer from the reality that water is scarce."</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Mayor and Wellington Water Committee chair Campbell Barry said in levels one to three restrictions would apply only to residential users.</p>
        
            <p>"If we were to get to an unprecedented situation of level 4 restrictions, then we are going to have to work with everyone and that's our business community as well on how we can get through."</p>
        
            <p>Barry said the key priority was residential water use and "finding and fixing the really large leaks we know are out there ... we want to be in a position where we don't go anywhere near level 4."</p>
        
            <p>Karaka Cafe operator Paul Retimanu said water restrictions would pose a challenge for the hospitality sector.</p>
        
            <p>"In hospitality, there's a real risk as a consumer of water through our kitchens and all the back of house areas."</p>
        
            <p>Retimanu said the business community need better messaging from authorities.</p>
        
            <p>"We do need to front-foot this with some good solutions in place of what it could look like and what is the plan, should we go to level 4."</p>
