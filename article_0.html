            <p>The Kiwi men will race for fifth or sixth while the women smashed the national record in the team pursuit.</p>
        
            <p>Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields set a new national record finishing in a time of 4 minutes 04.679.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand will race Italy in the first round tonight with the winner getting the chance to go for the gold or silver. If they lose they will be among nations racing for the bronze.</p>
        
            <p>The men's team beat Belgium, however, Australia set a world record in beating Italy who also posted a faster time than the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>That means New Zealand will race France for fifth and sixth.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi quartet of Aaron Gate, Tom Sexton, Keegan Hornblow and Campbell Stewart only qualified with the sixth fastest time of the eight teams on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>However, they looked impressive in beating Belgium this morning, posting a time of 3.43.776.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the Kiwi women's team pursuit did everything right to set the best time ahead of the USA, Great Britain and Italy.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Lisa Carrington and her team mates have breezed through their heats, while Kiwis on the track and climbing wall have also advanced.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington, along with team mates Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan, led from the beginning of the women's K4 500m and never looked back. They go straight through to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington and team mate Hoskin also won their K2 500m and are in the the semi-finals. Fellow New Zealanders Aimee Fisher and Lucy Matahaere did not advance after coming fifth in their quarter-final.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's men's team in the K4 500m and K2 500m also advance to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, first-time Olympian middle-distance runner Maia Ramsden is through to the semi-final of the 1500m after coming sixth in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>Climber Julian David made two personal best times, 5.24 in the first round, only to beat that in the elimination heat with a time of 5.20, defeating Iran's Reza Ali Pour to advance.</p>
