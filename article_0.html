            <p>A 22-year-old man has been arrested for 10-month-old Mustafa Ali's murder at Te K큰iti on 8 June.</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in Hamilton District Court on Saturday, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Mustafa Maheir Mukzameel Ali was taken to Te K큰iti Hospital unconscious last Saturday afternoon and was unable to be revived.</p>
        
            <p>He died a short time later and police began a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week police said he died of violent blunt force trauma.</p>
        
            <p>The parents had spoken to police but Detective Inspector Graham Pitkethley said he had concerns there were inconsistencies with the family's statements.</p>
        
            <p>Today he said it was possible more charges would be laid.</p>
        
            <p>"The police investigation into Mustafa's death and other incidents that occurred during his short life is ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are continuing to support Mustafa's wider family, as they grieve the loss of their little boy, and our thoughts are with them," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Family and friends buried the baby boy at the Te K큰iti Cemetery on Thursday. They gathered around the tiny grave, where a cross, flowers and soft toys were laid.</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley thanked all those who have come forward with information to assist their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Te K큰iti residents can expect to see a continued police presence in the area as we continue to examine and reconstruct the full circumstances of Mustafa's life."</p>
