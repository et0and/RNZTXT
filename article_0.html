            <p>A man who helped to save people during a mass stabbing at an Auckland supermarket says the "shadow" of that day still follows him around.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Andrews was recognised in this year's New Zealand Bravery Awards for his actions during the 3 September 2021 attack at Countdown LynnMall.</p>
        
            <p>Ahamed Samsudeen, who had been under intense police surveillance since being released from prison for possessing objectionable material, walked into the supermarket in the afternoon and grabbed a large kitchen knife.</p>
        
            <p>He then began indiscriminately attacking customers in several aisles of the store.</p>
        
            <p>Within minutes he had seriously injured several people and attempted to attack members of the public and staff who had barricaded themselves in a storeroom.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews was in the store when the stabbing rampage began, and saw two injured people fall to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>As Samsudeen returned to a woman he had previously attacked, crouching over her to stab her, Andrews approached him and shouted to distract him. Samsudeen reacted by trying to stab Andrews before moving away.</p>
        
            <p>"It went from zero to 100 really quickly and he chased me and I ran out of range, picked up a bollard and went back to Aisle 10 and tried to fight with him with the bollard thing," Andrews said.</p>
        
            <p>"Another dude yelled at him and he turned and chased a guy and I followed the attacker around. Next thing there was armed police and lots of shots fired."</p>
        
            <p>Samsudeen was fatally shot by police and died at the scene.</p>

            <p>Andrews then assisted in providing first aid to the victims. In total, seven people were stabbed, with some suffering critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a "horrible day" and he thought he would never see his young boys again.</p>
        
            <p>"It was scary, it's still there, it's like a shadow, it just lives with you."</p>
        
            <p>Andrews said he was proud of his actions, but said "I just wish I'd done more and [a victim] would have been cut less, and I can't change that."</p>
        
            <p>He was humbled to be among the list of Bravery Medal recipients, but said the honour came with mixed emotions.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't [think] there would be anybody on this list that wants this. I didn't do what I did that day because I thought there was something at the end of it. You know I'd rather those people not be hurt, and they carry scars now.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we all would have preferred that the event never happened, but it did, and you've got to find the lessons and the goodness in it and I'm doing that."</p>
        
            <p>Andrews said the survivors of the attack continued to meet as a group every now and again.</p>
        
            <p>"We're connected forever basically. We don't live in each other's lives, but we will always be connected by that event."</p>
