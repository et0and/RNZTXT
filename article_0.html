        <h2>The $25-a-night DOC hut with million-dollar views</h2>
        <p>
The newly restored Cape Brett Hut is one of a handful of huts run by the Department of Conservation in Northland.

            <p>To enjoy some of the best views in the Bay of Islands this summer you could book the exclusive, cliff-top Rahimoana villa at Eagle's Nest in Russell for a mere $15,000 a night.</p>
        
            <p>Or, you could spend just $25 a night for an arguably even more stunning view overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the iconic Hole in the Rock.</p>
        
            <p>The only catch - if you could call it that - is you have to make your own way to historic Cape Brett Hut on foot.</p>
        
            <p>Also, unlike Rahimoana, it doesn't come with a Porsche or a personal chef, but those are minor sacrifices given its other attractions.</p>
        
            <p>Cape Brett Hut is one of just a handful of huts operated by the Department of Conservation in Northland, but it is one of the most spectacularly located in the country.</p>

            <p>A former lightkeeper's cottage, it perches on the tip of rugged Cape Brett peninsula, at the foot of Rakaumangamanga, a mountain renowned as a waypoint for Polynesian navigators.</p>
        
            <p>Just offshore, the famed Hole in the Rock - original name Motukōkako - lures a steady stream of tourist boats.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, the hut had been showing its age and there were frequent problems with its water supply.</p>
        
            <p>A major renovation earlier this year, however, means the cottage - built in the early 1900s to house a lightkeeper's family - is back to looking its best and ready to withstand the Cape's sometimes ferocious conditions.</p>

            <p>DOC Bay of Islands operations manager Bronwyn Bauer-Hunt said the seven-week, $290,000 restoration project focused on preserving the hut's heritage, while ensuring a high standard of comfort and durability for future visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Inside the hut, the restoration team carried out a full repaint, sanded and re-varnished the floors, and replaced the "ugly" 1970s doors with kauri versions in the building's original style.</p>
        
            <p>Outside, rotten weatherboards were replaced and window frames restored. New flashings and drainpipes were installed and the exterior was given six layers of paint.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said she was thrilled to welcome visitors back to the hut, and its stunning surroundings, this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The cottage could sleep up to 23 people and attracted about 2000 visitors per year.</p>
        
            <p>"Although it's a challenging hike to reach the hut, it's very popular, providing a unique experience for those seeking adventure and a connection to New Zealand's natural and historical heritage."</p>
        
            <p>Options for reaching the hut included taking a water taxi to Deep Water Cove, followed by a two-hour hike.</p>
        
            <p>Weather permitting, water taxi passengers could sometimes disembark directly onto the rocks below the hut.</p>
        
            <p>Those who wanted the full Cape Brett experience could walk from Rāwhiti on a physically demanding track that took up to eight hours each way.</p>

            <p>That route crossed private land owned by the 3B2 Trust. The track fee, like accommodation at the hut, could be booked and paid for online.</p>
        
            <p>The historic lighthouse, a short scramble uphill from the cottage, was built in 1910 from cast-iron parts shipped from Thames.</p>
        
            <p>It was decommissioned in 1978 and restored in 2007.</p>
        
            <p>Other standout DOC accommodation in Northland includes Lane Cove Hut in Whangaroa Harbour's Pekapeka Bay - accessible by boat as well as on foot - and the more basic Peach Cove Hut at Whangārei's Bream Head.</p>
