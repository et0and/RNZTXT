            <p>Former US President Donald Trump was found guilty all 34 counts in his hush money trial.</p>
        
            <p>The jury's verdict on each count was read aloud in a New York courtroom on Friday (NZT).</p>
        
            <p>Moments after being found guilty, Trump called the verdicts a "disgrace".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters outside court Trump said it was a "rigged" trial and he vowed to keep fighting.</p>
        
            <p>The New York jury in Trump's hush money trial has found him guilty of all of the charges against him.</p>
        
            <p>This morning the judge announced the jury had reached a verdict, but had requested extra time to complete forms related to their decisions on the 34 felony counts the former president faces.</p>
        
            <p>Trump was sitting in the courtroom with his arms folded across his chest as he awaited the reading of the verdict.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second day of deliberations Thursday after the panel began the weighty task a day before. The jury deliberated for about 9.5 hours total: about 4.5 hours Wednesday and five hours Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen for a US$130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors said the reimbursements were falsely logged as "legal expenses" to hide the true nature of the transactions.</p>
        
            <p>The charges Trump faced were punishable by up to four years in prison. He has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>The case is the first of Trump's four indictments to reach trial and is the first-ever criminal case against a former US president.</p>
