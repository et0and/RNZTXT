            <p>The theft of $75,000 worth of fencing from the North Shore has left locals worried about safety and ratepayers fuming.</p>
        
            <p>In November, more than 60 fence panels were stolen from on top of a newly built retaining wall in Albany between Silver Moon Road and Gills Road. Another 16 were stolen last week.</p>
        
            <p>That was on top of 10 panels taken from a recently repaired site in Long Bay in November.</p>
        
            <p>Uzra Casuri Balouch, deputy chair of the Upper Harbor Local Board, told Morning Report the latest "brazen and appalling" theft appeared to be well-planned and she was "absolutely disgusted".</p>
        
            <p>"I was asked to do a site visit and I spoke to the residents there who are absolutely outraged by this theft, because it took a lot of effort and a lot of advocacy on their part for us to provide them with… a safe footpath, because these fences were keeping the pedestrians safe," Balouch told Morning Report on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"They were all about pedestrian safety and protecting them from drop-off of the steep embankment."</p>

            <p>Residents who saw the thieves thought they were contractors from Auckland Transport or the council, she said, because they had hi-vis gear on.</p>
        
            <p>"They did it over several days and they did it at all hours."</p>
        
            <p>Balouch hoped information would be forthcoming - perhaps from someone who receives the panels to be melted down.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no idea what the reason is, but I'm just thinking with this cost of living crisis happening, more and more people are stooping to this kind of behavior, and it's not on.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hearing about this all the time. We hear about prowlers in the community knocking on doors and all sorts of hours.</p>
        
            <p>"This was reported to 105, and there was no response. I think the police presence and even admin staff at police manning these lines, they need to be increased. The community needs to feel safe. I think that's really, really important - that's the one role the government plays in the country, to keep its citizens safe."</p>
        
            <p>Police said on Thursday they were not immediately aware of reports of stolen fencing, but were looking into reports referenced by Auckland Transport.</p>
