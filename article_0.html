            <p>The cost of junior doctors doing extra hours to plug workforce shortages has skyrocketed to more than $70 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>The costs for 2022-23 were more than twice as high as the year before when they were $33m, figures generated for RNZ by Te Whatu Ora show.</p>
        
            <p>They were also 2.6 times higher than the $23m paid in 2020, when doctors worked long hours to tackle the Covid pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ was forced by big gaps in the rosters to virtually double the rate it paid per shift in June 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"My reaction when I saw the figures was: 'Wow, it really is that bad'," said Resident Doctors Association (RDA) national secretary Dr Deborah Powell.</p>
        
            <p>"They were new figures to me, but with 400-500 vacancies of resident doctors, they also weren't a surprise."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ agreed to pay almost twice as much per hour in mid-2022 for "additional duties" that saw junior doctors doing evening, night and weekend shifts on top of their regular work hours, as well as a much smaller amount for "cross cover" work to plug gaps in day-time shifts.</p>
        
            <p>This higher rates were meant to stop last month, but were continuing.</p>
        
            <p>"There are still gaps as some shifts and services have not been able to cover the gaps," Health NZ said in the OIA supplied to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Shifts to cover out of hours had historically been hard to fill.</p>
        
            <p>"The enhanced payments were to recognise that we needed cover for those shifts."</p>
        
            <p>Powell said it was a "vicious cycle", with plugging gaps at high cost taking money away from regular pay rises needed to help retain staff.</p>
        
            <p>"It did take an increase in the rates to get them to do the cover," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But they don't want to. They already work 60 hours a week... they don't want to suffer the consequences of fatigue and make a mistake."</p>
        
            <p>She said junior doctors were not taking advantage of the system. "No, the residents [junior doctors] know that we have to cover the shifts, otherwise there won't be a doctor".</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ took over a year to give the junior doctor information to RNZ; it should by law take five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"I am very sorry for the delay," wrote Sasha Wood, head of government services.</p>
        
            <p>The high costs increased pressure on districts that received orders from the government last month to find $105m in savings from staffing by the end of June.</p>
        
            <p>"The higher rates are higher than budget, which will impact on the bottom line," said Whanganui district about the junior doctor rates.</p>

            <p>The 2500 junior doctors in the Resident Doctors Association are taking industrial action over pay.</p>
        
            <p>A strike on Tuesday is set to be followed by a two-day strike from next Thursday morning. Senior doctors have often had to cover for them.</p>
        
            <p>Most have been offered a 20 percent pay rise, but not all - others would get a 12 percent pay cut, creating a split that has motivated strikers.</p>
        
            <p>"We are such an undervalued but integral part of the hospital," a Waikato Hospital medical registrar on a picket said.</p>
        
            <p>OIA figures show some districts paying more than twice as much between financial year 2021-22, and 2022-23. Northland paid almost four times as much - $3.2m versus $840,000 - Waikato paid 3.3 times more and MidCentral's costs were 2.6 times higher.</p>
        
            <p>Capital and Coast paid 2.3 times more, and it also topped the total costs in additional duties and cross-cover of any district - $13.4m, a rise of $7m in just 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>This was well ahead of Canterbury ($10m) and Auckland ($8.7m).</p>
        
            <p>The beleaguered Southern district had to find an extra $2.27m to cover the extra pay for junior doctors that it had not budgeted for.</p>
        
            <p>While the higher rates had helped plug gaps, "workforce shortages" and higher rates of unplanned leave by both junior and senior doctors, had weighed the other way, the OIA showed.</p>
        
            <p>This was reflected in the Hutt, Capital Coast and Wairarapa districts stating: "While these rates add to the district's overall wage and salary costs, this is offset by the districts' RMO [resident medical officer] vacancy rates."</p>
        
            <p>Vacancies were the problem, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can solve our retention problems, we won't need to pay this money.</p>
        
            <p>"An investment to get the retention correct will be rewarded by not having to pay this money and overall we will be in a much better situation financially - and having enough doctors to look after our patients."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ chief people officer Andrew Slater said in a statement that workforce pressures were being felt on the front line "and these shortages are having an impact on our people".</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge their contribution and commitment to serving their patients and communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't fix those shortages quickly."</p>
        
            <p>An extra 50 new medical school places were being opened up from this year as a "first step" to boost local training, and a support service for junior doctors was being developed, Slater said.</p>
        
            <p>In the OIA, Te Whatu Ora said there was no evidence of junior doctors gaming the system - such as by using lieu days with the agreement that a colleague would work for them, and collect the higher additional duties pay, then requesting their own lieu day.</p>
        
            <p>A joint agency-union group met to ensure any breaches were clamped down on and "it was not raised by either party as a concern or practice being witnessed".</p>
