            <p>Up to 50 new or converted charter schools will be funded out of Budget 2024, the coalition government has announced.</p>
        
            <p>It has set aside $153 million of new funding for the publicly-funded private schools over the next four years.</p>
        
            <p>The money will establish 15 new charter schools and convert 35 state schools in 2025 and 2026, depending on demand and suitability.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour said there had been overwhelming interest from educators exploring the charter model.</p>

Associate Education Minister David Seymour says charter schools have greater flexibility in how they spend their funding, as long as they reached the "agreed performance outcomes".

            <p>"We've heard from potential applicants such as TIPENE St Stephen's MƒÅori Boy's Boarding School, and AGE School.</p>
        
            <p>"By focusing primarily on student achievement, charter schools allow sponsors and communities to take their own path getting there.</p>
        
            <p>"They can, with some restrictions, set their own curriculum, hours and days of operation, and governance structure.</p>
        
            <p>"They also have greater flexibility in how they spend their funding as long as they reach the agreed performance outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>An application process for prospective charter schools will open after legislation is passed in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>It is expected the first charter contracts will be signed before the end of the year, so the first schools can open for Term 1 of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said the changes would lift declining educational outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>"Charter schools provide educators with greater autonomy, create diversity in New Zealand's education system, free educators from state and union interference, and raise overall educational achievement, especially for students who are underachieving or disengaged from the current system."</p>
        
            <p>"They provide more options for students, reinforcing the sector's own admission that "one size" doesn't fit all."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said a new departmental agency - independent of the Ministry of Education - would be created to monitor the performance of charter schools.</p>
