        <h2>Mill closure shuts door on three generations of family history</h2>
        <p>
For 21 years, Aaron McCann and his father worked together at the mill. For the past year his son James has been there too.

            <p>When Winstone's Karioi Pulp Mill closed down this month, it shut the door on generations of family history for those who have spent their lives working on the site.</p>
        
            <p>The mill has been operating for 45 years in the Ruapehu District, at Tangiwai near Ohakune.</p>
        
            <p>For many of those years, it has employed members of the local McCann family.</p>

            <p>Aaron McCann's father Tom worked there for 33 years as a cleaner.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a general hand ... it used to be called a cleaner back in the day, he shovelled chip."</p>
        
            <p>For 21 years the two men worked at the same mill, and Aaron smiles as he recalls their time together - saying it was a good thing they were in different roles on site.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't bump heads too much."</p>

            <p>His father died eight years ago, and for the past year Aaron's son James had been working alongside him.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't get away from him, he's helped me out a lot," James joked.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good seeing him every day," Aaron said.</p>
        
            <p>Both men were devastated by the mill's closure, saying the workplace offered so much more than just employment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's everything for us - it's our life. It's very sad and a lot of young ones are just realising the impact now," Aaron said.</p>

            <p>The McCanns, like many mill families, were facing the possibility of being split up as James was looking over the ditch at opportunities there.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to stay here, but it's not looking very hopeful for myself, so Australia is looking quite inviting ... I don't want to leave but if I have to, I will," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of people moving out of the area, a lot of families getting split up now."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Aaron was hoping to stay put and start his own firewood business.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going anywhere," he said.</p>

            <p>The government decided not to intervene in the mill's closure, saying there were a number of factors involved and it was not in a position to step in and save businesses.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Labour Party said it would have backed the government putting a share of electricity profits into a short-term solution to help the mill workers.</p>
        
            <p>Aaron said the whole situation had left everyone feeling frustrated and let down.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm quite disappointed with the government. They campaigned for us to vote for them, and when we wanted their help they just turned a blind eye.</p>
        
            <p>"National said we are going to double exports and go hard, but we're losing exports - freezing works are closing, we are closing.. I don't know what the country is going to be, that's what I want to tell New Zealand - we're going backwards," he says.</p>
