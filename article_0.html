            <p>Any school not putting in place the new ban on phones will face a visit from the Education Review Office, Education Minister Erica Stanford says.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon have addressed media at the regular post-Cabinet conference after announcing the government's new education priorities.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the coalition government's ban on phones in schools comes into action.</p>
        
            <p>The government is facing backlash after Te Whatu Ora confirmed public hospitals needed to make target savings of $105 million by July, saying it was about bringing the organisation back to budget.</p>
        
            <p>It said several districts have gone over budget in the past three months, adding it is "reducing the overspend, not making cuts".</p>
        
            <p>Former Te Whatu Ora chairperson Rob Campbell said that felt like a last-minute panic on behalf of management.</p>
