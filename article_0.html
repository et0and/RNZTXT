            <p>Wellington City Councillors will hold an urgent meeting Wednesday afternoon after the government threatened to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown told media he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and thresholds to intervene in the city council.</p>
        
            <p>It came after the council voted last Thursday to stop the sale of its 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>The sale was part of the council's long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday afternoon City Councillor Diane Calvert emailed Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau to ask for a meeting between councillors and mana whenua after the airport vote.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting would see the councillors discuss the council's long term plan (LTP) amendment process in wake of the council's decision not to sell its shares.</p>
        
            <p>It would include discussion on how staff calculated the resulting $400-$600 million deficit caused, reviewing projects, and considering seeking independent support for navigating the LTP amendment process.</p>
        
            <p>Calvert said in the email she recommend a media release from the mayor "outlining a constructive way forward that involves all council members and conveys a unified message".</p>
        
            <p>She said this was vital for restoring public and government confidence in the council.</p>
        
            <p>A private meeting would be held at 2.30pm Wednesday.</p>
