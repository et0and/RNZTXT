            <p>Seven teenagers have been arrested after an aggravated robbery in the southern Auckland town of Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>Police said six young people aged 12 to 18, wearing masks - including two armed with weapons - entered a business in West Street on Monday morning. They demanded tobacco products, which they stole, then went to a nearby address, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The business owner was inside at the time, but was able to quickly move away from the group.</p>
        
            <p>A seventh person drove the robbers to the business in a stolen vehicle, which was later recovered with most of the stolen items inside, Inspector Joe Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>Several people nearby at the time had "observed the robbery and contacted police, providing a number of updates... that led to the arrest of all seven alleged offenders."</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently working through an investigation which includes conducting a scene examination of the [business] and at the address in Pukekohe where the offenders were located."</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand justice system treats anyone 18 years old or older as an adult, and anyone 17 years old or younger as a minor - although 17-year-olds can go through the adult justice system if charged with serious crimes.</p>
        
            <p>"Six of the seven alleged offenders are youths," Hunter said, "and we are currently considering charges of aggravated robbery and other offences pertaining to the stolen vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>He said support was being provided to the victim, and police wanted to thank the people who reported details to police as the incident was unfolding.</p>
