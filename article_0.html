            <p>A train travelling from Waikanae to Wellington has been hit by a rockfall as heavy rain arrives in the region.</p>
        
            <p>There are no reports of injuries, but passengers said they could hear the rocks hitting the train while going from Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a lane on State Highway 2 through the Hutt Valley has been closed.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings were in force Monday morning for the lower North Island, as the weekend's wet and boisterous north-to-westerly winds continued.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was in place for Horowhenua Kapiti Coast, and the Wellington area, including north of Porirua and Upper Hutt, set for between 5am and 5pm. MetService warned of "periods of heavy rain, and amounts may approach warning criteria. Moderate chance of upgrading to a warning.</p>
