            <p>The government is being accused of quietly expanding the reach of its public service cuts to pay for promised tax breaks.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as one of the largest public agencies, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, puts the call out to staff, offering voluntary redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>National campaigned on slashing spending across 24 public agencies, as part of its "Back Pocket Boost" tax plan.</p>
        
            <p>The policy proposed an annual reduction in back-office expenditure by an average of 6.5 percent; on top of Labour's $500 million in annual public sector savings.</p>
        
            <p>National identified two dozen agencies which could spend less including the transport, conservation and justice ministries.</p>
        
            <p>Now, Finance Minister Nicola Willis' office has confirmed she asked "all departments" to identify savings in December, not just those listed in National's election policy.</p>
        
            <p>"Departments have been asked to identify savings options of either 6.5 or 7.5 percent depending on how much their full-time equivalent staff numbers (FTE) have increased since 2017," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Labour public services spokesperson Ayesha Verrall said National had expanded the public service cuts it campaigned on.</p>

            <p>"Nicola Willis made reckless commitments about tax cuts which she couldn't afford and now she's sneaking in larger cuts than she signalled before the election. This is a broken election promise."</p>
        
            <p>Willis said the policy was consistent with National's pre-election commitment to restore discipline to government spending.</p>
        
            <p>"We were very upfront about our commitment to get a reduction in consulting and contracting spend across government; to move resources out of bureaucracy and into the frontline.</p>
        
            <p>"An inclusion of those [all] agencies in this exercise is entirely consistent with those promises we made to New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>National has promised frontline services will not be impacted by the cuts, but Public Service Association national secretary Duane Leo said this was not possible.</p>
        
            <p>"6.5 or 7.5 percent is going beyond the removal of contractors and efficiencies; it's basically going to cut to the bone in terms of services and staff."</p>
        
            <p>Public sector bosses will present their savings plans - including potential risks - to the government soon, before ministers and Cabinet decide whether or not to accept their proposals.</p>
        
            <p>Willis is looking to slash annual public service spending annually by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>The bulk of that will come from a reduction in consultant costs and savings already announced by the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining $600m will be made up of further cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Exactly where these savings are made will be revealed in May's Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Some government departments are already making changes.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has confirmed it had offered its staff voluntary redundancy this month, having signalled the process late last year.</p>
