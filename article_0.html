        <h2>Economy crawls out of recession</h2>
        <p>
A small jump back into positive growth ends half a year of bad news and beats economists' expectations.

            <p>The economy has rebounded more strongly than expected out of recession, on the back of improved agricultural production and tourism spending.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data shows gross domestic product -- the broad measure of economic growth -- rose 0.7 percent in the three months ended December, to be 1.1 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Expectations had been for quarterly growth of 0.3 percent, and and annual contraction of 1.3 percent, after the previous two quarters of contraction.</p>
        
            <p>"Higher spending by international visitors led to increased activity in tourism related industries such as accommodation, restaurants and bars, transport and vehicle hiring," spokesperson Katrina Dewbery said.</p>
        
            <p>The main growth spots were agriculture, up 1.4 percent, retail up 1.9 percent, and transport up 2.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Those were partly offset by a 3 percent fall in construction, reflecting the slow down in house building, and decreases in telecommunications and internet services.</p>
        
            <p>The energy sector, which had dented the previous quarter because of the mid-winter power crunch, rebounded as conditions returned to more normal activity.</p>
        
            <p>Individual shares of the economy - per capita GDP - rose 0.4 percent, the first quarterly increase in two years, but were still more than 2 percent over the year.</p>
        
            <p>The country's purchasing power (disposable income) improved 1.2 percent for the quarter, after shrinking in the previous six months, although it was was still 2 percent down on a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>The latest GDP reading marked the turning point for the economy, which fell into its worst contraction in nearly 30 years outside of the Covid-era.</p>
        
            <p>Lower interest rates are expected to give a spark to household spending and business investment.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts are for modest, positive growth this year picking up pace in the second half for an annual rate between 1.5-2.0 percent, rising towards 3 percent next year.</p>
        
            <p>However, a soft labour market, with unemployment expected to nudge higher, is expected to keep a brake on household spending.</p>
        
            <p>The uncertain global outlook and impact of any tariffs on world growth is expected to weigh on business activity and investing decisions.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's quarterly growth rate was one of the stronger among our major trading partners, but the annual contraction was the weakest of any for 2024.</p>
