            <p>Joseph Parker is back in the ring, taking on Chinese heavyweight Zhilei Zhang for the interim WBO belt.</p>
        
            <p>Parker is coming off arguably one of the best performances of his career when he beat American Deontay Wilder in a unanimous decision in December, which took his record to 34 wins and three losses.</p>
        
            <p>Zhang comes in with a 26-1-1 record after defeating Joe Joyce twice last year.</p>
        
            <p>The Knockout Chaos card is headlined by Anthony Joshua fighting Francis Ngannou.</p>
