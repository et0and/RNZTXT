            <p>Whether it is a fight or a farce, the world will be tuning in to watch.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Tyson last fought professionally in 2005, and this Saturday he re-enters the ring against a man 27 years his junior.</p>
        
            <p>'Iron Mike' was once the most feared man walking the face of the earth, but time waits for no man.</p>
        
            <p>Enter 'the Problem Child' Jake Paul, one of the world's biggest influencers turned actor turned pro boxer, who has proven the critics wrong several times. Many have called for him to take on a 'real' boxer, while others believe that 58-year-old Tyson is the man to finally end the brash young Paul's in-ring run.</p>
        
            <p>Whether you love him or hate him, Paul's impact on the boxing world cannot be denied, nor can his athletic ability.</p>
        
            <p>Despite only entering the boxing world in 2020, Paul, now known as 'El Gallo', has managed to carve out an impressive resume. He has won 10 of 11 fights and beaten some big names in combat sport, including two former UFC champions.</p>
        
            <p>Paul rose to prominence on social media platforms such as Vine and YouTube, amassing billions of views. He then progressed to Hollywood, landing a gig on the Disney Channel. Now with a die-hard horde of young fans, Paul looked to make his mark in the rising phenomenon that was influencer boxing.</p>
        
            <p>Picking up a TKO in his debut bout, Paul immediately began to take legendary names from MMA, including Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva. He suffered his only career loss in a split decision against Tommy Fury, younger brother of Tyson Fury, before bouncing back with victories over two of the toughest men to ever enter the octagon in Nate Diaz and Mike Perry.</p>
        
            <p>This is Tyson's first professional fight in 19 years, so there is understandably plenty of concern about his health and his legacy, both of which will be under threat against Paul.</p>
        
            <p>He fought an exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020, though looked a shell of the man who rearranged faces in the '90s. he has also been lacking energy at press conferences and venom on the mic.</p>
        
            <p>The fight was originally scheduled for July but Tyson was forced to pull out due to an ulcer flare-up in late May. But he is still Mike Tyson, and all it takes is one.</p>
        
            <p>While this is a professionally sanctioned fight, the gloves will be bigger and the rounds will be shorter. It will take place over two-minute rounds instead of the standard three, and boxers will use 14oz gloves instead of the standard 10oz ones.</p>
        
            <p>A magnet for controversy, Paul's fights garner not just criticism but ridiculous amounts of cash, and with this bout being on Netflix, it is set to be the most lucrative yet.</p>
        
            <p>On the Forbes list of the world's highest paid athletes, Paul's PPVs have totalled more than $150 million, and on Saturday he is set to take home $40 million with Tyson earning himself $20 million.</p>
        
            <p>It is expected to be the most watched boxing event in modern history, with some pundits even predicting an online audience of half a billion.</p>
        
            <p>Tyson, with 50 wins, six losses and 44 career knockouts, has earned his moniker of the baddest man on the planet.</p>
        
            <p>Paul has just one career loss, with 10 wins and seven knockouts.</p>
        
            <p>Paul has promised he is going to knock out 'Iron Mike'.</p>
        
            <p>"The Gods sent us for a war of the ages. I'm going to out-box the man who has been doing it his whole life. I'm feeling sharp, powerful, and explosive. it's going to be a short night for Tyson. Someone is going to sleep."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Tyson says he is going in there to hurt Paul and has warned the former Disney star to "take this seriously".</p>
        
            <p>"I was born to sell out stadiums. I'm betting on myself. I want him to be that old savage Mike, I want that killer. I want the hardest match possible and I want there to be no excuses from anyone when I knock him out. I'm not going to lose."</p>

            <p>The TAB has Paul as a $1.62 favourite with Tyson wearing the underdog tag paying $2.63. A draw is paying $10.</p>
        
            <p>Don't expect the 'slugfest' Paul has predicted. This is going to be a slow, drawn-out eight rounds of a much fitter and faster Paul picking Tyson apart from the outside, and clinching for dear life any time he feels a haymaker coming his way. Tyson will have two or three blitzes in his at most before he inevitably gasses and ends any chance of him finishing Paul.</p>
        
            <p>Tyson's only chance will be to catch him clean and early, but Paul will add another great to his list of victims with a laboured majority decision.</p>
        
            <p>The co-main event pits Katie Taylor against Amanda Serrano. The pair first fought in 2022 in what was the biggest women's fight in boxing history, with Taylor winning a narrow decision.</p>
