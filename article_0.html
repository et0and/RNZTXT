            <p>Lebanese have troops have pulled back from the border with Israel as a ground invasion by Israel looks imminent.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli strikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs, a security source said, with a Reuters reporter witnessing a flash of light and a series of loud blasts about an hour after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate areas near buildings it said contained Hezbollah infrastructure south of the Lebanese capital.</p>
        
            <p>Israel has told the US it plans to launch a ground incursion into Lebanon, multiple reports from the US say. And a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the positioning of Israeli troops suggested an incursion could be imminent.</p>
        
            <p>It comes days after Israel killed the head of the Lebanese armed group, Hassan Nasrallah, in an escalation of regional tensions.</p>
