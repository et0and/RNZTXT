            <p>A group determined to tackle the number of new bottle shops says there has been a burst of licensing applications ahead of stiffer new rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) comes into force for Auckland this month and will immediately slap a two-year freeze on new liquor shops.</p>
        
            <p>Secretary of Communities Against Alcohol Harm lawyer Grant Hewison said they have noticed a "rush" of new applications in the last three to four months.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps in anticipation that this LAP will take effect," Hewison said.</p>
        
            <p>The LAP, which outlines the location, number and trading hours for alcohol businesses in different areas, was adopted by Auckland Council in August.</p>
        
            <p>The two-year freeze on applications prevents new-off licence bottle shops in Auckland city and 23 other suburbs. It comes into effect on 16 September.</p>
        
            <p>This means any application to open an off-licence in these areas is likely to be declined for the next two years, unless a very high threshold was met.</p>
        
            <p>Hewison said the LAP will make a significant difference in reducing alcohol-related harm in Auckland's most vulnerable communities.</p>
        
            <p>He said they knew of a new bottle shop application in Henderson out west, Milldale north of Auckland, Manurewa, and some other recent ones in the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Hewison said the implementation of the LAP will make it harder for new liquor shops to set up, with stricter restrictions after the two-year freeze.</p>
        
            <p>"The community has responded to that [applications], we have a number of objections that have come through to those stores and that would go through the District Licensing Committee processes.</p>
        
            <p>According to council, there have been 139 new liquor licence applications between May and August.</p>
        
            <p>These included those who had taken over a business that already had an existing licence.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 139 applications, two were for clubs, 22 for off-licences, and 115 for on-licence.</p>
        
            <p>An on-licence premises includes pubs, taverns, hotels, restaurants and cafes, while a club premises include sports clubs and RSA's.</p>
        
            <p>Hewison said now that the LAP had been adopted, it will slow down new off-licence applications, or stop it.</p>
        
            <p>"It will make a significant difference, in terms of creating the right framework within which the community can still oppose liquor stores, if they want to set up."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Josephine Bartley said since 2018, there have been 9490 liquor licence applications and only 25 were refused.</p>
        
            <p>"So that means our communities will need to continue fighting and objecting."</p>
        
            <p>The second part of the LAP, maximum trading hours with a 9pm closing time for all off-licence stores, will come into place on 9 December.</p>
