            <p>A celebration of the Māori King's coronation at Tūrangawaewae marae in Ngāruawāhia, the Koroneihana began on Friday - also marking 18 years since the death of the Māori Queen Dame Te Atairangikāhu.</p>
        
            <p>The celebrations will continue through the week, but Monday is the most political - with politicians expected to speak at a pōwhiri. The Kiingitanga will speak first, followed by government and opposition politicians.</p>

            <p>ACT leader David Seymour will not be attending, with some dispute about whether or not the party was invited.</p>
