            <p>The coalition plans to reintroduce the three strikes sentencing law later this year - but it will be slightly different.</p>
        
            <p>The three-stage system of increasing consequences for repeat serious violent offenders was first introduced by National and ACT in 2010, but was repealed by the previous Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee said once approved by Cabinet, she would introduce a bill to the House later this year which would reintroduce it.</p>
        
            <p>The system would cover the same forty serious offences, with the addition of the new strangulation and suffocation offence.</p>
        
            <p>It would also only apply to sentences above 24 months and provide a limited benefit for guilty pleas.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
