            <p>Democrats are consolidating their support around Kamala Harris, after US President Joe Biden dropped his faltering re-election bid on Sunday amid intensifying opposition within his own Democratic Party.</p>
        
            <p>He endorsed Harris, his vice president, to replace him as the party's candidate against Republican Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Biden, 81, in a post on X said he would remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025. He has not been seen in public since testing positive for Covid-19 last week.</p>
        
            <p>"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.</p>
        
            <p>If officially nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run to lead a major-party ticket in US history. A former attorney general of California and former US senator, she ran unsuccessfully for president against Biden in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"My intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump."</p>
        
            <p>All 50 Democratic party state chairs have thrown their weight behind Harris to be the party's new presidential nominee, according to sources familiar with the matter. The chairs held a conference call on Sunday after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside as the party's candidate. There was "full support" in backing Harris to be at the top of the ticket, one source said.</p>
        
            <p>Prominent members of the party, including past contendor Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Clintons have expressed support for Harris.</p>
        
            <p>Biden's campaign had been on the ropes since a disastrous debate against former President Trump, 78, in which the incumbent at times struggled to finish his thoughts.</p>
        
            <p>The party was planning to hold an online vote to officially nominate Biden ahead of the formal convention, partly to quell internal dissent about his candidacy.</p>
        
            <p>"As it stands, that process could still happen - so they might try and get somebody in place before the convention itself," BBC correspondent Tom Bateman told RNZ's Nine to Noon. "The question is really about what happens in the discussions between congressional Democrats and party officials now, because the question is, do they effectively say, 'Right, the time for division is over, we're going to get behind Kamala Harris,' or are other people going to put themselves forward?</p>
        
            <p>"And therefore you have that competition rolling out over the next few weeks, and that's the big unknown at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Bateman said polls would play a big part in who the Democrats ultimately go with.</p>
