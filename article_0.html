            <p>The government is bringing in the Commerce Commission to keep an eye on Wellington Water.</p>
        
            <p>Local Government Minister Simon Watts said the move comes after recent reports about "high costs and unsound financial management" at the entity.</p>
        
            <p>It means Wellington will have economic regulation and Commerce Commission scrutiny, part of the wider Local Water Done Well programme, imposed on it sooner than other places.</p>
        
            <p>The government said it was accelerating Local Water Done Well for the Wellington region to provide greater transparency at Wellington Water and ensure it was delivering value for money for ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the current issues, Wellingtonians shouldn't have to wait for the full economic regulation regime to be in place to have greater visibility over how their money is spent on water services," Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Commission will impose foundational information disclosure requirements on Wellington Water.</p>
        
            <p>"This will require it to report to the public and the Commission on key delivery performance and financial management measures.</p>
        
            <p>"While the precise disclosure requirements will be set by the Commission, we anticipate it will include indicators that provide a view of value for money, procurement practices, and plans to address the shortcomings outlined in the published reports."</p>
        
            <p>Watts said the action today to increase public accountability at Wellington Water was implemented under Local Water Done Well legislation the Coalition Government passed last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last few months, I have had serious concerns around Wellington's water services," Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "clear evidence suggesting the ratepayers are not getting good value for money".</p>
        
            <p>"I am not satisfied by the progress made to address these glaring problems and without clear and decisive action, Wellingtonians face a decade of hefty rate increases with little to show for it."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached Wellington Water for comment.</p>
