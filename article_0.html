            <p>A new ministry set up to slash red tape spent more than $400,000 on contractors in six months.</p>
        
            <p>The ACT Party pitched a Ministry of Regulation ahead of last year's election and secured its creation during coalition negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>This new department was set up six months ago, replacing the Productivity Commission, and has spent $410,150 on contractors.</p>
        
            <p>The figure was confirmed in an answer to a written Parliamentary question by Green MP Francisco Hernandez, who said it was "outlandish".</p>
        
            <p>"This government has double standards. While our health system and public service is buckling under the weight of government cuts, their pet ministries are getting lavished with attention."</p>
        
            <p>"While the wider public service is being left with crumbs, Seymour's pet ministry is feasting on cake."</p>

            <p>It comes after new figures revealed the department was paying its staff an average salary of more than $150,000 and would eventually employ more than 90 people.</p>
        
            <p>In his written answer, Minister of Regulation David Seymour said it took "time and resource" to establish a ministry.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact, until 8 May the ministry was without its own payroll services and only able take on staff as contractors or secondees," his written response says.</p>
        
            <p>"Consequently, the ministry has required a mix of seconded, fixed-term staff and contractors to carry out its establishment activities and begin the ambitious programme of work I have asked of it, including initiating and carrying out two regulatory reviews."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he expected the proportion of the ministry's budget spent on contractors would decrease when it recruited a permanent workforce.</p>
