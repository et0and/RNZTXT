            <p>The Prime Minister went on a whirlwind trip around Tokyo today, attending events ranging from space deals to export produce to tiny fashion dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon is cracking through his three-day trade mission to Japan, after a wobbly start when the defence force plane broke down in Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>The Boeing 757 is back up and running, and is expected to carry Luxon and his business delegation back to New Zealand early on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Luxon was there to see Rocket Lab sign a record deal with Japanese satellite company Synspective for 10 electron launches off the Mahia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>He then visited a Costco store to see New Zealand produce including salmon, kiwifruit, apples and cookies on the shelves.</p>

            <p>The Prime Minister's objectives for the trip are threefold: boost existing business, promoted international investment and develop his relationship with his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida.</p>
        
            <p>He also toured a frigate at the Yokosuka Naval Base today, where he announced New Zealand will do more to support North Korea sanctions monitoring on a Japanese frigate.</p>

            <p>It is part of a concerted effort to be seen to be doing more with defence in an increasingly-contested Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a real uplift in the number of assets that we're deploying to support this important mission; one which is vital for supporting the stability of the Indo-Pacific," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon rounded off the day by meeting some local dogs at a New Zealand pet food store, eating sushi with Japanese celebrities and meeting Japan's defence minister.</p>
