            <p>A man convicted of murdering a man walking his dog at a Christchurch park has avoided a life sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Messervy, 20, has been sentenced to 17 years and six months imprisonment after being found guilty for the murder of Nigel Wilson, 62, who was found badly injured with several stab wounds at Bexley Reserve in November 2022. Messervy was 18 at the time of his arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The sentence includes a minimum non-parole period of seven years.</p>
        
            <p>The Sentencing Act - which lays out the penalties for various crimes - says a person found guilty of murder has to be sentenced to life imprisonment, unless it would be deemed "manifestly unjust".</p>
        
            <p>A minimum non-parole of at least 10 years usually applies for life sentences for murder.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Rachel Dunningham on Wednesday said she believed the "impulsive" circumstances of the attack, Messervy's youth, his family background and resulting post-traumatic disorder and his rehabilitative potential meant a life sentence would be manifestly unjust.</p>
        
            <p>Following a trial spanning more than a week, jurors rejected the defence case that proposed Messervy did not intend to kill Wilson when he stabbed him.</p>
