        <h2>'Absurd and totally unacceptable': Man has to wait a year for surgery</h2>
        <p>
"I was stunned at the state of things," a Canterbury man who has been bumped down the list says.

            <p>A Canterbury man whose surgery has been delayed is disbelieving that a cost savings drive ordered at hospitals will not impact patient care.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora has given the 20 health districts a target to save $105 million collectively by the end of June, by reining in spending on staff, such as on overtime.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury district must save $13.3m in 10 weeks - which equated to a rate of about five percent of its operational spend in that period.</p>
        
            <p>The man just received a hospital letter warning him he faced a long wait for surgery, and adding: "We sincerely apologise for this, but the circumstances are not within our control."</p>

            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti said on Friday that "none of these cost-saving measures will impact the level of care patients receive".</p>
        
            <p>The man said that seemed "incredibly naive".</p>
        
            <p>His one-page letter from the hospital contained a "special notice about current waiting times for surgery".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has seen the letter and asked Te Whatu Ora how many had been sent out.</p>
        
            <p>"The letter that was sent to me was obviously sent to a large number of people awaiting surgery, possibly thousands," the man said.</p>
        
            <p>The letter said: "Unfortunately, the health system has been under very high pressure, in part due to the ongoing effects of Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>"We currently only have capacity to treat patients with a non-deferrable condition, such as cancer.</p>
        
            <p>"When our capacity improves, there will be a large number of patients that we will need to prioritise surgery for, and this is going to take some time.</p>
        
            <p>"This means the waiting time for your surgery is currently much longer than expected, and longer than you may have been indicated."</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand chief executive Margie Apa has said hospitals now have enough staff to "live within our means" post-Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"Times have moved on and that means a return to more business-as-usual practices," Apa said in a letter to health unions a few days ago, outlining the savings drive - what she called "reducing the overspend, not making cuts".</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury man said the hospital had told him directly that he would have to wait a year.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2022 the wait time was 65 days. Now it is 365 days. This quite frankly is absurd and totally unacceptable," he emailed RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I must confess that I was stunned at the state of things. My normally placid GP cut loose with language that you would not expect from a doctor."</p>
        
            <p>The last three months had driven spending over budget, the health agency said.</p>
        
            <p>Its quarterly report to December 2023 showed internal personnel costs were $100m under budget, at $5.6 billion for the first six months of the financial year, against a budget of $5.7b.</p>
        
            <p>But outsourced personnel costs were $112m over budget, mostly due to overspending on external medical staff ($100m) and external management and administration personnel ($108m).</p>
        
            <p>The man said he appreciated the country had to "tighten our belts".</p>
        
            <p>"But we need to be reassured of a high level of competence in our nation's leadership. This saga reeks of immaturity and inexperience.</p>
        
            <p>"It was completely predictable that the hospital would react in this way."</p>
