            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will speak shortly at his weekly post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government scrapped Labour's controversial Three Waters programme when it came into power and has now struck a deal with Auckland Council that will see water rates rise by 7.2 percent rather than the 25.6 percent forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare will be able to borrow more money to invest in infrastructure under the scheme with the cost of borrowing spread over a longer period.</p>
        
            <p>Local mayors are now considering how a similar deal might work in smaller districts.</p>
