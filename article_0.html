            <p>Two massive wildfires menacing Los Angeles from the east and west were still burning uncontained today.</p>
        
            <p>The Palisades Fire between Santa Monica and Malibu on the city's western flank and the Eaton Fire in the east near Pasadena already rank as the most destructive in Los Angeles history, consuming nearly 31,000 acres (12,500 hectares) - or some 48 square miles (125sqkm) - turning entire neighborhoods to ash.</p>
        
            <p>At least five people have been killed, thousands of homes and businesses have been incinerated and nearly 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with another 200,000 under evacuation warnings, officials said.</p>
        
            <p>The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna told a press conference, adding that the Eaton Fire alone had damaged or destroyed 4000 to 5000 structures. Officials said the Palisades Fire destroyed another 5300 structures, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>
        
            <p>There have been conflicting reports that the death toll has risen to seven.</p>
