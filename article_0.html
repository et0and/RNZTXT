            <p>New Zealand rowers are hoping to float to the top of the medals table as day six of the Paris Olympics 2024 gets under way.</p>
        
            <p>There are four chances for rowing medals tonight, with the women's and men's double sculls and the women's and men's coxless fours all taking place between 9.20pm-10.10pm NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Later, sailors Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie, and Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, will contest medal races in the 49er FX skiff in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the time difference, day six begins on Thursday evening NZT and stretches into Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>So far, New Zealand has copped a gold medal in women's sevens rugby and a silver in the men's triathlon.</p>
