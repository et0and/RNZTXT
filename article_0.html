            <p>Lollies containing methamphetamine were distributed in food parcels from the Auckland City Mission after they were donated by a member of the public.</p>
        
            <p>The mission was alerted when a parcel recipient reported "funny tasting" lollies, and missioner Helen Robinson says she is "absolutely devastated" by the turn of events.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the mission said the Rinda brand pineapple lollies in a sealed retail-sized package were donated by an unknown member of the public.</p>
        
            <p>"As a measure of safety, lollies still on site were tested by NZ Drug Foundation. Tests confirmed that the lollies tested contained potentially lethal levels of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in the process of contacting possible recipients to inform them of the issue and give them guidance on next steps. Public safety is our key concern."</p>
        
            <p>The mission said it only accepted commercially manufactured food for inclusion in food parcels and the lollies appeared as such when donated.</p>
        
            <p>It was "deeply concerned" and was working with the NZ Drug Foundation and police, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said anyone concerned they might have received one of the lollies should called 111 and if they were feeling unwell, go to the nearest healthcare provider urgently, or also call the national poison line on 0800 764 766.</p>
        
            <p>The mission said police were investigating.</p>
