            <p>Power is out to 100 homes in Whitianga, a tree is blocking State Highway 25, and there is minor flooding and debris on other roads in the Coromandel area following heavy rain overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Thames-Coromandel District Council said 100mm of rain fell across the peninsula overnight, and it was still raining at 7am.</p>
        
            <p>"High tide is at 8.30am this morning, meaning that all streams and rivers are running high until later in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Take extreme care if travelling or walking the dog this morning," the council advised.</p>

            <p>About 100 homes in Whitianga were without power on Thursday morning, with reports of surface flooding and debris on roads in the area, a tree was blocking SH25 at KÅ«aotunu.</p>
        
            <p>It said, PowerCo was working to restore power.</p>
        
            <p>After a night of heavy rain in much of the country, Thursday was promising another day of severe weather with thunderstorms, wind and snow forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty had the worst of the weather overnight, MetService Duty forecaster Heath Gullery said.</p>
        
            <p>Taranki had 100-150mm of rain while Tasman had up to 250mm in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's rain radar showed the rain band moving across the upper North Island and the centre of the country early Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law told Morning Report the "band of rain" was likely to be stuck over the country for a few days.</p>
        
            <p>The wet weather was taking it's time moving on from Coromandel and Bay of Plenty but in general things would clear up in the North Island during Thursday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However things would ramp up in the southeast of the South Island, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an incredibly wet situation down across the likes of Otago."</p>
        
            <p>But he said there were "plenty of severe weather watches and warnings" nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>And it was likely to remain wet over the weekend, Law said Northland, Auckland, and Waikato should expect more showers then.</p>
        
            <p>In the afternoon, up to two months' worth of rainfall could hit in parts of the South Island, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said .</p>
        
            <p>NIWA forecaster Seth Carrier said Thursday would see "a plume of moisture coming down from the north", carrying heavy rain that could impact the Bay of Plenty and East Cape, before the heavier rain crops up in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService has issued a swath of warnings and watches.</p>
