            <p>Four police cars have been rammed during a street racing event in Hamilton overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato police said they received reports of a large gathering of cars and people at the intersection of Horotiu Road and Great South Road, about 2.15am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Officers dispersed the crowd and the vehicles moved on, before converging near the Base in Northgate.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Neil Faulkner said the crowd became "increasingly hostile" and officers were "put at serious risk due to the violent behaviour of many of those involved".</p>
        
            <p>In one instance, a vehicle allegedly reversed at speed towards a police car, which officers were standing in front of.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the investigation, police were looking for "a vehicle of interest", and to identify and speak with the two people.</p>
        
            <p>Faulkner said the behaviour was dangerous and it was fortunate no staff or members of the public were injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are committed to disrupting this activity by breaking it up when it occurs and holding offenders to account.</p>
        
            <p>"However, this is an example of how incredibly dangerous these situations can become."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or dashcam footage should contact 105 - the police non-emergency service - or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
