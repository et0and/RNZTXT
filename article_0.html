            <p>The Government has announced new assessment for students from the first year of school.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford said from 2025 phonics tests with children will begin at 20 weeks and 40 weeks of schooling.</p>
        
            <p>Twice-yearly "progression monitoring" for reading, writing and maths would also be introduced for children in years three through eight.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the assessment was intended to give parents certainty about their childrens' learning.</p>
