        <h2>Live: 'Night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak' as LA fires spread</h2>
        <p>
A fire is now threatening a populous area, while 16 people have been killed, 12,000 structures razed, and neighbourhoods left looking 'like war zones'.
</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were slowly making progress in their battle to contain the inferno that has razed swathes of Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades neighbourhood to the ground, but still-spreading flames threatened communities in the populous San Fernando Valley.</p>
        
            <p>"LA County had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak," Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said.</p>
        
            <p>Six simultaneous fires that have ripped across the second-largest US city since Wednesday had killed at least 16 people as of Monday morning with more missing.</p>
        
            <p>The blazes have damaged or destroyed 12,000 structures, fire officials said. The flames have reduced whole neighbourhoods to smouldering ruins, destroying the homes of the rich and famous and ordinary folk alike and leaving an apocalyptic landscape.</p>
