        <h2>The worst start to Wellington's summer in a decade</h2>
        <p>
Complaining about the weather is a national past-time, but some of it is justified this summer, official data shows.

            <p>Complaining about the weather is somewhat of a national past-time, but Wellington residents are justified in bemoaning this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The capital has had one of its worst starts to the year on record, with Wellingtonians weathering the longest run of cold days in a decade, according to MetService data.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians spoken to by RNZ described this year's summer to date variously as "a buzz kill", "crap", "pretty trash", and "one of the worst in memory".</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Clare O'Connor said the feelings were backed up by the data, with a streak of low temperature days - 13 in a row - making the start of the year the least summery since 2014, and putting it among a handful in the past four decades.</p>
        
            <p>She said while the daily average temperature of 17 degrees Celsius for January was not exactly balmy, it was almost three degrees above the current daily average of 14.3 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>"Digging back into our records, going back to 1980, this is one of the longer runs of below average daily temperatures that we've had in the summer months."</p>
        
            <p>She said while the cool temperatures were set to continue for the next couple of days, she said it was unlikely to top the peak streak of 17 in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>She said continuous southerlies - which have caused majored disruptions to Cook Strait ferry services - were largely to blame for the cooler temperatures, bringing wind gusts of up to 100kmh and double the average rainfall for the year to date.</p>
        
            <p>"(The southerlies) are being driven by low pressure to the east of the North Island (pushing) colder southerly air up over the east of the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Wellington and the lower North Island is really exposed, so it brings that cold air up over us and cloudy days.</p>
        
            <p>"With that rain as well, it's all going to contribute to less than ideal summer weather."</p>
        
            <p>O'Connor said the start to the year was a sharp contrast to 2024's above average temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>She said while last year's Wellington Anniversary weekend was 29 degrees Celsius - a January high not seen since 1971 - this year's holiday would be lucky reach the low 20s.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking at 21 degrees as our maximum for Wellington Anniversary weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"But I will say it's much easier to sleep than it was January last year."</p>
        
            <p>Hope remained, O'Connor said, for temperatures to pick up next month, with records showing some low temperature Januarys were followed by warm Februarys.</p>
        
            <p>However, she would not make any promises.</p>

            <p>The southerlies have also seen Wellington's popular inner-city Oriental Bay beach almost deserted this season.</p>
        
            <p>Surf lifesaver Sarah Hay said it had been a "pretty slow start to the summer".</p>
        
            <p>"The first four weeks of our paid lifeguard service have been pretty dead.</p>
        
            <p>"Not many people on the beach at all."</p>
        
            <p>She suspected the cold start to the season was keeping all but the die-hard Wellingtonians at bay.</p>
        
            <p>"The water temperature has been really low compared to previous years and the winds have been quite cold and strong."</p>
        
            <p>Hay said Monday's 15 degrees was three degrees below the average of 18 for this year, but said it was expected to climb to 16.7 next week.</p>
