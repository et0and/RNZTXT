            <p>The Prime Minister has announced the completion of all but one of the items on the third-quarter plan, and unveiled a new one with 43 targets.</p>
        
            <p>The "partially completed" third-quarter plan item was to publish an updated health workforce plan.</p>
        
            <p>With Commissioner Lester Levy appointed to lead Health NZ Te Whatu Ora, the government says a new national health workforce plan will now be considered by Cabinet in the next quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The new plan also focuses on infrastructure, with items including the passing of the Fast-Track Approvals Bill and the first RMA reform bill, establishing the National Infrastructure Agency, and starting the review of regulations for a third sector.</p>
        
            <p>It also includes the promised expansion of free breast cancer screening, more consequences for beneficiaries not meeting obligations, and legislation to combat foreign interference.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon says the government is shifting focus now that interest rates are falling, towards "creating the foundations for growth".</p>
        
            <p>It follows large protests over the weekend against the government's announcement last Thursday that it would look to scale down construction of the new Dunedin Hospital, keeping it within the funding envelope of $1.9 billion.</p>
        
            <p>A report suggested the costs had increased to about $3b.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about that, Luxon said he understood the frustration, but "we can't have a project like that blowing out and heading towards a $3b cost.</p>
        
            <p>"Rest assured, we're committing to building a new hospital but it needs to be within the budget frame ... even at $1.9b it would be amongst one of the most expensive hospitals in the southern hemisphere."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand could not have situations like what the government "inherited around cost blowouts", pointing to the Interislander ferries and school buildings projects.</p>
