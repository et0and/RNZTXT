            <p>A children's librarian is hoping young people will embrace reading this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Libraries whānau learning specialist Lawren Matrix warned children could lose up to six months of progress if they stop reading over the school holidays.</p>
        
            <p>"It means they spend their first term back at school getting their literacy and reading levels back to where they were at the end of the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>"We call this the summer slide or summer reading loss.</p>
        
            <p>"Tamariki, whānau, and kaiako work hard to get reading levels up. Not only do they start the year having lost all that work, but it has a compounding effect and they are always trying to catch up."</p>

            <p>Studies in New Zealand and overseas have shown a long summer break could result in a loss of reading gains made during the year for some primary school pupils.</p>
        
            <p>Matrix said at least 15 minutes of reading a day was recommended, but even a few minutes would make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>She acknowledged parents were busy, and sometimes devices were needed to keep children occupied.</p>
        
            <p>"Families want their children to be off devices and playing outside or reading a book.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can make reading a habit and get them feeling good vibes, hopefully, we're setting them up to continue reading for pleasure as they get older."</p>
        
            <p>Her advice to families was to make reading fun.</p>
        
            <p>"Read as a family and empower your kids to read about what they're interested in."</p>
        
            <p>She also suggested listening to audiobooks or VOX Books, especially for reluctant readers.</p>
        
            <p>Until 26 January, children in Auckland could pick up a summer reading tracker and activity handouts from libraries across the city.</p>
        
            <p>Matrix, who led the Raumati Reads summer reading programme for 5- to 10-year-olds, said participants would earn stickers and prizes for completing activities and reaching daily reading milestones.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Libraries had also put together a suggested reading list, highlighting local authors and Children's Book Awards winners.</p>
        
            <p>Matrix said the programme, which was introduced in 2023, had helped hundred of parents keep their children reading.</p>
