            <p>The organisation's change proposal, leaked to RNZ, says 66 roles would likely go from the workforce of 528 people.</p>
        
            <p>About a third of the roles are already vacant, with both science and back office jobs likely to go.</p>
        
            <p>GNS says it is supporting its staff through the unsettling and uncertain time, but it will continue to deliver the critical science, innovation, and technology.</p>
