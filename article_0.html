            <p>Senior New Zealand First MP Shane Jones has confirmed party leader Winston Peters is not in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The leaders of National and ACT arrived in the capital on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour earlier said it was "very possible" that the leaders of the three parties looking to form a government would meet today.</p>
        
            <p>All the party leaders have been meeting one-on-one, but have yet to all get in the same room together.</p>
        
            <p>But later on Tuesday, Jones told reporters that Peters was not in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"But the caucus are down here and we're flat out on our various bits and pieces."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands National leader Christopher Luxon has given up all hope of attending the APEC leaders summit in San Francisco later this week.</p>
        
            <p>He would have needed to reach a deal by tomorrow at the latest to be able to attend.</p>
        
            <p>Arriving in Wellington on Tuesday, Seymour told waiting reporters each party has issues the others do not like very much, and each knows they will have to come to a compromise.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hope is that happens as rapidly as possible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone says they want it to go faster - I certainly do, I think a lot of people watching and listening would love to see this be got on with - but equally no one person can decide how a negotiation between three ends, or when it ends ... ultimately, three have to agree."</p>
        
            <p>He was asked if they would all be meeting together today.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's very possible, we're certainly very happy to meet anyone, anytime, and we're all in Wellington now so that's got to make it easier.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there may well be a meeting of three, yes."</p>
        
            <p>He also alluded to discussions about the state of the economy, pointing to expectations the Emissions Trading Scheme auction of units next month could mean government revenue falls about $1 billion short.</p>
        
            <p>"That creates another hurdle I guess," he said. "I think what's critical is the budget has to balance, we can't keep borrowing and spending - that drives inflation, it drives mortgage rates, it makes people's lives much harder as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"But nevertheless the numbers have to stack up. ACT has always said that if you're prepared to spend less, you can balance a budget and tax less without adding new taxes. That's the kind of question that I guess we've got to work through this week."</p>

            <p>Luxon, also arriving at the airport on Tuesday morning, had little to say about the negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a great week ahead of us, we're going to make some progress," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're making great progress, we've got lots to do this week and we're going to make sure we get a strong, stable government for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We're making great progress."</p>
        
            <p>NZ First MP Mark Patterson was the first to appear at the party's temporary offices across from Parliament, and told reporters "things have ground to a little bit of a halt in terms of our visibility here".</p>
        
            <p>"So we're looking forward to seeing how they've progressed."</p>
        
            <p>He would not comment on the party's position on National's foreign buyers tax, but said "I look forward to a briefing today".</p>
        
            <p>ACT deputy leader Brooke van Velden, also landing in the capital, said she was looking forward to meetings lined up for today.</p>
        
            <p>"Negotiations are negotiations and I look forward to the meetings that we've got today," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's possible that there could be a deal by the end of the week, or even next week, but that's what the ongoing talks are about ... every day is a new day."</p>
