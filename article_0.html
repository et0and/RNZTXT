            <p>Mayor Helen Lash has declared a local state of emergency for the southern ward of Westland District.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as parts of the West Coast experience their wettest night in decades as emergency managers continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Emergency Management said the declaration was made "as extensive flooding causes significant problems across the district, including evacuations, road closures and landslips in the South Westland area.</p>
        
            <p>"This declaration provides for controllers to direct and coordinate personnel, material and other resources made available and provides access to extraordinary powers to deliver an effective and timely response to an emergency.</p>

            <p>"Members of the public are reminded to prepare getaway bags in preparation for potential evacuations.</p>
        
            <p>If anyone is feeling unsafe, please self-evacuate to friends or family on higher ground or call 111."</p>

            <p>About 30 campervans from a camping ground in southern Westland have been evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell was travelling from Hokitika to Franz Josef and said the roads were hazardous.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been some slips. There is a community through the south ... because of slips that has been isolated and cut off."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the evacuated campers have been taken to a safer area.</p>
        
            <p>Orange level rain warnings are in place for Westland until at least this afternoon, with a small chance warnings could escalate to red.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Civil Defence has partially activated its emergency operations centre, with emergency managers meeting later on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Warnings for heavy rain continuing for Westland, Buller, and Cantebury headwaters this afternoon/evening as the front moves north. Watch for severe gale northwesterlies in Canterbury High Country until early this afternoon:https://t.co/qHyE5zzql5 pic.twitter.com/KASXa9E3gB</p>
        
            <p>Claire Brown from West Coast Emergency Management has asked people to avoid travel, particularly in the south of the Westlands area, with some road closures in place.</p>
        
            <p>These include State Highway 6 from Fox Glacier to Haast, due to a slip, and Ross to Fox Glacier because of flooding and slips.</p>

            <p>In a statement, the New Zealand Transport Agency said parts of the state highway will remain closed over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Systems manager Mark Pinner said: "Our crews will continue to clean up the fallen trees and slips around Bruce Bay, the glacier towns and south of Ross but the Knights Point cracks are of more concern.</p>
        
            <p>"We will have a surveyor on site this afternoon and more geotechnical inspections by chopper Sunday morning to assess the area at Knights Point. SH6 through Knights Point area will remain closed for the weekend with the next update for the route between Fox Glacier and Haast at 10am Monday."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said no detour was available for SH6 at Knights Point.</p>
        
            <p>"People wanting to get to Greymouth or Hokitika will need to come via Arthur's Pass or the Lewis Pass from the east coast for the time being, or delay their journeys."</p>
        
            <p>About 350 millimetres of rain had fallen across the coast in the 24 hours to 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Franz Josef experienced its wettest 24 hours in 45 years.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell earlier said Westland residents should stay off the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said Emergency Management officials and the community were well prepared, but they need to stay vigilant, and stay off the roads if they can.</p>
        
            <p>He said the main area of concern is the Waiho River near Franz Joseph, which experts were keeping a close eye on.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has also issued orange heavy rain warnings for Grey and Buller until 9pm Saturday, with 100mm to 130mm of rain expected.</p>
