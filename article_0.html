            <p>New Zealand is joining other nations, including Britain, in condemning Russian government malicious cyber-attacks.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released this morning, Minister Responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau Judith Collins said this country was backing a position taken by the UK and other allies.</p>
        
            <p>The UK government said earlier today malicious cyber activity was affecting its domestic democratic institutions and processes, as well as civil society organisations. It blamed Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand stands with the UK in calling out this behaviour," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand does not tolerate attempts to undermine the integrity of democratic institutions through cyber or any other means.</p>
        
            <p>"NGOs [non-government organisations] and civil society organisations also play an important role in enabling social inclusion in our democracies, and any attempt to interfere with their ability to do that is unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"Russia's pattern of malicious cyber activity continues to demonstrate disregard for the framework of responsible state behaviour online and for the international rules-based order."</p>
        
            <p>Collins said it was a reminder to businesses and other organisations in New Zealand to ensure they had strong cyber security measures in place and were protecting their data from all kinds of cyber harm.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand condemns the unacceptable actions of Russian state actors and calls for all states to behave responsibly online."</p>
