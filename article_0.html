            <p>A 15-year-old has been named as one of the drivers who died in a crash at a motorsport competition in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes are emerging online for Brooklyn Horan, who has been competing since he was a young child.</p>
        
            <p>Hodgson Motorsport posted on Facebook on Monday: "It is with a very heavy heart that today we heard the absolutely devastating news that Brooklyn passed away doing the very thing we grew to love together as families. It's times like these that you remember that the sport we chose comes with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows."</p>
        
            <p>"Brooklyn you were an amazing kind loving happy kid and that hadn't changed years later when we crossed paths again back at off-roading last year, the cheeky smile was still the same, you had just grown a weeee bit taller."</p>
        
            <p>ORANZ, the governing body for off-road racing in New Zealand, posted: "Our thoughts go out to family & friends of Brooklyn Horan from all of the off roading community. You were a huge talent in multiple motorsports."</p>
        
            <p>A large number of the motorsport community on Facebook have changed their profile pictures to black in tribute.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, MotorSport New Zealand confirmed two competitors died after one car went off the road at the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa.</p>
        
            <p>Police and emergency services were called to the scene at approximately 2pm, but the competitors died before they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of these two competitors and all involved with the Arcadia Road Rallysprint," said MotorSport New Zealand president Wayne Christie at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole motorsport community will be understandably shocked and upset by this terrible tragedy. We will be offering support to all those involved in the coming days."</p>
        
            <p>MotorSport New Zealand said it would cooperate with all investigating agencies as well as undertake its own full and thorough investigation.</p>
