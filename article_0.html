        <h2>Why the unemployment rate is worse than you think</h2>
        <p>
New data from Stats NZ shows the jobless rate is rising quickly.

A new model suggests NZ's unemployment rate could soon top 5 percent.

            <p>New Zealand's unemployment rate may have already reached 4.8 percent, and could hit 5 percent by the end of the year, an economist says.</p>
        
            <p>AUT economics professor Tim Maloney has developed a new model that gives more timely information on likely changes in the rate.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ only updates the rate each quarter, whereas Maloney's model provides a monthly reading.</p>
        
            <p>"We collect data from the past to indicate what the unemployment rate is but by the time we look at it, that quarter is already gone.</p>
        
            <p>"To make good decisions, we need to know currently what the unemployment rate is, what the state of the aggregate economy is."</p>

            <p>Maloney said the UR-Now model estimated the unemployment rate might have hit 4.8 percent in July, based on data on benefits and filled jobs.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been recent predictions of pending recessions in New Zealand and many other developed economies.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, lags in the release of the official unemployment rate prevent us from knowing what is currently going on in the labour market. This is why we built UR-Now - to provide early warnings of economic downturns."</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.4 percent in a year's time, but Maloney said it could reach that level sooner.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would be expensive for Stats NZ to update the unemployment rate quarterly with its current method, but his model was a more economical method.</p>
        
            <p>"This was born out of the Covid situation, where we were looking at large swings in the performance of the economy and the unemployment rate.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time when I was working in Wellington, I said it's fairly easy to use administrative data to have a nowcast of what the unemployment rate is... we don't have to wait for three or four months."</p>
        
            <p>Maloney said the rate was clearly going up toward the Reserve Bank's forecast peak.</p>
        
            <p>"We're getting there a lot faster than a lot of people would expect... I think there's clearly evidence the labour market is weakening, the economy is slowing down.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be that we'll get to something like the low 5 percent to mid-5 percent before a year from now.</p>
        
            <p>"It might be by the end of this quarter or early 2025 [when] we're in the 5 percent range. This is just alerting public and private decision-makers that the economy is weakening a bit faster than we expected."</p>
