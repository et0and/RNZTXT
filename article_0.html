            <p>A severe thunderstorm that caused more than 70 floods in Auckland is heading south and east.</p>
        
            <p>There is now a severe thunderstorm watch in place for Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Taupō and Gisborne until noon on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Bay of Plenty Regional Council has activated its Flood Room emergency response as the Ngongotahā River levels rise after heavy rain this morning.</p>
        
            <p>It said it had teams in the field, checking the condition of flood infrastructure, and pumping out flood waters from affected drainage canals.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight torrential rain and thunderstorms hit Auckland and saw fire crews called to 71 flooded or weather-damaged homes.</p>
