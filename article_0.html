            <p>Department of Conservation campgrounds around Northland are packed as holidaymakers count down to the New Year in some of the region's most scenic spots.</p>
        
            <p>DOC manager Bronwyn Bauer-Hunt said all Bay of Islands campsites were already at full capacity, especially the three boat-access only campgrounds on Urupukapuka Island.</p>
        
            <p>Campsites in the Kaipara District were also full to the brim, and in the Whangārei District only Uretiti, south of Ruakākā, had a few spots left.</p>
        
            <p>Bauer-Hunt said the ever-popular Maitai Bay campground, on Karikari Peninsula, was likewise full, but space could open up as some campers headed home early due to a forecast wet end to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, campgrounds operated by Ngāti Kuri were also busy, but the iwi was ready to open overflow campings if required.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kuri facilities manager Abbey Brown said campings at Spirits Bay, Rarawa Beach and Taputapotu, near Cape Rēinga, were "pretty full".</p>
        
            <p>The iwi was also operating the campground and cabins at Waitiki Landing, 20km south of Cape Rēinga, for the first time this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Waitiki Camp, and one other campsite in the Te Paki area, could be used as overflow areas, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The iwi preferred campers to book beforehand online or by phone but walks-ins were still welcome and would be referred to other campsites if their first choice was booked out.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, two campgrounds at Kai Iwi Lakes - a series of pristine dune lakes north of Dargaville - are fully booked from 29 December until January 5, though some spots may yet become available.</p>
        
            <p>The Kai Iwi Lakes campgrounds are operated by Kaipara District Council.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, privately-owned campgrounds around Northland were also busy.</p>
        
            <p>Paihia Top Ten Holiday Park manager Rachel Andrews said the campground was always full during the Christmas-New Year break, but this year the rush started two weeks earlier than usual.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been awesome," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The early influx was dominated by overseas visitors but the current campers were a mix of Kiwis and international tourists.</p>
        
            <p>The campground was fully booked until 20 January but there were always cancellations and spots opening up for new arrivals, Andrews said.</p>
