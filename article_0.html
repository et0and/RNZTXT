        <h2>Treasury fears government estimate may be off ahead of Budget</h2>
        <p>
There's $140 billion of projects being planned or built, but Treasury says it's "not sure" a key number is right.

            <p>The government has been struggling with lack of visibility over scores of big projects heading into Budget 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It has over $140 billion of projects being planned or built, and while cost pressures are put at just one billion, Treasury is "not sure" about the figure.</p>
        
            <p>"Data quality remains an ongoing concern," Treasury's latest available report to the Finance and Associate Finance Ministers said.</p>
        
            <p>It did not fact-check what agencies told it but "some of the data submitted to us appears to be out of date", it said.</p>
        
            <p>The "investment-readiness" of proposals had actually dropped slightly heading into the Budget 2025 process, said the report, that dated back to September 2024, and was released by Treasury this week.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked Ministers for an update.</p>
        
            <p>The September report alluded to the high stakes of half-baked business cases getting to Cabinet, and it being forced to choose between them.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the constrained fiscal position, it is important that we are provided well-developed business cases to allow us to consider the relative value for money and trade-offs through Budget," it told Nicola Willis and Chris Bishop.</p>
        
            <p>The report put the cost pressure at a mere $1 billion, half of what it was in June 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But was that figure reliable? Treasury warned: "The quality of the data on cost pressures remains variable.</p>
        
            <p>"We must remain vigilant."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ scored just 36 percent for investment readiness.</p>
        
            <p>"Data quality and completeness remains poor, including challenges in reconciling historic data," said Treasury of Health, the worst comment about a major agency, though readiness at Education was put at just 19 percent.</p>
        
            <p>HNZ is poised to cut half of its data and digital jobs.</p>
        
            <p>The government was trying to get a grip on a 10-year pipeline of infrastructure building, but its ambitions did not all match the available funding, expertise or labour.</p>
        
            <p>Weak project planning and monitoring have jammed and cracked the building pipeline for successive governments, papers show.</p>
        
            <p>Road builders have talked previously about projects being disconnected from reality.</p>

            <p>The new Treasury investment update showed the government was not out of the woods yet.</p>
        
            <p>"While there has been incremental improvement in investment planning and delivery behaviours, agencies need to continue improving their asset management and investment planning to support the delivery of a sustainable pipeline and avoid unnecessary cost pressure," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury noted progress on seven fronts, such as stronger guidance and monitoring loops.</p>
        
            <p>The Infrastructure Commission plans to present a draft 10-year plan mid-year.</p>
        
            <p>The scale is large: 188 medium and high-risk projects worth about $85 billion in the planning stage, and 142 worth $57 billion in the delivery stage. There were also scores of lesser risk ones.</p>
        
            <p>The value of projects being planned had risen $20 billion since June, due to NZTA completing some costings, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>As for delays, in June they were afflicting half of the projects in the delivery phase, but the September quarter report did not mention them.</p>
        
            <p>"Budget allowances remain tight," the ministers were told.</p>
        
            <p>The government had been casting around for funding alternatives, and there was one sign of that in the report: Treasury had sought extra risk assessments for two potential public-private-partnerships (PPPs) - the highway north of Warkworth, and courthouses in Rotorua and Waitākere. Courts are in a half-billion-dollar infrastructure hole.</p>
        
            <p>It recommended Cabinet add four projects to its list for getting a business case drawn up, this included, building a standardised tool for yearly assessment in schools, a new fingerprinting system for police and a digital overhaul of Stats NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The fourth project was blanked out as were the likely costs of the projects.</p>
        
            <p>A project to update gambling tech for the Lotteries Commission did not meet the threshold.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury kept the same five projects in its trickiest high-value and high-risk basket, including police's Next Generation Critical Communications project, and the rebuild at Antarctica's Scott Base.</p>
