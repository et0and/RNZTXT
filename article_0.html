            <p>Proceedings are underway at a national Hui-ā-Iwi being held in Ngāruawāhia convened by Kiingi Tuuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 members of Waikato Tainui have welcomed a mass contingent of iwi, community, public service, and political representatives on to Tūrangawaewae Marae.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia extended the invite in December last year after iwi leaders highlighted the need for a unified response to</p>
        
            <p>coalition government policy impacting Māori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingitanga chief of staff Ngira Simmonds said this would be the first of a series of hui dedicated to empowering Māori voices, initiatives, strategies, and solutions.</p>
        
            <p>"This hui will probably be a touch point and a reference for Māori for many years to come, we will all be able to say that at this time in this place we all agreed to this, and what we all know is there is power in kotahitanga."</p>

            <p>As guests gathered outside the marae this morning a hot topic of discussion was the leaked Ministry of Justice document</p>
        
            <p>about the governments proposed Treaty Principles Bill.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi posted a screenshot of the leaked document on social media yesterday, saying it showed the government's "intentions to erase Te Tiriti o Waitangi".</p>
        
            <p>The screenshot showed commentary from the report's author saying they expected the Bill would be "highly contentious".</p>
        
            <p>"This is due to both the fundamental constitutional nature of the subject matter and the lack of consultation with the public on the policy development prior to Select Committee."</p>
        
            <p>It said there was a need for the legislation because the principles of the Treaty were not defined in legislation, and "their importance requires there be certainty and clarity about their meaning".</p>
        
            <p>Waititi wrote: "Let this be the fuel to our fire! See you all on Saturday! We do not surrender! We do not cede!".</p>

            <p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi will be a central point of discussion on Saturday, with a dedicated breakout session focused on the Treaty of Waitangi and proposed reforms.</p>
        
            <p>The government has been met with multiple challenges from Māori over its policies, with Ngāi Te Rangi filing an application for an urgent Waitangi Tribunal Hearing over its stance on te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Māori health advocates also lodged an application for an urgent hearing over government intentions to shut down Te Aka Whai Ora, The Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>More recently Waikato-Tainui, the hosts of the hui filed action against the government in the High Court seeking a declaration from the Crown that it affirms the rights and interests of Waikato-Tainui.</p>
        
            <p>Speakers at today's hui include legal experts, former prime ministers and prominent highly respected members of Māori communities across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will not be attending. He said he was fully supportive of the event, but described it as being primarily for Māoridom, not politicians.</p>
        
            <p>Instead he was sending National MPs Tama Potaka and Dan Bidois as government representatives.</p>
        
            <p>The breakout sessions will begin following the pōwhiri, followed by a plenary session and the hui will be closed with a kauhau (address) from Kiingi Tuuheitia.</p>
