        <h2>Tokelau sets sights on a potential third referendum</h2>
        <p>
Community consultation is beginning in Tokelau, ahead of a possible third referedum on whether the island territory should have self-determination.
</p>
        
            <p>
Tokelau is a territory of New Zealand, and has a unique governing structure. Its people are now considering how they want its future governance to be organised, with consultation underway that could lead to a third referendum on self-determination.

            <p>A special committee is being set up in Tokelau to make sure everyone is well informed ahead of a potential third referendum.</p>
        
            <p>"My hopes are [for] Tokelau to be independent one day," Lupe Josephine Lui, Nukunonu's Fatupaepae Representative told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>She believes education is the way toward that goal and encourages all young Tokelauans to get educated, "to get more knowledge" and "in the future that will lead us to self-determination, if we are well educated for our people and for our island."</p>

            <p>In an interview filmed by Elena Pasilio, Tokelau's only on-atoll journalist, who is currently Nukunonu's environment officer, a teary-eyed Lui issued a poignant message to the next generation:</p>
        
            <p>"Be strong. There's a Lord. We pray that He gives us the courage to develop our land. We would never go anywhere. This is where we belong.</p>
        
            <p>"This is where we will live and whatever would happen. But at this time, we are all blessed to be here in Tokelau, and we are well looked after."</p>
        
            <p>It is a message Pasilio can relate to: "It is pretty hard being a journo in a small place like Tokelau because we are so remote and everyone knows each other," the 29-year-old explained.</p>
        
            <p>Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory of New Zealand and will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its relationship with New Zealand next year.</p>
        
            <p>Its people are New Zealand citizens and have voted against becoming self-governing in free association twice: in 2006 and another the year after.</p>
        
            <p>"This information is key to explain to the people the advantages and disadvantages of this choice," Tokelau's Ulu-o-Tokelau, or Head of State, Alapati Tavite said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to make sure we have all the information that is required for the communities to understand before they can actually select the kind of political status Tokelau will take next in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Tavite says the standard options have been independence, integration, and self-government in free association. But this time Tokelau may opt for something different.</p>
        
            <p>A former Ulu-o-Tokelau, Kelihiano Kalolo, has said before that Tokelau can not take the same path as Niue, and instead needs a tailored approach to "work something Tokelauan".</p>
        
            <p>Tavite said that once the consultation period which will educate the communities on the UN models is complete, the community will decide if they are ready for another referendum.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not want to force them by going through a vote that they do not understand," Tavite said.</p>
        
            <p>A decision will ideally coincide with the 100th anniversary of its relationship with New Zealand next year.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand government said self-determination is a decision for the people of Tokelau.</p>

            <p>UN data shows that the population living in Tokelau has been steadily increasing, with more than 1600 in the last population count.</p>
        
            <p>Tavite said that the funding it gets from New Zealand is not enough to combat the existential threat of the climate crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"Climate-related projects, such as shelters and coastal defences, are part of the priorities Tokelau is considering for its infrastructure development," an MFAT spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The total allocation to Tokelau is not being made publicly available, but New Zealand stands ready to support Tokelau to progress a pipeline of infrastructure priorities in the coming years."</p>
        
            <p>There is no airline, and it takes more than a day to reach Tokelau by boat from Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>Tavite said that the climate impacts need serious attention and financing.</p>
        
            <p>"Our coastal areas are really affected by erosion," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are the kinds of things we would like to have some more technical assistance on. How can we better prevent our small islands [from suffering the impacts of erosion]?.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though New Zealand [has] been assisting us, it is not to that level where we would like to.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, we have a bit of a disadvantage in accessing international funding. We cannot fully access global funding opportunities because of our political status, but yet, the impact of climate change does not determine the real issues and the impact of it.</p>
        
            <p>"It is almost the same to all the Pacific Islands, but I think it is worse for Tokelau because of our smallness, our isolation."</p>
        
            <p>He said sea-level rise and climate change impacts were real issues for Tokelau.</p>
        
            <p>"The building of sea walls, having an airstrip, an airport, having better transportation, having a quality internet connection, those kinds of services that [we need more assistance on].</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, our coastal areas are really affected by erosion. So those are the kinds of things we would like to have some more technical assistance on. How better can we protect our small islands."</p>

            <p>A governance structure, mechanism, and management unit is being set up with help from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
        
            <p>Governance institutions need strengthening so that informed and transparent decisions are made, the Office of the Council for the Ongoing Government of Tokelau general manager (national) Aukusitino Vitale told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"[We need to] strengthen policy and legal frameworks, and enhance governance and leadership capacities in line with Tokelau's National Strategic Plan," Vitale said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tokelau is exploring its pathway towards self-determination, and obviously they need to plan out, get an understanding of what the UN options are.</p>
        
            <p>He said Tokelau may also come up with its own unique options related to the Tokelau way of living.</p>
        
            <p>"The UN is already aware of our progress so far, but I think we need to consult our people internally and externally as well before we actually start pursuing that."</p>
        
            <p>UNDP resident representative Aliona Niculita said "home-grown solutions" were needed.</p>
        
            <p>"And will be led and driven by the Taupulega (village elders), civil servants and the recipients of the project in Tokelau, with UNDP support."</p>

            <p>Unlike Cook Islands and Niue, New Zealand's other realm nations, Tokelau's government structure is a little different.</p>
        
            <p>Tokelau is governed by the Taupulega (village elders) of the three atolls.</p>
        
            <p>"In Nukunonu, there are more than 30 members of Taupulega and they are called matai," Pasilio explains.</p>
        
            <p>"Families pick who they want to be matai and then those matai's make up the Taupulega and then the island votes for Faipule (leader) and Pulenuku (village mayor) and General Fono (parliament) reps for their own atolls."</p>
        
            <p>Each atoll elects their Faipule during an election process, who then take turns serving as Ulu-o-Tokelau or Head of State in an annual rotation.</p>
        
            <p>Together they make up an executive council called the Council for the Ongoing Government of Tokelau.</p>
        
            <p>They serve on the General Fono, which is Tokelau's parliament.</p>

            <p>Once the consultation period is complete, the community will decide if it is ready for another referendum.</p>
        
            <p>When questioned on a timeline, the Ulu-o-Tokelau stressed there is no time lock because:</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want to force them, you know, by going through a vote that they don't understand," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>There are hopes everyone will have enough information and be confident in their decision by 2026 to mark 100 years of New Zealand's colonial control.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot promise you the time, because it is driven by the communities."</p>
        
            <p>The first parliament for the year kicks off next week on the host island, Fakaofo.</p>
        
            <p>Leaders from Nukunonu and Atafu will be picked up by boat this week and taken there.</p>
        
            <p>The Ulu-o-Tokelau 2024, Nukunonu's Tavite, will hand over the the role to Fakaofo's Esera Fofō Tuisano.</p>
