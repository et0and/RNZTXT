            <p>Newshub, one of the key media companies in New Zealand, is to close its newsroom in New Zealand on 30 June, multiple sources have told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Staff are in the midst of an emergency meeting now to hear the news.</p>
        
            <p>Follow all the live updates here:</p>
        
            <p>Newshub is owned by global entertainment giant Warner Bros Discovery which also owns eden, Rush, HGTV and Bravo.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020 it took over the channel's assets which had been then part of Mediaworks.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, Warner Bros Discovery dropped AM Early and Newshub Live at 11am.</p>
        
            <p>In October, it announced it was axing The Project, its 7pm news and current affairs show.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, a spokesperson said: "We have commenced consultation to discontinue The Project on Three from the end of the year - our primary focus is to support our people as we work through this process."</p>
        
            <p>The new show that was expected to replace The Project, hosted by former AM Show present Ryan Bridge, has yet to begin.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Newshub, Sarah Bristow, senior director of news at Warner Bros. Discovery ANZ, which owns Newshub, said the live show would be a vital news offering tackling the day's biggest stories and advancing the news agenda.</p>
        
            <p>"The show will tackle the big conversations - conversations that connect us - and conversations you won't want to miss," Bristow said.</p>
