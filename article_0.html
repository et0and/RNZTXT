        <h2>Watch live: Dawn ceremony marks beginning of Waitangi Day</h2>
        <p>
The ceremony is taking place at Te Whare Rūnanga Marae on the upper Treaty grounds.
</p>
        
            <p>A dawn ceremony will mark the beginning of Waitangi Day commemorations at Te Whare Rūnanga Marae on the upper Treaty grounds this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Today's celebration came after a tense pōwhiri at the marae yesterday which saw ACT Leader David Seymour's microphone cut off twice, and his speech drowned out by waiata.</p>
        
            <p>A flag raising ceremony will take place followed by a public breakfast at 7am.</p>
        
            <p>At 9am the traditional waka parade will take place just infront of Te Tii Marae before eventually docking near the lower treaty grounds.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a number of performance from local groups, including kapa haka and reggae, as well as market stalls throughout the grounds.</p>
