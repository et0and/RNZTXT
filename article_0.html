            <p>More than 400 jobs are likely to go at Oranga Tamariki, with the evidence centre proposed to be significantly impacted, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>The evidence centre produces research evaluation, analytics and insights about tamariki, rangatahi, their whƒÅnau and the work of Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>In total, possibly a third of roles could be affected - possibly changed or disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry employed 4904 people as of 31 December 2023, according to the Public Service Commission.</p>
        
            <p>That was up from 4651 six months prior.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki has been apporached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>*If you have information, including documents, about public sector job losses please contact: jemima.huston@rnz.co.nz</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki chief executive Chappie Te Kani earlier said workers would be able to provide feedback on the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a priority to ensure we do as much as we can to connect with our kaimahi, to keep them informed with regular updates, to share information around the process we are using, and be open about the fact that the document we will release on Wednesday is a proposal and everyone will have a chance to provide feedback before a final decision is made."</p>
        
            <p>He said the change would help put children at the centre of the ministry's work.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2000 jobs have been cut from the public service so far as ministries try to achieve budget savings of up to 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Regulation David Seymour previously indicated that figure could hit 7500.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education is also expected to announce proposed job cuts on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood many of the jobs on the line are in the Ka Ora, Ka Ako school lunches programme.</p>
        
            <p>The programme was introduced in 2019 by the previous Labour government, and currently offers meals to 230,000 students in about 1000 disadvantaged schools.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour has previously confirmed the programme itself is under review and is likely to be cut in the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Jobs being disestablished are understood to include nutritionists, those who monitor and evaluate the programme, sustainability and waste, and people who work in regional branches of the team.</p>
        
            <p>One person close to the matter said the team was set to be "decimated".</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
