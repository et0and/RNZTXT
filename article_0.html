            <p>A Wellington florist claiming to have been bullied by Green MP Julie Anne Genter says she felt degraded and humiliated by the confrontation.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens have launched disciplinary action against Genter, following an outburst towards National's Matt Doocey in the House on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple parties have complained to the Speaker, who has given Genter until Monday to respond. The Green Party has also launched a disciplinary process.</p>
        
            <p>Following Genter's confrontation in Parliament, Newtown florist Laura Newcombe alleged on Newshub on Thursday that the Rongotai MP confronted her in her shop last week.</p>
        
            <p>Newcombe has been a vocal opponent at public meetings and through the media of the removal of carparks outside her shop on Riddiford Street, which have been replaced by a cycleway.</p>
        
            <p>She said usually her customers ring ahead, but Genter, who is a prominent cyclist turned up to "poke the bear" unannounced.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that she was just here to just unload a little bit of anger or frustration that she had," Newcombe told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Newcombe said it was the first time the two had spoken face to face, but acknowledged they were prominent voices on opposing sides.</p>
        
            <p>"We obviously are two passionate people with two different views. And I just pointed out to her, I said 'oh, look there's no one on the cycleway, there's ghost cyclists' and that enraged her.</p>
        
            <p>"And then she started getting really angry. She just said 'Oh, that must be a lot, to really have a lot of hate in you' and all this sort of thing."</p>
        
            <p>Newcombe said Genter then got out her phone and started filming.</p>
        
            <p>"She was saying things like 'You hate my kids cycling,' and I was thinking 'I don't even know your kids, I don't know anything about you'.</p>
        
            <p>"And then she pulled out the camera, she had it in my face, she was in my face, she was yelling, and I said 'Look you're going to have to leave' but she didn't like that. She stuck her heels in and was very slow to leave."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Newcombe acknowledged she gave as good as she got to her critics, but denied she was a bully herself.</p>
        
            <p>"Well yeah, we had an exchange, but of course we didn't swear or anything, because I'm still going to respect the woman."</p>
        
            <p>But she said being filmed felt degrading and humiliating.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a massive imbalance of power."</p>
        
            <p>Newcombe acknowledged that there were public carparks in the nearby Woolworths supermarket, but after two knee replacements she wanted a loading zone outside her shop.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had no issue with there being a cycleway during peak times, but not 24/7.</p>

            <p>A Green Party spokesperson said the co-leaders Marama Davidson and Chl√∂e Swarbrick had "no prior knowledge" of Newcombe's allegations, but confirmed Genter took out her phone and filmed the florist during the exchange.</p>
        
            <p>They maintained Genter's actions in the House were unacceptable, and fell short of the high standards the party expects of its MPs.</p>
        
            <p>"The co-leaders took immediate action to initiate a disciplinary process and will be working with Julie Anne to make sure this behaviour is not repeated," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson apologised to Newcombe, through an interview with Newshub, but Newcombe said she had not received a personal apology.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Genter for comment.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, Newcombe told RNZ's Midday Report the removal of the carparks would "finish" her business, which is situated across the road from Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"I would just like the council to come and buy this property, it's not fair that I bear the whole financial brunt of this. I've invested everything into this building where I live upstairs and where I work," she said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2022, she told Wellington City Council's Planning and Environment Committee the cycleway was a "new experiment" and had "destroyed" the business.</p>
        
            <p>"The process was flawed from the beginning, and rammed through with breakneck speed," she told the council.</p>
        
            <p>She acknowledged the challenges of Covid-19 and high inflation, but she was unable to collect government grants as she had not recorded a 40 percent loss in revenue.</p>
        
            <p>"Staying open and bleeding out all of my savings, is no longer an option," and told the council she would close the business the following Friday.</p>
        
            <p>She then put up signs in the shop window, one reading "you killed this retail precinct by removing all the carparks. Unfair, unjust & undemocratic!" and another stating she had lost $45,000.</p>
        
            <p>By December 2022 she had reopened.</p>
