            <p>Scott Robertson's tenure with the All Blacks has started with a narrow test win over England in dramatic circumstances at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>In an absorbing, intense match, the All Blacks won 16-15, having maintained a one-point lead for the last 15 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>But in the final few minutes, the game took on a bizarre turn as All Blacks first five Damian McKenzie lined up a penalty, only for Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli to rule that he had taken too long.</p>
        
            <p>England stormed on to attack as the New Zealanders conceded a penalty, and looked like mounting a strong challenge to win the game - only to be denied by the referee awarding the All Blacks a penalty after replacement forward Tupou Vai'a won a turnover. And that was the game.</p>
        
            <p>All Blacks captain Scott Barrett said he was ''immensely proud" of his side, but conceded the penalty awarded to them from that turnover was a "50-50 call".</p>
        
            <p>"It could have gone either way,'' he told Sky Sport.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks looked the more adventurous side against the aggressively defensive England side, having the sharper backline with McKenzie's astute direction.</p>

            <p>While the forwards never shirked from their task, the side lost focus at some crucial times during the first in a two-test series.</p>
        
            <p>England had an early chance for points after Amashukeli pinged the All Blacks front row for collapsing the scrum but Marcus Smith's kick drifted to the left of the posts.</p>
        
            <p>Ethan de Groot drew cheers from the Highlanders fans in the crowd at a scrum soon after when the All Blacks had the English forwards backpedalling. A sustained period of All Blacks attacking ensued before Damian McKenzie delivered the perfect cross-kick for Sevu Reece, who powered through the late cover defence to score.</p>
        
            <p>The England side were up in the All Blacks' faces with their fast defensive line-speed and were next to score with Maro Itoje crashing over via pick-and-go tactics.</p>
        
            <p>Four minutes later, the All Blacks scored another cracker, with Stephen Perofeta, who looked sharp on attack, breaking the England defence and putting Ardie Savea in the clear with a slick pass.</p>
        
            <p>The All Blacks led 10-7 in the final minute before halftime, but lost their way, giving away a penalty, which Marcus Smith slotted.</p>
        
            <p>TJ Perenara, who injured a leg in a messy tangle of bodies late in the first half, didn't return for the second, with Finlay Christie replacing him. The All Blacks lost bruising flanker Samipeni Finau later in the game after he didn't return from a head injury assessment. England prop Joe Marler left the field injured early in the first half.</p>

            <p>England stormed on to attack early in the second half and were rewarded for consistent attack with a try to quick winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, giving his side a 15-10 lead .</p>
        
            <p>Robertson went to his bench early with Beauden Barrett replacing Perofeta and Ofa Tu'ungafasi on for de Groot.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Earl was huge in the England pack but he gave away an offside penalty in the 65th minute, which McKenzie slotted for New Zealand to regain the lead.</p>
        
            <p>And they held it, but only just.</p>
        
            <p>The final test is at Eden Park in Auckland next Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand 16 (Sevu Reece, Ardie Savea tries, Damian McKenzie 2 pens)</p>
        
            <p>England 15 (Maro Itoje, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso tries, Marcus Smith con, pen)</p>
        
            <p>Halftime 10-all.</p>
