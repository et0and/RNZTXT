        <h2>Watch live: Kim Hill's final Saturday Morning show</h2>
        <p>
RNZ veteran Kim Hill is hosting Saturday Morning for the last time - watch and listen live as it happens.
</p>
        
            <p>RNZ veteran Kim Hill is hosting her last ever episode of Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>After nine years as host of Nine to Noon, Hill moved to the weekend show in April 2002.</p>
        
            <p>It gave her the opportunity for expansive interviews with her guests - be they scientists, historians, theologians, psychiatrists, novelists, or just characters or high achievers - while also taking in some leisurely interests: food, classic literature and poetry, children's books and music.</p>
        
            <p>After more than 21 years, she announced her departure from the show in September.</p>
        
            <p>"It is time for a change for me. I look forward to having a break," she said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>While Hill is not leaving RNZ altogether, this is her final time hosting Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>Today's episode will feature interviews with Tim Minchin, Adrian Edmondson, Richard Flanagan and Hill herself is playing favourites.</p>
