            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown and acting Auckland Mayor Desley Simpson are making an announcement at Mount Eden Railway Station.</p>
        
            <p>They are expected to speak about 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Public transport in Auckland was allocated more police last month after a fatal stabbing on a bus in Onehunga, and the minister said he would look into making attacks on public transport an aggravating factor at sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>Works preparing for the City Rail Link - due to open in early 2026 - also disrupted train travel in Auckland over Labour weekend, with buses replacing all services.</p>
        
            <p>The same was true in Wellington amid a major project aimed at providing faster and more frequent commuter train services into the city.</p>
