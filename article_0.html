            <p>Darleen Tana has resigned from the Green Party and may remain in Parliament, despite the party having demanded she quit as an MP.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party has been speaking to reporters after receiving an independent report from investigator and barrister Rachel Burt on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leader Chloe Swarbrick told media the MP's behaviour has fallen "far short" of what's expected and she should do the right thing and resign from Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>After receiving the report, the party called a caucus meeting on Saturday, unanimously demanding she resign and saying they believed her position as an MP was untenable.</p>
        
            <p>However, Tana resigned from the Green Party, tendering her resignation to the secretary and chief of staff. The party then informed the Speaker.</p>
        
            <p>This means she could continue as an MP for the remainder of the term - unless the party uses the contentious 'party hopping' legislation.</p>
        
            <p>The party is unlikely to do so, however, having consistently been ideologically opposed to the legislation.</p>

            <p>Tana has been suspended on full pay since March, after a series of allegations of migrant exploitation against her husband Christian Hoff-Nielsen's bicycle company, and claims she was also involved.</p>
        
            <p>The claims include texts showing Tana told a migrant worker he could continue working in her husband's bike shop despite that being a breach of his visa conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Other migrant workers complained of unpaid wages, with Tana still being involved in related decisions despite her resignation as a director and shareholder in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Burt's investigation was launched immediately after the accusations came to light, but has taken nearly four months to reach a conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday marked 115 days since she was suspended, and means she has now spent more time suspended on full pay than acting in her role as an MP.</p>
        
            <p>The party is yet to release the full report into Tana's actions, saying they were still in the process of contacting those named in it for privacy reasons.</p>
