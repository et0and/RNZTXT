            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington's first bit of action out on the water did not disappoint on Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>As Aotearoa's most decorated Olympian, Carrington, along with team mates Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan led from the beginning of the women's K4 500m and never looked back. They were now straight through to the final.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington and team mate Hoskin also won their K2 500m and were through to the semi-finals. Fellow New Zealanders Aimee Fisher and Lucy Matahaere did not advance after coming fifth in their quarter-final.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's men's team in the K4 500m and K2 500m were also through to the semi-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, first-time Olympian middle-distance runner Maia Ramsden was through to the semi-final of the 1500m after coming sixth in her heat.</p>
        
            <p>Climber Julian David made two personal best times, 5.24 in the first round, only to beat that in the elimination heat with a time of 5.20, defeating Iran's Reza Ali Pour to advance.</p>
        
            <p>And in sailing, Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson were in the medal race for the mixed multihull narca on Wednesday after a third place finish on Tuesday.</p>
