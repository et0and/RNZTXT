            <p>Commerce Minister Andrew Bayly has apologised for his conduct after a complaint that he repeatedly called a worker "a loser" and swore at him while on a business visit.</p>
        
            <p>The business employee formally complained after the visit, saying Bayly told him to "f*** off" and repeatedly called him a loser, making an 'L' with his fingers on his forehead.</p>
        
            <p>In a written complaint, released by the minister on Friday afternoon, the employee said he had been left feeling "degraded, embarrassed and deeply disrespected" during the visit in early October.</p>
        
            <p>In an accompanying statement, Bayly said his comments were intended in "a light-hearted manner" but he accepted they caused unintentional offence.</p>
        
            <p>"I obviously got this completely wrong, and I have unreservedly apologised to the person concerned ... I take responsibility for the situation, and I am sorry.</p>
        
            <p>"I regret my actions. They fall well short of the behaviour expected of a minister, and what I expect of myself. I have also apologised to the prime minister, and given him my assurance it will not happen again."</p>
        
            <p>In a separate statement, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was disappointed in Bayly's conduct but continued to hold confidence in him.</p>
        
            <p>"He fell well short of the professional standards of behaviour I expect from ministers. He has apologised, both to the person concerned and to me, and has given me his assurances that it won't happen again."</p>
        
            <p>Read the original letter from the complainant and Bayly's responses below:</p>
        
            <p>In the released letter, the complainant detailed his encounter with Bayly, saying the minister questioned why he was still at work and told him: "take a bottle of wine and go home... take some wine and f**k off".</p>
        
            <p>He described Bayly as invading his personal space "until we were shoulder to shoulder", while he continually questioned the worker as to why he was still there noting "no one else was on the warehouse floor".</p>
        
            <p>"What followed next was both shocking an humiliating. He called me a loser repeatedly, saying the reason I was still at work was because I am a loser".</p>
        
            <p>The worker said Bayly then "formed an 'L' with his fingers on his forehead".</p>
        
            <p>The worker said in his letter Bayly's "behaviour and the way he spoke to me suggested that he had been drinking prior to arriving, which made the situation even more uncomfortable".</p>
        
            <p>Bayly denies he had been drinking ahead of the visit.</p>
        
            <p>The worker describes in the letter feeling "angered and powerless" and made to feel the "object of ridicule in front of my peers".</p>
        
            <p>"The entire situation was deeply uncomfortable, and I felt as though I had no choice but to lock the warehouse early and leave, as I was overwhelmed with absolute disgust from the minister's treatment towards myself."</p>
        
            <p>In a letter from Bayly on 11 October to the business in question, he thanked the team for hosting him at their "impressive facility".</p>
        
            <p>He went on to say he appreciated the concerns of the worker being brought to his attention and noted he was "deeply saddened to learn" he had caused, what he described as, unintentional offence.</p>
        
            <p>"What had intended to be a sharing of a light hearted moment, has obviously caused great offence to him," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The minister apologised unreservedly and said he regretted "misreading the situation".</p>
        
            <p>In a follow-up letter on Friday addressed to the complainant, Bayly again apologised, saying he would be grateful for an opportunity to meet with the worker and communicate that directly.</p>
        
            <p>"While I meant my comments in a light-hearted manner, I accept that they made you feel embarrassed and insulted. I got it wrong, and I deeply regret this. I am sorry.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to reassure you that I was not intoxicated when we met. Regardless, my behaviour was unbecoming of a government minister," Bayly wrote.</p>
