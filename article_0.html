            <p>Firefighters are working to stop the spread of a house fire in the Wellington suburb of Kelburn to neighbouring properties.</p>
        
            <p>A house is on fire in the suburb of Kelburn.</p>
        
            <p>Photos from the area show a house with flames inside and smoke has filled the surrounding neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters tackling the blaze have created a curtain of water to protect closely-set neighbouring homes from the flames as the building is quickly consumed by the fire.</p>
        
            <p>A small crew are keeping a large fan of water directed between the two houses while on the other side of the property a crew have taken up a point from a nearby balcony to direct water onto the building.</p>
        
            <p>Flames can be seen coming through the roofing iron of the home. The force of water from firefighters' hoses has lifted sections of the roof, exposing blacked beams in the attic spaces above the structure.</p>

            <p>A police officer told residents there was no indication of any people in the building.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby residents Penny and Ethan smelled burning from across the valley and when they looked outside saw "huge sheets of smoke and flames through a flat window about 150m away".</p>

            <p>Local resident Julie said it was her impression that the house had been empty for a few months.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Matt who mowed lawns at nearby properties said he saw the smoke and came to check it out.</p>
        
            <p>"Just a lot of flames coming out one side of the house.</p>
        
            <p>"And ... all the fire brigade working hard to get it all under control."</p>

            <p>Paramedics and firefighters are on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said crews were alerted about 2.40pm, and there are nine trucks attending.</p>
        
            <p>The house, down a steep bank above Aro Valley and off Plunket Street, was well ablaze when RNZ reporters arrived at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>People are advised to avoid the area to allow crews to fight the fire, while parents have been guiding school children homeward over a maze of hoses crisscrossing the street above the property.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
