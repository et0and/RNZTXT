            <p>Twenty-eight jobs will be cut at the Department of Internal Affairs' National Library and the Māori, Strategy and Performance branch, the agency has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as more than 400 jobs are also wound up in its water reform teams.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Internal Affairs has confirmed most of the more than 400 staff working on national water reform will be gone by the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>DIA says it is announcing organisational changes in a "staged approach" and so far eight roles are affected at the library and 20 in the Maori branch.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ expects further announcements about job cuts at DIA to come this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>DIA said it was required to make savings of 6.5 percent, and that job losses account for less than half of savings identified.</p>
        
            <p>It said changes in its other branches are to be announced in mid-May.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government binned the Three Waters reform and is going to bring in a new plan called Local Water Done Well.</p>
        
            <p>DIA said that as of mid October, 427 staff were working on the old plan but that number stood at 60 on Thursday - most on fixed term contracts - with the majority to finish up at the end of the month and the last few done in June.</p>
        
            <p>It comes at the end of a big week of cuts with Department of Conservation, the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, and the Commerce Commission, among others, all making announcements.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
