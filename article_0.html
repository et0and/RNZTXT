            <p>Two people are in hospital following an explosion in a central Wellington apartment building on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Roadblocks are in place on adjoining Boulcott Street. People are asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant commander James Martin-Bond said initial reports were of a fire on level eight.</p>
        
            <p>"When crews investigated they found there'd been an explosion in one of the apartments, and so we are now investigating the cause of that explosion."</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were alerted about 1pm and there are 11 fire crews in attendance.</p>

            <p>Wellington Free Ambulance said three of its ambulances and two cars responded as well.</p>
        
            <p>They have transported one patient in a serious condition and another in a moderate condition to Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A policeman at the cordon told an RNZ reporter there had been an explosion at an apartment and all residents have been evacuated from the building.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, KƒÅinga Ora Greater Wellington regional director Vicki McLaren said they were very concerned to learn of the explosion at one of their Church Street flats.</p>
        
            <p>"Our immediate priority is checking on the safety and wellbeing of our customers and we have staff onsite who are ready to offer support once we can access the building or reach the customers by phone."</p>
        
            <p>Determining the cause of the incident was a matter for Fire and Emergency to investigate but as a landlord Greater Wellington would provide assistance where it could, she said.</p>
