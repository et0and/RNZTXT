        <p>
Pauline Hanna's death will now be subject to a coronial hearing - but defence lawyer Elizabeth Hall doesn't believe different factual findings will be reached.

            <p>A criminal defence lawyer says the verdict in the Philip Polkinghorne trial shows the justice system is working.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the former Auckland eye surgeon was found not guilty of murdering his wife, Pauline Hanna, in their Remuera home three years ago.</p>

            <p>Crown prosecutors claimed Polkinghorne murdered his wife and staged the scene as suicide, while his defence argued Hanna took her own life.</p>
        
            <p>Jurors heard from more than 80 witnesses over the course of the nine-week trial, before returning their verdict after almost two days of deliberation.</p>
        
            <p>Criminal defence lawyer Elizabeth Hall said the not guilty verdict showed a working justice system.</p>
        
            <p>"The obligation on the Crown is to call the evidence that they think will convince a jury that their theory of the case is right, and that the jury is sure beyond a reasonable doubt," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The jury in the case wasn't sure, and so they acquitted..."</p>

            <p>She said the Polkinghorne trial came down to the pathology evidence around Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case, the pathology evidence was very extensively tested, there were a number of senior pathologists, and in fact that's what this trial appears to have come down to: the Crown being unable to prove the mechanism of death that they alleged," Hall said.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Monday said Hanna's death would now be subject to a coronial inquest.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said she did not think the coroner's process would reach different factual findings from what had already been presented in the trial.</p>
        
            <p>"They can make recommendations, and there may be some peripheral aspects of the case, other than culpability, that the coroner wants to make recommendations about," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This case was extensively ventilated in the High Court. It doesn't really seem that there will be much that the coroner would add."</p>
        
            <p>Hall said the Polkinghorne trial presented a good chance for the public to get interested in other areas of the justice system.</p>
        
            <p>"I would hope that people who are interested in this particular case are also interested in how our courts operate in general terms, and get involved in that debate."</p>
