            <p>Kurt Capewell was all smiles in his first-ever appearance in front of the cameras as a Warrior. Fresh off another preseason training session, the club's big signing for 2024 certainly wasn't complaining about the weather in his new home either.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful country. It's been 30 degrees almost every day we've been training," the 30-year-old told media.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty big move for myself and my partner, but we're very happy living over in New Zealand. It's never been a detriment to the Warriors, in my eyes."</p>
        
            <p>The second row forward arrives at the Warriors after premiership-winning shifts at the Sharks and Panthers, as well as an appearance in last year's epic grand final with the Broncos. Add in three seasons with the Queensland Origin side and it's safe to say he is the most accomplished Australian pick up the club has had since Ryan Hoffman.</p>
        
            <p>"I think my game style is going to suit [the Warriors] well. Webby [coach Andrew Webster] was obviously really keen to get me over here. I'm excited to play with some of the young superstars we've got here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He follows in the footsteps of Hoffman, Steve Price, Kevin Campion, Michael Luck and Jacob Lillyman as the sort of Aussie workhorse NRL forwards that quickly become cult heroes at Mt Smart. Capewell doesn't feel as though his style of play will change that much under Webster, and he reunites with his former Sharks team-mate Shaun Johnson.</p>
        
            <p>"I can just bring what I probably do best, which is asset plays. I'm probably not your impactful, powerful superstar, but I'll definitely be there for 80 minutes and do all the stuff that nobody else really likes doing. I'll just focus on doing what I do best and helping out where I can."</p>

            <p>With Addin Fonua-Blake's departure at the end of this season confirmed, it's likely that Capewell will be tasked with eventually assuming some of the standout prop's carries and defensive work. While Webster maintains that he prefers his squad to be 80-minute players, the likes of Capewell and Marata Niukore being able to give Fonua-Blake more time on the interchange will be an important development in how the middle forwards are managed.</p>
        
            <p>Capewell's arrival also signals another turning point for the Warriors, in that a player of his calibre was attracted to making the move across the Tasman in the first place. He was off contract anyway due to the Broncos needing to free up cap space to lock down Ezra Mam in a four-year, AU$3 million (NZ$3.23m) contract extension, but two years ago the Warriors would have been the last place his agent would have pitched to him.</p>
        
            <p>Capewell arrives at a high-water mark for the club. After a preliminary final appearance last season, hopes are high that they can go one step further and win an NRL premiership for the first time in their history.</p>
        
            <p>"The club's got a massive following at the moment with the 'Up The Wahs', so shout out to all the fans that I've seen in the street and have come out and said hello. They've made me very welcome out here."</p>
