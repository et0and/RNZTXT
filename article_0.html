            <p>Christchurch man David Benbow has been sentenced to life in jail with no parole for 17 years for the murder of a childhood friend.</p>
        
            <p>Michael McGrath was last seen at his Halswell home in May 2017, and he was due to visit Benbow the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Benbow claimed his friend never turned up, but in October he was found guilty of murdering McGrath with a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>McGrath's mother, Adrienne McGrath, said she could not believe her son would never come home again.</p>
        
            <p>In her victim impact statement, she said still hoped her son would come knocking at her window.</p>
