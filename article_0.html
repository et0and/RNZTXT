        <h2>Watch live: Crackdown on teacher-only days in latest truancy push</h2>
        <p>
Parents of students absent for 15 days could also face prosecution, while changes to teacher-only days are coming, David Seymour has announced.
</p>
        
            <p>Schools won't be able to hold teacher-only days during term time and parents of students absent for 15 days could be prosecuted, Associate Education Minister David Seymour has announced in a new truancy crackdown.</p>
        
            <p>The government this year brought in daily attendance reporting, alongside changes to public health guidelines on when students are too sick to attend. It has announced a target for attendance of 80 percent of students present for 90 percent of the term.</p>
        
            <p>"Any student who reaches a clearly defined threshold of days absent will trigger an appropriate and proportionate response from their school and the Ministry," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>Schools must have a stepped attendance response (STAR) plan in place by the beginning of the 2026 school yeaer.</p>
        
            <p>Responses could include meeting with parents when a child is absent for 10 days to develop a plan for their return, and at 15 days escalating the response to the ministry or beginning prosecution of parents.</p>
        
            <p>"Schools will have to play their part in setting a good example as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>This meant not taking teacher-only days during term time.</p>
        
            <p>"I have asked the ministry to collect data on when a school is open or closed for instruction for the full day, and for each year group, during term time."</p>
        
            <p>It was critical lost teaching time was made up, he said. I reserve the right to look at an infringement scheme in the future if this approach doesn't work.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said teacher-only days were legally only allowed to be held out of term time unless authorised by the Minister of Education.</p>
        
            <p>The next phase of improving attendance rates would be further understanding why students did not go to school.</p>
        
            <p>"I've directed the Ministry of Education, with the active co-operation of the Ministry for Social Development, Oranga Tamariki, Police, Kainga Ora, and Te Puni Kokiri to develop robust information sharing agreements so that staff can share appropriate information once a student has been identified as needing support.</p>
