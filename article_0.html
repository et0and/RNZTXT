            <p>Flights in and out of Wellington Airport have been delayed this morning as high winds are causing havoc for New Year's Eve travellers.</p>
        
            <p>By 9am this morning, 14 arrivals and nine departures had been either diverted or cancelled due to the blustery conditions, a Wellington Airport spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>That number was expected to increase throughout the morning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers have been advised to check their flight status with their airlines.</p>
        
            <p>At least 20 Air New Zealand flights in and out of the capital had been cancelled, customer and sales manager Scott Carr said.</p>
        
            <p>Four flights were diverted including, three flights which were forced to return to Auckland and Christchurch and a flight from Nelson which was diverted to Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>"Our teams are monitoring the conditions closely and working hard to get people where they need to be today," Carr said.</p>
        
            <p>"Customers booked to travel are advised to keep an eye on our website for up-to-date travel information."</p>

            <p>The unsettled conditions are set to put a dampener on New Year celebrations across some parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council said on Saturday it had made the decision to cancel its New Year's Eve community celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>It said a heavy band of rain with possible thunderstorms and lightning is forecast to sweep through between 6pm to 9.30pm, when events were due to take place at five locations.</p>
        
            <p>However, one group of Coromandel campers appear to be toughing it out for New Year's Eve despite heavy downpours.</p>
        
            <p>Campers in Cooks Beach have shared video footage showing water pooling around tents and caravan awnings on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Flaxmill Campground relief manager Chris Goldsbury said her campground was on higher ground, but it was still very wet underfoot this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a very heavy downpour probably about 7.30pm? And noticed we had 40mm measured in the rain gauge this morning ... but no, everybody was happy, we didn't have any problems."</p>
        
            <p>Areas of the South Island are also in for a stormy start to 2024 with rain, hail and thunderstorms possible across areas of Canterbury, Otago and Southland.</p>
        
            <p>The unsettled summer weather across the country has been largely influenced by the El Nino weather pattern, which has caused swings in temperature variations sparking thunderstorms and heavy downpours.</p>
