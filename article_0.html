            <p>One of New Zealand's first film industry stars and a child cancer doctor are among recipients of the country's top honours.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very Kiwi thing, this position of being a jack-of-all-trades just in order to pay the rent," says award-winning actor, writer and director for stage and screen, Ian Mune.</p>
        
            <p>He was among 151 recipients of New Year Honours, recognised for their achievements or service to their communities.</p>
        
            <p>He's joined by Dr Scott Macfarlane, also made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for transforming cancer treatment for children, and The Right Honourable Trevor Mallard, former Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
        
            <p>Māori business leader Pania Tyson-Nathan has been made a Dame, along with Samoan New Zealand-born Sarai Bareman, for her services to football governance.</p>

            <p>An actor with more than 70 screen roles to date, Sir Ian has continued to perform in a variety of film, television and theatre productions, most recently in the mini-series The Pact (2021).</p>
        
            <p>"The one I'm passionate about is the one I'm doing at the time," he told RNZ. "If I'm acting that's what I'm passionate about, if I'm directing that's what I'm passionate about, if I'm writing that's what I'm passionate about."</p>
        
            <p>He co-wrote Sleeping Dogs (1977) and Goodbye Pork Pie (1981); and directed Came a Hot Friday (1984), the coming-of-age drama End of the Golden Weather (1991), The Whole of the Moon (1997) and the sequel to Once Were Warriors, What Becomes of the Brokenhearted (1999) - to name a few.</p>
        
            <p>Now 82 years old, he is recognised as a pioneer who developed the theatre and film industry into viable professions in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Three other health professionals have been made Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit: paediatric anaesthetist and intensive care specialist Brian Anderson, specialist anaesthetist Vanessa Beavis and radiologist Graeme Bydder.</p>
        
            <p>Noted New Zealand hymn writer Marnie Barrell has been recognised for her work and made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit. The music teacher, lay preacher and musician at St Mary's Anglican Church in Christchurch has been hymn writing since 1986 and estimates she has written "50 or 60".</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ she was "incredulous and delighted" to be listed as a recipient - but only after she realised the email wasn't a scam.</p>
        
            <p>When asked what made a good hymn, she said: "It's on the edge of poetry.</p>
        
            <p>"It needs to be connected with the historic faith of the Church but also needs to move in contemporary directions.</p>
        
            <p>"The Church's thinking does evolve a great deal over time."</p>
        
            <p>Decisions about the recipients were made by the previous government, prior to the 2023 General Election.</p>
