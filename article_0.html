            <p>Fifty people have been treated after an incident on board a flight to Auckland, with one person seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>LATAM Airlines Group said flight LA800 had a "technical problem during the flight which caused a strong movement" on its way from Sydney to Auckland.</p>

            <p>"Some passengers and cabin crew were affected. They received immediate assistance and were evaluated or treated by medical staff at the airport as needed."</p>
        
            <p>A passenger told the NZ Herald she felt a "quick little drop" while mid-air.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole plane just froze."</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance said it was notified of the incident at 3.58pm.</p>
        
            <p>Five ambulances, two operations managers, one Major Incident Support Team vehicle, one Command Unit, and two rapid response vehicles rushed to Auckland International Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ambulance crews assessed and treated approximately 50 patients, with one patient in a serious condition and the remainder in a moderate to minor condition," St John Ambulance said.</p>
        
            <p>"So far, 13 patients have been transported to Middlemore Hospital by ambulance."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport said in a statement its emergency service team "responded to a request for medical support" from the LATAM flight.</p>
        
            <p>The plane involved was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.</p>
        
            <p>It landed at Auckland Airport about 4.30pm as scheduled.</p>
        
            <p>LATAM Airlines Group said it regretted the "inconvenience and injury" the situation had caused its passengers.</p>
        
            <p>LATAM is Chile's national airline and flies frequently between Auckland and Santiago.</p>
        
            <p>The airline's next flight - LA800 to Santiago - has now been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>That flight was originally due to leave Auckland Airport at 6.40pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known what caused the "technical problem".</p>
        
            <p>In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration last week reported an issue with Boeing Dreamliners' de-icing systems, according to CNN.</p>
        
            <p>The administration said a damaged seal could impact an engine inlet, risking serious damage to the plane.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was moving through the administration's standard process for "developing airworthiness directives", CNN said, which meant it did not believe the issue was severe enough to pull the planes from service.</p>
        
            <p>Boeing's 737 Max has also come under scrutiny after an emergency exit blew out after taking off from Portland, Oregon on 5 January.</p>
        
            <p>That plane landed quickly and no-one was hurt.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
