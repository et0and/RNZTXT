            <p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is onstage at a convention centre in Palm Beach, Florida to address his supporters</p>
        
            <p>Watch his speech livestreamed here: </p>
        
            <p>A smiling Donald Trump has told supporters: "This is the greatest political movement of all time."</p>
        
            <p>He said this "would the golden age of America".</p>
        
            <p>While some swing states are still counting votes, his rival Democrat Kamala Harris has almost no path to victory left, while Trump is on track to win significantly more of the electoral college votes needed for victory.</p>
        
            <p>Trump said he would help the country heal after a divisive election.</p>
        
            <p>"We made history tonight."</p>
        
            <p>Harris is not expected to speak tonight.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after a successful night for the Trump campaign.</p>
        
            <p>He has picked up swing states including Georgia and North Carolina and is most likely to beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to the White House.</p>
        
            <p>If he does, he will have pulled off a remarkable feat becoming the first president since Grover Cleveland in 1893 to win a second non-consecutive term in office.</p>
