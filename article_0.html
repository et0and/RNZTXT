            <p>Weak tarmac at air forces bases, failing accommodation and a deteriorating navy base are contributing to millions of dollars worth of maintenance costs for the Defence Force.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force is getting a funding boost of more than $570 million in this year's Budget, Defence Minister Judith Collins announced on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of the funding will be spent on equipment upgrades and a pay package for frontline personnel.</p>
        
            <p>But issues with Defence Force infrastructure have been well canvassed over the past year, with stories on the problems relating to accommodation on defence bases.</p>
        
            <p>In documents earlier sent to a select committee, the Defence Force said $460 million was needed to keep existing assets in a reasonable condition.</p>
        
            <p>If they did not get the funding, the documents revealed their assets would degrade faster and result in the need for unplanned repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Force also revealed some of the problems that made up the deficit.</p>
        
            <p>Old or faulty tarmac at the Ohakea and Whenuapai air force bases meant aircraft such as the newly bought $2 billion P8-A Poseidons could only travel on specific parts of the airports.</p>
        
            <p>A defence spokesperson said this was to minimise the risk of aged or damaged pavement producing debris which could inadvertently damage aircraft, particularly the engines.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said major works were underway or have recently been completed at both bases to address key areas that required repair.</p>
        
            <p>They said pavement repair works have a planned annual budget of $270,000 but periodically capital injections would be required for planned large scale upgrades as has recently occurred on both bases.</p>
        
            <p>The Devonport Naval Base on Auckland's North Shore has been facing several costly issues.</p>
        
            <p>One of these was problems with silt building up around the base's naval sea areas which was impacting its dry dock operation.</p>
        
            <p>The base's wharf facilities were also deteriorating which led to difficulties when naval vessels used them.</p>
        
            <p>The wharf facilities were also regularly affected by coastal flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force has been investigating the cost of staying at the Devonport Base and the need for a supplementary facility at WhangƒÅrei.</p>
        
            <p>The accommodation for many Defence Force staff has also been adding to the bill the government agency needs to pay.</p>
        
            <p>The documents stated that these included: failing hot water systems and failing plumbing which were requiring significant remediation and the relocation of families.</p>
        
            <p>The flow on effects were creating "increasing dissatisfaction for members of the NZDF".</p>
        
            <p>Mould has emerged as a problem also because of damage to roofs.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force has been forced to relocate some people into "sub-optimal" temporary facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The upgrades announced on Friday include replacing Unimog and Pinzgauer trucks, improving helicopter navigation and better computer applications to detect maritime threats.</p>
        
            <p>Collins said $163 million would go on salaries, a significant boost in pay rates and proof the government had their backs.</p>
        
            <p>Another $408m will go toward projects and infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The project funding will be broken down into $127m in operating funding and $281m in capital funding.</p>
        
            <p>Specific projects for which funding has been allocated, subject to Cabinet approval, are:</p>
        
            <p>Attrition rates had dropped since last December, Collins said, with remuneration, more deployments and a sense that the government "had their back" helping to retain staff.</p>
        
            <p>"Our people are at the frontline of New Zealand's security in an increasingly unstable world and that increasingly unstable world makes it essential that we retain our hard-working and well-trained people who without hestitation deploy throughout the world," Collins told an audience at the burnham Military Camp near Christchurch.</p>
