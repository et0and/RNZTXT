            <p>An outraged mayor of the Horowhenua is calling for greater police powers to deal with "large mobs" after a gathering of more than 200 cars in Levin tumbled into violence at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Police were pelted with rocks and bottles as efforts to dismantle the crowd allegedly sparked hostilities on Saturday night leaving some officers injured and police cars damaged.</p>
        
            <p>Two people - one who was allegedly found with a flick-knife - were arrested and six cars impounded after dozens of police sought to quell "anti-social road user activity".</p>
        
            <p>"Around 30 police staff, deployed to the area pre-emptively, were put at serious risk due to the aggressive behaviour of many of those involved."</p>
        
            <p>Wanden told Morning Report police had sent extra manpower "but it obviously wasn't enough".</p>
        
            <p>It was hard to pinpoint what went wrong. However, he believed some people had arrived determined to incite violence.</p>
        
            <p>It would be difficult to ban these types of events, Wanden said. Some would probably try to flout the law by gathering in large numbers somewhere.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 cars - each containing multiple passengers - began gathering in a carpark on Bath Street around 8pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Manawatū area commander Inspector Ross Grantham said the car convoy then converged at the intersection of Queen Street and State Highway 57, before attempting to do burnouts there,</p>
        
            <p>"Police staff managed to disrupt the activity and move them on, but not before patrol cars were kicked by bystanders, who also threw bottles at the cars."</p>
        
            <p>The group then moved to an industrial cul de sac in Ōtaki, where they did more burnouts with police opting to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>According to police, the convoy then went back to the intersection of State Highway 57 and Tavistock Road in Levin, where they blocked the road and did more burnouts.</p>
        
            <p>A police patrol tried to drive through the group to disrupt them, however the onlookers "turned on the officers, kicking and bottling the car".</p>
        
            <p>The side window of the patrol vehicle was also smashed.</p>
        
            <p>The mayhem has angered the district's community leaders who feel officers were "caught between a rock and hard place" that night.</p>

            <p>Horowhenua District Mayor Bernie Wanden said police powers were too limited to deal with such throngs of people.</p>
        
            <p>"I can understand their inability to handle such a mob," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because they wouldn't be used to people attacking them like they were.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess they are limited to their powers of dispersal and maybe they need further powers to manage a mob like this."</p>
        
            <p>Although he wouldn't be drawn on specifics of what powers they could be equipped with, Wanden felt front-line officers had their hands tied.</p>
        
            <p>"They've almost got to stand there and take it and can't react based on what they're allowed to do and not allowed to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In situations like this, this could've escalated into something a lot worse.</p>
        
            <p>"It's absolutely disgusting that people came to that event, prepared to act in a violent way."</p>
        
            <p>By the same token, and underlining the delicate balancing act facing officers in scenarios like these, police needed to be wary not to "inflame" situations.</p>
        
            <p>"There could be some tragic events as a result."</p>
        
            <p>Street racing gatherings had become fairly common, particularly around the lower North Island, although an escalation into the violence allegedly seen on Saturday was unprecedented, Wanden said.</p>
        
            <p>Levin Ward Councillor Mike Barker believed police are "too soft" on illegal street-racers and they need to face serious consequences.</p>
        
            <p>He said their cars should either be destroyed or sold to pay for repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Street-racing events in recent months have regularly absorbed police resource throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>Five people were arrested after police targeted a 200-car-strong street events across Auckland during the Easter break.</p>
        
            <p>Police impounded five vehicles and handed out 50 fines during a crackdown on illegal street racing across Christchurch a fortnight ago.</p>
        
            <p>Last month in Invercargill, a vehicle crashed into bystanders leaving two people injured during an illegal street racing event.</p>
