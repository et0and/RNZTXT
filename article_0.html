            <p>Anzac Day has been marked around New Zealand today, with the Dawn Service in Gallipoli this afternoon featuring Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>The Foreign Affairs minister has told attendees at the Dawn Service in Gallipoli to draw their own lessons from being there, but to come together to honour those who paid with their lives.</p>
        
            <p>Describing the world as "troubled" and "the worst in memory", Winston Peters said diplomacy had never been more needed to de-escalate conflicts and ease tensions.</p>
        
            <p>Here in New Zealand, the Ministry of Culture and Heritage pulled the plug on two services for Anzac Day in Wellington over safety concerns for veterans and visitors due to strong winds over safety concerns. Many other commemorations went off without issues.</p>
