        <h2>Marokopa mystery: Mum of missing Phillips kids breaks silence</h2>
        <p>
It is the first time in two years their mother has spoken publicly, and she's asking for people to help.
</p>
        
            <p>The mother of the missing Phillips children has appealed for people's help in returning them to her.</p>
        
            <p>Today marks one week since police offered an $80,000 reward for information that would help discover the whereabouts. It is also one of the children's 11th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>Ember, Maverick and Jayda Phillips have been missing along with their father for two and a half years.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe they are in the Marokopa area in the King Country.</p>
        
            <p>Today their mum, Cat, said she was begging for people's help in finding them.</p>

            <p>In a video provided by police she said: "They are just innocent children. They do not deserve to be treated this way.</p>
        
            <p>"They do not deserve the life that is being provided to them right now."</p>
        
            <p>Referring to her daughter's birthday, Cat said: "She will be a young woman now and she needs her mother."</p>
        
            <p>Her other daughter, Ember, was asthmatic and needed medical care "that cannot be provided from the land", Cat said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of you say that the children are fine, that they're being well looked after.</p>
        
            <p>"How do you know? Have you seen them? Or is it just bush talk?"</p>
        
            <p>She then took aim at her estraged husband, Tom, accusing him of child neglect, endangerment, abandonment and abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"What Thomas is doing is not okay. It is not okay to divide and conquer.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not okay to isolate and endanger.</p>
        
            <p>"None of this is okay. My babies deserve better."</p>
        
            <p>She concluded by asking anyone with information to ring the police.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
