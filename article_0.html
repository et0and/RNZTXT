            <p>The skipper of a power boat who crashed into a passenger ferry in the Bay of Islands has been ordered to pay his victims more than $130,000 in reparations.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland man James Thomson was driving a power boat near Russell at more than 20 knots on 13 April last year when he struck the historic ferry Waitere with 19 people on board.</p>
        
            <p>The power boat, the 9.8m Onepoto, struck the Waitere, also known as the Blue Ferry, side-on.</p>
        
            <p>The crash penetrated the wheelhouse and leaving the ferry skipper, Bill Elliott, with critical head and spinal injuries.</p>
        
            <p>One passenger was thrown into the water while others received minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The 90-year-old wooden ferry sank about an hour after the collision.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of operating a vessel dangerously and appeared for sentencing in the Auckland District Court on 17 June.</p>
        
            <p>In a reserved sentence released on Tuesday, Judge Nick Webby ordered Thomson to pay his victims emotional harm reparation of $128,000 and consequential loss reparation of $3200.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson told the court he had been distracted by an engine alarm sounding from a display unit next to the helm, and had failed to see the Waitere approaching from his starboard side.</p>
        
            <p>He was travelling in open waters at about 20.5 knots at the time.</p>

            <p>The prosecution was brought by Maritime New Zealand with the charge of operating the Onepoto in a manner that caused unnecessary danger laid under the Maritime Transport Act 1994.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand manager of general regulatory operations Jason Lunjevich said it was a serious incident that could have been avoided.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and sympathies go out to the skipper of the Waitere and his loved ones, and to other victims affected by this incident."</p>
        
            <p>"Had the Onepoto skipper given full attention to keeping a look out for other vessels and hazards, and had he been travelling at a safe speed while dealing with the alarm, this incident and the injuries sustained from it could have been avoided," Lunjevich said.</p>
        
            <p>"The message for other skippers is, it is your responsibility to stay alert for other boats, craft, swimmers and hazards. Staying alert and keeping a look out prevents collisions and the consequences that they can cause."</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged Thomson had expressed remorse and accepted responsibility for the incident by cooperating with the investigation and pleading guilty at the first opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Lunjevich also praised local emergency services, the harbour master, commercial maritime operators and bystanders who responded to the incident, rescuing the skipper and ferry passengers before the vessel sank.</p>
