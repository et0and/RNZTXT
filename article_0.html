            <p>The government has confirmed a document about the government's proposed Treaty Principles bill is a leaked draft memo from the Ministry of Justice.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori's co-leader Rawiri Waititi posted a screenshot of the leaked document on social media on Friday, saying it showed the government's "intentions to erase Te Tiriti o Waitangi".</p>
        
            <p>"Let this be the fuel to our fire! See you all on Saturday! We do not surrender! We do not cede!" he wrote, ahead of the Kiingitanga's planned national unity hui.</p>
        
            <p>The screenshot showed commentary from the report's author saying they expected the bill would be "highly contentious".</p>

            <p>"This is due to both the fundamental constitutional nature of the subject matter and the lack of consultation with the public on the policy development prior to Select Committee."</p>
        
            <p>It said there was a need for the legislation because the principles of the Treaty were not defined in legislation, and "their importance requires there be certainty anc clarity about their meaning. Parliament should be intentional n (sic) the principle's (sic) definition, and how they operate in law and society".</p>
        
            <p>It also listed the proposed three new principles proposed by the government to be based on the articles of the Treaty, similar to what ACT's initial policy stated, and featured a watermark with what appears to be the word 'draft' - with the final three letters partially visible.</p>
        
            <p>1News reported it had a full copy of the leaked report, which it said warned the proposal's key points were "at odds with what the Treaty of Waitangi actually says".</p>
        
            <p>Quoting from the report: "The bill will also change the nature of the principles from reflecting a relationship akin to a partnership between the Crown and Māori to reflecting the relationship the Crown has with all citizens of New Zealand. This is not supported by either the spirit of the Treaty or the text of the Treaty."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith confirmed the report was a draft prepared by the ministry. His office also said the government was investigating the leak.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a draft Ministry of Justice memo that has not been seen or considered by Cabinet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition agreement is clear that the Government will support a bill on treaty principles to first reading. However [Prime Minister] Christopher Luxon has been clear that National has no intention to support it beyond that."</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
