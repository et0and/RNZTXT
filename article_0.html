        <h2>Live: Dunedin weather 'deteriorating' further as floodwaters rise</h2>
        <p>
Authorities have "a reasonable amount of concern" and another evacuation centre has opened as heavy rain pummels Otago.
</p>
        
            <p>A red heavy rain warning has been issued for parts of Otago with up to 150 millimetres of rain expected to fall in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in Otago and Dunedin have been warned to stay off the roads and go home.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel Peninsula was dealing with power cuts and blocked roads on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Roads are closed across Dunedin and Clutha due to flooding and slips, with those in low-lying areas of Dunedin "encouraged" to evacuate as floodwaters threaten their homes.</p>
