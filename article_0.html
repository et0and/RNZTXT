            <p>The Government is almost tripling the fee charged to most international tourists - increasing it to $100 from October - up from $35 now.</p>
        
            <p>The levy was introduced by the Labour government in 2019 - and was opposed by National at the time - who labelled it yet another tax.</p>
        
            <p>It's now come round to the idea - with the Tourism Minister Matt Dooce saying the increase would ensure visitors contribute to public services and high-value conservation projects.</p>
        
            <p>He said public consultation found 93 percent of submitters were in support of a hike.</p>
        
            <p>Some in the tourism sector have actively campaigned against an increase.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors from Australia and many Pacific Island countries were exempt from the charge.</p>
