        <p>
An "evil" criminal element combined with the social media "sensationalism factor" are contributing to increasing violence, police say.

            <p>An "evil" criminal element combined with the social media "sensationalism factor" are contributing to an increasing level of violence seen at illegal street racing, road police say.</p>
        
            <p>In the most recent incident, an officer suffered minor injuries after a ute rammed a police patrol car at a gathering of 1000 illegal street racers near Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as Police Minister Mark Mitchell and Transport Minister Simeon Brown seek advice on legislative changes to crack down on illegal street racing</p>
        
            <p>Waikato District road policing manager Inspector Jeff Penno said several officers had a narrow escape from severe injury at the Horotiu meet in August.</p>
        
            <p>"They were really lucky. If people are going to start blatantly attacking the police like that, that's some pretty deep social issues there.</p>
        
            <p>"Like or hate the police, we are what stands between anarchy and lawfulness."</p>
        
            <p>While police were well-prepared for the event, the close call was an escalation in violence that also included beer bottles being thrown at a police car.</p>
        
            <p>Penno said there was an element at the event that was "evil".</p>
        
            <p>"It just had a criminal undertone. They want to cause as much trouble as they can and they do not care about the consequences."</p>
        
            <p>The ramming incident, which resulted in charges against an 18-year-old Ōtorohanga man, was caught on camera with Penno saying social media fuelled the behaviour by glorifying it.</p>
        
            <p>It had also helped street racers become more organised so that large-scale events like the one at Horotiu were now popping up in different locations across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Illegal street racers - previously dubbed boy racers - had become more sophisticated in recent years, Penno said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had an incident about two or three weeks ago where they towed their car to a location in rural Waikato - they had trolley jacks, they had a compressor, they had tyres, and they jacked the car up, they did their massive burnouts and put it back on the trailer and went home.</p>
        
            <p>"It was luckily caught on camera so we took that car."</p>
        
            <p>Penno said there was now a very high level of premeditation compared to illegal racers of decades past.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardcore group are disguising their vehicles. They're removing all identification from them."</p>
        
            <p>In order to stay one step ahead, police devoted a lot of resource to combatting illegal racing.</p>
        
            <p>That included an operation every weekend, changing tactics from using vehicle testing inspectors to write cars off the road, to bailiffs checking for driver fines.</p>
        
            <p>There were also two staff members solely dedicated to getting warrants to impound cars, a significant road presence, and forensic work to link offending to a vehicle - often turbo-charged Japanese imports and, more recently, Ford Falcons.</p>

            <p>Hamilton's deputy mayor Angela O'Leary, who heads up the city council's infrastructure and transport committee, said the council introduced a bylaw in 2015 which prevented light vehicles on certain streets at night.</p>
        
            <p>The streets were agreed in consultation with fed-up residents and the bylaw was working to discourage illegal street racing at those spots, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really big problem and it's really awful for residents who are plagued with screaming car tyres in the middle of the night and dangerous behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>A similar bylaw was recently introduced in Waipā.</p>
        
            <p>Other efforts included anti-skid road surfacing which was proving successful on the roads where it was used.</p>
        
            <p>O'Leary said providing skid pads was not the answer and not affordable for ratepayers, and suggested real power to curb the behaviour lay with the government.</p>
        
            <p>"If we continue to see an escalation in illegal street racing and cars being used as weapons then I would support governments to have a zero tolerance policy and crush cars.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only a matter of time before somebody is probably killed and nobody wants to see that."</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown suggested new legislation could be on the way to curb gatherings of "increasingly hostile" car enthusiasts.</p>
        
            <p>"Illegal street racing is dangerous for participants and members of the public, and it causes a nuisance in neighbourhoods and communities across the country," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dangerous driving and illegal street racing should have no place in our society, and we're determined to get tougher on this anti-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"The Minister of Police and I are continuing to get advice on legislative changes to crack down on illegal street racing, and we will have more to say on this in due course."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile the Ōtorohanga teenager will reappear in the Hamilton District Court next month facing charges of intentionally damaging a police car and receiving a stolen truck.</p>
        
            <p>Current offences include operating a vehicle in an illegal race, or in an unnecessary exhibition of speed or acceleration, or in a manner that causes the vehicle to undergo sustained loss of traction.</p>
        
            <p>Police may impound a vehicle for 28 days and courts can issue a $4500 fine, three months in prison, and/or suspend a licence for six months.</p>
        
            <p>Courts may also confiscate and sell vehicles after a first offence, must confiscate and sell a vehicle after second offence, and may destroy a vehicle after the third offence.</p>
        
            <p>If the offence caused injury courts may issue a $20,000 fine, five years in prison, and must disqualify a licence for one year or more.</p>
        
            <p>If the offence caused death the maximum prison time increases to 10 years.</p>
