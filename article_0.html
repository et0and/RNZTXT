            <p>Thousands have begun arriving at Waitangi for the annual commemorations, as key Māori leaders call for a united front in the face of the coalition government's plans.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon, the Kiingitangi led a delegation onto the Treaty Grounds along with representatives from Rātana and Te Pati Māori.</p>
        
            <p>The intent is one of solidarity, made more profound by the rarity of Kiingi Tuheita's attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leaders addressed the media this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Rawiri Waititi said "This is about kotahitanga"and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said "[Our people] are incensed by this three-headed taniwha".</p>
        
            <p>Labour and the Greens were welcomed yesterday. Green co-leader Marama Davidson said the opposition would take up the call to stand with Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Today, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the feeling at Waitangi this year was "positive but there is a degree of apprehension".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a real uncertainty at the moment as to what the new government's policies are going to mean for Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Government parties are due to arrive in the North on Monday, and are expecting a much frostier reception.</p>
