            <p>The foreign affairs minister says Phil Goff's position as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is untenable, following public comments about US President Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>According to The Post, Mr Goff was speaking at a Chatham House event, and said "President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?"</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Winston Peters says Mr Goff's comments are deeply disappointing and do not represent the views of the New Zealand government.</p>
        
            <p>The Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade will now work with Mr Goff on an 'upcoming leadership transition' at the High Commission - effectively confirming his sacking from the position.</p>
        
            <p>Last year Goff offended the Māori King at at an event for the New Zealand delegation in London. He forgot to perform a karakia to open the event at the High Commission, and then went on to say in front of Kīngi Tuheitia that no one in the room had experienced a coronation before.</p>
