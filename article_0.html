            <p>Forty one days after the election, the makeup of the next government is due to be unveiled.</p>
        
            <p>National Party leader Christopher Luxon, the next prime minister, will reveal the details on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Speculation was rife on Wednesday night an announcement was imminent, with the National Party leader on his way to Wellington. ACT leader David Seymour was already there, and NZ First leader Winston Peters following on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>National needed both New Zealand First and ACT's backing to form the next government, whether as a coalition or on confidence and supply.</p>
        
            <p>The negotiations were the second-longest in New Zealand's MMP history, behind only 1996, when New Zealand First was in a 'kingmaker' position.</p>
