            <p>The leak of Te Whatu Ora vaccine-related information online is a "devastating breach of trust", the organisation's chief executive Margie Apa says.</p>
        
            <p>The health agency had resecured systems and was continuing to scan the internet and media for any further appearance of the data.</p>
        
            <p>The staff member accused of leaking the data was due to appear in Wellington District Court on Monday, charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief executive Margie Apa said the individual allegedly downloaded a large amount of vaccine-related information and published it on an overseas website.</p>
        
            <p>The person had no clinical background or expert vaccine knowledge and appeared to be trying to spread misinformation, she alleged.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora found out about the breach on Thursday morning through an email an individual had sent to a number of officials, she told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically that he had information that suggested there were excess mortalities due to the Covid vaccine that were not reported, and purported to have made connections to data that proved that, which is not true."</p>
        
            <p>The data had been taken down from the overseas website and an Employment Relations Authority injunction was preventing it from being published elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>The data seemed to be "large amounts of vaccine-related information" and appeared to have been anonymised, Apa said. Analysis was continuing, but so far no NHI numbers or personally identifiable information was believed to have been released.</p>
        
            <p>"We have taken action since Thursday morning to resecure our whole system, which includes resetting a whole lot of access codes.</p>
        
            <p>"We're scanning the international internet and web and media to look for data that looks like ours appearing, which is how we picked up the US-based website on Friday midnight."</p>
        
            <p>She said the leak was an "isolated incident" and a "devastating breach of trust".</p>
        
            <p>The man facing charges had worked in a small team of specialised people who were "incredibly devastated" by what happened.</p>
