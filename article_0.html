            <p>Alliance Group has announced a proposal to close its Timaru plant.</p>
        
            <p>It told workers consultation would run until 11 October and a final decision was expected to be made by 18 October.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the company announced a surprise meeting would be held at 11am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The company would not say in advance what it was about.</p>
        
            <p>The lamb processing season finished at the Smithfield plant on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Venison processing was still running, but workers were told there were no shifts on Friday and to attend the meeting instead.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the meeting, Timaru Mayor Nigel Bowen said the plant employed more than 600 people at peak season, and workers were going into the meeting with a lot of questions.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of concern for those workers that are affected. There's been rumours for some time now around possible changes, potential closure, so I guess one thing that is positive is that affected parties will have that confirmed in one way or another."</p>
        
            <p>Bowen said a closure would be significant for the region, given the large number of staff and supporting trades it would affect.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been talking, certainly, with agencies, Chamber of Commerce, economic development, and certainly there'll be as much support as possible wrapped around anyone if there is any closure of sorts," he said.</p>
