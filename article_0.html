        <h2>'Deeply sorry': Bayly fronts after resignation</h2>
        <p>
Senior National Andrew Bayly MP has quit his ministerial roles after what he says was an "animated discussion" that went "too far" and ended with him putting a hand on a staffer. Audio

            <p>Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly has resigned his ministerial positions after what he says was an "animated discussion" that ended with him putting a hand on a staffer.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly says he took the discussion "too far", and described his behaviour as "overbearing" and "inappropriate".</p>
        
            <p>"I am deeply sorry," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios. Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."</p>
        
            <p>In a press conference last about five minutes later on Monday, Bayly described the discussion with the staffer as "lively" but did not provide further details. He denied using force on the staffer.</p>
        
            <p>A complaint had been laid, Bayly said, refusing to comment further.</p>

            <p>It follows a separate incident in October, where Bayly apologised after repeatedly calling a worker a loser during a site visit for his former small business portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>The worker's complaint said the minister had questioned why they were still working and told them to "take a bottle of wine and go home ... take some wine and f*** off", and later called them a "loser" in front of their boss, the minister's assistant, marketing staff and other employees, forming an 'L' on his forehead with his fingers.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly will remain in Parliament as MP for Port Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Bayly indicated his actions fell short of the expectations he set himself, and that are expected of ministers, and "as such has offered his resignation as a minister, which I have accepted".</p>
        
            <p>That resignation takes effect immediately, and Scott Simpson will take over as Minister for ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs.</p>
        
            <p>"I do want to thank Mr Bayly for the hard work he has put into his ministerial portfolios," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Timeline:</p>
        
            <p>"Concerns have been raised with me about a recent incident in which my behaviour towards a staff member was overbearing and for that, I am deeply sorry.</p>
        
            <p>"As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios. Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"I have apologised to the staff member and regret placing them in an uncomfortable position.</p>
        
            <p>"There are times when you have to hold yourself to account and today is one of those days. I have made the personal choice to resign as a Minister and have offered my resignation to the Prime Minister, which he has accepted.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to extend my gratitude to all the officials and staff who have worked diligently alongside me to progress a wide suite of changes across all my ministerial portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>"I am incredibly proud of the work we have achieved together, and I look forward to continuing to serve the people of Port Waikato and being involved in the work of Parliament."</p>
