            <p>Four people - one semi-conscious - have been pulled from the sea after getting into serious trouble in a rip.</p>
        
            <p>The three children and one adult had gone into the water on Friday evening at an unpatrolled Port Waikato beach.</p>
        
            <p>Six off-duty lifeguards from the Sunset Beach Surf Lifesaving Club happened to see them and quickly went to the rescue about 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>They used a rescue board and tubes to bring the swimmers to safety.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand said one of the swimmers was in a semi-conscious state when pulled from the water, but had since stabilised.</p>
        
            <p>They were flown to hospital by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>The other three were in a "stable but shaken" condition.</p>
        
            <p>The surf at the beach was between 1.2 and 2 metres and "turbulent", Surf Life Saving New Zealand said.</p>
        
            <p>"These people were incredibly lucky surf lifeguards happened to be in the vicinity, outside surf lifeguard patrol hours.</p>
        
            <p>"Had they not been spotted by off-duty surf lifeguards, it is likely they would have drowned."</p>
        
            <p>The weekday paid lifeguard service will begin at Port Waikato beach on 23 December and runs until 14 February.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteer patrols will be at the beach on the weekends.</p>
