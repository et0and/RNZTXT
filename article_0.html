            <p>The new Ministry of Regulation is paying its staff an average salary of more than $150,000 and will eventually employ more than 90 people, new figures reveal.</p>
        
            <p>That is despite the coalition pledging to slash back-office spending across the public sector and attacking the former government for creating massive bureaucracies.</p>
        
            <p>The anti-red tape department is overseen by ACT leader David Seymour, who secured its creation during coalition negotiations last year.</p>
        
            <p>Figures obtained by the Green Party - and first reported by The Post - reveal a median salary at the agency of $154,500, well above the public service median of $84,800.</p>
        
            <p>The mean, or average, salary is $152,034, compared to $97,200 across the wider public service.</p>
        
            <p>Other documents outline the ministry's proposed structure, including three deputy chief executives earning up to $350,000 each.</p>
        
            <p>Green MP Francisco Hernandez said the coalition's hypocrisy was galling given the deep cuts being felt across other parts of the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>"The government has a double standard: one for its pet ministries and its pet ministers, and the other for the wider public service which is actually doing really useful things."</p>
        
            <p>Hernandez said the "ideology-driven agency" was merely duplicating work and should be defunded, with the money spent instead on real frontline services, such as Oranga Tamariki or health.</p>
        
            <p>The Taxpayers' Union also issued a statement in response to the news, decrying "bureaucratic blob" and calling it a test of Seymour's credibility.</p>
        
            <p>"This upstart ministry seems to be running in completely the wrong direction," executive director Jordan Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"Seymour needs to lead by example, and has now set himself a tough task to demonstrate value for money from his new gold-plated department."</p>
        
            <p>Public Service Minister Nicola Willis referred all RNZ's questions to Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Seymour questioned the media's focus on salaries given there were more than 200 people in the public service in "tier 2 roles", most earning between $250,000 and $350,000.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite this, the media are concerned with ministry's average salary and its 91 permanent roles, when it is carrying out the long-needed work of addressing the country's red tape which is going to save various sectors, and many New Zealanders, time, money, and sanity."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said he expected the average salary to drop as the ministry became more established and temporary roles were replaced with permanent ones.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry is destined to be a lean and effective team. It is small and requires highly skilled specialist roles for the work it is doing for New Zealanders, and a reasonably average salary can be expected. That said, it is lower than other agencies and has been benchmarked against four other central agencies.</p>
        
            <p>"Contrasted with various other ministries that had become bloated under the previous government, the Ministry for Regulation will be efficient, cutting the unnecessary out - much like the regulations they have been working to, and will continue to, cut and improve."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has previously described the ministry as being "small but mighty".</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the election, ACT campaigned on axing the Productivity Commission, and its 20-odd staff, and instead setting up the Ministry for Regulation.</p>
        
            <p>The new department is tasked with assessing red-tape across a range of sectors and "clearing out laws that are sapping Kiwi ingenuity", Seymour has said.</p>
        
            <p>Since taking office, the government has directed savings be made across ministries, agencies and departments.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has tallied a net loss of more than 6500 roles to date.</p>
