            <p>US President Donald Trump signed a string of divisive presidential orders as he was sworn in for a historic second term and is now celebrating at one of three balls being held in Washington.</p>
        
            <p>Trump and wife Melania shared a first dance at the Commander in Chief Ball which is for military service members.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, he wasted no time getting stuck into paperwork, signing dozens of orders on his first day back in office.</p>
        
            <p>One of his most immediate priorities was to pardon about 1500 people who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The US will also leave the World Health Organisation, Trump said, saying the global health agency had mishandled the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.</p>
