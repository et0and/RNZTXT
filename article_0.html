            <p>US president Joe Biden has called for 'thorough and swift' investigation' into the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and said he was grateful the former president was recovering.</p>
        
            <p>Trump had just begun a campaign speech in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday (Sunday NZT) when shots rang out, hitting the former president's right ear and streaking his face with blood.</p>
        
            <p>Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who they say fired from the roof of a building 140m from the stage where Trump was speaking.</p>
        
            <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says he has been speaking to the families of two people who were shot and injured at the rally and are still being treated.</p>
        
            <p>Shapiro paid tribute to volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, who he said was killed at the rally on Saturday (Sunday NZT time) after he "dived on his family" to protect them.</p>
