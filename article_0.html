        <h2>Watch live: Minister fronts as NZ's climate targets come into doubt</h2>
        <p>
Labour says the government is off track, while the Greens say they're rolling back progress, The Climate Change Minister agrees there are challenges ahead after the release of new figures. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Climate change minister Simon Watts will be speaking live from about 10am.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition parties say the government's draft emissions reduction plan shows it's policies are taking the country backwards.</p>
        
            <p>The plan, released Wednesday, shows New Zealand's future climate targets are in jeopardy, unless new policies or technology come to the rescue by the end of the decade.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins told Morning Report the government was off track for meeting emissions reduction targets.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have to be a climate scientist to figure out that almost every decision that this government has taken since they took office has actually turned us backwards when it comes to reducing New Zealand's emissions."</p>
        
            <p>While there were some positive ideas in the plan they were outweighed by the negatives, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is they're all over the show on climate change."</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick told Morning Report the plan was disappointing but unsurprising.</p>
        
            <p>"The top thing that New Zealanders need to know out of this is that Aotearoa New Zealand is no longer on track to meet it's net zero target, or... our third emissions budget as a result of this government's policies."</p>
        
            <p>She said the government was relying on a "heck of a lot of wishful thinking" and was making things worse with its policy decisions.</p>

            <p>"They are rolling back massive progress.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are to add all of the policies up which the previous government had in place.. what we have now with the government shredding those policies is that we are in a worse place than we were a year ago."</p>
        
            <p>Climate Change Minister Simon Watts told Morning Report while there was work to be done the plan did see the country meeting its more immediate domestic targets.</p>
        
            <p>He admitted meeting international obligations, such as those under the Paris agreement, was a work in progress.</p>
        
            <p>"The government are committed to meeting all of the targets that we've signed up to, that is a significant challenge for us and we'll be working through that later this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really focused on what we need to do between now and 2023 and are we on track for that and while it's going to be a challenge, the analysis that we've got based on our policies that we've got in play show we are on track."</p>
        
            <p>A focus on new technology, renewable energy and providing farmers with tools to reduce emissions were among ideas outlined in the plan, Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>He denied the government was relying too heavily on planting trees.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all part of the broader mix of options on the table and giving us the diversity of options as well."</p>
        
            <p>Overall the government was confident it could reduce emissions while continuing to grow the economy, Watts said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the win win that we need to achieve but now is the period of time where actually need to start doing the doing."</p>
