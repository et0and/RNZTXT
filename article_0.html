            <p>More deaths have been reported in New Caledonia as the unrest spreads beyond Nouméa to rural areas.</p>
        
            <p>The French territory has been under a state of emergency for six days due to riots sparked by a proposed law change which would allow more French residents of New Caledonia to vote. Protesters say the move would weaken the indigenous Kanak vote.</p>
        
            <p>Local media reported a father died near the small rural town of Kaala-Gomen, about 355km away from the capital, on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>He had been trying to go beyond a road block set up by rioters, but was refused access, and shots were exchanged when he tried for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>The man's son was with him at the time, local media reported.</p>
        
            <p>Two other people were reported as injured during the shooting. They were rushed to the Northern Province's main hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a young motorcyclist was also reported dead after accidentally hitting a burnt vehicle in Nouméa on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred in the Vallée du Tir neighbourhood about 7pm, public broadcaster Nouvelle-Calédonie la Première reported.</p>

            <p>Vallée du Tir is among the areas identified by French authorities as out of control and still being held by groups of rioters.</p>
        
            <p>"We are once again calling on those blocking access: lift the blockades!" an emotional local government minister Vaimu'a Muliava told a press conference on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"There have been deaths already ... every day that passes brings us deeper into the hole and makes it more difficult for us to recover."</p>
        
            <p>He also called on rioters to restore free access so people could access medical care and food.</p>
        
            <p>"Please everyone, think not just with your reasoning, but with your heart," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We just can't go on like this ... we are killing ourselves."</p>
        
            <p>Muliava told the people on the barricades to imagine if it was their mother or grandmother in need of medical care.</p>
        
            <p>Planes flown from France (but also from French Polynesia), described as an "air lift", were also carrying essential food, medical supplies and blood reserves.</p>
        
            <p>Food rationing was enforced in most retail outlets, under supervision from neighbourhood watch "civil defence" groups who were ensuring consumers did not take too many essential items at the time.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, French High Commissioner Le Franc said there was sufficient food in stock to last two months - the issue was accessing shops and service stations.</p>

            <p>He also said he had heard "a youngster died because he was playing with a gun", but did not provide further details.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody wins. We all lose, whether pro-independence or anti-independence. We die because roads are still blocked. Are we going to go on like this? No!"</p>
        
            <p>Government spokesperson Gilbert Tyuienon said he was asking for the "restoration of peace".</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone should pray on this Pentecost weekend and then next week let's start to work on our country's recovery, which is only possible if access is restored."</p>
        
            <p>Police, gendarmes, firefighters and army reinforcements are gradually arriving in New Caledonia from France, as well as French Polynesia, to lift the blockades.</p>
        
            <p>Once all of the reinforcements have arrived, the total number is expected to reach some 2700.</p>
        
            <p>The French government also plans to send a "dialogue mission" to New Caledonia to restore trust between Paris and the South Pacific dependency.</p>
