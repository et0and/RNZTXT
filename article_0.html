            <p>People are reportedly trapped under buildings in Taiwan after a 7.7 earthquake that has also prompted tsunami warnings in the region.</p>
        
            <p>Media in Taiwan are reporting people have been trapped under collapsed buildings in the city of Hualien following the quake on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>TV stations are screening footage of buildings that have collapsed and power is out to some parts of capital Taipei, witnesses say.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the quake was reported to be M7.2, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has upgraded the magnitude to 7.7.</p>
        
            <p>There is no tsunami threat to New Zealand, GNS Science and NEMA have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says there are 137 New Zealanders registered with it in Taiwan and 428 in Japan.</p>
        
            <p>It says Kiwis in areas affected in Taiwan and Japan should follow the advice of local authorities.</p>

            <p>Japan has also issued an evacuation advisory for the coastal areas near the southern prefecture of Okinawa after the tsunami warning.</p>
        
            <p>Waves up to 3 metres were expected to reach Japan's southwestern coast around, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.</p>
        
            <p>Its epicentre was in the waters off the eastern coastline of Taiwan, according to the country's Central Weather Administration.</p>
        
            <p>A tsunami measuring 0.3 metres has already reached Yonaguni island, in southwestern Japan, NHK has reported.</p>
        
            <p>Japan was rocked by its deadliest quake in eight years on New Year's Day when a 7.6 magnitude temblor struck in Ishikawa prefecture, on the western coast. More than 230 people died in the quake that left 44,000 homes fully or partially destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about one-fifth of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.</p>
        
            <p>On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami. Those events triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.</p>
