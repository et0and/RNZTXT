            <p>The first exit poll after UK polling booths closed minutes ago is showing a landslide for Labour, ending the Tories' long reign.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC exit poll predicts Labour will win 410 seats to the Conservatives' 131 under Britain's First Past the Post system.</p>
        
            <p>Voters in the UK are casting their ballots in a national election to choose the 650 MPs who will sit in Parliament for the next five years.</p>
        
            <p>After 14 years in power under five different prime ministers, Sunak's Conservatives are widely expected to lose to the main opposition party, the left-of-centre Labour Party led by Keir Starmer. Sunak's party has struggled to reassure voters on issues including the rising cost of living and a crisis in the National Health Service.</p>
        
            <p>Polls opened at 7am (Thursday 6pm NZ time) and closed at 10pm on Thursday night (9am this morning NZ time).</p>
