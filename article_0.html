            <p>Tens of thousands of people are expected to converge on parliament on Tuesday, as te Hīkoi mō te Tiriti convoys come together in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Final preparations are being made in Wellington, ahead of the march on Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi stopped in Porirua for a rest day on Monday, where about 1000 people took the opportunity to learn waiata, haka and create signs.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Te Koha O Te Moana Shortland, who sung on stage in front of the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>She said despite the importance and meaning behind the hīkoi, spirits had been positive and upbeat throughout the day.</p>
        
            <p>"For such a sad hīkoi, everyone here has like a really good wairua, everything's so happy, the vibes are vibing, the sun is out, we are all very warm - it's a great day," Shortland said.</p>

            <p>Also at Ngāti Toa Park in Porirua, where activities were taking place, was 75-year-old Iris Pahau, who was on the 1975 land march with Dame Whina Cooper almost 50 years ago, as well as the foreshore and seabed march in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>She joined the hīkoi on Sunday in Levin, and planned to link up with other whānau coming through on Tuesday in car loads from Taumarunui.</p>
        
            <p>Pahau said she felt the wairua of the hīkoi very strongly in her whole body, the moment she reached Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>"Beautiful that we're here - for tangata whenua to be on tangata whenua land, it's beautiful. But a lot of it has been about akoranga: teaching our whānau what it is all about tomorrow. Me, my mokopuna, my tamariki - we're all going to be arm to arm on this hīkoi," she said.</p>

            <p>The hīkoi had also gained momentum from many pākehā or tangata tiriti around the country, including Barbara Blake who is part of the group Te Tiriti is Us.</p>
        
            <p>She described the atmosphere at Porirua Domain as beautiful and likened it to a festival.</p>
        
            <p>She criticised the Treaty Principles bill architect, ACT leader David Seymour, saying his approach was not right.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't break a bilateral agreement unilaterally, with just one party. That's wrong, that's legally wrong, that's morally wrong and that's culturally wrong."</p>

            <p>Speaking at the Beehive, Seymour told reporters although he supported the right to protest, the people on the hīkoi were misguided and there were a range of grievances.</p>
        
            <p>"This has brought them together and given them some purpose. To some extent it is something that's been organised by Te Pāti Māori, but nonetheless, you know it looks like a peaceful protest - they've got a right to do it," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was not yet sure whether he would speak to the crowds on Tuesday when they reached Parliament, and was waiting to assess the mood first.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in two minds, let's see what the vibe of it is. If there's an invitation from the organisers," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think if I sort of walk out there and they don't want to give me a chance to speak and so on, then you sort of wonder what you're doing there, but certainly I welcome the opportunity in principle."</p>

            <p>Among the crowds at Parliament will be the new Māori Queen, Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po, who will join the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingitanga spokesperson Ngira Simmonds said while it was uncommon for a Māori monarch to break the period of mourning following the death of their predecessor - in her case, her father - the Queen would advocate for more unity between Māori and the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>"Equally she's keen to invite all of us across Aotearoa, wherever we are, to find a way to embody that tomorrow. Her presence - her hope is for one of unity and one of immediate action rather than just continued prolonged conversation," Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>A contingent from Te Waipounamu, the South Island, made its way from Christchurch to Picton, with many travelling on to Wellington by ferry and arriving on Monday evening.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, they planned to link up with the North Island group at Waitangi Park in central Wellington, and then to descend onto the steps of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>From here, the halls of power would feel the full force and wairua of Māoridom, organisers said.</p>
