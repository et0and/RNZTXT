            <p>Aotearoa's 10th meteorite has been discovered on Crown land in the South Island's Mackenzie Country by a group of eagle-eyed citizen scientists.</p>
        
            <p>The space rock entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 50 to 60 kilometres per second on 13 March.</p>
        
            <p>It was spotted by Dennis Behan, a member of Fireballs Aotearoa, who was relaxing in his spa bath in Queenstown when it tore through the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>About 20 searchers set off this morning to find the rock, south of Lake Tekapo.</p>
        
            <p>They were now celebrating at the pub after coming across the meteorite before the search-proper had even got underway.</p>
        
            <p>Fireballs Aotearoa citizen scientist Steve Wyn-Harris excitedly recounted the tale.</p>
        
            <p>"We had hoped to get more [volunteers] to search because it was such a big area to search - 200 or 300 hectares - and we found it. We found it on our way to the search area," Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>Jack Weterings, one of the volunteers, had spotted the meteorite.</p>

            <p>"It is a bit like a needle in a haystack and where we were on a big glacial plain covered in stones and very little vegetation, but this particular stone stood out," Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>"It looked a bit like a piece of coal - a dark, black stone amongst a whole lot of grey, greywacke. It had embedded itself into the ground. It was in a small crater. We think this stone is about a kilo in weight."</p>
        
            <p>Geologist Marshall Palmer inspected it and was very excited by the find.</p>
        
            <p>Fireballs Aotearoa director James Scott had also inspected it remotely from Germany and was equally excited and Palmer's initial analysis of the rock showed it was very high in nickel.</p>
        
            <p>"Which is almost confirmation it's a meteorite," Wyn-Harris said.</p>

            <p>The rock would now make its way to Otago University to confirm its extra-terrestrial origins, but they were 99 percent sure they had found the meteorite.</p>
        
            <p>"We found the bastard and this is not just my Everest but Fireballs Aotearoa, who have co-ordinated the search and whose cameras allowed the maths and physics to be done to know where to search, but also a small group of volunteers from the Tekapo community," Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>In exchange for giving up ownership of the meteorite, Weterings had been gifted a fireballs camera so he could join the citizen sleuths with an eye on the sky.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorites which landed on private land became the property of the land owner, but those found on public land were subject to the law of finders-keepers.</p>
