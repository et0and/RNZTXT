        <h2>'Extensive, ambitious': Governor-General sets out govt plan, during State Opening of Parliament</h2>
        <p>
The Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro will deliver a speech outlining the government's priorities for the term.
</p>
        
            <p>The Governor-General is delivering the traditional Speech from the Throne at the State opening of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro will read the speech, penned by the Prime Minister's Office, which will lay out the government's intentions for the next three years. It is her first speech from the throne.</p>
        
            <p>Preceded by ceremony supported by the military and MƒÅori dignitaries, the speech is the primary instrument to mark the State Opening of Parliament, following the Commission Opening - featuring the swearing-in of MPs and election of the Speaker - on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The new government is committed to delivering, to getting things done. It wants people to see demonstrable, measurable results that make their lives easier, and help them to get ahead," Kiro said in her opening remarks.</p>
        
            <p>The speech noted the novel three-party coalition form the incoming government would be taking.</p>
        
            <p>It spoke of the government's plan to work with "local government, businesses, community groups and iwi" saying more could be achieved by working together and that cooperation would "enable greater reach into communities, particularly those with high needs, to effect change".</p>
        
            <p>"The government's aim is to improve outcomes for all New Zealanders, while leading a unified and confident country. The government will encourage independence and reward hard work, while retaining a comprehensive safety net for those in need of support."</p>
        
            <p>It set out clear priorities:</p>
        
            <p>"Its policy programme will be extensive and ambitious, reflecting the amount of change necessary to provide hope and opportunity for more New Zealanders, and for this great nation to realise more of its potential," Kiro said.</p>
        
            <p>The speech is delivered after the Governor-General's messenger - the 'Black Rod' - knocks three times on the doors of the debating chamber, summoning the MPs inside to the Legislative Council Chamber, the room that used to house the equivalent of Britain's House of Lords until New Zealand's Parliament switched to a unicameral system in 1951.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday Parliament was formally opened and MPs were sworn in.</p>
        
            <p>National's Gerry Brownlee was elected Speaker of the House.</p>
