            <p>Whangārei District Council is holding a sudden closed-door meeting on Tuesday morning about fluoridating its drinking water.</p>
        
            <p>The closed meeting comes just 17 days ahead of the government's 28 March deadline for the council to fluoridate its drinking water.</p>
        
            <p>The short-notice 9.30am emergency meeting comes after an unusual last-minute change on Friday where an initial and also unusually, unadvertised, open council meeting scheduled at 9am with the description fluoride as its purpose was canned at the last minute.</p>

            <p>About 80,000 Whangārei district residents will have their water fluoridated by that date if the council decides to change tack on its rebel stance against doing so at Tuesday's meeting.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Local Government Act which underpins local council meetings process requires ordinary council meetings to be publicly notified at least two working days ahead of them happening.</p>
        
            <p>This did not happen.</p>

            <p>Fluoridation has for months drawn the biggest sustained public gallery turnouts since the council moved into its civic centre Te Iwitahi in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 100 people have attended every public council meeting where fluoridation has been discussed, since Whangārei District Council (WDC) decided not to fluoridate on 28 November.</p>
        
            <p>WDC posted the Tuesday meeting change on its council Facebook page only and not its website's normal agendas and meetings page, doing so about 2.45pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The post said the reason for the 9am meeting's cancellation was that there were no public agenda items for consideration.</p>
        
            <p>It said the 9.30am meeting's purpose was for the council to consider legally privileged information about the council's position on drinking water supply fluoridation.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting comes as time runs out for the significant lead-in time required to test newly installed infrastructure and dosing processes ahead of any fluoridation startup.</p>
        
            <p>Council lawyers have applied to the High Court for a date to hear a council application for "urgent interim relief" so WDC can delay its hands-on preparations for full fluoridation by the late March deadline.</p>

            <p>The council wants the High Court to rule on which evidence about adding the chemical to drinking water is used to justify the government directive to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Politicians face the prospect of jail if the council is successfully charged with flouting the government directive to make this happen by 28 March.</p>
        
            <p>Ratepayers face stumping up for $5 million in extra costs from the council refusing to comply.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's closed meeting comes after Whangārei Mayor Vince Cocurullo said he would go to prison over democracy and the council directive.</p>
        
            <p>WDC is the only council in New Zealand refusing to fluoridate among 14 nationwide ordered to do so by outgoing the Director General of Health Sir Ashley Bloomfield in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The council is to hold the meeting at its Te Iwitahi council chambers in Whangārei's Rust Ave.</p>
