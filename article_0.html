            <p>Pharmac chief executive Sarah Fitt has resigned from her role.</p>
        
            <p>The drug funding agency made the formal announcement in a statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"The Board of Pharmac wishes to announce that its Chief Executive for the last 7 years, Sarah Fitt, has resigned effective from 30 May 2025, with her taking a period of leave in April and May. Pharmac will commence its recruitment for a new CEO shortly."</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a submission built off a 100,000 signature petition calling for her to be sacked was presented to Parliament's health select committee in December 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Fitt has had a turbulent time as CEO since 2018, with repeated calls for her resignation.</p>
        
            <p>They were perhaps at a height in 2023 when emails released to journalist Rachel Smalley under the Official Information Act revealed what critics called a "sneering and contemptuous" tone among some Pharmac staff.</p>
        
            <p>Fitt had sent an email with the subject line "Sigh...." about a Smalley column about cancer patients who would have died if they relied on the public health system.</p>
        
            <p>One of her staff members had joked about making Smalley cry.</p>
        
            <p>Patients and a top haematologist were among those calling for her resignation, and she was accused of being out of touch with their experience.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of last year, the agency was under fire for making changes to hormone replacement therapy patch brands.</p>
        
            <p>The Pharmac Minister, David Seymour and the chairwoman Paula Bennett refused to express confidence in Fitt at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac backtracked on the issue just a few weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister David Seymour, acknowledged the resignation and thanked Fitt for her service.</p>
        
            <p>"Since becoming minister responsible for Pharmac I have been impressed by Sarah's commitment to focussing Pharmac on its core role of expanding opportunities and access for patients.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge Sarah's decision to step down from the role and thank her for her work in providing modern healthcare for New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish her all the very best for the future".</p>
        
            <p>In recent weeks a number of top health officials have announced their resignations including the Director-General of Health, Diana Sarfati and Health New Zealand chief executive Fepulea'i Margie Apa.</p>
        
            <p>Director of Public Health Dr Nicholas Jones also announced he would be stepping down and returning to his regular role.</p>
