            <p>Warning: This story contains content some readers may find distressing.</p>
        
            <p>A disabled mental health patient who was "manipulated and groomed" into a sexual relationship with a staff member has described how she has lost trust in both men and nurses, a court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>It was part of a victim impact statement that was read to the Christchurch District Court on Wednesday as former nurse Peter Ogden was sentenced.</p>
        
            <p>The 54-year-old had pleaded guilty to one charge of ill-treatment of a vulnerable adult, after he engaged in a relationship with a vulnerable patient at a Christchurch mental health facility between 2021 and 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Tom Gilbert sentenced Ogden to 12 months home detention.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Deidre Elsmore read a victim impact statement to the court from the woman, whose identity has been suppressed, and who was listening via audio-visual link.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't trust nurses or men anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know whether they're just being nice or are going to want something.</p>
        
            <p>"It has made me question whether they're in the job for the right reasons."</p>
        
            <p>Further fears of being perceived as a "liar" by other patients and staff at the facility were also heard.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard how the situation had ruined her ability to care for herself and how she has panic attacks when "around people associated to Pete".</p>
        
            <p>"I find it difficult to have a shower, even with consistent female staff members as I don't want them to touch me.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes I don't shower for weeks at a time.</p>
        
            <p>"This has lead to infections and caused my skin to break down."</p>
        
            <p>After she disclosed the relationship with Ogden, the court heard how he begged and pleaded with the woman to withdraw a complaint against him.</p>
        
            <p>Although the Crown acknowledged the relationship was consensual, Elsmore stated it was "exploitative, involving extreme amounts of power".</p>
        
            <p>"She has been groomed and manipulated, this law is here to protect unwell people from that kind of manipulation that leads to genuine consent," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Stephen Hembrow said although the relationship was inappropriate, the level of control that Ogden had over the woman was "overstated".</p>
        
            <p>"She came and went from the hospital as she chose," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's only there eight hours, five days a week.</p>
        
            <p>"She had other nurses, counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists and only disclosed the relationship after he transferred to somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>Other personal factors, including Ogden's subsequent estrangement with his children and loss of income were also heard.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Gilbert said Ogden's relationship with the patient was "all wrong" and unquestionably a gross departure from the standard expected of hospital carers.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst the relationship may have been consensual, it was exploitative and she shouldn't have even been put into a position where she was thinking about consenting to sexual activity with you," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is you will never be a nurse in New Zealand again."</p>
        
            <p>Although Gilbert conceded an "instinctual distaste" of Odgen's behaviour, he said he was a first offender who was at low risk of re-offending.</p>
        
            <p>Ogden was also ordered to pay an emotional harm payment of $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
