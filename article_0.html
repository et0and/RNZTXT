            <p>Police were called to an address on Douglas Crescent in Fairfield at 2.10am, following a report of an assault.</p>
        
            <p>There they found one person dead and two seriously injured, who were transported to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"A 34-year-old man was found a short distance from the address with serious injuries and was also transported to hospital, where he remains under police guard," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Five ambulances, two critical care paramedics and two managers also attended the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to reassure the community that this is an isolated incident and there is no ongoing risk to the wider public."</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination will take place.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the 34-year-old will "face charges in due course".</p>
