        <h2>'That is fascism' - Peters on protesters at NZ First speech</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has been repeatedly heckled while delivering a State of the Nation speech in Christchurch.
</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters is delivering a State of the Nation speech in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Peters is scheduled to speak at a public meeting at James Hay Theatre from 2pm, and to answer questions from 3:15pm.</p>
        
            <p>In remarks released to media, Peters called to 'Make New Zealand First again' and proposed a "war on woke".</p>
        
            <p>"One of the most concerning and insidious cancers in our society today is the underlying creep of woke social engineering," Peters was to say.</p>
        
            <p>"This seeping of the leftist group-think and condoned by too many on the right, has been mostly hidden from society in the way it has implanted itself in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>At the speech's conclusion, Peters' remarks end with, "We together are going to take back control, take back our country, and Make New Zealand First Again."</p>
        
            <p>It comes on the heels of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' arrival back from Washington DC, where he met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
        
            <p>Peters has been tight-lipped about the specifics of the meetings he attended, insisting he will brief his Cabinet colleagues before speaking publicly on the issues.</p>
