            <p>Thousands of people have joined the national hīkoi opposing the Treaty Principles Bill as it progresses south, with supporters lining State Highway 10 as it passes through Kerikeri en route to Kawakawa.</p>
        
            <p>A dawn karakia at Te Rerenga Wairua launched the national hīkoi on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Hīkoi mō te Tiriti participants gathered for a dawn blessing ahead of a nine-day journey to Wellington. Police are preparing for 25,000 people to join, while organisers are hoping for as many as 40,000.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, rangatahi, tamariki, kaumatua and kuia marched and rode on horseback through Kaitaia. An RNZ reporter described the scene there as "upbeat and energised".</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi was expected to reach Whangārei by 6pm on Monday - the first overnight stop on the journey to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, leaders of a hīkoi against David Seymour's Treaty Principles Bill have rejected the ACT leader's offer of a meeting as they set off for Wellington.</p>
