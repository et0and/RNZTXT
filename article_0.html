            <p>A caravan park has been evacuated near Canterbury's West Melton as high winds fan a large vegetation fire.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ said the blaze was first reported about 9pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"At 10pm, 10 trucks are on the scene at the end of Thompsons Rd.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire is approximately 1km x 1km, with high winds in the area."</p>
        
            <p>A caravan park, in The Willows area, had been evacuated, Fire and Emergency NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze comes just days after a huge fire broke out in the Bridge Hill area, leading to school camps and part of a village being evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>That fire, which has since grown to about 1000 hectares, is expected to take a week to fully extinguish.</p>
