            <p>The 32-year-old man accused of driving the vehicle that fatally struck a Nelson police officer has been charged with murder and multiple other charges, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming was one of two officers struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square at about 2am on 1 January. She later died from her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsey remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Two members of the public were also injured in this incident - one woman received a broken arm and a man who came to assist police was injured in his shoulder. A third police officer was assessed for a concussion and discharged from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the vehicle that hit the officers was arrested at the scene after being tasered.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released this afternoon, Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said the arrested man will face eight charges, including murder and attempted murder.</p>
        
            <p>He is also charged with two charges of assault using a vehicle as a weapon; two charges of wounding with intent (reckless disregard) in relation to the other officer who was injured and a member of the public; dangerous driving and driving while disqualified.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said further charges may follow.</p>
        
            <p>The man will appear in Nelson District Court tomorrow, Friday 3 December.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said the incident which claimed the life of the widely-respected police officer with 38 years front-line service was "tragic and senseless"</p>
        
            <p>"For New Zealand, Lyn is tragically the first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty and the first police officer in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>"I know we are all struggling to understand why this has happened."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers thanked the investigation team who had worked "around the clock".</p>
        
            <p>"They continue to speak with a number of witnesses today and have enquiries well underway."</p>
        
            <p>Tasman District criminal investigations manager Detective Inspector Lex Bruning has appealed for any footage of yesterday morning's event.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation team have set up a dedicated portal for receiving photos and videos and would appreciate the public's assistance with this."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with footage of the incident can upload it here.</p>
        
            <p>Bruning said police would also like to hear from anyone who was in the area who witnessed the incident, or any events leading up to it.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be doing area enquiries which will include visiting business in the area canvassing for CCTV footage."</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's family said they wished to acknowledge Nelson Hospital, the members of the public who came to the assistance of the injured officers, and all of those injured in this incident.</p>
