            <p>Evacuations are under way in parts of Tai Rāwhiti, with police going door to door, as heavy rains and wind continue to lash the district.</p>
        
            <p>An iwi-led response team has encouraged some Te Karaka residents to evacuate due to high levels at the Waipaoa River.</p>
        
            <p>Pimia Wehi says about 70 people have evacuated to Te Karaka Area school, and another 80 residents have told them they have evacuated to marae.</p>
        
            <p>She says the river level is currently at 8.2 metres, and when it reaches 9m, sirens will sound which will signal the whole community to evacuate to the school.</p>
        
            <p>In Hawke's Bay, police are knocking on doors and evacuating residents in Haumoana due to costal inundation.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence has declared a state of emergency in the Heretaunga Ward in Hastings District, as the region is also battered with heavy rain.</p>
