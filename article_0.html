            <p>Bad weather put a dampener on some celebrations, but thousands of people around the country still came together to ring in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, large numbers gathered along the waterfront as the skyline was lit up with a five-minute fireworks display from the Sky Tower.</p>
        
            <p>The city's Harbour Bridge was also lit up.</p>
        
            <p>Aaron and Mary were among the crowds keen to watch the city's New Year spectacle.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in town for four nights, just about to celebrate our New Years, it's our 20th wedding anniversary so we're going to have a good time, we've got a live town, fireworks, people watching," Aaron said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to be sitting up there just watching all the excitement unfold," Mary added.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of other people gathered on Auckland's maunga to get a view of the fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>Parasol and Swing venue manager Jonny Park said their rooftop bar on Quay Street in Auckland was looking forward to a busy few hours beyond midnight.</p>
        
            <p>"Seems to be a lot less people that have gone away, but yeah it's always a really busy night, so we don't do a heap of bookings later on because we like to kind of leave ourselves open for people to rock up," he said.</p>

            <p>In Wellington, a street carnival was held in Courtenay Place with traffic blocked off. It was organised by a group of hospitality owners seeking to revive the area amid tough economic conditions.</p>
        
            <p>But in Christchurch, wet weather forced the council to cancel its New Year's Eve celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Large celebrations were held at both the Rhythm and Vines Festival in Gisborne, and at Rhythm and Alps in Wānaka, where thousands have gathered over the past few days.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers of Rhythm and Vines Festival were defending a $5 fee for optional pre-driving breath testing.</p>
        
            <p>The three-day festival, which attracted more than 26,000 people, ends Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, festival organisers shared a checklist for people leaving the festival, promoting a breath-testing service aimed at encouraging responsible driving. But some people vented their frustration over the cost.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the comments, organisers said a private vendor was offering the service for people who choose to use it.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand is of course among the first countries to see in the New Year.</p>
        
            <p>Much of Asia was the latest time zone to mark the end of 2024.</p>
