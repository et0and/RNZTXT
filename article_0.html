            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will formally apologise at Parliament today.</p>
        
            <p>The apology, to those who experienced abuse in state and faith-based care, has been a long time coming for many survivors.</p>
        
            <p>Many will be on hand to hear it in person, though not everyone could make it and not all are happy about how it will play out.</p>
