        <h2>Protesters target Health Minister over Dunedin hospital plan</h2>
        <p>
They blocked Simeon Brown's exit, chanting "build it once, build it right" and "public health, not private wealth".
</p>
        
            <p>The health minister was confronted on Friday by noisy protesters after his announcement about the new Dunedin Hospital, with one protester hitting his car with their placard.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown said the new $1.8 billion hospital will have 351 beds - 59 fewer than originally proposed, but with capacity to expand to 404 beds over time.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the plan would deliver certainty to the people of Dunedin, within the budget.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 protesters gathered at the site of the announcement, chanting throughout.</p>
        
            <p>As Brown left, protesters blocked his exit, yelling at his car, accusing him of lying, and chanting "build it once, build it right", as well as "public health, not private wealth".</p>
        
            <p>Protesters were moved back by police.</p>

            <p>Last year, a government-commissioned report found plans for the long-awaited hospital could not be delivered within the $1.2 billion-$1.4 billion budget set in 2017. It projected the costs would balloon to $3b, a figure the coalition described as unaffordable.</p>
        
            <p>The current hospital had 367 beds, according to a Te Whatu Ora document from 2023.</p>
