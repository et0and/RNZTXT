            <p>Landlords will once again be able to claim tax deductions for interest on residential investment property from the start of next month, David Seymour says.</p>
        
            <p>The policy was promised among tax reforms announced by the new coalition government late last year.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour, the leader of the ACT Party and the Associate Minister of Finance, said the change would benefit both landlords and renters.</p>
        
            <p>"The government's restoration of interest deductibility will ease pressure on rents and simplify the tax code," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The move has been hotly debated, with some critics claiming renters are unlikely to see any benefits.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Party finance spokesperson Barbara Edmonds said instead it would make it more difficult for first-home buyers to get out of rentals and into the market.</p>

            <p>The change will take effect from 1 April, when landlords would be able to claim 80 percent of their interest expenses against tax, and would be increased to 100 percent, from 1 April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Landlords have been hit with a double whammy of rising mortgage interest rates and increasing interest deductibility limitations during a cost-of-living crisis. These costs are inevitably passed on to tenants, one of the reasons New Zealand has all time high rental costs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This heaped pressure on landlords and renters alike by reducing the number of rentals, pushing rents up, and making it harder for Kiwis to save for their first home."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand needed to create to encourage investment and development, and this policy would help, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Competition helps keep prices affordable. Reducing supply reduces the number of options and drives up prices. Removing the ability for landlords to claim interest expenses made residential properties less attractive and reduced the pool of properties for tenants to choose from.</p>
        
            <p>The government had earlier said the planned mortgage interest tax deductions would be backdated, so that 60 percent of interest from 2023 could be claimed.</p>
        
            <p>The Council of Trade Unions estimated last year that with this included, the policy would cost the government $3b over four years.</p>
        
            <p>CTU policy director Craig Renney said it was doubtful the change would benefit renters, and that it amounted to the government cutting a cheque to landlords at the cost of taxpayers.</p>
        
            <p>Renters United spokesperson Geordie Rogers also told RNZ last year that the changes were unlikely to benefit renters, and it would have been more helpful to provide incentives that would encourage more houses to be built.</p>
        
            <p>However, CoreLogic's Kelvin Davidson said the change would make keeping a property more affordable, slow the rise of rents and increase the supply of rentals.</p>
        
            <p>The Property Investors Federation said earlier that rental property owners were facing financial difficulties and "tax deductibility which is a normal business way of operating."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said the changes would be made to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently before a select committee.</p>
