            <p>Police are searching hospitals and schools across the country after threats were made against a number of organisations in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>They are searching Wellington and Bowen Hospital in the Capital and Burwood Hospital in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands police have also been at Auckland City Hospital and Saint Kentigern College says on its website that it was evacuating.</p>
        
            <p>High school students are currently undertaking NCEA exams.</p>

            <p>NZQA deputy chief executive of assessment Jann Marshall said the safety of students and staff was a top priority.</p>
        
            <p>"Each school has its own processes for handling a security lockdown, and these apply during the exam period.</p>
        
            <p>"Students who are unable to sit an exam, or whose performance is impaired because of a security incident, can apply for a derived grade, or their school may apply for derived grades at scale to apply."</p>
        
            <p>PPTA acting president Chris Abercrombie said the primary concern of schools would be ensuring the safety of staff and students.</p>
        
            <p>Police said staff were working with those impacted and would respond based on individual circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"Police acknowledge how unsettling these emails are for all concerned. We'd like to thank all involved for their cooperation as we investigate these emails."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora's national director for hospital and specialist services Fionnagh Dougan confirmed some hospitals received an "email of concern" earlier today.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] was immediately referred to police for further investigation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff have followed police advice and we are remaining vigilant. Our hospital sites have remained open and all services are continuing.</p>
        
            <p>"Members of the public with appointments at our hospitals or needing emergency treatment should be assured it is safe to attend their local hospital as usual."</p>
        
            <p>On 26 July 2022, some North Island schools went into lockdown and moved students off site after receiving phone threats.</p>
        
            <p>Threats were made to five schools in Waikato, Thames Coromandel and Gisborne districts, police said.</p>
        
            <p>No specific risk was ever found.</p>
        
            <p>The next day, bomb threats were made to four schools and at least a dozen the next, causing widespread disruption with many of the schools having to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>The Principals' Federation said those threats originated from an overseas cyberbot.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
