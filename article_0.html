            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman has pleaded guilty to shoplifting charges in Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's first appearance was brought forward to Wednesday after it was delayed twice before and pushed to 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old former politician faced four shoplifting charges for separate incidents at stores in Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>She was charged with stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx Store on 22 October and a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket on 22 December.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with two counts of shoplifting from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby - $5773 of items on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>The 21 December charge originally related to more than $7200 of items, but the amount was downgraded in court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman stood quietly in the dock of Auckland District Court, dressed all in black.</p>
        
            <p>Annabel Cresswell, Ghahraman's lawyer, entered guilty pleas to the charges on her behalf.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman has been remanded at large and will be sentenced in June.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years.</p>

            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement in January, she said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character. I am not trying to excuse my actions, but I do want to explain them".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
