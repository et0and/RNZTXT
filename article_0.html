        <h2>Wind gust made Bluebridge ferry hit wharf</h2>
        <p>
Bluebridge's Connemara ferry hit the Picton wharf while berthing.
</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge's Connemara ferry hit and damaged fendering on Waitohi Wharf in Picton while berthing on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Port Marlborough engineers and workshop team have resolved the issue while the troubled vessel waited, anchored in Queen Charlotte Sound.</p>
        
            <p>Picton Harbourmaster Jake Oliver earlier confirmed he had been made aware that a Bluebridge ferry had "made contact" with the wharf and was currently being fixed.</p>
        
            <p>StraitNZ Bluebridge spokesperson Will Dady said a strong wind gust caused the Connemara to make contact with fendering (cushioning to prevent a boat being damaged if it makes contact with a dock) on the Picton wharf on Tuesday morning.</p>

            <p>There was no damage to the ship but a fender attached to the wharf needed repairs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The ship was delayed from berthing while the repairs were done, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dady apologised to passengers on board for the inconvenience.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a man told RNZ his partner was on board the ferry, which had headed back into the Queen Charlotte Sound after trying to dock.</p>

            <p>He said the fender chain appeared to have broken when the ferry tried to dock.</p>
        
            <p>Another person who said they were onboard at the time posted on social media that the ship had backed into the wharf.</p>
        
            <p>Marine tracking websites also showed the Connemara in the Queen Charlotte Sound.</p>
        
            <p>In September, the Connemara lost power during a late night sailing and had to be towed back to Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest in a series of disruptions, delays and issues with the country's ferries.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a strong wind watch for both Marlborough and Wellington, with a chance of northwest winds approaching a severe gale in exposed places. The warning was in place in Marlborough from 1pm to 9pm, and from 2pm to midnight in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said winds had been picking up in the Cook Strait for the past few hours. She said wind speeds had reached an average of 55km/h in the Marlborough region and an average of 95km/h near Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Strong winds would persist for the rest of Tuesday, she said.</p>
