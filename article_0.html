        <h2>Defence job cuts turn up heat on Luxon's last day in India</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister hit back at criticisms of his coalition's investment in defence as he stood aboard HMNZS Te Kaha, docked in Mumbai.

            <p>After using his India trip to tout the importance of security, Christopher Luxon has spent his last day in Mumbai facing questions about defence job cuts at home.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister hit back at criticisms of his coalition's investment in defence as he stood aboard HMNZS Te Kaha, docked in Mumbai, overnight Thursday NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, Luxon also met India's rear admiral and toured one of its navy vessels. As well, he attended a cricketing panel and hit a few balls at Wankhede Stadium.</p>

            <p>He is now winging his way back to New Zealand on the Defence Force 757, after declaring his four days on the ground a great success.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters, Luxon said the proposed job cuts were an "operational decision" for defence.</p>
        
            <p>"To be clear, it's up to the military forces to determine the best deployment of their resources, as it is for every government agency.</p>
        
            <p>"If they think there's...a better way of delivering the results they want to deliver, it's up to them."</p>

            <p>Luxon rejected any suggestion the restructure was driven by inadequate investment.</p>
        
            <p>"We've put more money in at the last Budget, and we're planning to step up our commitment yet again in the coming Budget as well."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand currently spends about one percent of its GDP on defence.</p>
        
            <p>But the coalition has signalled a significant boost to be revealed in its long-delayed Defence Capability Plan due in the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Defence has been a key strand of Luxon's trip to India, featuring in his talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and his keynote speech at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association on Thursday revealed plans for a Defence Force restructure intended to reduce the civilian workforce by 374 roles.</p>

            <p>A Defence Force spokesperson said the overall headcount would drop by only about 80 given the number of positions already vacant and the new ones being created.</p>
        
            <p>But Labour defence spokesperson Peeni Henare said there was no doubt the job would be made harder for those in uniform.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really a reflection of the much-vaunted talk that National gives with respect to defence, but simultaneously they seem to be stripping it to its bare bones."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon rejected that: "I'd just say we increased defence spending last Budget and we've got a new Budget coming."</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister is due back in New Zealand in the early hours of Saturday.</p>
