        <h2>Watch: Shane Jones willing to share 'shot of tequila' with Mexican Ambassador</h2>
        <p>
However, the Minister is refusing to say if he agrees with his party leader backtracking on Jones' "send the Mexicans home" comment.
</p>
        
            <p>Shane Jones says he hopes to meet with Mexico's Ambassador to New Zealand, after the ambassador raised Jones' "send the Mexicans home" comment with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
        
            <p>The ambassador's involvement led to Jones' party leader Winston Peters acknowledging the MP could have expressed himself differently.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones is refusing to say whether he agrees or disagrees with Peters' rebuke.</p>
        
            <p>Jones' outburst in the House on Tuesday led to Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March writing to the speaker, as well as condemnation from New Zealand's Latin American community.</p>
        
            <p>The ambassador, Alfredo Perez Bravo, told RNZ he was pursuing the matter through diplomatic channels.</p>
        
            <p>Despite initially backing his colleague's comments, Peters backed down after being made aware of the ambassador's concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"In the heat of the moment in the robust environment of Parliament, sometimes some members say things when provoked that, on reflection, may have been expressed differently," a spokesperson for Peters said.</p>
        
            <p>On Morning Report, Jones repeatedly declined to address his comments, saying Peters had addressed the matter as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the leader of New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>But speaking to media on Friday after releasing the government's minerals strategy, Jones brushed the comments off.</p>
        
            <p>"I bear no malice to any Latin American, I've had some of the most exciting nocturnal experiences with the Latin American people," he said.</p>

            <p>Standing behind Jones, Coromandel MP Scott Simpson raised his eyebrows.</p>
        
            <p>Jones was later asked whether he had been "gagged" by Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, we're here today about minerals," Jones replied.</p>
        
            <p>"I was surprised, actually, how one colourful remark in Parliament has gathered such traction. But know this from me, these Green five-minute wonders, they'll think twice before taking on the matua again."</p>
        
            <p>Jones would not say whether he disagreed with Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"No, that would end up shortening my life," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Winston has addressed this issue as the rangatira of our party, and that's all I say on the matter."</p>
        
            <p>In his statement on Thursday, Peters said he was looking forward to seeing the ambassador at Waitangi next week to discuss the matter.</p>
        
            <p>Jones also said he hoped to see the ambassador.</p>
        
            <p>"In the event I see the Mexican ambassador, who's a valued member of the diplomatic community, I'll share a shot of tequila."</p>
