            <p>The 78-year-old had served as mayor of the supercity since October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He would be making a speech to announce he is running for a second term mayor at 4pm at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron on Auckland's waterfront, his campaign manager confirmed to RNZ.</p>

            <p>Kerrin Leoni was the only Auckland councillor to put her name forward for the city's top job so far and would be running as an independent candidate.</p>
        
            <p>It was also speculated Brown's own deputy Desley Simpson could challenge him for the job after the domain name, "DesleyforMayor.co.nz'' was registered by Desley Simpson's son in December.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ last month she had "not yet made a decision about what I intend to do this year".</p>
