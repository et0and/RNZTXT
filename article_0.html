            <p>Christmas Eve has been the busiest shopping day of the year with 10,408 sales a minute at its peak.</p>
        
            <p>Payments company Worldline said 12pm to 1pm saw 607,299 sales recorded on its network.</p>
        
            <p>The company's network covers about three-quarters of the electronic terminals in operation.</p>
        
            <p>Worldline did not have a dollar value for spending, but the peak number of transactions is the lowest of the past six years and well shy of the record 679,436 in 2019, before the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month it noted an increase in sales in the first two weeks of December on a year ago, but said sales varied between regions.</p>
        
            <p>It said then consumer spending in core retail merchants, which excluded hospitality, reached $1.65b, a rise of 1.2 percent on the same period in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Official data from Stats NZ to the end of November showed flat spending for the month, and a fall of 2.3 percent for the year.</p>
        
            <p>Retail spending has been subdued as households have remained cautious because of high prices and interest rates, and fears of a worsening labour market.</p>
        
            <p>However, recent surveys have shown improving consumer sentiment with ANZ bank's monthly report turning optimistic for the first time in three years.</p>
        
            <p>Boxing Day is expected to remain the country's favourite shopping day this year despite a big Black Friday spend, with Worldline expecting some numbers to be available on Friday.</p>
