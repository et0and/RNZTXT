            <p>The first official day of the 2024 Olympic Games has begun in Paris, following a colourful opening ceremony on the banks of the River Seine.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather has narrowly missed out on winning New Zealand's first medal at the Paris Olympics after finishing fourth in the women's 400-metre freestyle final.</p>
        
            <p>Fairweather was aiming to become the first New Zealand woman in 72 years to win an Olympic medal in the pool.</p>
        
            <p>In a high-profile final, she was beaten home by Australian Ariarne Titmus, who won gold from Canadian Summer McIntosh, with American great Katie Ledecky third.</p>
        
            <p>The schedule for the first day is jam-packed, with New Zealand athletes competing in sports as varied as equestrian dressage, canoe slalom, surfing, rugby sevens and freestyle swimming.</p>
