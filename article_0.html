        <h2>Live: Luxon faces questions at post-Cabinet conference</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister speaks after Cabinet's meeting, as the government faces backlash over landlord tax changes and the removal of climate change from its transport policy.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will speak to media shortly at his regular 4pm post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has faced backlash after restoring the ability for landlords to claim tax deductions for interest on residential investment property from 1 April.</p>
        
            <p>While the government and property investors have said this would ease pressure in the rental markets, opposition parties were sceptical the savings would be passed on to tenants.</p>
