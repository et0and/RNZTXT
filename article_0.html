        <h2>Live: Power cuts, ferries cancelled as intense rain lashes Auckland</h2>
        <p>
All Harbour ferries have been halted, and a car has crashed on the Harbour Bridge as heavy rain hits the north. Audio

            <p>Heavy rain is hitting Auckland and other parts of the upper North Island during today's school and work commute.</p>
        
            <p>The Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Waikato, Northland and the top of the South Island also have MetService weather warnings and watches in place for Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Officials across the top of the South Island and the West Coast were also monitoring heavy rainfall into the night - brought to our shores by a deep low crossing the Tasman Sea.</p>
