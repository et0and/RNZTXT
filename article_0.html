            <p>Water Safety New Zealand believes the government is turning a blind eye to drownings and is calling for more lessons in schools.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, 90 people died in preventable drownings - well above the 10-year average of 82.</p>
        
            <p>Water Safety chief executive Daniel Gerrard said a quarter of New Zealand children were not learning basic lifesaving water skills, such as floating on their back.</p>
        
            <p>He had been asking to meet with the ministers of sport, health, education, ACC and transport on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"Regrettably, my attempts have been met with silence - an outcome that is both surprising and deeply concerning."</p>
        
            <p>Getting water safety lessons into schools could help to lower the number of deaths by drowning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's getting into our schools and supporting teachers to deliver basic aquatic skills.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, that is not [teaching them how] to swim. This is [about] floating, moving through the water - really basic stuff that, supported properly, teachers can do."</p>
        
            <p>Gerrard said deaths by drowning were a public health issue, but so far, the ministers had been absent.</p>
        
            <p>"We just need the opportunity to put this in front of the ministers.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not an expensive fix. There's a lot that can be done, and is already going on.</p>
        
            <p>"We just need an opportunity to put it on their radar."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would cost $100 for a child to receive 10 lessons in a year, which would dramatically reduce drowning deaths.</p>
