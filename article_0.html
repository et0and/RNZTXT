        <h2>Live: Luxon calls Wellington's councils 'pretty lame-o'</h2>
        <p>
It comes after the region failed to put in a bid for an infrastructure deal. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister says "it's pretty lame-o" Wellington councils didn't submit a regional funding deal to be considered by the government.</p>
        
            <p>As part of its plan to boost infrastructure, the government plans to enter into deals with regions to co-ordinate investment.</p>
        
            <p>A deadline was put in place to present a proposal to government by 21 February, but the region didn't put in submission.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty lame-o, is my view of it," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"Here we have a government doing everything it can to make sure that we attract capital to this country, which has been a problem for a long period of time, and you can't even get Wellington councils to submit a regional or city deal."</p>
