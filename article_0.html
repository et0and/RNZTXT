            <p>Minister of Māori Development Tama Potaka says he didn't know about the coalition ruling out the Treaty clause in its RMA reform.</p>
        
            <p>The clause required the principles of the Treaty to be upheld, as is included in the current RMA.</p>
        
            <p>RMA Minister Chris Bishop confirmed on Monday Cabinet had agreed not to include the clause in the coalition's proposed new legislation.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the removed clause, Potaka said it was the "first time" he'd heard about it.</p>
        
            <p>"The first I've heard of it is right now," Potaka told reporters at Parliament on Tuesday morning. "I don't know about that."</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen any formal document in that respect."</p>
        
            <p>Potaka said he was aware the Prime Minister made an announcement on Monday, but he wasn't "deep dark into the room at that stage listening to all of it".</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he was concerned that he wasn't aware about the removed clause, Potaka said he didn't know the context in which the questions were being asked.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't see the stand up and I don't know what Chris Bishop has talked to you about right now."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he didn't remember, or wasn't consulted about the change, Potaka said he wasn't across the specific comment made by Bishop.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Willie Jackson said it's not good enough, and shouldn't have come as a surprise given the coalition had made its intention clear in that area.</p>
        
            <p>"For him to be surprised now is a bit of a shock," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said he needs to do his homework.</p>
        
            <p>"He's the Minister in charge of kaupapa Māori, overseeing legislation right across the spectrum - I'm just very surprised to hear that."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said Māori are being let down by the senior māori minister, who he said isn't doing his job.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly important to have those treaty clauses in."</p>
        
            <p>He said their removal was consistent with the government's "constant attack" on Māori issues.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop was asked about Potaka's comments, but said those questions should be directed at Potaka.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what's in Tama's head. But cabinet has made a decision to not have a generic treaty clause in the RMA."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if Potaka was consulted directly, Bishop said "he's a member of the Cabinet, so..."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop added the new legislation will still recognise Treaty settlements, and Māori rights and interests, despite scrapping the long-standing treaty clause.</p>
        
            <p>He said the government is not interested in a generic treaty clause.</p>
        
            <p>"That is a different issue from the legitimate expectations of Māori that their role in the Resource Management system is recognised and protected.</p>
        
            <p>"We are interested as a government in descriptive clauses that make it really clear for everyone - including iwi Māori and hapū - what their role is in the system, but also what the Crown's role in the system is."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said the problem with generic clauses is they are open ended, and create legal risk.</p>
