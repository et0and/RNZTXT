        <h2>US presidential debate live: Biden and Trump head to head</h2>
        <p>

</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are set to battle it out on the stage in their first debate of the 2024 election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>The debate runs from 1pm to 2.30pm NZT on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the big issues to be discussed are inflation, the economy, immigration, climate change, culture wars and real wars, abortion and the fact that Trump is now the first convicted felon president.</p>
        
            <p>Another big issue this election might just be age.</p>
        
            <p>Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, will be under pressure to display their command of issues and avoid verbal stumbles as they seek a breakout moment in a race that opinion polls show has been deadlocked for months.</p>
