        <h2>'Back to the bad old times': Kelvin Davis' parting shots</h2>
        <p>
The former Labour deputy says his work has been "devastated already in the two weeks" of the new government, and he has some advice for National.

            <p>Senior Labour MP Kelvin Davis is calling time on politics, announcing he will quit Parliament effective from Waitangi Day.</p>
        
            <p>The former Labour deputy leader, who led Māori-Crown Relations, says the prime minister should be attending Waitangi Day for several days and fully engaging with the iwi chairs.</p>
        
            <p>He says he does not want to become bitter - having seen the work he's done already being eroded in the two weeks of the new government, whose policies will take race relations back decades.</p>
        
            <p>Davis was first elected in 2008 and has been a senior figure in the party as deputy leader during the 2017 and 2020 terms.</p>
        
            <p>He was also Minister of Corrections, Children, Māori Education, Māori Crown relations and Tourism.</p>
        
            <p>In the lead-up to the election, Davis indicated he would quit politics if he lost his Te Tai Tokerau seat, saying he would have lost his mandate.</p>
        
            <p>Davis was defeated by Te Pāti Māori in Te Tai Tokerau in October, but stayed on as a list MP.</p>
        
            <p>He said in November ACT's proposal for a referendum on the Treaty of Waitangi had motivated him to stay, but this week he told his caucus his time was up.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been an honour and a privilege to be a member of Parliament in the first instance and to be a member of Te Tai Tokerau, but also to be a minister - that's where real change happens - and I'm proud of the legacy that I helped to create in Māori-Crown relations."</p>
        
            <p>He said that legacy had, however, been "devastated already in the two weeks that this government has been in place".</p>
        
            <p>"They need to realise that their policies are really going to hurt Māori, they set race relations, I think, back to the 1970s at the very least.</p>
        
            <p>Davis is moving to a new consulting role with indigenous peoples in Australia. He said it was time for him to start thinking about himself.</p>
        
            <p>"There's little you can do from opposition other than get angry and frustrated and, you know, I need to start thinking about my myself - my family and my grand daughter, now - and look at opportunities to be able to be a father and husband and a grandfather.</p>
        
            <p>"I just didn't want to be this bitter, angry person. And once I leave here I'll just, I'll walk out the door - and it's the people who are left here to the job, to fight the good fight."</p>
        
            <p>He laid down a challenge to the new government and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, saying they needed to properly engage with Māori - particularly at Waitangi - but he was not hopeful that would happen.</p>
        
            <p>"He should be there to front the iwi chairs forum, I think, on the Friday before Waitangi Day. He should be there for the pōwhiri. His ministers should be down there at the forum tents, they should be talking about their policies ... they should be there on Waitangi Day itself - at the dawn service, the karakia, and they should be also feeding the people like we did.</p>
        
            <p>"They won't be popular, they will be challenged, but they still need to do it.</p>
        
            <p>"I say to all the parties: we are not what's important. Te Tiriti is what is important. For two hours of the year, let's just put aside our differences and be adults and go on, and the purpose of the pōwhiri is just to say 'welcome to Waitangi, now go out and meet the people'. It's not Waitangi Day itself."</p>
        
            <p>He reflected on the changes made in that space in his time in government, saying he expected the lack of protest at the event across the six years of the Labour government was likely to change.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government would spend four or five days up in the north engaging with people on the ground ... but also ministers spending a lot of time across that Te Tii marae and the forum tents talking about our policies and engaging with Māori at that level.</p>
        
            <p>"And that to be honest, was the greatest thing that we've done at Waitangi, was just to humble ourselves as ministers, as the prime minister and engage face to face with the people - just handing out bacon, eggs, sausages and things like that."</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Peeni Henare told Morning Report he was sad to see his colleague go.</p>
        
            <p>"[He's] somebody who's been a consistent feature of my entire political career, nine years in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"He's been a strong leader for the Māori caucus in particular. And if I think of the times with Prime Minister Ardern, Kelvin was the perfect offsider for her because he provided the kind of stability within the party and was a great representative for our country."</p>
        
            <p>Reflecting on Labour's loss of most of the Māori seats, Henare said it was a "hugely disappointing election".</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear our people wanted change. I do think that there was quite a, an impressive strategy employed by the Māori Party that really mobilized the vote for Māoridom but that doesn't detract from the fact that ... Kelvin did a great job in his service and made clear that without the mandate, he chooses not to continue."</p>
        
            <p>Davis will be replaced by the next person on Labour's list, Tracey McLellan.</p>
