            <p>A prospective first-home buyer says he is gutted the government has scrapped the First Homes Grants scheme, and fears he'll now miss out on the house he was looking at.</p>
        
            <p>The government yesterday confirmed it was ending the initiative, with applications closing at 1pm - 30 minutes before the announcement was made.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme paid out grants of $5000 for an existing home - or $10,000 for a new-build - to first-home buyers whose income was less than $95,000, or $150,000 as a household.</p>
        
            <p>Jaie, a Taupō-based quarry manager, had been preparing to purchase his first home with his partner.</p>
        
            <p>He was planning to apply for a $5000 First Home Grant after he finished work at 3pm yesterday afternoon, but discovered that was no longer possible during his lunch break.</p>
        
            <p>"I was on the internet... just getting all my paperwork in line and I popped onto the website just to double check I've got everything, as I was going to apply for it... after work.</p>
        
            <p>"I read that from one o'clock... there is no more applications accepted," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>He described the loss of the grant as "quite gutting".</p>
        
            <p>"It sets you back. It takes a long time to get here and you're right there get all excited and then you get a bit of a blow."</p>
        
            <p>Jaie and his partner had been hoping to put in an offer on a Taupō property he said was "ideal" for their needs.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got the deposit and everything... the grant would have helped us reach that deposit but yeah, it's caught us off guard a bit.</p>
        
            <p>"We had no warning ourselves... I got onto my mortgage broker straightaway and told her and she's like 'what?' And then she looked it up and she's like, 'yes, you're right'."</p>
        
            <p>There was now a "big chance" they could miss out on the house, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Housing Minister Chris Bishop confirmed on Wednesday the grant would be scrapped. The government was retaining the First Home Loan scheme, which Bishop said evidence showed was a more effective way of supporting first home buyers.</p>
        
            <p>He also announced 1500 new social housing places from July next year, to be provided through community housing providers.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who RNZ is calling Sam used the grant to purchase a two-bedroom unit in 2020 and told RNZ she would not have been able to afford her home without the support.</p>
        
            <p>"I really needed the grant. I had quite a low deposit and I was lucky enough to work with a really good mortgage broker who got me pre approval for a deposit just under 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Living in a small town in New Zealand I was able to scrape in and buy a two bedroom unit in early 2020. I was absolutely panicking at the time because it was just before we went into lockdown, but turns out it was perfect timing," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Without the grant, Sam said, she would have been "no doubt... locked out of the market."</p>
        
            <p>"That [the grant] was really what pushed me over the line with having that semi-decent deposit. It was just me and I was on a single income and I have no family help, so I really, really was reliant on that."</p>
