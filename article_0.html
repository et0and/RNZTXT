            <p>Police had relentlessly attempted to "crack" Shargin Stephens by bail-checking him several times a day, a witness revealed in the inquest into his death.</p>
        
            <p>Stephens, a 35-year-old MƒÅori man, was shot dead by police in Rotorua in 2016 after vandalising an empty patrol car with a weed slasher.</p>
        
            <p>In the 38 days before his death, he was bail-checked by police 70 times, sometimes in the middle of the night, while he was also being electronically monitored.</p>
        
            <p>During the second day of the inquiry into the circumstances of his death, a witness who spent Stephens' final day with him gave an emotional statement at the Coroner's Court in Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>The man, under name suppression, appeared via video call. He was emotional and kept his head down during most of his testimony.</p>
        
            <p>He stated that Stephens only wanted to go to work because that was where he felt free and safe from police harassment.</p>
        
            <p>"[He was being] constantly harassed, the day before [the day of his death], and the day before [that], and all he wanted to do was go to work.</p>
        
            <p>"Because that's the only place he could be free, at work, you know? [With] no one harassing him."</p>
        
            <p>In his statement, read out by police counsel Amanda Gordon, the witness said Stephens was trying to turn his life around, but excessive police checks were hindering him.</p>
        
            <p>"It is true that Shargin thought police were tormenting him, [and] I agree with this. [The police] were always at him when he was on bail. They knew it was a way of getting at him.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it was a game the cops played with [Stephens]. They would keep the pressure on until he'd cracked, then they would lock him up.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought it was what [the police] must have enjoyed, like a game to them," the statement read.</p>
        
            <p>Another witness at the inquest stated that every second day there were midnight bail checks, and they could see him getting on-edge.</p>
        
            <p>"[Stephens] tried his best not to let the number of bail checks bother him, but it was, you could see the pressure building."</p>
        
            <p>They said police would purposely park in front of Stephen's house to "bother him".</p>
        
            <p>"The [police] wagon was just parked up across the road from [his] house, and this used to bother Shargin.</p>
        
            <p>"He would say to me 'Are they just trying to set me up by parking out there and making me look bad to everyone?"</p>
        
            <p>They said Stephens had his problems with the police, but he was a good man.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is fair to say that Shargin did not like [the] police, but he knew that when he screwed up, he had to deal with them.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot accept that all those bail checks needed to happen. They were just used as a punishment, a way to get at Shargin.</p>
        
            <p>"I want the police to tell the truth about all the extra bail checks they did, all the harassment of Shargin in the weeks leading up to him being shot.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the loss of Stephens should be used as a reason to review police standard responses.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing we can do to bring Shargin back, but I would hate to think that Shargin being shot is something that could happen again.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'd hate to think] that no lesson has been learned at all, that nothing went wrong, that there is nothing else that could have happened."</p>
        
            <p>The trial will resume tomorrow with the police officer involved in the shooting set to give his statement to Coroner Michael Robb.</p>
