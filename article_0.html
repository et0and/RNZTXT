        <h2>The year in politics, month-by-month</h2>
        <p>
It's been a long year in politics - James Shaw was still leading the Greens in February - remember that?

            <p>The coalition government's first year in power has caused nationwide mobilisation of Māori and an unprecedented protest arrive at Parliament, huge swathes of legislation repealed and introduced, crackdowns on crime and beneficiaries, some stern words to local councils, and a new Minister for Rail.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition parties have had their own ups and downs, including various complaints to the Privileges Committee, plenty of attacks, and some cross-party wins.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a snapshot of party politics in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The political year kicked off with news former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman had resigned from Parliament after being accused of shoplifting. She was later convicted of shoplifting and fined, and an appeal to be discharged without conviction failed.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's James Shaw announced he would step down as co-leader in March, after nearly 9 years in the role.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis told the public sector to get slashing, asking all departments to identify savings of either 6.5 or 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>January also saw the first of a series of Hui-aa-motu, hosted by the Kiingitanga at Tuurangawaewae. Around 10,000 people gathered to answer the former Māori King's call to attend a national hui for unity. It was organised as a response to coalition policies - including the Treaty Principles Bill. Kiingi Tuheitia called for a way forward that "brings kotahitanga to all of Aotearoa."</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuheitia's intention was to carry on those discussions at Rātana and Waitangi commemorations. Just days after the nationwide hui, political leaders headed to Rātana Pā where those gathered were able to directly challenge coalition policies affecting Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Waitangi commemorations saw Māori and non-Māori gather in force over a number of days, including the Kiingitanga, who carried on the call for kotahitanga. Different forms of protest occurred, with veteran activist Tāme Iti leading a hīkoi, and a group gathered for the government pōwhiri holding Te Tiriti o Waitangi shaped signs. Later they interrupted speeches on the paepae. The coalition was challenged again in relation to the government's impact on Māori, including specifically the Treaty Principles bill.</p>
        
            <p>February also saw the government move under urgency to repeal a number of Labour policies, including Three Waters, the Māori Health Authority, and legislation that would create a smokefree generation.</p>
        
            <p>Smokefree Minister Casey Costello ran into trouble - after telling RNZ she had not specifically asked for advice from officials on freezing tobacco tax - despite having asked for advice from officials on freezing tobacco tax.</p>
        
            <p>The opposition parties were going through some changes, with Chlöe Swarbrick making a bid for the Green Party co-leadership position, and then news Grant Robertson would retire from politics after being an MP for 15 years to take up a role as the Vice Chancellor of Otago University. The Greens were also rocked by the shock death of their former colleague, Fa'anana Efeso Collins.</p>
        
            <p>Discovery announced a proposal to shut down its Newshub operation in June - ending it's broadcast and digital news offerings. This would signal the start of significant changes for New Zealand's television news networks.</p>
        
            <p>The first day of March saw the Prime Minister walk back a decision on claiming an accommodation allowance. It had been revealed he was claiming a thousand dollars a week to live in his own mortage-free Wellington apartment, while his official residence - Premier House - sat empty. Luxon also experienced plane trouble for the second time in the top job, while trying to fly to Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick was confirmed as the Greens new co-leader, and backbencher Darleen Tana was stood down following allegations of migrant exploitation surrounding her husband's business. Labour attempted to start fresh, with leader Chris Hipkins saying tax is back on the table, and NZ First leader Winston Peters made headlines for comparing co-governance with Nazi Germany's race-based theories.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ was next to propose job losses, due to structural challenges within the sector. Former Minister Melissa Lee fronted after criticism of how she handled the news of Newshub's potential demise. Former Minister Penny Simmonds also came under fire after she directed the Disability Ministry to place new limits on funding.</p>
        
            <p>In April, there was confirmation Newshub would cease to exist, and cuts at TVNZ would see the end of Sunday and Fair Go.</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister announced a Cabinet reshuffle that saw Melissa Lee booted from Cabinet, losing the Media portfolio, and Penny Simmonds losing the Disability Issues portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>And the Remuneration Authority ruled politicians should get a pay rise - the first since 2020. Luxon said he'd donate his 50k bump to charity.</p>
        
            <p>More trouble for the Greens after MP Julie-Anne Genter was sent to the Privileges committee after she crossed the floor to berate Minister Matt Doocey. She was later found in contempt.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Mitchell was forced again to correct the record, the first in January over a coalition promise, this time over prison beds. And the [ttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/516157/he-got-it-mixed-up-pm-backs-corrections-minister-despite-announcement-muddle Prime Minister was made to back him up - again.]</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour announced the coalition's plans to overhaul the school lunch programme, which the government says will save more than $130 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>National MP David McLeod was stood down for failing to declare $178,394 in donations. That was later referred to police, who decided not to take any action following an investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition also delivered their first Budget - keeping National's tax cuts but without delivering another key election promise: to fund cancer medicines. They backtracked, later providing a large funding boost to Pharmac.</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Marama Davidson announced in June she had breast cancer, taking leave to undergo treatment and surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori found itself under scrutiny - over claims a marae misused census data to help the party's election campaign, leading to an independent inquiry by the Public Service Commission. The findings of that inquiry were due at the end of the year, then delayed till January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon headed overseas again, where he had to defend comments he'd made on Newstalk ZB calling past business delegations 'c-listers.</p>
        
            <p>New Minister for Media and Communications Paul Goldsmith came out in support of a Labour policy National had previously been opposed to. The bill would force tech giants to pay news organisations for their content. The ACT party invoked the 'agree to disagree' provision of the coalition agreement, choosing not to support the Bill.</p>
        
            <p>That bill is now on hold until the government can evaluate how it's playing out in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston failed to show up this month to the first reading of one of her own pieces of legislation in Parliament, causing the Bill to be discharged.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party's independent investigation into Darleen Tana - what she knew about accusations against her husband and when - finally wrapped up, after the MP was suspended with full pay since March. Tana resigned from the Green Party, but the Greens wanted her to leave Parliament entirely.</p>
        
            <p>[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/521595/former-green-mp-darleen-tana-speaks-out-on-allegations-and-plea-to-resign She didn't accept the report and decided to return to Parliament as an Independent MP.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens had to decide whether to eject her from Parliament using the Party Hopping legislation - which the party has previously opposed. They decided to meet later in September to vote on this, but Tana filed an interim junction in August at the Auckland High Court hoping to block the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The country experienced a power crisis - scarcity of gas and a lack of wind and rain sent wholesale power prices sky rocketing. Winstone Pulp International said this month they planned to shut down their mills due to high energy prices, which would cause 230 people to lose their jobs. Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones took aim at the Electricity Authority at the time, saying it needed to "man up" and flex its authority.</p>
        
            <p>Koroneihana - the anniversary of the Māori King's coronation - took place at Tuurangawaewae, and the Kiingitanga took the opportunity to lay out its opposition to the Treaty Principles Bill. Political leaders from across the divide spoke, except for David Seymour who did not attend. Just a week later, Kiingi Tuheitia died following complications after heart surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Over a number of days, people paid their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia - including David Seymour, his first visit to the Waikato marae. His tangi saw tens of thousands of people pass through Tuurangawaewae - the third large gathering this year. The new monarch was announced at the end of the tangi, with Tuheitia's youngest daughter taking the throne - Kuini Ngā wai hono i te po.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing between Darleen Tana and the Green Party was held in the Auckland High Court, and Tana ultimately lost the legal battle. She did however succeed in delaying the Party's vote on her future until October.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition continued their crime crackdown and banned gang patches. Meanwhile, Andrew Coster announced he was leaving the top police job early to head up the government's social investment agency.</p>
        
            <p>And the Prime Minister moved into his official residence now that refurbishments were complete. He also sold up the Wellington apartment he'd been staying in, as well as two other properties in his portfolio. This ignited discussions around capital gains tax policy, and the Prime Minister's wealth.ANZ waded into the discussion too, with the CE saying it was time for a CGT.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens voted - unanimously - to remove Darleen Tana from parliament, despite their former opposition to the law. Former MPs including Kevin Hague and Metiria Turei gave input to the hui.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition waded into local body politics, and appointed a Crown observer to Wellington City Council.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party had their own scandal, with Minister for Small Business Andrew Bayly forced to apologise after a winery worker lodged a formal complaint about his conduct during a visit. The worker claimed Bayly had ridiculed him for working late - repeatedly calling him a loser, holding up the L sign to his forehead, and telling the worker to "take some wine and f*** off."</p>
        
            <p>The government formally apologised to survivors of abuse in state care, after the six-year Royal Commission of Inquiry was tabled in parliament earlier in the year.</p>
        
            <p>November also saw the Treaty Principles Bill at last arrive at Parliament - the legislation coming for its first reading and first debate. Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke took the opportunity to interrupt the vote with a haka in protest.</p>
        
            <p>Just a week later, Hīkoi moo Te Tiriti arrived at Parliament, after making its way across the country. Tens of thousands of people gathered, the biggest hīkoi ever.</p>
        
            <p>A Member's Bill from Green MP Teanau Tuiono passed with unanimous support, restoring citizenship to a group of Samoans.</p>
        
            <p>One year on from the coalition being formed, the coalition leaders fronted to take stock of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Labour did their own stock take, with the party's annual conference in Christchurch where the party decided not to take part in AUKUS.</p>
        
            <p>News broke that a participant of the government's bootcamp pilot had died (while in the community phase). Days later Oranga Tamariki fronted questions from MPs at the second of this year's Scrutiny Weeks, Minister for Children Karen Chourr also scrutinising the agency for not giving her a heads up. Sparks flew between Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall and Health NZ's Commissioner Lester Levy at another select committee.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party tried to end the year positively with an alternative Emissions Reduction Plan, before the government released theirs.</p>
        
            <p>The long-awaited decision on the Cook Strait ferry replacement came around, and Finance Minister Nicola Willis "discharged" her "duty", handing over the rains to newly minted Minister for Rail Winston Peters. Rather than a replacement, they announced a plan to replace the ferries a little later.</p>
        
            <p>Support from across the House saw Greyhound racing banned.</p>
        
            <p>With the House under urgency to get through a range of policies, the coalition celebrated achieving the entire Quarter 4 plan - except for passing legislation to reverse the oil and gas exploration ban. That one will take a little longer due to some drafting errors. One final sitting week, not without protest, with some taking issue in the House at the government's Fast-Track legislation passing into law.</p>
