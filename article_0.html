            <p>A man charged with more than 20 counts of sexual offending against children at the Gloriavale Christian community has been sentenced to 11 years and 10 months' jail.</p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Benjamin's offending spanned about three decades from the 1980s, and his charges related to nine victims at the reclusive community.</p>
        
            <p>A jury last year found him found guilty of 11 charges of sexual offending, and he previously admitted 15 similar charges.</p>
        
            <p>At least one of the victims was aged 12 or younger at the time of the offending.</p>
        
            <p>He had earlier admitted similar charges against five others.</p>
        
            <p>Some victims were brought to tears reading victim impact statements in the Greymouth District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
