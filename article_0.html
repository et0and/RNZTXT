            <p>A vehicle has exploded on a bridge that connects the US and Canada near the Niagara Falls, according to the FBI.</p>
        
            <p>Two people have died at the Canada-US border, according to BBC's US partner CBS.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS that two people died inside the vehicle that exploded at border crossing between New York and Canada.</p>
        
            <p>Sources said that it appears at this point to have been a deliberate act. But no motives or identities have been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The incident took place on the Rainbow Bridge one day before the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, one of the busiest travel days of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"As this situation is fluid, this is all we can say at this time," the FBI said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>According to the city of Niagara Falls, the incident involved a vehicle that was "coming into" the US.</p>
        
            <p>All crossings are currently closed until further notice, officials say.</p>
        
            <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul also confirmed there had been an incident, and said she had been briefed by law enforcement.</p>
        
            <p>"State agencies are on site and ready to assist," she posted on X, formerly Twitter.</p>
        
            <p>"I am travelling to Buffalo to meet with law enforcement and emergency responders and will update New Yorkers when more information becomes available," she added.</p>
        
            <p>The bridge connects Ontario with New York and links the cities of Niagara Falls, US with Niagara Falls, Canada.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the Rainbow Bridge, the incident has led to the closure of three other international border crossings in the region.</p>
        
            <p>The Peace Bridge, Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, Whirlpool Bridge, and Rainbow Bridge are also closed in both directions, officials say.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses told the Niagara Gazette newspaper that they heard what sounded like an explosion and a cloud of smoke shortly before police arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard something smash," one witness said. "We saw fire and big, black smoke."</p>
        
            <p>Canadian officials are receiving "contradictory information" about the incident on the Rainbow Bridge, according to Dominic LeBlanc, the country's Minister of Public Safety.</p>
        
            <p>LeBlanc added that Canada is so far unable to confirm where the car came from.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would be "simply not responsible" to "speculate" on what exactly happened.</p>
        
            <p>"This is obviously a very serious situation," he said, adding that Canadian agencies are doing all they can to ensure the public is safe.</p>
        
            <p>He added that he expects to speak to his US counterparts from the Department of Homeland Security shortly.</p>
        
            <p>Canada is considering "additional measures" to secure border crossings across the country, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Canada's parliament, Trudeau said the extra security steps could be added at "all" of Canada's points of entry.</p>
        
            <p>So far, four crossings - all in the Buffalo area - are closed.</p>
        
            <p>Trudeau said the government would "continue to be engaged" and provide updates.</p>
        
            <p>After the brief update, Trudeau left parliament.</p>
