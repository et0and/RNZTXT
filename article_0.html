            <p>A slow-moving front over the south of the South Island is bringing "significant" snow to Queenstown Lakes, Southland and inland Otago, as well as heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>The latest forecast came after a heavy dump of snow in the South Island on Friday caused power outages, shut schools and closed roads.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy snow warning is in place until 10pm Sunday for the Queenstown Lakes District south of Wanaka and for Southland north of Mossburn and west of Athol.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said to expect 12-18cm of snow to accumulate above 400 metres, warning that further snow was expected on Monday night and into Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy snow was also expected until 5am Monday in Southland, north of Lumsden and from Athol eastwards, as well as inland Otago excluding the Queenstown Lakes District.</p>
        
            <p>In those areas, people could expect 10-20 cm of snow to settle above 400 metres, with lesser amounts down to 300 metres.</p>
        
            <p>The snow could disrupt travel and damage trees and powerlines, and cold conditions may cause stress for livestock, it said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned people to prepare for snow, cold temperatures, and possible power outages.</p>
        
            <p>"If you must travel, drive cautiously, and ensure you have snow chains, sleeping bags, warm clothing, and emergency items."</p>
        
            <p>A number of major routes through alpine passes have road snowfall warnings in place:</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown skiers, however, had been enjoying the latest blast of spring snow.</p>
        
            <p>Ski area manager for The Remarkables Steve Hall said there were more than 1000 people on the skifield on Sunday and the numbers were even higher on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The snow was falling straight down, with light winds, which is ideal, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The snow base there was currently between 55 and 220 centimetres.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, MetService said there was a high risk of thunderstorms for Northland on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and the Coromandel Peninsula might also see thunder and lightning at the start of the week.</p>
        
            <p>There was a low risk the storms would be severe and accompanied by damaging tornadoes, and a watch for severe thunderstorms could be issued for those areas on Monday, MetService said.</p>
