            <p>A friend of two of three people missing on Aoraki Mount Cook says it would help bring closure if local climbers are able to find them.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the police called off the search for Americans Kurt Blair and Carlos Romero and an unnamed Canadian national who have been missing since 2 December.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they believe the men took a fall while climbing around the mountain.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow US climber Patrick Ormond, who lived in Colorado, said knowing what happened would help put the families' and friends' minds at ease.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys basically vanished into thin air... and it's hard to wrap your head around that."</p>
        
            <p>Ormond said there was a slim to none chance the trio would be found after five days, but there was always hope.</p>
        
            <p>"If they had shown up - popped out of a snow cave or something ... [we] didn't figure that was gonna happen.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always a little thought back there, like 'Maybe?' "</p>
        
            <p>The men flew into Plateau Hut at 3.30pm last Saturday, planning to summit the mountain via Zurbriggen Ridge, but failed to meet their flight out.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they would resume the search, however, if the final three weeks of the climbing season turned up any clues.</p>
