            <p>The Commissioner of Health New Zealand insists he knew nothing about an internal staff presentation detailing potential widescale job cuts for frontline healthworkers to save money.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has seen a copy of the presentation about "potential cost savings in hospital and specialist services" to senior leadership on Tuesday, which suggested a total reduction of 4492 staff, including 470 doctors, 1491 nurses, 338 allied staff and more than 2000 managers and admin workers.</p>
        
            <p>In total, that would save more than $700 million.</p>

            <p>However, this proposition apparently came as a surprise to newly appointed Commissioner, Dr Lester Levy, who last night sent an all-staff memo to every Te Whatu Ora employee to "set the record straight" on frontline clinical staff.</p>
        
            <p>"For the avoidance of doubt, what was presented is in direct conflict with our thinking and should be dismissed," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>The Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners Ken Whelan and Roger Jarrold were "absolutely committed to a strong clinical frontline to drive better health outcomes for New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>"The clinical frontline will not be cut or reduced, and our plans are to strengthen it.</p>
        
            <p>"We do of course have a serious financial problem and as part of our reset at Health NZ we need to make sure we live within budget, but not at the expense of the clinical frontline."</p>
