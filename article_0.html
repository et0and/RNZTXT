            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the government has been disappointed in KiwiRail's asset management after Friday's ferry grounding.</p>
        
            <p>The Interislander ferry Aratere ran aground near Picton and will likely stay there till Saturday night at the earliest.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry had been on a freight-only sailing when it suffered a steering failure and crashed about 9.45pm on Friday. No one was injured and there was no environmental damage, KiwiRail said. All passengers have been evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said his understanding was that there was a new piece of equipment that had been recently installed and may not have responded properly.</p>
        
            <p>He said it relates to how the rudders work, but that the KiwiRail, TAIC and Maritime NZ investigations will get to the bottom of it.</p>
        
            <p>"That is my understanding ... they lost the ability to steer the ship."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said ministers have made their expectations clear that KiwiRail must take all the necessary steps to maintain safety and reliability.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail is working on plans to refloat the vessel at hightide on Saturday about 9pm.</p>
