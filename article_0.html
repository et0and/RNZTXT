            <p>The government is introducing new sanctions for those on benefits, including taking five-hour weekly training courses.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement also said job seekers would need to perform a minimum of three job-search activities every week for a month and report back to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).</p>
        
            <p>The new sanctions would ensure there was "accountability in the welfare system", Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important beneficiaries who can work are taking steps to re-enter the workforce," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>"Consequences must exist for those who don't."</p>
        
            <p>The new sanctions are part of the government's beneficiary traffic light system.</p>
        
            <p>The system applies to people who receive a benefit with work or social obligations, such as Jobseeker Support.</p>
        
            <p>They are given a green, orange or red status. Once someone is moved to red, they are sanctioned.</p>
        
            <p>Those sanctioned will have to provide evidence of their activities at the end of their sanction to return to 'green' in the system, Upston said.</p>
