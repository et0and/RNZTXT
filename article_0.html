            <p>The two councillors who lodged a code of conduct complaint against Invercargill mayor Nobby Clark will not comment on his recent apology.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Clark made headlines when he appeared on satirical news show New Zealand Today and repeated a racial slur he had drawn criticism for in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The appearance prompted councillors Ian Pottinger and Ria Bond to lodge a code of conduct complaint against the mayor.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Clark told Stuff he thought he was appearing on a comedy show and apologised to "anybody who felt offended".</p>
        
            <p>Local Democracy Reporting approached Clark after the apology, but he responded he had "no further comment to make".</p>
        
            <p>Both Pottinger and Bond remained tight-lipped also.</p>
        
            <p>Pottinger said he could not comment - not because he did not want to, but because the code of conduct process was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"Things are happening, so that's all I can say."</p>
        
            <p>Bond was also unwilling to talk about the unfolding situation.</p>
        
            <p>"We've still got to follow a process, so I don't really want to comment on it at this stage, including the apology," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Bond said an outside agency had picked up the complaint and was investigating it.</p>
        
            <p>Both councillors were critical of the mayor's television appearance at the time it aired in March, with Pottinger labelling it a "train wreck".</p>
