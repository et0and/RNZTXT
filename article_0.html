            <p>An ambulance officer has broken down in tears describing trying to treat worshippers who needed surgeons, not paramedics, after being shot in the terror attack at Christchurch's Al Noor Mosque.</p>
        
            <p>Craig Stockdale was one of the first St John ambulance officers at the mosque after the mass shooting on 15 March 2019.</p>
        
            <p>He became emotional answering questions about potentially life-saving treatments for injured people in the Deans Avenue mosque, saying they would not be carried out in a mass casualty situation because of the skill and time involved.</p>
        
            <p>"In my heart, I knew, what these people needed was a surgeon, not a paramedic on the periphery trying to help them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They needed a hospital and we as a group, we knew that and that was our sole aim."</p>
        
            <p>Stockdale said the mosque's hallway was "littered" with bodies and paramedics had to step over people to help those who had survived.</p>
        
            <p>The Coroners Court earlier heard a senior policeman watching a delayed feed of the terrorist's livestream of the massacre relayed the information in error in a panicked transmission over police radio.</p>
        
            <p>For a few minutes, police and paramedics at the scene thought the terrorist was returning to the mosque, but they soon realised it was a mistake.</p>
        
            <p>It was one of the times where Stockdale felt the security situation at the scene changed.</p>
        
            <p>Stockdale told the court police at the scene did not tell him the information was incorrect, which was "unsettling".</p>
        
            <p>There was no debrief about the situation and they all "just ploughed on".</p>
        
            <p>Just minutes later at 2.15pm, the first two St John paramedics entered the mosque with an armed police escort to assess the situation.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after, injured survivors began being taken from the mosque, but Stockdale said he "absolutely" still believed the gunman might come back.</p>
        
            <p>He said if he had been told it was a false alarm, it may have reduced his concern.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest will examine the following 10 issues over six weeks:</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
