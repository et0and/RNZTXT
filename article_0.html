            <p>Broadcasting minister Melissa Lee is speaking to RNZ after refusing radio and TV interviews since the announcement of Newshub's closure.</p>
        
            <p>Lee insists she has not been ducking for cover, despite the refusals, and was widely criticised for her initial response last week, with commentators and opposition MPs describing her as glib or "missing in action".</p>
        
            <p>On her way into a National caucus meeting this week, Lee stopped for questions, with colleague Paul Goldsmith standing by her side.</p>
        
            <p>"I have actually fronted up. I haven't been hiding," she told reporters. "I have done a couple of interviews."</p>
        
            <p>Since the announcement, Lee has taken questions from reporters at Parliament on three occasions, including on Tuesday. She also spoke to The Spinoff's Duncan Greive.</p>
        
            <p>Follow the interview via our liveblog:</p>
