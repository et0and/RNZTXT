            <p>Donald Trump is safe and a shooter and bystander dead after multiple shots rang out at a rally by the Republican presidential candidate in Pennsylvania, reports say.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of FBI Pittsburgh field office, said the FBI was not prepared to identify the shooter and did not have a motive for the incident that left one person dead and two injured.</p>
        
            <p>"This evening, we had what we are calling an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. It's still an active crime scene," Rojek said during a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has identified a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man as the suspected shooter at the Trump rally on Saturday, a CNN reporter posted on X citing sources.</p>
        
            <p>The FBI is not releasing the name of the suspected shooter yet, CNN reported. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has now left the area where the shooting occurred, NBC is reporting, but his destination is unclear.</p>
        
            <p>Two spectators were critically injured and are being treated at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple inquiries are underway. The FBI is the lead investigator and its director, Christopher Wray, has briefed US President Joe Biden and the National Security Council.</p>
