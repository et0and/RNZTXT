            <p>It was so close yet so far for Kiwi Hayden Wilde, who has claimed silver in a dramatic triathlon in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>Wilde looked to be cruising to gold, but was pipped on the home stretch by his great rival from Great Britain, Alex Yee.</p>
        
            <p>Yee came out of nowhere to overtake Wilde, who settled for silver and New Zealand's second medal of the games.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Sky Sport, he said it was a nervy finish seeing Yee close in.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked back and there was a gap and he looked composed and I was trying to get composed as well," Wilde says. "It felt good but it was hot, just with obviously the change of time so that might have been a bit of an effect.</p>
        
            <p>"I gave it everything and I can't leave this race with a what if. I'm just stoked for Alex as well, just to finally have an even race, no penalties, nothing, just purely a good foot race, it was exciting."</p>
        
            <p>In sailing in the men's skiff (49er) the crew of Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie sit in first place overall after 11 races.</p>
        
            <p>The women's skiff (49er) of Jo Aleh and Molly Meech are seventh after 12 races, having now qualified for the medal race.</p>
