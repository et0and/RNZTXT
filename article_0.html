        <h2>Kotahitanga in action: Hundreds descend upon Treaty grounds alongside the Kiingitanga and Rātana</h2>
        <p>
As the sun shone over the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on Sunday afternoon, up the hill came two of Māoridom's leading voices, a true sight of kotahitanga.

            <p>As the sun shone over the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on Sunday afternoon, up the hill came two of Māoridom's leading voices, Kiingi Tuuheita and Rātana Tumuaki Manuao, Te Kohamutunga Tamou, bringing with them iwi leaders from across the motu, a true sight of kotahitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Responding to the tono from Ngāpuhi rangatira, the Kiingitanga led hundreds onto the grounds, carrying with them the mauri from hui aa motu.</p>
        
            <p>Many from Tainui iwi travelled up to Paihia in one of the seven buses that the Kiingitanga organised, which left Waikato on Saturday.</p>

            <p>The Kiingitanga typically mark the day on its own whenua, but this year, they arrived in style. The sounds of the Rātana brass band overlapped with the haka of the kaihoe.</p>
        
            <p>As the manuhiri approached the atea the hau kāinga quickly put out more chairs to accommodate what seemed like a never-ending ope.</p>

            <p>Hundreds had come to voice their concerns on the government's proposed Treaty principles bill and what it could mean for this country's founding document.</p>
        
            <p>Whaikōrero is a skill which weaves together whakapapa and kaupapa seamlessly. This pōwhiri was no exception, with all kaikōrero speaking the same message, unity.</p>
        
            <p>Rising to speak on the hau kāinga side, Ngāpuhi Rangatira Matua Hone Sadler acknowledged Kiingi Tuuheitia.</p>

            <p>"Aotearoa is happy that you have returned to Waitangi. We must work together to find the solution to move forward."</p>
        
            <p>"You have brought everyone together, thank you Tuuheitia."</p>
        
            <p>Matua Sadler told iwi māori to be guided by their ancestors.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't fight the negative with the negative. Don't fight the wrongs with the wrongs. Even though we are upset and angry, never meet anger with anger.</p>
        
            <p>"Let us remain peaceful, humble, but don't drop our guard. They will be here to share their thoughts. Let them know our thoughts and our feelings. Let us look for prosperity of unity," Sadler said.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't be soft but talk to them [the government]; we will never stoop to their level," Sadler said.</p>
        
            <p>Bayden Barber of Ngāti Kahungunu also spoke of unity.</p>

            <p>"I think of the 90s when the kotahitanga movement came to my marae and we unified then to take on the government which pushed us to the bottom then and te iwi Māori unified."</p>
        
            <p>"What do we do with this unity? What do we do with this unity that has brought us here as one? We go home and we must keep the strategic planning going. We have come here to fight. We have come here to share thoughts and strategies with you Ngāpuhi on how we move forward. This is a good place to start."</p>
        
            <p>Te Taepa Kameta, a representative of Rātana, criticised NZ First MP and Minister Shane Jones, for his absence at the pōwhiri.</p>

            <p>"Shane [Jones], where are you? For it was you that said we will talk Waitangi at Waitangi, not at Rātana. Here is the Rātana pā to talk Te Tiriti o Waitangi. My friend, Shane. You know that all that we stand for at Rātana is the unity of te iwi Māori."</p>
        
            <p>"To support the talks we must remain peaceful. I acknowledge Shane and Winston. We still love you. But you came to my house and said if you want to talk at Waitangi, let's talk at Waitangi. I am at your house and you are not here."</p>
        
            <p>Last to speak for the manuhiri was Rāhui Papa, a Kiingitanga representative.</p>
        
            <p>"We have spoken, let us unify, let us mobilise under mana motuhake."</p>
        
            <p>He also acknowledged the importance of He Whakaputanga.</p>
        
            <p>"Let us not forget that he whakaputanga must be level with Te Tiriti. "</p>
        
            <p>After his whaikōrero, manuhiri from Tainui came forward in the hundreds to sing in beautiful harmony. A true spectacle on the grounds at which history was made 184 years ago.</p>
