            <p>Fresh off completing the Coalition's 100-day plan, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has laid out a new priority list for the next three months and it includes the delivery of long-promised tax relief.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon last month celebrated the fulfilment of all 49 tasks on his government's initial to-do list, boasting a clean sweep, though a closer analysis delivered a more ambiguous report card.</p>
        
            <p>The new "action plan" - published on Tuesday - includes 36 bullet points to be achieved by 30 June, and, like its predecessor, contains a mix of concrete tasks and more ambiguous easily-achievable objectives.</p>
        
            <p>While 100-day plans have been utilised by numerous former governments, the notion of an ongoing public quarterly programme was much less common but in keeping with Luxon's self-professed CEO-style.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a clear plan with specific actions and timeframes for delivery creates momentum and drives focus," Luxon said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders expect and deserve delivery from their government, and that is exactly what they are getting from us."</p>
        
            <p>The number one job is "deliver a budget that reduces wasteful spending while investing in frontline services like health, education and police", set down for 30 May.</p>
        
            <p>That is followed by commitments to pass laws delivering personal income tax relief and the FamilyBoost childcare tax credit outlined last week.</p>
        
            <p>A Regional Infrastructure Fund will also be established within the quarter, though the amount of funding to be allocated is not specified. New Zealand First secured the fund in its coalition agreement with National to the tune of $1.2 billion over the three-year term.</p>
        
            <p>A new school Attendance Action Plan will be launched, presumably by Associate Education Minister David Seymour, who has responsibility for addressing truancy and recently mused about fining more parents whose children are frequently absent.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve of the tasks require the coalition only "take decisions" on various policies or promises, meaning some could arguably have already been delivered. They include taking decisions on the return of Three Strikes, tighter controls on youth vaping, and stronger teacher training.</p>
