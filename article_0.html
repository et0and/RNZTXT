            <p>A King's College staff member has resigned after admitting to what the board is calling "inappropriate online activity".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the board said the staff member - who was involved in football and in boarding - had acknowledged being involved in inappropriate online activity, where he was under the impression that he was engaging with a minor.</p>
        
            <p>"The staff member has resigned today with immediate effect," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>The school notified police, and contacted parents and guardians on Monday night, asking them to talk with their child if they had any concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Boarding students were also notified, and pastoral care services were ready to provide support, the school said.</p>
        
            <p>King's College said the inappropriate online activity did not involve any King's College student, and it was not aware of any student involvement.</p>
        
            <p>This was the first time it had been notified of any concerns relating to the staff member's behaviour, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"This matter is very concerning to King's College and our priority is supporting our students through this news."</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>
