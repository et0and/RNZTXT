            <p>The White Ferns have caused a major cricketing shock with victory over South Africa in the T20 Women's World Cup in Dubai.</p>
        
            <p>It is New Zealand's first win in the T20 World Cup, and their first appearance in a final since they lost to Australia in 2010.</p>
        
            <p>Led by Sophie Devine, the White Ferns won won by 32 runs, after scoring 158 for five in their 20 overs, with Melie Kerr top scoring with 43. Brooke Halliday hit 38 and opener Suzie Bates 32.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa got away to a blazing start in reply with Laura Volvaart and Tazmin Brits putting on 51 for the first wicket before spinner Fran Jonas got rid of Brits. That triggered a collapse with the next four wickets falling for 26 runs, with Kerr taking three of them.</p>
        
            <p>Sune Luus and Chloe Tryon then turned the innings back towards South Africa's way with a 20-run partnership, but a Suzie Bates catch put paid to Luus and the momentum swung back strongly to the White Ferns.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa finished their 20 overs at 126 for nine.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr, the undoubted player of the match, finished with three for 24 off her four overs.</p>
        
            <p>The White Ferns came into the tournament after losing two series to women's cricket powerhouses, Australia and England. But the form book was turned on its head in the UAE as both those countries failed to make the final.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
