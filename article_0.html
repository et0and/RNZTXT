            <p>The government is making it easier for teachers coming to New Zealand to apply for residency faster, with Immigration Minister Erica Stanford saying they're making New Zealand a "competitive destination for overseas talent."</p>
        
            <p>From late next month, primary teachers with a job offer from an accredited employer in the country will be able to apply for residency without first working for two years.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a warning from the Ministry of Education schools could be short 1250 teachers this year.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said a "teacher shortage not only impacts students, but other staff as well."</p>
        
            <p>"To attract skilled teachers from offshore to help address this, we are making New Zealand a competitive destination for overseas talent by moving primary teachers to the Straight to Residence pathway."</p>
        
            <p>From 26 March, the streamlined process will allow eligible primary and intermediate teachers - and MƒÅori medium equivalents - with a job offer to apply for residence.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the government shifted secondary school teachers to the Straight to Residency pathway, resulting in 480 new teachers.</p>
        
            <p>This benefited thousands of students, said Stanford and "around 1170 people were supported with an Overseas Relocation Grant of up to $10,000 when coming to New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford added immigration is only one lever the coalition is pulling to grow the workforce. She listed a $53 million investment to double the School Onsite Training Programme, "so 1200 aspiring teachers can train in the classroom."</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Education is also subsidising training and financial assistance for trainees across primary and secondary and a range of subjects."</p>
