            <p>Maritime NZ has filed a charge against KiwiRail after its Interislander ferry lost power in the Cook Strait last year.</p>
        
            <p>On 28 January 2023, the Kaitaki was sailing into Wellington Harbour when it lost propulsion with more than 880 people on board - resulting in a mayday call.</p>
        
            <p>The ship regained limited power and made its way to port where its passengers were able to safely leave it and come ashore.</p>
        
            <p>This week Maritime NZ filed one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act following a near year-long investigation into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum penalty is a fine of up to $1.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ director Kirstie Hewlett explained the evidence they had investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"It involved reviewing the operator's organisational information relevant to processes and procedures connected to safety and maintenance management, undertaking interviews and examining the Kaitaki after the incident occurred."</p>
        
            <p>Hewlett said evidence was comprehensively reviewed before the decision was made to prosecute.</p>
        
            <p>She said Maritime NZ cannot make any further comment about the ongoing proceedings due to it being before court.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy said passenger and staff safety will always be their highest priority.</p>
        
            <p>"The safe and reliable operation of the Interislander service is an absolutely non-negotiable requirement for KiwiRail board and management.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the Kaitaki incident, we conducted a full review of all of our asset management practices, using global experts to ensure we are running the Interislander to world's best practice standards."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were pleased that over the recent busy Christmas period the Interislander ferries have operated with 100 percent asset reliability and 91.4 percent on-time performance.</p>
