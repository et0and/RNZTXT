            <p>Homes and a caravan park have been evacuated near Canterbury's West Melton as high winds fan a large vegetation fire.</p>
        
            <p>About 50 firefighters have been tackling the blaze overnight, and four helicopters will be on scene with monsoon buckets at first light Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ said the blaze was first reported about 9pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>By 10pm, the fire was "approximately 1km x 1km, with high winds in the area".</p>
        
            <p>At 3am, 12 trucks, tankers and support vehicles were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A caravan park, in The Willows area, had been evacuated, Fire and Emergency NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuations were also underway in the area east of Thompsons Road to McKays Road about midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuees were being sent to the West Melton Community Centre.</p>
        
            <p>"People should continue to avoid the area while our crews work," Fire and Emergency NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke could be smelled from up to 30km away.</p>
        
            <p>If further evacuations were needed, an emergency mobile alert would be sent out, or firefighters would knock on people's doors, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was described as "uncontained", and FENZ said it would have "a better and more accurate picture of the fire's size" once day broke on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze came just days after a huge fire broke out in the Bridge Hill area, leading to school camps and part of a village being evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>That fire, which had since grown to about 1000 hectares, was expected to take a week to fully extinguish.</p>

            <p>A third Canterbury fire, at Kirwee, was brought under control on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters had used heavy machinery to build a fire break and remained on site on Sunday night in case of any flare-ups.</p>
        
            <p>"Firefighters will return tomorrow to continue working on the deep-seated hotspots."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, crews in Auckland put out a large vegetation fire in East Tamaki on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said crews were called to a fire near the roundabout on Highbrook Drive just after 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>Three fire trucks and a water tanker battled the blaze, which had been put out by 10.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>The crews had left the scene after dampening down remaining hot spots, a spokesperson said.</p>
