            <p>Like a dog with a bone, investment manager Greg Smith of Devon Funds refuses to give up on a call for a jumbo-sized cut to the official cash rate (OCR) at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's last meeting of the year due to take place in a couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>He made the same bold call for a 75 basis- point cut for the recent October decision, only to be confounded by the RBNZ's 50 point cut to 4.75 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Smith is not deterred that he's swimming against the tide, which overwhelmingly backs a more modest 50 basis point reduction.</p>
        
            <p>"A general comment by dissenters to a cut of such magnitude is that such large reductions are generally reserved for extreme circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not too difficult to argue that we are in such circumstances now," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the RBNZ no longer had to be concerned with preserving jobs, but had to avoid unnecessary instability in output, employment and interest rates, and the exchange rate.</p>
        
            <p>Inflation has fallen back into the RBNZ's 1 to 3 percent target band and could undershoot the desired mid-point by 2 percent and go to the bottom of the target range.</p>
        
            <p>"It is therefore not hard to argue that we should be at, or below, the RBNZ's 'neutral' rate - neither boosting nor restricting growth - of 3.8 percent ... right now.</p>
        
            <p>"The case for a 75-basis point reduction in the official cash rate does indeed seem legitimate."</p>
        
            <p>"Our economic data is dire, and the RBNZ should probably be pushing the panic button.</p>
        
            <p>"The economy is in recession, and unemployment is on the rise," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>He cited the weakness in the monthly measures of manufacturing and services sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"Key parts of the Kiwi economy do appear to be stuck in a rut, which therefore increases the need for extraordinary measures."</p>
        
            <p>Smith doubled down on the domestic risks by warning of "flashing red lights" from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>"The growth outlook for China, our largest customer, remains uncertain... which poses downside risks to New Zealand's real export growth, as well as export and import prices," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Smith's call for a jumbo-sized OCR cut has not been completely ruled out by economists and finance sector observers, but it's certainly a minority view.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ's head of research, Stephen Toplis, an early advocate of rate cuts at the start of the year, believed drastic measures were not needed and won't be used.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the RBNZ has already cut the cash rate 25 basis points more than it had assumed ... and given that it's likely a further cut of 50 basis points will be delivered later this month, we see no reason to advocate anything more," Toplis said.</p>
        
            <p>ASB senior economist Mark Smith agreed. He said the hurdles to large rate cuts were high, and conditional on the economic numbers and balance of risks.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect the RBNZ to revert to a more measured pace of OCR easing over 2025 with a 3.25 percent OCR endpoint being reached by late 2025."</p>
        
            <p>But Greg Smith said there was a further imperative - the gap between the final 2024 meeting and the first meeting next year in February.</p>
        
            <p>"That's nearly three months during which quite a lot can happen to our growth profile and not necessarily in a good way."</p>
        
            <p>Anecdotal evidence they were receiving from businesses, big and small, pointed to struggling firms, some on the brink of failure.</p>
        
            <p>"A larger rate cut this side of Christmas might make all the difference," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>He questioned whether "the much-needed real jumbo cut [will] be avoided altogether?"</p>
        
            <p>"To save an admission that the New Zealand economy is lagging many others and that rates were pushed up too high too fast and kept there for too long?</p>
        
            <p>"Time will tell."</p>
