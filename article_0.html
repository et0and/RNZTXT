            <p>Having crashed to the first defeat of their maiden A-League season, Auckland FC will look to come out firing when they take on the Central Coast Mariners in round 10.</p>
        
            <p>AFC were humbled at home last week, suffering a shock 4-0 loss to Western United.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Steve Corica accused his players of complacency, saying the whole team was "off".</p>
        
            <p>Currently top of the table, just one point separates the Black Knights from Adelaide United. The mariners meanwhile sit in 10th, having won just two games this season.</p>
        
            <p>Follow all the action here:</p>
