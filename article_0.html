            <p>A search is underway for a teenager missing in Omaha, north of Auckland, since Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Wednesday issued an amber alert for Hugo Wadham, 15, who left a house on Kokopu Street in only his underwear after becoming upset at 11.55pm.</p>
        
            <p>Wadham was described as 183cm tall and of slim build. He was wearing Jockey brand underwear. He has blue eyes and short wavy brown hair.</p>
        
            <p>Police said he had autism and ADHD and there were concerns his mental health could be deteriorating due to medication issues.</p>
        
            <p>"Hugo is verbal, however has been going through periods of 'non-communication' lately."</p>
        
            <p>While he was familiar with the area there were no places he was likely to go and there were concerns he'd spent the night outside in the wind and rain.</p>
        
            <p>"There is significant concern for his wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Police and Facebook launched the amber alert system in 2017 for cases where a child or young person who was missing was at serious risk of harm and public assistance could help to locate them.</p>
