            <p>The police watchdog has just released its report into complaints over the 2022 protest and occupation at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority said of 1905 complaints relating to the protest, it has made 19 further investigations.</p>
        
            <p>Another two complaints were received following the publication of the IPCA's general report regarding the protest and occupation in April 2023, meaning that 21 specific complaints were considered by the IPCA, in 17 separate investigations.</p>
        
            <p>Across these 17 investigations, the IPCA found the police use of force was excessive in six instances and there was an adverse finding in relation to the impoundment and damage of a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
