            <p>An Air New Zealand flight was diverted on its way to Auckland this morning because of a "disruptive" passenger.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ-176, from Perth, made a stop in Melbourne, where it was met by police.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Operational Integrity and Safety Officer, Captain David Morgan, said the flight then continued to Auckland and landed at 8.50am.</p>
        
            <p>He said incidents like this are distressing for customers and staff, and the airline has zero tolerance for such behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>He apologised for the 90-minute delay.</p>
        
            <p>It comes less than a week after passengers were held on an Air New Zealand flight at Sydney Airport after a bomb threat was reported on board.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand flight NZ247 landed safely on Saturday following the threat, but passengers were forced to wait onboard for about two hours while police and security services ensured the plane was safe.</p>
