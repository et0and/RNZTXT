        <p>
The spot they were fishing at, known as The Gap, is notorious for its large swells and known among locals as a danger zone.

            <p>The two fishermen who have been missing in Northland since Wednesday, had recently moved to the country from India with their young families.</p>
        
            <p>The two men, aged in their thirties, were last heard from on Wednesday afternoon while rock fishing at Taiharuru, a small bay in Whangārei Heads.</p>
        
            <p>The spot they were fishing at, known locally as The Gap, is notorious for its large swells and is known among locals as a danger zone.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, Whangārei District Council described The Gap as a "narrow cleft in the rocks", which could be a "spectacular sight when the sea is rough".</p>
        
            <p>It is known as a good fishing spot, especially for snapper, but can be dangerous when there are large swells - as there were on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, police confirmed they had found the men's car and some of their personal belongings in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the search was ongoing on Friday and warned the public to stay away from the search area after private jet skis were seen there on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the police dive squad were at the bay and they needed the public out of the water in that area for the divers' safety.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Tutukaka volunteers were helping with the search along with the Northland Coastguard Air Patrol and the Ruakākā Surf Lifesaving Patrol SAR Squad.</p>

            <p>Whangārei Malayali Association president Sujoy Alex said the community were supporting the wives and children of the men, who are from South India.</p>
        
            <p>"They hadn't been here for very long - we're still hoping for the best and to hear some good news, but given the amount of time they've been missing the chances are slim.</p>
        
            <p>"I spoke to the families yesterday - they're devastated, but they have a good support system around them and have been liaising with the families of their husbands back in India."</p>
        
            <p>Alex said he had been told police divers would be out in the water on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>One local fisherman, who did not want to be named out of respect for the missing men, said the fishing spot could be treacherous in high seas.</p>
        
            <p>"Locals know you have to respect The Gap."</p>
        
            <p>In 2013, a fisherman died at The Gap after he and two friends were swept off the rocks and into the sea.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment on how the search efforts on Friday are going.</p>
