            <p>KiwiRail's chief executive Peter Reidy is to front media over the next steps for the stricken Aratere.</p>
        
            <p>The Interislander ferry ran aground just north of Picton while on a freight-only sailing on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>No-one was injured, but the ferry was not able to be refloated until nearly 24 hours later.</p>
        
            <p>It would be anchored in Picton Harbour today and be placed under a Maritime NZ detention order, barring it from further movement, while the reason for the grounding is investigated.</p>
        
            <p>Follow the press conference with our live blog:</p>
