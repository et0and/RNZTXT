            <p>Wellington City Council's chief financial officer Andrea Reeves says it is important the community are aware that both the sale and a partial sale of Wellington Airport are still on table.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, the council voted against selling its airport shares and must now find a different way to pay for its long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>Following the vote, Wellington mayor Tory Whanau told the councillors there would have to be cuts to the council's capital programme.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff had warned in documents prior to the vote that if the council stopped the sale it would have to consider two scenarios.</p>
        
            <p>One would be almost doubling their debt ceiling from $272 million to $500m and cutting capital project spend by $400m; the other would be tripling the council's debt ceiling to $750m and slashing capital spend by $600m.</p>
        
            <p>City councillor Sarah Free, who supports the sale, asked if a partial sale option was still a consideration at a briefing on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said that would be confirmed in the new year, as councillors consider which options to put out for public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>She said it would still be stressed selling the shares was not the council's preferred option, and the reasons why, but it was important to highlight a full or partial sale of shares were still "reasonable options".</p>
        
            <p>The council's new Crown observer Lindsay Mckenzie starts work on Wednesday. He was not at the meeting, but told RNZ he sat in on some of it remotely.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, Finance Minister Nicola Willis said Wellington's council was a "shambles".</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Local Government Minister Simeon Brown said he was seeking advice from officials on the options available to him and the thresholds for action against the city council.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Wellingtonians have also expressed their disappointment over the ongoing saga</p>
        
            <p>The majority of people who spoke to RNZ last month said they were disappointed in the city council and its leadership.</p>
        
            <p>A woman walking her dog said it was a difficult situation and while she did not totally agree with intervention, she conceded it might be the only solution to the council's roadblocks.</p>
        
            <p>"[There's] a bit of a stalemate going on with some of the big decisions. It's difficult."</p>
        
            <p>Her husband said he was worried about overreach, saying people needed to trust those elected and in positions of authority, to make the right decisions.</p>
        
            <p>He said while interest from central government was a positive development, it diminished the council's power.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems to give them less teeth, less authority, less impact ... if someone is just going to wade in over the top of them."</p>
        
            <p>Hustling down Victoria Street, one woman expressed disillusionment with both central and local politics.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, I'm not a fan of the current [coalition] government for a start, but I'm also not a fan of the council leadership that we've got at the moment either.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a little bit too late for the council now, and if the only option is for the government bailing them out ... maybe that's the way to go ... but it might go against my values."</p>
        
            <p>Another man said the council had been "weird for some time, and it's not getting any less strange".</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think they should appoint a commissioner, but an observer may be a compromise."</p>
