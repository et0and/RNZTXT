            <p>When taking a trip you can't guarantee things won't go wrong, but you can choose an airline brand you trust, and a New Zealand brand have proven to be a safe bet.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand has been announced one of the safest airlines in the world, according to Airline Ratings - an Australian-based airline safety and product rating website - and their safest airlines list for 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The site rated the safety and in-flight product of 385 airlines, and given that low cost, regional and full service carriers are so different, the company constructed a different rating system for each one.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand took out the top spot for safest full-service airline, while Hong Kong Express was ranked the safest low-cost airline.</p>
        
            <p>Following Air New Zealand as the safest full-service airline was Qantas, with a three-way tie between Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways and Emirates for third.</p>
        
            <p>Ryanair was in third for safest low-cost airline.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive of Airline Ratings Sharon Peterson said the race between the top airlines was tight.</p>
        
            <p>"It was extremely close again between Air New Zealand and Qantas for first place with only 1.50 points separating the two airlines.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst both airlines uphold the highest safety standards and pilot training, Air New Zealand continue to have a younger fleet than Qantas which separates the two."</p>
        
            <p>Peterson said the three-way tie for third place was simply because they could not separate the airlines.</p>
        
            <p>"From fleet age to pilot skill, safety practices, fleet size, and number of incidents, their scores were identical," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Inlast year's list, Air New Zealand ranked fourth among the top premium airlines and Jetstar took out the top spot as the safest low-cost airline in the world.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, Air New Zealand was also crowned the top airline in the world, which was then based on a seven-star safety rating that incorporated leadership in innovation for passenger comfort.</p>
        
            <p>To rank airline brands, Airline Ratings assessed carriers according to different ratings systems categorised by low cost, regional and full service airlines.</p>
        
            <p>The company used nine criteria that were evaluated in the appropriate contexts.</p>
