The new US president says the agency mishandled the pandemic and other international health crises.
</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Donald Trump was sworn in as the president of the United States of America for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>He has wasted no time getting stuck into paperwork, signing dozens of orders on his first day back in office.</p>
        
            <p>One of his most immediate priorities was to pardon about 1500 people who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The US will leave the World Health Organisation, Trump said, saying the global health agency had mishandled the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.</p>
