            <p>The Ministry of Health has apologised to the Associate Minister of Health Casey Costello for failing to inform her that one of its officials advising her on tobacco reform had a conflict of interest.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said that it was its responsibility and stressed that the staffer in question had followed the correct guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after NZ First leader Winston Peters named the official in Parliament's debating chamber, accusing her of attending meetings with Costello without telling her she was the sister-in-law of Labour's health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to reporters on Thursday afternoon, Peters said: "Something has seriously gone amok. It's seriously bad. It's wrong. It's corrosive ... and now it's been exposed."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, acting director-general Maree Roberts said the ministry official had adhered to its conflict of interest rules, but the ministry had failed to then "specifically" pass on the conflict to Costello.</p>
        
            <p>"This was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. The ministry has apologised to the associate minister of health for this oversight.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry does have a conflict of interest protocol which is well-communicated to all staff and was adhered to by the individual in this case."</p>
        
            <p>Peters first made the allegation under Parliamentary privilege on Wednesday afternoon, saying he had learned that a "close relative" of Verrall had been advising Costello on smoking reform over the past year without declaring any conflict of interest to the minister.</p>
        
            <p>Returning to Parliament on Thursday, Peters took the opportunity to identify the ministry staffer.</p>
        
            <p>"The official I mentioned in my general debate is Ayesha Verrall's sister-in-law … who attended multiple meetings with the minister, worked on tobacco reform legislation advice, and who did not declare to the minister that she was a close relative nor did she declare that there was a massive conflict of interest.</p>
        
            <p>"The deceit and underhandedness shown by Verrall throughout her constant political attacks and smear campaign against one of my ministers [is] now writ large."</p>
        
            <p>Peters told reporters he had contacted the Ministry of Health himself to ask, "What on Earth is going on here?," but had yet to get a reply.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether he had any proof the official had leaked material, Peters responded: "For goodness' sake, I'm not going to entertain you people."</p>
        
            <p>"I've given you game, set, and match," Peter said. "I've never seen as bad as this: An insider, in there for 11 months, not telling the minister what her critical role was."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Peters' actions were "yet another example" of the government's contempt for workers.</p>
        
            <p>"Winston Peters has dragged another MP's family into a political debate and named and attacked a public servant who can't answer back."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement issued the day before, Verrall said she was "confident" the conflict had been managed appropriately.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people who work in politics have relatives in the public sector. That's the reality of living in a small country like New Zealand. They do their jobs professionally and any conflicts of interest are managed with their individual employers."</p>
        
            <p>Also speaking on Wednesday, Hipkins described the official as a "distant relative" and said he had been assured by Verrall there was "no issue here".</p>
        
            <p>He challenged Peters to provide evidence to back up his claims.</p>
        
            <p>"Any conflicts have been declared and managed, so the allegation that there's an unmanaged conflict here, which seems to be what Winston Peters was implying, is a fairly serious one."</p>
