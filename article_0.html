            <p>A total of 149 projects have been selected for fast tracking through the government's new Fast-track Approvals Bill.</p>
        
            <p>According to Minister for Infrastructure Chris Bishop, they will help rebuild the economy, fix the housing crisis, improve energy security and address the country's infrastructure deficit.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about getting NZ moving and cutting through the red tape", he said in a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about jobs and growth."</p>
        
            <p>The bill is yet to pass, and there are a few steps to go through, Bishop said, but it is expected some of these projects will be accepted by next year.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said advice was sought on any conflict of interest issues when choosing projects for this bill.</p>
        
            <p>Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said in a statement that the projects had been selected through a "thorough and robust" process. Final decisions were made by Cabinet after going through the Ministry for Environment and an independent advisory group.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fast-track Approvals Bill is a key part of the government's plan to rebuild our economy and cut through the red and green tape that has made it more and more difficult to build the projects New Zealand needs." Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, the 44 listed housing developments will enable up to 55,000 new homes to be consented in New Zealand's major growth centres and across our regions, playing a significant part in addressing New Zealand's housing crisis."</p>
        
            <p>One of the projects listed is a redevelopment of the existing Eden Park facility in Auckland "to deliver a world class</p>
        
            <p>hybrid, multi-purpose 50,000+ capacity stadium with a retractable roof".</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said today he had not analysed the Eden Park project with his Sports Minister hat on.</p>
        
            <p>He said people will be happy with a whole variety of these projects, and not so happy about others.</p>
        
            <p>"But we have to grow as an economy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There are also seven aquaculture and farming projects, 43 infrastructure projects, 22 renewable energy projects, and 11 mining projects.</p>
        
            <p>"Our regions and the New Zealanders living in them have enormous potential, and the fast-track projects, freed up from stifling consenting processes, are another change that is giving them back the wings they deserve," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"The projects will bring a big boost, and will help stimulate various industries, including the aquaculture, energy, housing, and mining sectors. This progress is going to help get things moving and flowing where it is needed, in the form of job creation, construction, new opportunities, and more business.</p>
        
            <p>However, the introduction of the bill has not been without its controversies.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's acting environment spokesman David Parker condemned the list.</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition government has just confirmed a line-up of projects that could wreak havoc on our natural environment," Parker said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The list includes previously rejected projects like Trans-Tasman Resources' seabed mining and the Waitaha Hydro Project - both rejected for their adverse effects on the environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's now clear why the government has hidden this list for so long."</p>
        
            <p>The Environmental Defence Society's CEO Gary Taylor also called many of the projects "questionable".</p>
        
            <p>"The Resource Management Act can be too slow and too expensive. However, the Fast-track Approvals Bill goes way beyond what is required to streamline processes," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, we're blown away by the sheer volume of projects listed. We question how the government intends to stand up enough qualified expert panels to process them in the timeframes indicated.</p>
        
            <p>"As currently designed, the bill almost guarantees approval for the projects. It fails to properly balance development and environment considerations and instead has a deeply troubling bias in favour of applicants. That means that good projects will get approved along with the bad. Local communities will not have a say."</p>
        
            <p>Ng훮ti Toa led a h카koi to Parliament in May to make clear its opposition to the bill.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people gathered on the forecourt, met by Crown Ministers Chris Bishop and Tama Potaka, as well as MPs from Labour, the Greens and Te P훮ti M훮ori.</p>
        
            <p>The government representatives received a box of submissions in opposition to the fast-track legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Other concerns including politicisation, consultation, appeals and trade also remain.</p>
