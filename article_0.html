        <h2>Wayne Brown makes announcement on Auckland port's future</h2>
        <p>
The Port of Auckland boss recently told RNZ they were in negotiations to sell two wharves to council.
</p>
        
            <p>Watch Mayor Wayne Brown and officials from Port of Auckland and Maritime Union speaking about 11am here:</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown is set to make announcement on the future of the Port of Auckland and Auckland Council's Long-term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>He will be joined by Port of Auckland chief executive Roger Gray and the Maritime Union of New Zealand Auckland Secretary Grant Williams.</p>
        
            <p>A record number of people gave feedback on the Long-Term Plan, with Aucklanders having their say on options and trade-offs of activities and services delivery over the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>The draft plan's central proposal included a proposed rates increase for the average household of 7.5 percent from 2024 to 2025, 3.5 percent for the following year, and 8 percent the year after that.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Gray told Checkpoint they were in negotiations to sell council the smaller Captain Cook and Marsden wharves next to Bledisloe.</p>
        
            <p>That sale would be subject to a condition, he said. The port wanted consent and approval to build a wharf along the northern face of Bledisloe where the seawall was.</p>
        
            <p>The port has had consent for the demolition of Marsden Wharf since 2012, due to its poor structure.</p>
        
            <p>Gray said this plan would help ease the problem of ferry delays due to cruise ships arriving or departing.</p>
        
            <p>The ideas were similarly outlined in 2017 as part of the port's 30-year masterplan.</p>
        
            <p>A previous proposal by the port to extend the Bledisloe Wharf was opposed by residents, who said it would ruin views.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
