            <p>The police watchdog has found officers used excessive force in six incidents during last year's protest and occupation of Parliament's grounds.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority said of 1905 complaints relating to the protest, it has made 19 further investigations.</p>
        
            <p>Another two complaints were received following the publication of the IPCA's general report regarding the protest and occupation in April 2023, meaning that 21 specific complaints were considered by the IPCA, in 17 separate investigations.</p>
        
            <p>Across these 17 investigations, the IPCA found the police use of force was excessive in six instances and there was an adverse finding in relation to the impoundment and damage of a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Its chair, Judge Kenneth Johnston KC, has found a police officer's initial use of a fire extinguisher against protesters on 2 March, the final day of the protest, was in self-defence and justified.</p>
        
            <p>However, he and other officers were not justified in continuing to spray protesters after they had turned their backs and were trying to climb down from the column.</p>
        
            <p>Another officer used excessive force in punching an elderly man twice in the head in defence of a female colleague.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming said police acknowledge the findings.</p>
        
            <p>The police were faced with a level of violence never before experienced in New Zealand and he's proud of their response, he said.</p>
        
            <p>... More to come</p>
