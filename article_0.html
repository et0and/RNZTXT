            <p>Police have confirmed two people who fell, one fatally, from a Coromandel cliff on Saturday night were both under 18.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed this afternoon that the victims were both under 18 when asked by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Hahei Beach about 8.15pm on Saturday and a person was located at the bottom of the cliff face in a critical condition, however, they later died at the scene, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Another person was trapped on the cliff but uninjured and later rescued by a Fire and Emergency Lines Rescue Team.</p>
        
            <p>St John said it sent one first response unit, one ambulance and one helicopter to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Hahei Beach is south east of Whitianga, and a popular Coromandel Peninsula summer holiday destination.</p>
        
            <p>The death will be referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation said the track was not one of the department's.</p>
        
            <p>DOC spokesperson Michelle Lewis said the track in Hahei is not a DoC track and the department is deeply saddened by the fatality.</p>
        
            <p>Tim Bright, skipper for Coromandel tour boat Hahei Explorer, said the landscape was very rocky.</p>
        
            <p>"[There is] kind of dense bush at the top of the cliff, so if you were going through it you'd only be able to see maybe a metre, two metres in front of you at a time," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The rocks themselves are fairly crumbly, so yeah you don't want to go too close to the cliff edges."</p>
        
            <p>Bright said there was signage around the cliffs of Cathedral Cove to warn trampers to keep to the path.</p>
        
            <p>"The track to Cathedral Cove, that's totally safe and if you stay on the track you're fine.</p>
        
            <p>"There are track signs saying, you know, stick to the track. There is a track from the Cathedral Cove lookout back down to the beach, but that has been closed by DOC (the Department of Conservation) with multiple fences, signs, everything like that."</p>
        
            <p>Thames-Coromandel mayor Len Salt said it had been a difficult weekend, with a fatal fall near Hahei on Saturday night and a scrub fire further north at Kūaotunu.</p>
        
            <p>Salt said while locals were hurting, the region's volunteer fire brigades were well-equipped to deal with these sorts of events.</p>
        
            <p>"Our communities are pretty resilient to dealing with these sort of things, particularly things like when we get weather events and fire events.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an area that's got a lot of bush, a lot of rural and mountainous terrain in certain places which can make it difficult to get to."</p>
        
            <p>Salt said the council remained ready to assist emergency services as required.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a little bit of a south-east wind blowing up on the hill there, it is quite strong but down on sea level it's not so we're hoping the wind will die out again this afternoon and it's supposed to swing around to the north-east so we're just monitoring that as well."</p>
        
            <p>However, Salt said the fatality near Hahei Beach was top of mind.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and whānau of the person who's tragically lost their life," Salt said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a council, we're being guided by [the emergency services] and we're available to help if there's anything they need."</p>
        
            <p>Salt said the walking tracks in the area were popular with locals and visitors alike and were generally safe, but people did need to take care.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not an area that we would recommend people go into after dark because they need to keep themselves safe and if they can't see where they're going, there can be heightened risks... there are a lot of challenging tracks and steep paths there that people need to be really cautious of."</p>
