            <p>Police in the North Island have launched 10 homicide inquiries in a little over a month.</p>
        
            <p>Half of the homicide investigations since the beginning of August were in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The rest were all in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>During a press conference on Friday about the Grey Lynn homicide, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said it was the fourth homicide investigation police had launched in the last 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>"None of these incidents appear to be linked, they're all separate," Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a tragedy, the timing is incredibly unfortunate, but we are investigating all of those matters with diligence. Those other three matters, the offenders have been arrested and those matters are now before the courts.</p>
        
            <p>"This matter has our absolute focus at this time. We will work hard over the next few days to understand the circumstances, we are following positive lines of inquiry and ... we are focussed on holding this offender to account."</p>
        
            <p>Police were also investigating the death of Steven Cranston near Raglan on Wednesday. He died after apparently being struck by a vehicle while walking his dog. It is not yet a formal homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>And investigations were underway into two unexplained deaths in Spreydon, Christchurch and Oxford, North Canterbury.</p>
