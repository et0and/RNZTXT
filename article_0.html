            <p>In the days after backpackers in Laos began falling violently ill due to suspected methanol poisoning, travellers tried desperately to warn each other about the hostel at the centre of the scandal.</p>
        
            <p>In a series of now deleted Google Reviews obtained by the ABC, backpackers warned about the unfolding disaster at the Nana Backpacker Hostel in Vang Vieng - where at least five of the six people to have died from suspected methanol poisoning were staying.</p>
        
            <p>Eight members of hostel staff had now been detained.</p>
        
            <p>The reviews were sometimes met with claims of 'slander' and subsequently deleted.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview with the ABC last week, owner Duong van Huan denied the poisoned drinks came from his bar and said he had been in business for almost 11 years, and it was the first time something like this had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I really take care of all the customers [who] stay with our hotel and our hostel," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not doing anything wrong with all of the customer.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm scared it happened. I lose a lot of customer, no customer right now, nobody stay, I'm very sad as well about my business."</p>
        
            <p>Duong van Huan was one of eight staff members detained by police in Laos as they investigated the tragic case, which had claimed the lives of six people including Melbourne teenagers Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles.</p>
        
            <p>Before the first deaths were made public, the ABC could reveal that backpackers had been trying to warn each other about the situation through Google Reviews.</p>
        
            <p>One traveller wrote: "Do not go here!! They have methanol in their drinks and me and 3 others have been hospitalised because of this."</p>
        
            <p>Another wrote: "I stayed at this hostel for 5 days. Myself and friends were sick from consuming the free vodka here.</p>
        
            <p>"People we know were taken to hospital, some even in intensive care with serious problems. The ones in hospital have all had traces of methanol in their bloodstream which is incredibly dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"The only event that connects all the different people is drinking at this hostel."</p>

            <p>The ABC had been unable to contact the reviewer but had confirmed she was one of the people hospitalised with methanol poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>Yet another reviewer said: "My friend has been to this hostel and is now in hospital. This is due to poisoning with methanol in the drinks served in this hostel.</p>
        
            <p>"I have heard several stories of people who ended up in the ICU or even died."</p>
        
            <p>That review was met with this response from the Nana Backpacker Hostel account:</p>
        
            <p>"This is a slander case can contact us want to clarify a few points (sic)."</p>
        
            <p>"Our hostel has been operating for five years, and during this time, we have always prioritised the safety and well-being of our guests. We take any claims like this very seriously."</p>
        
            <p>Police in Laos ordered the closure of the hostel last week but were yet to lay any charges over the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Another guest at Nana Backpacker Hostel, 19-year-old Australian Harry Ough said he had no idea that three backpackers had already died from suspected methanol poisoning when he first checked in on November 15.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood American man James Louis Hutson had been found dead on the floor of his hostel room on November 13, the same day two Danish women and Australian teenagers Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones were hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>Government-backed media outlet the Vientiane Times reported the Danish women Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman and Freja Sorensen died on the November 14.</p>
        
            <p>"I had no clue, and it was where I was staying. So it was awful. I wish I'd known," he told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>Blissfully unaware, he took advantage of the two hours of free alcohol the venue offered every night.</p>
        
            <p>"We drank lots of shots. Everyone did. I guess we drank a lot that first night and then throughout the night there were some rumours that said some girls got spiked or something.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't until the next day when we started realising something's going on here."</p>

            <p>He said there was a heavy police presence that day and officers appeared to be questioning hostel staff but a fellow traveller was brushed aside when they asked what it was about.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the people working there just said that someone smoked a joint at the front, which probably wouldn't be the appropriate reaction having that many police officers."</p>
        
            <p>He said the night after police had been at Nana Backpackers, the hostel continued to offer free shots.</p>
        
            <p>"They had the free shots again, and no one was touching any of the liquor on the second night.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think at that point, everyone sort of knew something's happening here and we didn't party very hard on the second night because there was all these police around and we weren't sure."</p>
        
            <p>Ough, 19, was continuing his travels throughout South-East Asia but said the methanol poisonings were on everyone's lips.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just awful, like just hearing about it was not nice, and it sort of put a stain on what was â€¦ actually quite a nice place."</p>
        
            <p>He said he hoped police in Laos get to the bottom of how this tragedy happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how they will investigate it, but, yeah, I think accountability is really important.</p>
        
            <p>"And I think for the families and everyone affected it's nice to understand what happened and closure and also, really importantly, make sure it doesn't happen again."</p>
