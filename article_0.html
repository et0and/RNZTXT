            <p>Police have found remains in their search for missing Christchurch woman Yanfei Bao.</p>
        
            <p>While searching private farmland in the Greenpark area in Canterbury on Tuesday, a shallow grave was discovered along the treeline.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the remains could not immediately be formally identified and work is now under way to excavate and forensically examine them.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the news has been shared with Yanfei's immediate family, and while long hoped for, still comes as a shock.</p>

            <p>Bao has been missing since 19 July last year, and despite extensive searches of Christchurch and surrounding areas over the past 12 months, the 44-year-old's body has never been found.</p>
        
            <p>A 53-year-old Chinese national, Tingjun Cao, has been accused of her kidnapping and murder, with a trial date scheduled for October.</p>

            <p>The search on Tuesday involved more than 60 people and was centred around land near the intersection of Hudson Road and Clarks Road.</p>
        
            <p>The farmland has been previously searched, but recent information prompted the investigation team to return.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene of the search said they could see more than a dozen police cars and a van.</p>
        
            <p>Police would continue to be visible in the area.</p>
