            <p>Michael Hill Jeweller says it has confidence in its security measures, despite two more of its stores suffering smash-and-grab raids this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In the latest in a string of robberies at the chain store's branches over the past two years, robbers struck its Bayfair shop in Mt Maunganui yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>And police today arrested a young person after an armed robbery at the Michael Hill store in Silverdale Mall on the Hibiscus Coast around 11.20am.</p>
        
            <p>"The offender was armed with a hammer, and left the store after the fog cannon was activated," police said in a statement on the Silverdale incident.</p>
        
            <p>He left the scene, and headed to the Northern Motorway before being stopped north of the Lonely Track Road Overbridge.</p>
        
            <p>"A youth has been taken into custody and charges are being considered," police said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Michael Hill Jeweller said today's attack in Silverdale was an attempted smash-and-grab, but the offender was unable to penetrate the armoured glass displays. Fog cannons were also activated.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Hill chief executive Daniel Bracken said in a statement "security and safeguarding measures remain integral" for the chain.</p>
        
            <p>"We have continued to review our security measures to ensure we are doing everything we can to protect our team and customers."</p>
        
            <p>With "continued offending in New Zealand", the company been rolling out a raft of new security measures, including smash-proof glass, extra fog cannons, alarm screamers and personal alarms for staff.</p>
        
            <p>DNA spray technology was also being used to protect staff and customers.</p>
        
            <p>Bracken said it was "incredibly disturbing" to see the robberies continue and they would prioritise the installation of assault glass across all stores.</p>
        
            <p>Retail strategy expert, First Retail managing director Chris Wilkinson said certain retailers were still being targeted despite putting significant security measures in place, because thieves who stole to order were extremely determined.</p>
        
            <p>Wilkinson said the Michael Hill jewellery store chain had been "hugely proactive" in protecting its stores.</p>
        
            <p>"They put guards in many sites, their staff have been well-trained, I guess this is really just a situation that proves that no matter what you do the intent of some of these people is such that it's going to be difficult to stop them."</p>
        
            <p>At least 15 Michael Hill branches have been robbed over the past year or so, mostly in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It was disappointing retailers were still being targeted by thieves despite putting significant security measures in place, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It had seemed that some of the worst aspects of retail crime were abating, with the coalition government giving police more powers to deal with offenders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly around hostile vehicle attacks such as ram raids and some of the anti-social behaviour that's been going in our town and city centres. But to have this happen again now is quite a disturbing re-emergence."</p>
        
            <p>Other robberies of Michael Hill stores in the past two years include:</p>
