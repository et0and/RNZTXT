            <p>The World Health Organization has implored China to share data and access to help understand how Covid-19 began, five years on from the start of the pandemic that upended the planet.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 killed millions of people, shredded economies and crippled health systems.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of Covid-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative," the WHO said in a statement on Monday (local time).</p>
        
            <p>"Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics."</p>
        
            <p>The WHO recounted how on 31 December, 2019, its country office in China picked up a media statement from the health authorities in Wuhan concerning cases of "viral pneumonia" in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, Covid-19 came to shape our lives and our world," the UN health agency said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we mark this milestone, let's take a moment to honour the lives changed and lost, recognise those who are suffering from Covid-19 and Long Covid, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from Covid-19 to build a healthier tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the issue of whether the world was better prepared for the next pandemic than it was for Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>"The answer is yes, and no," he told a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"If the next pandemic arrived today, the world would still face some of the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that gave Covid-19 a foothold five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"But the world has also learnt many of the painful lessons the pandemic taught us, and has taken significant steps to strengthen its defences against future epidemics and pandemics."</p>
        
            <p>In December 2021, spooked by the devastation caused by Covid, countries decided to start drafting an accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.</p>
        
            <p>The WHO's 194 member states negotiating the treaty have agreed on most of what it should include, but are stuck on the practicalities.</p>
        
            <p>A key fault-line lies between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors and poorer countries wary of being sidelined when the next pandemic strikes.</p>
        
            <p>While the outstanding issues are few, they include the heart of the agreement: the obligation to quickly share emerging pathogens, and then the pandemic-fighting benefits derived from them such as vaccines.</p>
        
            <p>The deadline for the negotiations is May 2025.</p>
