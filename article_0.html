            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking to media at his regular post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis is attending the briefing.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said Sir Brian Roche would take the role of the next Public Service Commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Brian is a highly respected New Zealander who has held significant roles across the public and private sectors. He has a proven track record of leadership and delivering results and has strong networks in the public sector and business community," said in a statement about his appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"He understands how to manage problems, develop talent and drive performance. This aligns well with our government's focus on raising the performance of the public service so that New Zealanders get the services they deserve."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was recently in Laos, attending the East Asia Summit.</p>
        
            <p>This trip marked his fifth visit to a South East Asian country this year, part of a "very deliberate" redoubled effort on the region.</p>
