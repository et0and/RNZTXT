        <h2>'It's an entitlement': Luxon defends claiming $52k apartment stipend</h2>
        <p>
Earlier today it was revealed Luxon will be claiming $52,000 to cover his accommodation expenses for an apartment he owns mortgage-free.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says his claiming of a $52,000 accommodation supplement is something "well within the rules".</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today it was revealed Luxon is collecting a taxpayer-funded accommodation supplement to live in his own mortgage-free home in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A $31,000 supplement is available for all MPs living away from home when in Wellington, but the prime minister's gets a higher subsidy of $52,000.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon campaigned on wasteful public spending and a need for cost cutting across the public service and under the coalition government ministries have been asked to find at least 6.5 percent of savings.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an entitlement and I'm well within the rules," he told reporters in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>He defended taking the payment, the first prime minister in at least 34 years to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, it's part of an entitlement for an out of Wellington MP. Whether you're an MP or a minister, there's a series of allowances and entitlements and it's because I don't have a primary residence in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"As I said before, all MPs, Ministers, have entitlements. All those MPs are living outside of Wellington, which I happen to do. So the intention is, I want to get to Premier House as quickly as we possibly can."</p>
        
            <p>Prime ministers have Premier House available to live in but Luxon said he was choosing not to due to long-standing maintenance issues.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to work out how we can make that work, so that actualy I can go live there - its' my preference to do so. Until then, I continue to live in the apartment that I have."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if it was hypocritical, he asked why. His government's focus on cuts and the cost of living was pointed out, but he said: "Yes. But all I'm just saying to you is I want to get to Premier House.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that'd be really important, as prime minister I'd like to live there. Premier House has got maintenance issues and I can't live there at this point of time. That's why I'm carrying on living in my apartment."</p>
        
            <p>"Look, it's an entitlement that I have as an out-of-town Auckland-based MP, as do many other non-Wellington-based MPs and/or Ministers."</p>
        
            <p>When Bill English was prime minister, he ended up paying back the supplement, but Luxon said that was a case of "different circumstances".</p>
        
            <p>"It's about where you primarily live," he said. "Anyone outside of the Greater Wellington area is entitled to the entitlements. That's how the allowance system actually works."</p>
        
            <p>When Luxon was voicing opposition to Labour's universal waiving of the $5 prescription fee, he said people like him who were well off should pay the money if they could - a case of if you can pay, you should.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, what I'm saying, I don't know how to explain it any clearer to you, as prime minister of New Zealand ideally you want to be able to live in Premier House when you're in Wellington," he said, when that was put to him.</p>
