            <p>Woolworths is rolling out body cameras at all its 191 stores this week, as part of staff safety measures.</p>
        
            <p>The supermarket chain trialled the cameras in 17 stores and said staff felt safer and reported the cameras helped de-escalate conflict and abuse from customers.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths has seen a 75 percent increase in physical assaults and 148 percent increase in "serious reportable events" in the past three years.</p>
        
            <p>The cameras were worn round the neck and only turned on during a security incident, Woolworths New Zealand director of stores Jason Stockill said in a statement. Staff were required to notify customers before recording.</p>
        
            <p>"Footage will not be released except when requested by police as part of an investigation."</p>
        
            <p>The rollout is part of Woolworths' three year, $45 million programme to add more security measures to stores.</p>
        
            <p>Other measures include walkie talkies and trolley lock systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Every security measure implemented in Woolworths stores complies with New Zealand law including privacy requirements," Stockhill said</p>
