            <p>Christopher Luxon has been officially sworn in as New Zealand's 42nd prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>Following a karakia and the national anthem, Luxon confirmed to the Governor-General he had the confidence to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Cindy has also appointed the rest of the executive council, which includes 20 Cabinet ministers, eight ministers outside Cabinet, and two Parliamentary under-secretaries.</p>
        
            <p>Holding a Bible, Luxon swore allegiance to King Charles III, his heirs, and successors, before signing his oaths.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters also chose to swear on a Bible, though ACT leader David Seymour opted not to.</p>

            <p>New Zealand First minister Shane Jones was the first to deliver his oath and affirmation in te reo Māori. National's Tama Potaka, who delivered a karakia on behalf of the executive council, also delivered his oath and affirmation in te reo Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Following her oath and affirmation in English, National's Melissa Lee delivered hers in Korean, the first time this had ever been done.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps due to the nerves and auspiciousness of the occasion, there were a few fumbles.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon pronounced heirs as "hairs", while National's Mark Mitchell accidentally introduced himself as Park Matrick Mitchell, before correcting himself.</p>
        
            <p>The swearing-in follows weeks of coalition talks between National, ACT and New Zealand First.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon, Seymour and Peters fronted media last Friday to confirm how the new government would look and policies it would be delivering.</p>
        
            <p>The swearing-in ceremony is taking place at Government House in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
