            <p>Negotiations to form a government have concluded, a statement from the leaders of all three parties says. Christopher Luxon is expected to speak to media within the hour.</p>
        
            <p>The actual announcement of the details, and the signing, will be on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The statement - attributed to National's Christopher Luxon, ACT's David Seymour and NZ First's Winston Peters - was short.</p>
        
            <p>"Negotiations to form a government that will deliver for all New Zealanders have concluded," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The parties are now going through their respective party processes for final sign-off and we expect that process to be completed this evening.</p>
        
            <p>"Subject to agreement by all parties, a signing ceremony will take place tomorrow at Parliament."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was expected to speak to reporters at Parliament about 4.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>One of the last outstanding issues was who would be given the role of deputy prime minister. The solution remains unclear, but one option could be splitting the term with ACT holding the job for one half and New Zealand First, the other.</p>
        
            <p>Peters this afternoon rubbished the idea of co-deputies, a prospect which both Luxon and Seymour earlier declined to rule out.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never had a co-deputy prime minister ever," Peters told reporters this afternoon. "Why would we [be] starting?"</p>

            <p>The leaders of all three parties are now all in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>National's Christopher Luxon and ACT's David Seymour flew into the capital last night.</p>
        
            <p>Peters arrived in Wellington earlier this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking outside Treasury on the Terrace, he was asked whether a deal has been reached.</p>
        
            <p>"Well if that was the case, I would have told you", was his reply.</p>
        
            <p>Before any deal between the three parties can be finalised, it first has to go to their respective boards and caucuses for sign off.</p>
        
            <p>Peters did however, confirm that his party is no longer negotiating.</p>
        
            <p>"No - well think about it, you're not going to nail me down, this is not my first rodeo, right", he told reporters.</p>

            <p>Also speaking this afternoon, Seymour said he was "feeling very good about the future of the government".</p>
        
            <p>"We've come through a long, and I know many people would say too long a process, but it's come together to create a very good deal and with some 'i's' and 't's' I think we'll be in a position to form that government.</p>
        
            <p>"But obviously I'm not in a position to say the exact details of that or what any outstanding tasks or issues might be."</p>
