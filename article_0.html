            <p>Two people have been spotted alive in the water off Gisborne - but they have since been lost to sight.</p>
        
            <p>A search was launched yesterday afternoon after a fishing boat with three people on board was reported overdue.</p>
        
            <p>The alert was initially raised to police just before 4pm on 24 June. It was not known where the party was when police were notified by a concerned contact of the fishing party.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre said this afternoon, a container vessel, the African Tiger spotted two people in the water off the Māhia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>They could no longer be seen but searchers were urgently trying to find them again and rescue them.</p>
        
            <p>Its operation's manager Michael Clulow said vessels had been sent to the location.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working as quickly as possible to relocate and rescue these people in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been in the water for a long-time now, and will be cold and tired."</p>
        
            <p>Weather conditions in the area were atrocious, making it extremely difficult for responders on the water and in the air, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking at a number of ways to try and safely get these people out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those caught up in this rapidly evolving situation and are taking all practical steps to save lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>This response was being supported by the NZDF, Napier Harbour Tugs, NZ Coastguard and rescue helicopter providers.</p>
        
            <p>Tatapouri fishing club president Roger Faber raised the alarm just before 4pm when the boat failed to return to shore.</p>
        
            <p>Three boats had headed out together Monday morning, with Faber on board one of them. Two boats - his included - decided to "pull the pin" about 11am in deteriorating weather conditions, and tried to get in touch with the now missing boat to let them know, but did not hear back.</p>
        
            <p>Faber's last communication with the missing boat was about 9.30am Monday, when they told him of their plans to head towards Māhia.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hoping that they've been pushed ashore down that way somewhere, and are sitting on shore where there's no communications, and they're found down there," he told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>The whānau of the three men were down by the boat ramp in Gisborne's inner harbour, Faber said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all coming back to the fishing club for a coffee, and it's really just a matter of sitting with fingers crossed, hoping for some good news."</p>
        
            <p>Initially, it was believed there were two people onboard the 7m vessel, but RCCNZ subsequently confirmed there three people were onboard.</p>
        
            <p>Faber said those missing were members of the club and "very experienced" fishermen.</p>
        
            <p>"They do know what they're doing, they're out there regularly."</p>
        
            <p>This response was being supported by the NZDF, Napier Harbour Tugs, NZ Coastguard and rescue helicopter providers.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, a NZDF P8 Poseidon undertook a radar search off Poverty Bay, Northern Hawke's Bay, and the Māhia Peninsula.</p>
