            <p>An engineer who forged the signatures of two higher-qualified colleagues in a wide-scale fraud has been sent to jail for four and a half years.</p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Beau Hall was sentenced today in the Rotorua District Court on 112 counts of forgery affecting 946 houses and 39 councils across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The engineering technologist signed off on house designs when he was not qualified to by using the identities of his supervisors.</p>
        
            <p>He then submitted the documents to councils for consent.</p>
        
            <p>The fraud was estimated by Hall to have cost $558,000 but Judge Greg Hollister-Jones believed the true cost to be in the millions.</p>
