            <p>An off-duty police officer who died after being hit by a car is being remembered as a "genuine soul".</p>
        
            <p>The woman was walking her dogs on Saturday afternoon when she was struck in Helena Bay, north of Whangārei, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the intersection of Webb Road and Russell Road about 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the car left the road and crashed into a power pole before hitting a pedestrian, who died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The driver sustained minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The police officer, a constable based in the Far North, has been remembered by whānau and workmates as "instrumental" in the Te Tai Tokerau community.</p>
        
            <p>"A person who was true to herself and stood up for what she believed in and loved her family more than anything in the world," one social media post read.</p>
        
            <p>"A genuine soul that will be sadly missed by us ... and all those who worked with her."</p>
        
            <p>The officer was a loving mother and grandmother, her whānau said.</p>
        
            <p>A message posted online on behalf of her daughter read: "I will love you and will miss you forever and always."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said their hearts went out to the officer's family and friends, who were receiving support.</p>
        
            <p>"Their passing is a tragic loss for our community and the impact will be keenly felt.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working to ensure our staff can access the support they need at this difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>The name of the officer has not yet been released by police.</p>
