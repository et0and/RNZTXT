            <p>The chief executive of Wellington Water Tonia Haskell is stepping down in the wake of a scathing report.</p>
        
            <p>Haskell has been in the role since early 2023 and will finish up on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after an independent report into the entity that found staff took four months to tell the region's councils about a budget error leaving a $51m bill over three years.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider's board chair Nick Leggett said Haskell had helped grow the capital programme for water assets and was admired fronting media on difficult issues.</p>
        
            <p>"In her time at Wellington Water, the capital programme delivering water assets for the region had grown from $60m to $330m in the last financial year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water's board will begin the process to appoint a new chief executive in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"Working for Wellington Water has been a privilege," Haskell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The team at Wellington Water, its supplier whƒÅnau and partners are incredibly smart, hard-working and dedicated to improving water outcomes for the region. I am proud to have been part of that."</p>
