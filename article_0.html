        <h2>Live updates: Democrats throw support behind Kamala Harris</h2>
        <p>
US Vice President Kamala Harris says she's honoured to have Joe Biden's support after the president dropped out of the 2024 election race.
</p>
        
            <p>Democrats are consolidating their support around Kamala Harris, after US President Joe Biden dropped his faltering re-election bid on Sunday amid intensifying opposition within his own Democratic Party.</p>
        
            <p>He endorsed Harris, his vice president, to replace him as the party's candidate against Republican Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Biden, 81, in a post on X said he would remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025. He has not been seen in public since testing positive for Covid-19 last week.</p>
        
            <p>If officially nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run to lead a major-party ticket in US history. A former attorney general of California and former US senator, she ran unsuccessfully for president against Biden in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"My intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump."</p>
        
            <p>All 50 Democratic party state chairs have thrown their weight behind Harris to be the party's new presidential nominee, according to sources familiar with the matter. The chairs held a conference call on Sunday after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside as the party's candidate. There was "full support" in backing Harris to be at the top of the ticket, one source said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has paid tribute to Biden, saying he "has dedicated his life to public service, and that is something that deserves much respect".</p>
