        <p>
The watchdog says a merger would substantially hit competition and make it harder for other retailers to grow.

            <p>The Commerce Commission has declined Foodstuffs' proposal to merge its North Island and South Island divisions.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year the country's biggest supermarket operator proposed bringing the divisions together to create a national cooperative.</p>
        
            <p>The boards of Foodstuffs North and South Island divisions currently operate separately and run a number of well-known brands including New World, Pak'nSave and Four Square.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Commerce Commission declined the proposal saying it would substantially lessen competition.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, chair Dr John Small said it would reduce the number of buyers of grocery products in New Zealand from three to two giving it greater buying power.</p>
        
            <p>"As a consequence of the substantial lessening of competition and the associated increase in buyer power, the merged entity would likely be able to extract lower prices from suppliers and/or otherwise adversely impact suppliers in the relevant markets.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also concerned that the consolidation with the proposed merger would lead to reduced investment and innovation by suppliers, meaning reduced consumer choice and/or quality of grocery products in New Zealand for consumers."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would also make it harder for other retailers to grow, potentially depriving consumers of a more competitive grocery sector in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs' proposal required Commerce Commission and High Court approval.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission can only grant clearance to a deal when it is satisfied it will not result in a substantial lessening of competition.</p>
