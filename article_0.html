            <p>Two people have been spotted alive in the water off Gisborne - but they have since been lost to sight.</p>
        
            <p>A search was launched yesterday afternoon after a fishing boat with three people on board was reported overdue.</p>
        
            <p>The alert was initially raised to police just before 4pm on 24 June. It was not known where the party was when police were notified by a concerned contact of the fishing party.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre said this afternoon, a container vessel, the African Tiger spotted two people in the water off the Māhia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>They could no longer be seen but searchers were urgently trying to find them again and rescue them.</p>
        
            <p>Its operation's manager Michael Clulow said vessels had been sent to the location.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working as quickly as possible to relocate and rescue these people in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been in the water for a long-time now, and will be cold and tired."</p>
        
            <p>Weather conditions in the area were atrocious, making it extremely difficult for responders on the water and in the air, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking at a number of ways to try and safely get these people out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those caught up in this rapidly evolving situation and are taking all practical steps to save lives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>This response was being supported by the NZDF, Napier Harbour Tugs, NZ Coastguard and rescue helicopter providers.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
