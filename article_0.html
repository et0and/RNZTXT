            <p>Te Papa has announced it is reviewing a controversial exhibition, part of which was damaged by protesters last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Signs of a Nation Te Tiriti o Waitangi exhibition has been at the museum since opening day in 1998. It has been changed a number of times but this would be the first full review of it, Te Papa said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa co-leaders Tumu Whakarae / chief executive Courtney Johnston and Kaihautū / Māori co-leader Dr Arapata Hakiwai said today that the museum's Te Tiriti o Waitangi display would be "renewed".</p>
        
            <p>"The purpose of this exhibition is to provide space for conversations about the Treaty, and it needs to change to meet the needs of today.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Tiriti o Waitangi is important for all New Zealanders, and now is an appropriate time to move resource to this area."</p>
        
            <p>They noted that to do this work properly, which would include having conversations with various communities, would take time.</p>
        
            <p>They wanted discussions to be "authentic, honest and informed".</p>
        
            <p>The cost of changing long-running exhibitions had to be considered against the spending required to look after the 2 million items in the museum's care.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve people were arrested on 11 December after a wooden display panel showing an English version of the Treaty of Waitangi was damaged with spray paint and an angle grinder.</p>

            <p>Dr Hakiwai acknowledged the message that had been conveyed through the protest action.</p>
        
            <p>"We have heard the message of this protest action, and we have heard the many and varied responses to it."</p>

            <p>A 29-year-old man was charged with intentional damage, obstructing police, and breach of bail.</p>
        
            <p>A 53-year-old woman was charged with intentional damage.</p>
        
            <p>A 46-year-old man and 52-year old woman were charged with breach of bail.</p>
        
            <p>The exhibition panel defaced by protesters would remain on display at Te Papa over the summer break but would eventually be removed and stored, the museum said.</p>
        
            <p>No decision had been made on its longterm future.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached Te Papa with several questions about the announcement, however, a spokesperson said there would be no further comment.</p>
