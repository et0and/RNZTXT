            <p>A man wanted over a central Auckland fatal shooting has been found dead in or near Taupō.</p>
        
            <p>Police were searching for Hone Kay-Selwyn, 31, who they believed shot one person dead on Ponsonby Road on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>A source confirmed the discovery of the body to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>It is not known how Kay-Selwyn died.</p>
        
            <p>The Ponsonby Road shooting victim, who had been with a group of people at the time of the shooting, was found dead by police when they arrived at the scene, outside a bar.</p>
        
            <p>Police said multiple shots were fired by another man who had earlier been refused entry to the bar.</p>
        
            <p>The motivation behind the shooting was not yet clear, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not say whether the shooting was gang related. The identity of the victim was yet to be released by police.</p>
        
            <p>A woman, who said she was the partner of Kay-Selwyn, had expressed remorse for his actions.</p>
        
            <p>In a now deleted Facebook post earlier this week, she said her inbox had been "overflowing" with messages about her partner's actions on Sunday night in Ponsonby.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to express my sincerest condolences to the family and loved ones of the victim. I'm deeply sorry and feel a great sense of shame about the situation."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was "grappling" with the fact he had taken someone's life.</p>
        
            <p>When contacted by RNZ the woman did not want to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>Police would not comment directly on the social media post or confirm if they had spoken to the woman.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
