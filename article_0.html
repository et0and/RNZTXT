        <h2>Live: Southern hīkoi reaches Picton and heads for capital</h2>
        <p>
Hundreds of supporters lined the streets of towns in Te Waipounamu as the convoy passed through.
</p>
        
            <p>There's been a strong show of support for the South island hīkoi as it arrives in Picton, with participants due to unite with those already preparing to march on Parliament tomorrow</p>
        
            <p>Ōtautahi hīkoi organiser Teresa Butler says the trip up Te Waipounamu on Monday had been "amazing".</p>
        
            <p>"Every stop we have people join the hīkoi."</p>
        
            <p>Butler says she looks at her daughter, who is nine, and hopes she won't have to be campaigning for Māori sovereignity when she's an adult.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been fighting for over 200 years and I'm sick of it but I have to do it."</p>
        
            <p>There will be extra buses and train carriages to ease congestion in the capital as te Hīkoi mō te Tiriti arrives at Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>However, commuters are still being warned to still allow extra time for travel, and add one or even two hours to their trips.</p>
