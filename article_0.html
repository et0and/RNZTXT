            <p>Nearly 400 people have marched down the main street of Kaitāia in a show of support for Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>The peaceful march was part of a much longer hīkoi that left Te Rerenga Wairua, or Cape Reinga, at dawn on Thursday and is due to arrive at the Treaty Grounds on 6 February.</p>
        
            <p>It took place as leaders of more than 70 iwi from around the country were meeting government ministers at the Turner Centre in Kerikeri, where discussions were dominated by concerns about a proposed bill redefining the Treaty principles.</p>
        
            <p>Marchers held flags and banners proclaiming Toitū te Tiriti (Uphold the Treaty), sang waiata and chanted haka along the 1.5km route.</p>
        
            <p>One lane of Commerce Street was blocked from noon to about 1pm but there were no incidents or serious disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Those taking part ranged from primary school children to 88-year-old Emily Murray of Pukepoto.</p>

            <p>Organiser Rueben Taipari of Ahipara said the six-day Hīkoi ki Waitangi had been held almost every year since 1985.</p>
        
            <p>The aim was to bring people together, uphold the rights of mana whenua, and keep the Treaty alive.</p>
        
            <p>He also hoped the hīkoi would raise awareness of what he described as moves to "erase" Māori from Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>Lisa McNabb of Kaitāia said she was taking part to show her support for the hīkoi and its kaupapa [cause].</p>
        
            <p>"The message we are sending from here in Te Hiku is the kaupapa of keeping Te Tiriti as it is, not be to reviewed, but to keep hold of what has been put in place by previous governments - to hold fast to what we have today to continue for tomorrow," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaitāia leg of the march ended with a rally outside the Te Ahu Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Participants will stay tonight at Mahimaru Marae, near Ahipara, and march through Taipā and Mangōnui on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The theme of this year's hīkoi is Toitū He Whakaputanga, Toitū Te Tiriti (Uphold the Declaration of Independence, Uphold the Treaty).</p>
