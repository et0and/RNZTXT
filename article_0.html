            <p>A couple who missed out on a 2.55 percent interest rate and had to instead fix their mortgage at a rate of 4.1 percent have been awarded compensation from their mortgage advisor.</p>
        
            <p>The case was dealt with by Financial Services Complaints, an external complaints resolution service that deals with issues that cannot be resolved between a client and service provider directly.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's loan came up to refix in mid-2021, when rates were near historic lows.</p>
        
            <p>They selected a rate of 2.55 percent and told their mortgage advisor, but he failed to pass on the instructions to the lender and the loan was not fixed.</p>
        
            <p>In November of that year they discovered their loan was floating and contacted the advisor.</p>
        
            <p>But by then, rates had risen significantly.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said the advisor first thought the lender was at fault but then accepted responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>In December, the couple fixed their loan for two years at 4.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The advisor and clients agreed in February he would pay them compensation of $12,000 at $500 a month for 24 months. This represented the difference in what they were paying in interest as a result of having fixed in December rather than mid-year.</p>
        
            <p>The advisor made 10 payments before stopping, having paid a total of $5500.</p>
        
            <p>The couple tried to contact the advisor through May and June 2023 but received no further payment.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said the advisor had breached the agreement with the client and it was reasonable for him to pay another $6500. But he did not make the payment until four weeks after FSCL sent a settlement form.</p>
        
            <p>Financial Advice NZ chief executive Nick Hakes, which represents advisors including mortgage brokers, said complaining to a service such as FSCL was the appropriate response in this situation.</p>
        
            <p>He said the case seemed to be one where something had gone wrong with the advisor's process and he might not have been operating within a broader framework.</p>
        
            <p>People who were considering engaging a mortgage advisor should do some research, he said. The association has a "find an advisor" function on its website, he said, and those advisors would be subject to obligations beyond the minimum requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"Come prepared with questions. It's a two-way relationship when you're sitting down, having to talk about something that can be quite scary initially, talking about your financial situation, goals, dreams and aspirations."</p>
        
            <p>He said people should also ask about an advisor's process, what they should expect and whether the adviser had helped other people in a similar position.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of advisors would call that a discovery meeting or a fact find, it's about building confidence in each other that we can form a good relationship and drive good financial outcomes in the future."</p>
