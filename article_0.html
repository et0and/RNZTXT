            <p>Average Wellington house values have plummeted nearly 25 percent over three years, according to latest official valuations.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City property owners will soon get their new ratings valuations which were recorded 1 September 2024.</p>
        
            <p>On average compared to the 2021 valuations, the value of residential housing had decreased 24.4 percent with the average house value now sitting at $1,086,000.</p>
        
            <p>The average land land value decreased 36.7 percent to an average of $621,000 over the same period.</p>
        
            <p>QV chief operating officer David Nagel said rating valuations were like a snapshot of the market at a point in time.</p>
        
            <p>"When these were last set, back in 2021, the market was obviously rising very quickly, buoyed by record low interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"It then experienced some steep declines in 2022, influenced by higher interest rates and tighter credit conditions, as well as a higher rate of inflation and unemployment."</p>
        
            <p>He said the latest valuations were reflective of a market that was still being affected by strong economic headwinds.</p>
        
            <p>"Sales volumes have reduced, and sentiment has changed markedly from being a sellers' market to being a buyers' one."</p>
        
            <p>Commercial property values decreased by 21 percent , and property values in the industrial sector have decreased by 12.2 percent since the city's last rating valuation in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council's manager of financial operations Michael Nyamudeza said it was important that property owners remember that a change in the rating valuation of a property does not mean rates will change by a similar percentage.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council used property values to allocate the rates it needed to collect across all ratepayers - it did not collect more rates because values had increased, and it did not collect less rates if values had decreased.</p>
        
            <p>Rates increases for each property depends on a range of factors, including:</p>
