        <h2>Watch live: All eyes on Willis speech ahead of Budget</h2>
        <p>
Finance Ministers have used past pre-Budget speeches to reveal where savings have been found and what rules have been set.
</p>
        
            <p>The speech will be livestreamed at the top of this page from about 7.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis is making a pre-Budget speech to the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce in Stokes Valley.</p>
        
            <p>The government's Budget will be unveiled on 30 May.</p>
        
            <p>Previous finance ministers have used pre-Budget speeches to reveal where some savings have been found, and the fiscal rules they have set themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said her speech would focus on the short, medium, and long-term goals of the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>The Budget is expected to lay out the government's tax relief package and Willis earlier said it would also include plans to rebuild business confidence and restore the Crown's finances.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, figures released by Treasury indicated the government books were worsening as the tax take fell.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury figures show a deficit of $5.04 billion for the nine months ended March, $619 million more than forecast in the December financial update.</p>
        
            <p>However, Willis has said tax cuts in the Budget would be fully funded and would go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>In a pre-Budget statement earlier this month, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Education Minister Erica Stanford announced that from next year the government expected all public schools to teach students to read in a "proven literacy approach".</p>
