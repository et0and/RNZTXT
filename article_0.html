            <p>The West Coast is today expected to get the worst of the torrential rain that has been drenching parts of the region since Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said up to 450mm of rain hit Westland on Wednesday and another 350mm is forecast by 9pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>There was still a chance the current orange warning could be upgraded to red, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a lull in the rain late on Wednesday, West Coast Civil Defence is urging people not to become complacent, and to take weather warnings seriously.</p>
        
            <p>SH6 from Franz Josef to Makarora - the only direct route between the West Coast and Otago - was closed overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The Waiho River at SH6 is back up to 8m breaching an alert level.</p>
        
            <p>There are now eight orange heavy rain warnings in the South Island, and one in Taranaki which ends on Friday morning.</p>
