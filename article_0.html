        <h2>Live: Tyre blowout sent truck through barrier in triple fatal crash</h2>
        <p>
Police have called some bystanders' filming of the aftermath "disgusting", and have explained how the truck collided with a van on the wrong side of SH1.
</p>
        
            <p>A truck blew a tyre, crashed through a barrier and hit a van carrying six people - along with two other cars - in collision that killed three people, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The victims of the crash on State Highway 1 in Auckland include two people believed to be seasonal workers, while three more are in hospital, one with critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Counties Manukau Road Policing Manager, Inspector Tony Wakelin on Tuesday explained how the crash occured on Monday, adding the victims were 45, 37 and 32-years-old.</p>
        
            <p>Wakelin applauded members of the public who jumped in to help, but he was highly critical of people who had filmed the aftermath of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought that was disgusting. It really was. I saw some of the footage. It was filmed before emergency services arrived," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I say to the people who were doing that: 'How would you feel if that was your family?"</p>
