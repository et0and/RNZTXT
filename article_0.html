            <p>The Uawa Tolaga Bay Civil Defence manager says severe wind conditions are the worst he has seen in a long time.</p>
        
            <p>Greg Shelton said high winds have downed trees and cut power to a lot of homes, as the region was hammered by severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>A team of eight would work through the night and be relieved by a fresh group of 10 tomorrow morning, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, these are probably the worst conditions, wind wise, I've seen for a long, long time.</p>
        
            <p>"We're expecting a lot of damage from the wind, more than anything.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say in the morning we're going to be faced with some pretty ugly scenes."</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne's emergency sewer valve has been opened due to fears of sewage overflowing back into homes and onto roads.</p>
        
            <p>The council has established an emergency centre in Tolaga Bay school and issued a flood warning for nearby Hikuwai River near Willow Flat.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence officer Greg Shelton said the river level was nearing nine metres, but its banks could handle up to 13 metres.</p>
        
            <p>There were orange heavy rain warnings for Gisborne/Tai R훮whiti about and south of Ruatoria and Hawke's Bay north and south of SH5.</p>
        
            <p>An orange strong wind warning was also in place for Gisborne/Tai R훮whiti and Hawke's Bay from Wairoa northwards, including M훮hia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Severe gale southerlies could reach 120 km/h in exposed places, MetService said, with the strongest winds are expected in coastal places.</p>
        
            <p>At 3pm, there was 44mm of rain recorded at Gisborne Airport, according to the Gisborne District Council.</p>
        
            <p> Radar update In the last 6 hours (9am-3pm): 59mm of rain at the GDC station in Hikuwai 38.8mm Tolaga Bay 37.2mm Gisborne Airport Severe Weather Warnings are in force. Stay up to date: https://t.co/qHyE5zzql5 pic.twitter.com/K2WjdSuxZe</p>
        
            <p>The council said the city's wastewater system has been flooded with intense rain draining from residential homes.</p>
        
            <p>Ground water levels had already very high due to rain that started at the weekend, and combined with more rain today has resulted in surface flooding finding its way into the sewer, it said.</p>
        
            <p>To stop sewage overflowing back into homes and onto roads, the council had to release the excess water.</p>
        
            <p>It opened the emergency sewer valve at Gladstone Road into the Turanganui River at 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Scour valves to the Taruheru River were opened at Palmerston Road and at Oak Street at 3pm and at Owen Road into the Waimata river at 3.08pm.</p>
        
            <p>"We only open the valve when it's absolutely necessary and only in the areas with issues.</p>
        
            <p>"The discharge is highly diluted with rain water, but still poses a health risk.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll notify the Hauora Tair훮whiti Medical Officer of Health, water user and sports groups," the council said.</p>
        
            <p>Temporary warning signs would be installed and the council advised no swimming, fishing or gathering shellfish in rivers and beaches until at least five days after the valves were closed and warning signs were removed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the council said Tiniroto Road was closing overnight at the bluffs from 7pm, with contractors scheduled to inspect it tomorrow at 7am to make a decision on reopening it.</p>
        
            <p>SH35 was also closed between Anaura Road and Mata Road, Mangatuna.</p>
        
            <p>There were also slips south of Tutira on State Highway Two from Wairoa to Napier.</p>
