            <p>A man was killed and three wounded in Auckland's Grey Lynn, in what police say was a fight between two groups that started as broken windows and escalated.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Tuarangi Road at 6.49pm on Thursday after reports of gunfire.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found with critical injuries and despite first aid being administered, he died at the scene. Police have declined to name the victim but tributes posted by family to social media names the 18-year-old as Maxwel-Dee Repia.</p>
        
            <p>Three others were also shot and injured. Armed officers have been guarding the scene on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>At a press conference, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said the shooting had been part of an ongoing 'neighbourhood dispute' between two groups that had begun with property damage - including broken windows - and escalated.</p>
        
            <p>"What we know at this point was that an altercation was taking place between two groups that led to a firearm being produced and discharged.</p>
        
            <p>"Immediately after the shots were discharged those who were present fled the area.</p>
        
            <p>"Both groups appear to be known to each other and we believe this relates to an ongoing neighbourhood dispute between the groups."</p>

            <p>Last night's incident started at the front of a property and the deceased man died on the roadside, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The dispute between the two groups started as early as March this year and this will form part of the police investigation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday night was a chaotic series of events because people had fled the area - and although police did not yet have the exact number of people involved - it was likely more than a dozen, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the dispute escalated last night and "someone has tragically lost their life in a shocking display of violence".</p>
        
            <p>"This is a time for calm, this appalling violence will not be tolerated, there is a team of driven investigators who will be working hard to identify those who were present and hold those to account who are responsible for the death."</p>
        
            <p>Police had not yet located a murder weapon, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not aware of more than one firearm being used, nor whether anyone else had been injured, he said.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the man who died from his injuries, two people went to Auckland Hospital with gunshot wounds that night, one of them remains in a serious condition while the other is in a serious but stable condition, he said.</p>

            <p>A third man was brought to the police station to be spoken to as part of the investigation but it was discovered he had also been shot and he was also taken to hospital, Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>All three men were expected to undergo surgery on Friday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The victim's body was expected to be removed from the scene today and a post mortem examination is scheduled for Saturday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said police could not yet name the victim as the family were being given the chance to notify other whƒÅnau and friends.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the homicide inquiry police were also investigating a complaint of wilful damage to a house on Tuarangi Road earlier that afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police would continue to examine the scene over the weekend and staff would go door-to-door in the area, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to hear from people who were able to assist with the inquiry and who may have dash cam footage or CCTV, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information could contact police on 105 and quote file number 240905/81806 or Operation Comma, or information can be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800-555-111.</p>
