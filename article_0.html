            <p>Former prime minister Helen Clark will join her Labour Party colleagues at Tuurangawaewae Marae on Wednesday as politicians from across the political divide travel to Ngaaruawaahia to pay their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>Due to a pre-planned work trip to Malaysia and Korea, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was accommodated at the marae on Saturday. He flew out to Malaysia on Sunday and will not return to New Zealand until the end of the week.</p>
        
            <p>Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka accompanied Luxon along with former National prime minister Jenny Shipley, former deputy prime minister Sir Don McKinnon, and former governor-general Dame Silvia Cartwright.</p>
        
            <p>Winston Peters is acting prime minister this week and will lead the government contingent onto Tuurangawaewae on Wednesday afternoon. Speaker Gerry Brownlee and National deputy leader Nicola Willis will join him.</p>

            <p>ACT Party leader David Seymour will also attend, along with ministers Nicole McKee and Karen Chhour.</p>
        
            <p>The party did not attend Koroneihana - the anniversary of Tuheitia's coronation - a fortnight ago. It ended up being the last time political leaders met with Tuheitia before his death.</p>
        
            <p>Other National Party ministers due to attend on Wednesday are: Shane Reti, Paul Goldsmith, Mark Mitchell, and Andrew Bayly. New Zealand First's Shane Jones, Casey Costello, and Jenny Marcroft will also be there.</p>
        
            <p>Jones has been asked to speak on behalf of the government at the pōwhiri.</p>
        
            <p>There are two welcomes a day at Tuurangawaewae to cope with the thousands that have been arriving in Ngaaruawaahia daily.</p>

            <p>Labour is scheduled to be welcomed alongside other iwi at 8am on Wednesday morning while the coalition parties and the Greens will take part in the 2pm pōwhiri.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Hipkins will lead the Labour Party on to the marae alongside his Māori caucus, many of whom have already been at Tuurangawaewae this week.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins, Labour Māori caucus co-leader Willie Jackson and senior MP Peeni Henare are all expected to speak.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick and her caucus colleagues will pay their respects in the afternoon where both Swarbrick and MP Teanau Tuiono are due to speak.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MPs have already visited this week and been welcomed onto Tuurangawaewae alongside their own iwi, so will not be taking part in the political pōwhiri on Wednesday.</p>
