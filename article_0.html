        <h2>Live weather updates: Wairoa will struggle to pay for another rebuild - mayor</h2>
        <p>
Craig Little doesn't know how the town is going to get through the latest weather onslaught.
</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Mayor Craig Little says he doesn't know how the town is going to get through this latest onslaught from the weather, which has wound back the clock on repairs done after Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint it was "devastating", with some previously existing homes that had never been underwater getting submerged as well as new builds.</p>
        
            <p>"I just don't know how we're going to get through this one, to be quite honest… Time will tell… We're a poor community, and this is just another big kick, you know? … We can't keep flooding and costing this country millions of dollars."</p>
