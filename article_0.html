            <p>Police have decided not to take any action against National MP David MacLeod's failure to disclose $178,394 in donations.</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission referred the matter to police in June after the MP for New Plymouth had a month earlier unveiled what he called an "inadvertent error".</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they had "completed their enquiries into this matter and no further action will be taken" in a statement to RNZ on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The backbench MP had originally disclosed just $29,268 in donations from seven donors, but later amended it to $207,662 from 24 donors.</p>
        
            <p>In May MacLeod said he thought he was filing a return for the 2023 year only, so left out 18 donations he had received when he became a candidate the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>He also failed to disclose a $10,000 donation from 2023, which he said was a mistake he could not explain.</p>
        
            <p>MacLeod said he "always fully intended for these donations to be made public" and had never tried to hide them, having written to all donors indicating amounts over $1500 would be disclosed.</p>
        
            <p>The MP was immediately stood down from his roles on the environment and finance select committees by National leader and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>In May, Luxon said MacLeod's path back to select committee roles was up to him.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about him demonstrating he's a great member of the team - he is a valued member of our team - but he has work to do, and the way to do that is to show us he's a good local MP, championing for his people in New Plymouth and doing everything we ask of him in Parliament."</p>
        
            <p>It was the National Party that discovered the error when it was consolidating its annual accounts, which led to MacLeod conducting a full audit of his 2022 and 2023 expenses and donations.</p>
