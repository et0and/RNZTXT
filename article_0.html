            <p>New Zealand cyclists are expected to put up a good fight in the Olympic women's road race from midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Niamh Fisher-Black and Kim Cadzow will be among the pack. Cadzow came seventh in the women's time trial earlier this week and it's hoped one or both of the pair will finish in the top 10.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand's golfers face a tough day on the links as they battle to improve their standings on the final day of their Olympics competition.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Fox is in the middle of the pack and Daniel Hillier is at the bottom in the competition at Le Golf National.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, it was a day of despair in the athletics, with sprinter Zoe Hobbs failing to make the women's 100m final and shot putters Tom Walsh and Jacko Gill missing out on medals, Walsh with an injury.</p>
