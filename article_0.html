        <h2>Government pushes out police recruitment timeline</h2>
        <p>
The coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First said the parties would "commit to training no fewer than 500 new frontline police within the first two years".

Under questioning in Parliament, Police Minister Mark Mitchell said the government's policy to deliver 500 more police officers was three years, the coalition agreement had stated it would happen within two years.

            <p>The government has changed one of its coalition commitments, nine-and-a-half weeks since the dotted line was signed.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First said the parties would "commit to training no fewer than 500 new frontline police within the first two years".</p>
        
            <p>But under questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, Police Minister Mark Mitchell pushed out the timeline.</p>
        
            <p>"The government's policy is to deliver 500 additional police officers over the term of this government, which is three years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's police spokesperson Ginny Andersen accused the government of backtracking on one of its coalition promises.</p>
        
            <p>"National's coalition agreement with New Zealand First promises 500 new frontline police within two years, and today Mark Mitchell has walked away from that. That's a concern for all those other promises that are outlined in the coalition agreement," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell denied it was a walk-back, saying he had received advice in his Briefing to the Incoming Minister that there were issues around recruiting.</p>
        
            <p>"We discovered that it was difficult to fill existing recruit wings, that the Australians are here recruiting our police officers, and that we've got lots of senior police officers that are coming up to retirement," he told Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Association said it felt like déjà vu.</p>
        
            <p>A commitment by the previous government to add 1800 new officers was pushed out, after it failed to take attrition into account.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association president Chris Cahill said this time at least the government had admitted it early, rather than two years down the track, but he was still disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>"You can have the best of intentions in the world, but when you get there, you've got to be able to finance, and the reality of 'can you recruit these officers?'" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You're dead right, Australia's coming, and they're taking our officers, but one of the key reasons is because we're not paying them enough in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Andersen said the minister should not have needed official advice to know there were recruitment issues.</p>
        
            <p>"Mark Mitchell has had a lot of experience as a serving police officer. He knows this area very well. I find it difficult to believe that it took him coming into government to figure out the challenges with recruitment. This is a clear broken promise."</p>
        
            <p>During Question Time, Mitchell said the police was under severe financial pressure because of the actions of the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>He stood by a guarantee that the government's 6.5 percent 'back-office' public service cuts would not affect the frontline, or the promise to deliver those 500 new officers.</p>
        
            <p>But Andersen, who worked in the back-office before becoming an MP, doubted it.</p>
        
            <p>"I was a non-sworn, working in police when National was last in government. What happened was as non-sworn jobs went under National, that meant that frontline police officers were called in to do those jobs. It does take frontline police off the street when they cut those jobs in the offices," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Cahill said the biggest priority in order to boost recruitment and reduce attrition was paying officers, who had been waiting for a pay rise since July.</p>
        
            <p>He also wanted to know where the cuts would come from.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't see how you can cut the police budget by six-and-a-half percent and not have an effect on the frontline. We know that personnel makes up the vast majority of police budget personnel expenses. And even if that reflects in our police employee, non-sworn staff, that's going to have an impact on the frontline. So we're very concerned as to where those cuts would be coming from."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked both the police minister and New Zealand First when the decision was made to extend the timeline. Neither have responded.</p>
