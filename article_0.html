        <h2>Watch live: 'The country needs these projects' - 149 projects selected by Fast-track Approvals Bill</h2>
        <p>
The projects will help the economy, housing crisis and infrastructure deficits, Minister for Infrastructure Chris Bishop says.
</p>
        
            <p>A total of 149 projects have been selected for fast tracking through the government's new Fast-track Approvals Bill.</p>
        
            <p>According to Minister for Infrastructure Chris Bishop, they will help rebuild the economy, fix the housing crisis, improve energy security and address the country's infrastructure deficit.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about getting NZ moving and cutting through the red tape", he said in a press conference.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about jobs and growth."</p>
        
            <p>Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said the projects had been selected through a "thorough and robust" process. Final decisions were made by Cabinet after going through the Ministry for Environment and an independent advisory group.</p>
        
            <p>"The Fast-track Approvals Bill is a key part of the government's plan to rebuild our economy and cut through the red and green tape that has made it more and more difficult to build the projects New Zealand needs." Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, the 44 listed housing developments will enable up to 55,000 new homes to be consented in New Zealand's major growth centres and across our regions, playing a significant part in addressing New Zealand's housing crisis."</p>
        
            <p>There are also seven aquaculture and farming projects, 43 infrastructure projects, 22 renewable energy projects, and 11 mining projects.</p>

            <p>"Our regions and the New Zealanders living in them have enormous potential, and the fast-track projects, freed up from stifling consenting processes, are another change that is giving them back the wings they deserve," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"The projects will bring a big boost, and will help stimulate various industries, including the aquaculture, energy, housing, and mining sectors. This progress is going to help get things moving and flowing where it is needed, in the form of job creation, construction, new opportunities, and more business.</p>
        
            <p>However, the introduction of the bill has not been without its controversies.</p>
        
            <p>Ng훮ti Toa led a h카koi to Parliament in May to make clear its opposition to the bill.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people gathered on the forecourt, met by Crown Ministers Chris Bishop and Tama Potaka, as well as MPs from Labour, the Greens and Te P훮ti M훮ori.</p>
        
            <p>The government representatives received a box of submissions in opposition to the fast-track legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Other concerns including politicisation, consultation, appeals and trade also remain.</p>
