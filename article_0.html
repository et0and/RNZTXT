            <p>A 15-year-old boy is in a critical condition in Waikato Hospital after being targeted and run over by a car several times.</p>
        
            <p>The boy was walking on Old Taupiri Road near Ngāruawāhia about 5pm on Wednesday when he was struck by a car and run over more than once, Detective Inspector Darrell Harpur said.</p>
        
            <p>The car, a black Toyota Auris with registration number NBE817, was found abandoned at Pukemokemoke Bush Reserve near Tauhei.</p>
        
            <p>Harpur said police wanted to hear from anyone who saw the car between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Wednesday between Huntly and Taupiri.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this car - a black Toyota Auris with the registration number NBE817 - left the Huntly township at approximately 4.40pm on Wednesday 10 April and travelled to the Hopuhopu area."</p>
        
            <p>Police believe this was a targeted attack, and the driver of the car purposely struck the victim before then driving the car over him more than once, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police have set up a portal for images and short recordings to be uploaded into.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or larger quantities of footage can contact police on 105 quoting file number: 240410/3018.</p>
