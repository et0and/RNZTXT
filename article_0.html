            <p>Two men, one accused of murdering 18-year-old Ariki Rigby who was found in a burned-out car in a Hawke's Bay, can now be named.</p>
        
            <p>Jimmy Heremaia, 32, an orchard worker from Auckland, has been charged with her murder and with arson.</p>
        
            <p>Ropine Paul, 29, a labourer from Havelock North, is charged with being party to arson.</p>
        
            <p>In a judgment today, Justice Paul Radich said he was not convinced that naming the pair would risk a fair trial or endanger their safety.</p>
