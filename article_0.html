            <p>Treasury will on Tuesday release its half-year economic and fiscal update (HYEFU), which lays bare the state of the economy and the Treasury's outlooks and forecasts.</p>
        
            <p>It was widely expected to show a sluggish economy and weaker tax take will lead to bigger deficits for longer.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the HYEFU update the government and opposition were already blaming each other.</p>
