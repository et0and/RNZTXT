            <p>The All Whites are headed to the FIFA World Cup 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Their 3-0 win over a brave New Caledonia side was enough to book the trip next year to the USA, Canada and Mexico, with Michael Boxall, Kosta Barbarouses and Elijah Just finding the back of the net in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>However, Darren Bazeley's side was made to work hard for the result after a scoreless first half.</p>
        
            <p>The New Caledonians frustrated the All Whites before the break, clearly outlining their intentions with some physical play and desperate defending.</p>
        
            <p>The All Whites created plenty of chances, with star striker Chris Wood heavily involved, however an heroic goalkeeping display by Rocky Nyikéïne kept the game goalless at halftime.</p>
        
            <p>Ironically, after all the talk of his involvement, Wood's departure on the hour mark with a thigh injury proved to be a bit of a turning point.</p>
        
            <p>He was replaced by Kosta Barbarouses, then only moments later Michael Boxall headed home from a corner to give the All Whites the lead.</p>
        
            <p>The 25,000-strong crowd had barely found their seats when Barbarouses got clear on goal, finishing with a deft little chip over Nyikéïne to provide the killer blow.</p>
        
            <p>That moment seemed to take the wind out of the New Caledonian's sails, and the crowd could sense they start to celebrate and make plans to attend the World Cup next year.</p>
        
            <p>Elijah Just put an exclamation mark on the result in the 80th minute, with the full time whistle sending Eden Park into celebration mode.</p>
        
            <p>It's been the perfect campaign for Bazely, who can now start planning for a World Cup campaign.</p>
