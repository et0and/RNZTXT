            <p>The Ukrainian community in Aotearoa and supporters gathered on Saturday to mark the second year of the invasion.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the Ukrainian Gromada [community] of Wellington met at Civic Square at noon.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the rally said it was not only a commemoration, but a collective call for solidarity and remembrance.</p>

            <p>Lawrence Meredith, the European Union Ambassador to New Zealand, called Russia's 2022 invasion "brutal and illegal".</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand - like the European Union - stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukrainians fighting for democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Meredith said he hoped the event would send a strong signal. He welcomed the government's extension of the Defence Force's Ukrainian deployment and provision of another $26 million of support, saying it showed New Zealand stood with Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand, the European Union and many ambassadors both from the European Union and other countries - United States, United Kingdom - we all stand with the Ukrainian people because we believe in the fight for freedom, sovereignty and democracy."</p>

            <p>The rally came a day after the head of the United Nations called Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and 2022's invasion "an open wound at the heart of Europe".</p>
        
            <p>"It is high time for peace - a just peace, based on the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions," Ant√≥nio Guterres told the UN Security Council.</p>
        
            <p>"Many Ukrainians are experiencing the living nightmare of losing their children. All children that have been deported must be reunited with their families.</p>
        
            <p>"The war is also hurting the people of Russia. Thousands of young Russians are dying on the frontlines. Civilians hit by strikes on Russian cities are also suffering."</p>
