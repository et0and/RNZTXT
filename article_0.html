            <p>A former political figure found guilty of historical sexual abuse is taking his fight for further name suppression to the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who is not a sitting MP, abused two teenage boys he mentored at a sports club in the 1990s and has been found guilty on eight charges of sexual assault.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to be sentenced in November, but on Tuesday asked the court to give him further name suppression until then - his fifth such request.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown, both survivors, RNZ, Stuff and TVNZ all opposed the application, arguing fair trial rights were no longer an issue.</p>
        
            <p>The judge declined the application though the man's lawyer indicated he would appeal this decision, meaning name suppression rolls over until then.</p>
        
            <p>The man will be sentenced on 22 November.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
