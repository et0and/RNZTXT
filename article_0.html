            <p>Crews battling multiple wildfires that raged across Los Angeles today were up against a near-perfect storm: intense wind, low humidity and, most troubling for residents, inadequate supplies of water to contain the blazes.</p>
        
            <p>At least five people are dead and thousands have fled.</p>
        
            <p>People living in the heart of historic Hollywood were ordered to evacuate Wednesday as a new fire erupted just a few hundred metres from Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
        
            <p>"Immediate threat to life. This is a lawful order to LEAVE NOW. The area is lawfully closed to public access," the Los Angeles Fire Department posted alongside a map that included sections of the storied movie district.</p>
