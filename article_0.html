            <p>Recreational climbers were the first to respond after a 69-year-old rock climber died in a fall at Mount Arapiles in western Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand woman fell as she scaled the final section of a climb called Eskimo Nell.</p>
        
            <p>Mount Arapiles is a renowned rock climbing destination attracting outdoor climbers from across the world.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called around 3:30pm on Tuesday afternoon to Centenary Park Access Road.</p>
        
            <p>Climbing veteran Zorba Parer heard a cry and went to help.</p>
        
            <p>He free climbed 80 metres without a harness and rope and was the first person to reach the woman, while two other climbers followed him.</p>
        
            <p>Another two climbers went to the top to drop a rappel line and abseiled down 30 metres.</p>
        
            <p>"I could see a body wedged in the crack which didn't look good - it looked like she had fallen directly on the ledge," Parer said.</p>
        
            <p>"I scrambled up and checked on her. There was no pulse."</p>

            <p>Parer said it took him 20 minutes to reach the deceased climber.</p>
        
            <p>He then brought the climber's belay partner up, and together with the four other climbers, commenced CPR on the woman until paramedics arrived.</p>
        
            <p>He estimated the helicopter arrived about 20 minutes after that.</p>
        
            <p>While Parer was not able to help the climber who died, he was glad to assist her belayer and help emergency services find her.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know the lady … I think it's always easier than if you have a personal connection with someone … I certainly won't forget her now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A report will be prepared for the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Country Fire Authority (CFA) assistant chief fire officer Mark Gunning confirmed that by the time paramedics were able to get to the climber she had died.</p>
        
            <p>The CFA was part of a full emergency response led by Victoria police, including search and rescue from Melbourne, SES, Rescue Fire Victoria and Ambulance Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria's SES said that in the past 12 months, they had assisted emergency services in 11 rescues at Mount Arapiles.</p>
        
            <p>The last death from a fall at Mount Arapiles was in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Acting operations manager for the SES in the Wimmera Jordan Bush said they saw high-angle rescues quite regularly, which intensified from October to March when the weather was warmer.</p>
        
            <p>"This year has been probably an above average year in terms of how busy our high-angle rescue [team] has been," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Bush praised the capabilities of the local units, who were ready to go 24/7 with all their equipment.</p>
        
            <p>"We're pretty fortunate that in both SES and CFA, in the Natimuk and Horsham areas particularly … we've got a lot members that are recreational rock climbers or abseilers, just generally outdoorsy people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Bush said it was a timely reminder for climbers and abseilers to check their equipment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a great idea to make regular checks of gear a habit, and ensure any equipment you might use is actually fit for the task you're about to use it for," he said.</p>
