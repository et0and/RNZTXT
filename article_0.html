            <p>Some patients at Bay of Island Hospital in Kawakawa have had to be carried up and down stairs after the building's only lift broke down.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand's Te Tai Tokerau operations director Alex Pimm said the lift had been out of action since Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Technicians arrived Saturday, ordered replacement parts, and had been on site every day since.</p>
        
            <p>Pimm expected the lift to be back in service Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He said a few less-mobile patients have needed to be helped up and down stairs using manual handling equipment.</p>
        
            <p>No one has had to be transferred to Whangārei Hospital because of the broken lift, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"None of our patients who transferred to Whangārei Hospital did so because they were unable to use the stairs. Instead, they all required on-going clinical management or procedures that couldn't be provided at Bay of Islands Hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Pimm said the lift received regular maintenance from the hospital's service provider.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately breakdowns do occur on occasion. As we only have one lift in the building, when the lift is not working that does cause us some challenges."</p>
        
            <p>The hospital had remained open and patient appointments had continued during the breakdown.</p>
        
            <p>He said the hospital had robust protocols in place to manage patient care and building access during such events.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Islands Hospital made the news earlier this year when a dire shortage of after-hours doctors prompted staff to speak out about their concerns, despite a ban on talking to the media.</p>
