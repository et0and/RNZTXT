            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has won significant facetime with global heavyweight Narendra Modi on a frenetic full day in India where both pledged closer cooperation.</p>
        
            <p>But one significant difference between the nations was aired, with Modi calling out "anti-India activities by some illegal elements" in New Zealand, a reference to a Sikh activist group banned in India.</p>
        
            <p>While India's primie minister said he was "confident" the NZ government would take action, Luxon later told media he would not be cracking down on the Khalistan movement.</p>
        
            <p>It was a rare disagreement in what otherwise seemed a warm meeting between the two leaders, their second official sitdown, about an hour long.</p>
        
            <p>The two leaders - both known for their tactile approach - hugged when Luxon arrived at New Delhi's opulent Hyderabad House, and again after delivering prepared remarks to media.</p>
        
            <p>As well, they shared lunch and later a cup of tea before then visiting a prominent Sikh site Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib.</p>
        
            <p>There, they donned traditional headdresses and cleansed their feet before touring the temple.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told media he and Modi share "a really good connection".</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"We like each other," Luxon said. "We actually have a similar approach to how you run government and how you set targets and you drive towards delivery and outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>The countries agreed a slew of memoranda, pledging cooperation across defence, customs, horticulture, forestry and sports.</p>
        
            <p>Modi also committed to more cooperation over contentious matters like dairy and migration.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon joked they had avoided "major diplomatic incident" by not raising either side's cricketing record, prompting hearty laughter from Modi.</p>
        
            <p>Modi also borrowed some sporting terminology: "I'm confident that our partnership will prove to be a match-winning one for the people of both our nations."</p>
        
            <p>Towards the end of Modi's remarks, he noted both countries' cooperation against "terrorists, separatists and radical elements".</p>
        
            <p>"In this context, we have shared our concerns about anti-India activities by some illegal elements in New Zealand," Modi said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are confident that we will continue to receive the support of the New Zealand government in taking action against these illegal elements."</p>
        
            <p>Later speaking to media, Luxon said there was no suggestion the Khalistan movement had broken any laws.</p>

            <p>"We respect India's sovereignty, but we also have very strong free speech laws," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In a democracy, we expect people to be able to exercise free speech."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he had articulated that position both publicly and privately.</p>
        
            <p>The Khalistan movement advocates for the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands took part in an event in Auckland's Aotea Square late last year - organised by US-based separatist group Sikhs for Justice which is banned by the Indian government.</p>
        
            <p>After sharing lunch, both Modi and Luxon left for the opening of India's Raisina Dialogue, a prestigious geopolitics and security conference at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in New Delhi.</p>
        
            <p>As chief guest, Luxon delivered the opening speech and laid the praise on thick, commending Modi for "eliminating extreme poverty" in India.</p>
        
            <p>As well, Luxon laid out his commentary on the state of the world and particularly the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to live in an Indo-Pacific where countries are free to choose their own path free from interference. A region where no one country comes to dominate.</p>
        
            <p>"We find ourselves in a world that is growing more difficult and more complex, especially for smaller states. However, we must engage with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be."</p>
        
            <p>As well, Luxon reiterated his commitment to boost spending on defence.</p>

            <p>"We have a responsibility to invest in our own security as a downpayment on our future ability to choose our own path.</p>
        
            <p>"That is why New Zealand will be scaling up and doing more to support our own defence."</p>
        
            <p>The comments come at a volatile time in global politics with dramatic shifts in previously established power structures.</p>
        
            <p>In the United States, President Donald Trump is causing immense disruption to markets as he wages a series of trade wars.</p>
        
            <p>Trump's shifting position on the war in Ukraine has changed the face of that conflict.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, China has been increasingly flexing its influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>It recently caused alarm in New Zealand after Chinese warships conducted live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea with little advance warning.</p>
