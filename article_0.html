        <h2>Vegetables push through silt left by Gabrielle</h2>
        <p>
The thick blanket cloaking productive land across Hawke's Bay might not be as suffocating as once thought..

            <p>The thick blanket of silt cloaking productive land across Hawke's Bay might not be as suffocating as once thought, with some some vegetable crops pushing through the barrier.</p>
        
            <p>Horticulturalists are grappling with growing on silt-ridden land after Cyclone Gabrielle, so Plant and Food Research is on a mission to help them find out what crops could actually flourish, and helping their businesses do the same.</p>
        
            <p>NH Packing operations manager Hamish Thomas was growing on the company's Swamp Road land in rural Hastings - smack in the middle of the Ngaruroro and Tūtaekurī rivers, which are about four kilometres away either side.</p>
        
            <p>When they burst, the land was inundated, leaving a thick layer of silt in its wake.</p>
        
            <p>"We've looked at this property and said, well, the cost is too high to go and try and remove it," said Thomas.</p>
        
            <p>"So do we look at trying to use this as a positive, and in years to come, this land could be just as productive as it was."</p>

            <p>That's the nut Plant and Food Research scientist Dr Eduardo Dias de Oliveira is trying to crack.</p>
        
            <p>The NH Packing land has become a testing ground for him to help the industry figure out how to work with silt and get back on their feet faster.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have all the money in the world and you want to scrape it off, go for it - but, nobody does, right?" Dias de Oliveira said.</p>
        
            <p>"So how can we make decisions that are the best, with what we have ... and maybe just use the silt to our advantage."</p>
        
            <p>Growing has been a guessing game for many, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to test and do the experiments so they didn't have to.</p>
        
            <p>"Otherwise they would have to do the tests themselves, and use their own money, time, without knowing if they were going to get any crops back."</p>
        
            <p>
The scientist and grower were happy to see an abundance of bees pollinating the crops.

            <p>A range of crops - including maize, broccoli, peas and carrots - were planted in varying depths of silt, between 15cm and 50cm.</p>
        
            <p>So far, the maize was thriving.</p>
        
            <p>"Maize - being a crop with a big seed size and big root systems - is the crop that is looking better, more promising, in these first stages," Dias de Oliveira said.</p>
        
            <p>Broccoli was looking good, too - but peas and carrots were not faring as well, struggling to push their roots through the silt to reach the soil below.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially carrots, they need a finer soil structure to grow and emerge, and it looks like the silt was too coarse for them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>All that knowledge would be gold for growers, said Thomas.</p>

            <p>"It's definitely good to see what's able to be grown in what we thought was going to be pretty unproductive land.</p>
        
            <p>"Getting some information to understand what that then means from a commercial scale yield, quality, I think that's going to be really important."</p>
        
            <p>It would also prepare growers for the next Gabrielle - helping them understand what they might be able to plant immediately, and potentially avoid the costly and time-intensive process of trucking silt off the land.</p>
        
            <p>The final harvest and results are expected by the end of March.</p>
