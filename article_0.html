            <p>Auckland councillors have voted to endorse a redevelopment of Eden Park in a debate over the future of the city's stadiums.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors spent Thursday afternoon weighing up the Eden Park proposal - which would ask for $100 million of public money from government - or a brand new waterfront stadium precinct.</p>
        
            <p>All but two councillors voted to give the Eden Park 2.0 project the green light to develop a business case.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Shane Henderson, who led the working group, said there had been decades of debate on the stadium and Aucklanders would be glad to see a decision.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor John Watson said a decision on Thursday may not seal the deal for a future stadium if the proposals don't have financial backing.</p>
        
            <p>The two proposals to be voted on today both rely on public funding.</p>
        
            <p>But Watson said Auckland Council is not putting any money into the proposals and will have no part in the planning or future running of a stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors want the government to provide funding, however, Minister for Auckland Simeon Brown said the government's focus was freeing up planning and consenting red tape.</p>
        
            <p>Official advice from council staff is far from confident in the proposals - with both not feasible without significant public funding, they have concluded.</p>
