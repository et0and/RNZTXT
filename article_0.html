            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington has triumphed in the great Paris Olympics showdown on the water.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa won the K1 500m at the Tokyo Olympics, however, Aimee Fisher had beaten her at the distance twice this year, including at the last regatta before the Olympics, in Poland in late May.</p>
        
            <p>But Fisher was not strong enough in the final, and Dame Lisa swept to victory to claim her eighth Olympic gold medal, with Fisher coming in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Golfer Lydia Ko is also chasing gold in the women's tournament. She headed into the final round tied for first with Switzerland's Morgane MÃ©traux, but moved into outright gold medal position after the third hole.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Hamish Kerr is hoping to become the first New Zealander to claim a high jump medal  in his final at 5.10am Sunday.</p>
