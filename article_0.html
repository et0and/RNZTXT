        <h2>Explainer: Why the Aurora Australis isn't just a pretty light show</h2>
        <p>
The Southern Lights look set to continue overnight - but why are they so colourful? And how do they affect the climate?

            <p>People across Aotearoa have been given a rare glimpse into the mechanics of the Sun and its effects on our planet this weekend, after a strong solar storm caused aurora to be visible across vast swathes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>
        
            <p>The solar storm spurred infrastructure companies, including Transpower, to issue warnings and take steps to minimise any disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists agree that the Sun is undergoing a period of intense activity, which occurs in 11-year cycles.</p>
        
            <p>Solar flares and coronal eruptions have been detected by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in the United States, which has been tracking several flares from a cluster of sunspots since 8 May.</p>
        
            <p>The cluster is estimated to be 16 to 17 times the diameter of the Earth and led to the first severe warning since 2005.</p>

            <p>Otago University physics Professor Craig Rodger told RNZ that despite the storm reaching G5 - the top of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) SWPC scale for geomagnetic storms - it had only just done so.</p>
        
            <p>It was the largest such solar storm for more than a decade in New Zealand - but not as big as those of 2003 or 2001, and he said we had learned a lot since then.</p>
        
            <p>Rodger had been working on understanding and modelling the impacts of a severe solar storm on New Zealand's electricity grid.</p>
        
            <p>The current storm was smaller than the one in 2001, which knocked out a power transformer in Dunedin - an event also known as a geomagnetically induced current hot spot.</p>
        
            <p>Usually, particles from solar flares bounce off the Earth's magnetic field, but when there is a severe eruption, they can penetrate the ionosphere and interact with gases around the magnetic poles - causing the ribbons of colour.</p>
        
            <p>Auroras are usually confined to certain latitudes in the north and south, which makes them relatively rare to observe for most of the population.</p>
        
            <p>The pinks, purples and greens that are often associated with aurora are the particles interacting with different gasses. Simply put, oxygen - which emits greenish-yellow or red light - and nitrogen - which emits blue light - in the upper atmosphere release specific colours when bombarded by solar radiation.</p>
        
            <p>Atoms, molecules and ions in the atmosphere are excited by the electrically charged particles and, in turn, release photons - which is the light we see.</p>

            <p>This might sound like an oxymoron, but black aurora are nevertheless a real and unusual phenomenon.</p>
        
            <p>Black aurora often form in bands, curls and sometimes blobs in the centre of more colourful aurora. According to the European Space Agency, these "anti-aurora" form when particles are pushed up out of the ionosphere rather than down to collide with gasses in the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>The sun's impact on Earth is clear, but geomagnetic storms, while looking pretty, also affect our climate.</p>
        
            <p>Writing in The Conversation, Associate Professor in in Geophysics Annika Seppälä at the University of Otago explains how molecules in the atmosphere are ionised as a result of intense amounts of solar particles, which sets off a chain reaction - producing chemicals that impact the ozone layer.</p>
        
            <p>The depletion in ozone causes serious and globally felt changes to rainfall patterns and sea surface temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>Some people have reported a hissing or clapping sound associated with auroras.</p>
        
            <p>While these have traditionally been dismissed by scientists, a 2016 Finnish study claimed to have found that the Northern Lights did make a sound audible to the human ear. One researcher claimed that they even captured a recording of these sounds.</p>
        
            <p>There's a good possibility you may be able to catch another showing of the Aurora Australis in certain parts of Aotearoa on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>While parts of the deep south will likely be covered in cloud, central parts of the South Island, Bay of Plenty and the Coromandel are forecast for clear skies.</p>
        
            <p> Aurora-viewers: here's our cloud cover forecast for 9pm Sunday.Where it's clear, the aurora may be visible, including much of the South Island & parts of the North Island.Wellington is forecast to have less cloud cover than last night but Auckland is forecast to have more. https://t.co/SGtS8ndVvV pic.twitter.com/0yHB2bNRWX</p>
