            <p>Deputy harbourmaster Patrick Atwood said he was told that the sole passenger on the first East by West ferry crossing from Queens Wharf to Days Bay on Friday morning was no longer on board when the vessel reached the dock.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report the odds were not in favour of the missing person.</p>
        
            <p>It was a cold morning in Wellington and "when they noticed the person was missing, it was still dark", he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the police maritime unit, Coastguard and a number of other vessels were searching for the person.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything that was available was thrown at it. I've been told it was around a dozen vessels that took part plus helicopters - a substantial effort was made to try and locate this person.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is that [the person] was on the boat."</p>
        
            <p>He could not say where in the harbour the person could have gone missing.</p>
        
            <p>The East by West ferry website shows the first ferry departs Wellington city at 6am.</p>
        
            <p>East by West ferries from the city to Days Bay have been cancelled on Friday morning due to the search.</p>

            <p>Wellington woman Rebecca Sim who was trying to catch the ferry said it was about to dock before its warning lights suddenly came on and it sped away.</p>
        
            <p>She and others waiting for the ferry saw it doing circles out on the harbour. Sim she caught a bus to work instead.</p>
        
            <p>East by West Ferry says the search is from the middle of the harbour to Days Bay and is wide.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry company said it needed to complete the search before determining what had happened.</p>
