            <p>Nearly every member of the Comanchero motorcycle gang in New Zealand is facing criminal charges after a three-year police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said a total of 137 charges have been laid against the gang's members and associates.</p>
        
            <p>These included 17 "office" holders, 10 patched members and 14 gang prospects.</p>

            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the disruption and dismantling of the gang would make a big dent in the Comanchero's ability to conduct significant serious criminal offending moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>"From the very beginning, there has been a multi-agency effort to continuously target, disrupt and enforce criminal activity that has been taking place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has resulted in significant criminal prosecution cases as well as assets and profits being stripped away from their grasp."</p>
        
            <p>Police worked alongside Customs, Corrections and Inland Revenue as part of the investigations.</p>
        
            <p>The Comancheros gang insignia was taken down from its Christchurch headquarters in Woolston a week after the city's entire chapter was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>It was the culmination of an eight-month investigation, called Operation Avon, that targeted regular cash and drug runs between Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the Comancheros were responsible for the majority of Class A drugs coming into Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
