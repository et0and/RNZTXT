            <p>Rampaging wildfires around Los Angeles have killed at least two people and caused a "significant number" of serious injuries, officials tackling the terrifying blazes said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 buildings have burned in multiple wildfires that have erupted around America's second biggest city, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.</p>
        
            <p>Hurricane-force winds have whipped up fireballs that have leapt from home to home in the upmarket Pacific Palisades area, torching a swathe of California's most desirable real estate.</p>
        
            <p>"We have well over 5000 acres (2000 hectares) that have burned, and the fire is growing," Los Angeles Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We have no percentage of containment. We have an estimated 1000 structures destroyed... and a high number of significant injuries to residents who did not evacuate."</p>

            <p>A second major fire was burning around Altadena, north of the city, where footage showed flames consuming whole streets.</p>
        
            <p>"We have over 2000 acres burning at this time, and the fire continues to grow with zero percent containment," Marrone said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have over 500 personnel assigned, and unfortunately, we have two reported fatalities to civilians, unknown cause at this time. And we do have a number of significant injuries. We have over 100 structures destroyed."</p>

            <p>Two other blazes in the area were also stretching resources.</p>
        
            <p>Vicious gusts were pushing the flames, whipping red-hot embers hundreds of metres, sparking new spot fires faster than firefighters could quell them.</p>
        
            <p>As dawn broke, a vast pall of smoke was visible over Los Angeles, with the acrid tang of burning in the air.</p>
        
            <p>City mayor Karen Bass warned that the "windstorm is expected to worsen through the morning" in a post on X early on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Some firefighters were facing water shortages at hydrants in the Palisades, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>
        
            <p>Emmy-award-winning actor James Woods posted a video showing flames engulfing trees and bushes near his home as he evacuated, adding all the fire alarms were going off.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't believe our lovely little home in the hills held on this long. It feels like losing a loved one," Woods said.</p>
        
            <p>The first wildfire erupted on Tuesday morning and spread quickly, taking many residents by surprise.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Palisades resident Andrew Hires told AFP he got a text alerting him to the fire as his child was at the dentist about to have a tooth extracted.</p>
        
            <p>"We pulled off the mask and ran to the car," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Trees and vegetation around the Getty Villa were burned, but the structure and collections were spared, the museum said.</p>
        
            <p>The Getty, set up by US oil billionaire and collector J Paul Getty and one of the world's richest art museums, houses Greek and Roman antiquities in a replica Roman country home.</p>
        
            <p>The fire came as the area was being hit by seasonal Santa Ana winds that forecasters said could develop into the worst windstorm in a decade, with gusts of up to 160km/h.</p>
        
            <p>"This looks pretty concerning," said meteorologist Daniel Swain.</p>
        
            <p>Wildfires are part of life in the US West and play a vital role in nature.</p>
        
            <p>But scientists say human-caused climate change is altering weather patterns.</p>
        
            <p>Southern California had two decades of drought that were followed by two exceptionally wet years, which sparked furious vegetative growth - leaving the region packed with fuel and primed to burn.</p>
