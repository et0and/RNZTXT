            <p>Christchurch residents reported hearing raised voices before a man's body was found in the street.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation is under way after the 38-year-old man's body was found on Carisbrooke Street, in the eastern suburb of Aranui on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves told Morning Report the unusual noises reported to the police were raised voices.</p>
        
            <p>"Which caused enough alarm for someone to go out and investigate or decide to make a call to police and then to ambulance," Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>The community was feeling a bit unsettled, but there was a strong police presence in the area and they would remain there until this was resolved, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're feeling really shocked about what's happened in and around their street. It's certainly not normal behaviour. But ... everyone's been really cooperative with police, really helpful."</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking for sightings of a White 2006 Toyota Crown sedan (licence plate LEQ895), which may have been driven by the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said police had made a lot of progress.</p>
        
            <p>Police had receive a substantial amount of information from the public about the whereabouts of the car and were also examining CCTV footage from the area.</p>
        
            <p>A forensic post mortem would be held on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the community is reeling after the death.</p>
        
            <p>Narelle works in the area as a pastoral leader for children and families at Revive Christchurch, and said it was a shocking start to the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We had this celebration really of the Aranui community at the beginning of December [2023], and so it's a big contrast to begin the year with a homicide in our community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know there will be a lot of people feeling unsettled and concerned, and just feeling very sad. My aroha goes out to all the whƒÅnau involved."</p>
        
            <p>Narelle said the community would be following the investigation closely.</p>
        
            <p>"Just holding their breath I guess thinking- am I going to know this person? am I going to know this family that's going to be impacted?"</p>
        
            <p>"I do know that there's a lot of support services in the Aranui community, and I'm sure that those are going to kick in to support families and the community that's been affected," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tina Harding, who runs the Aranui and Wainoni Community Facebook page, said posts flooded in Thursday morning about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"People I've talked to say they're shocked and they're sad, and that you don't think it would happen in your own backyard," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Local community board (Waitai Coastal-Burwood-Linwood Community Board) member Tim Baker lived in Aranui for more than 50 years. He told RNZ he was saddened by what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always been the odd ratbag living in the area, but overall it's been a great place to live for me and my family. Crime like that doesn't happen very often in the Aranui area. It does happen occasionally, but not very often."</p>
