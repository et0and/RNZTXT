            <p>Being passionate about your job is touted as a plus, but research shows it can lead to exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>Known as a 'passion tax', creative professionals in New Zealand have said it is a real phenomenon they have to battle against. But structural changes in at least one industry have shown a way forward.</p>
        
            <p>In a 2020 study from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, researchers found that "people consider it more legitimate to make passionate employees leave family to work on a weekend, work unpaid, and handle unrelated tasks that were not in the job description."</p>
        
            <p>If an artist was passionate about their job, study participants thought it was okay for their boss to ask them to do things like clean the office bathroom. After all, thought participants in the study, someone that passionate would probably even work for free.</p>
        
            <p>Maria Gill has been working as a children's book author in New Zealand for 22 years and published 62 books. She had experienced passion tax throughout her career, especially the expectation that she provide her time for free.</p>

            <p>"I get asked to help open a new school library, or one that's been renovated, all over the country. I'm expected to travel down on my own expense," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She would also be expected to volunteer all her time.</p>
        
            <p>"I just can't believe people think it's okay to ask me to do that. I mean, that's just one of the many things I've been asked as an author to do."</p>
        
            <p>She thought it occurred because authors generally love what they do. But she said you can't fill the fridge out of passion.</p>
        
            <p>"I work full-time as a writer, so I have to make it pay for itself."</p>
        
            <p>Vee Pendergrast is the industry development manager for NZ Code, a New Zealand economic development initiative for the game development industry which is currently the second biggest entertainment industry in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Pendergrast said about ten years ago passion tax was prevalent in the industry in New Zealand. But one thing has made a big change - access to grant money.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Code directly supported game development in Aotearoa through administration of grants from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and if you want a grant you cannot exploit a worker's passion.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not promote passion tax or exploitation over enthusiastic workers in any form, and we have quite a negative viewpoint on it," said Pendergrast.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Code will only support applications for funding where all contractors and employees are paid at an appropriate industry rate, and only support unpaid internships if there is an academic institution involved and the internship will gain academic credit for a student.</p>
        
            <p>Pendergrast said a drop in passion tax had been seen anywhere similar grant programmes had been introduced.</p>
        
            <p>"The expectation has changed simply because there is money to bridge the gap," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Game development is a new industry when compared to publishing, and Pendergrast thought that also played a role as there wasn't an entrenched culture of free internships or low wages.</p>
        
            <p>The industry's workforce is also generally younger than other creative sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"Millennials and Gen-Z have a real sense of not wanting to be exploited - as they should," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Maria Gill said she had met writers who do devalue their work because they didn't get into writing to explicitly make a profit. She encouraged them to have that as a goal to avoid being undervalued.</p>
        
            <p>As a full-time author she makes some money from her books, but also from paid events visiting schools, speaking at conferences, or running workshops.</p>
        
            <p>"All of that helps you have an income. [Authors] don't have time and energy, or the money, to go and do these free events for people," she said.</p>
