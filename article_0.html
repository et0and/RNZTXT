            <p>A Wellington resident has been hurt in a fight with an intruder in their home, while a second person was found unconscious on a nearby street shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked for the public's help as they work out if the two overnight incidents in Miramar are linked.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a Darlington Road home at 2am on Monday, where a resident had found an intruder inside.</p>
        
            <p>"One occupant received minor injuries following an altercation with the suspect, who fled before police arrived," Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch said.</p>
        
            <p>Three other residents at the address were unharmed.</p>

            <p>A police dog unit tracked the intruder north of the bus turnaround for several hundred metres until the trail was lost.</p>
        
            <p>About 30 minutes later, officers on patrol found a person unconscious and critically injured near the intersection of Camperdown Road and Totara Road.</p>
        
            <p>The victim was taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition.</p>

            <p>Police officers, crime scene technicians and at least six police cars were at the scene on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said three large splatters of blood and several chalk circles were on the edge of the pavement on Camperdown Road.</p>
        
            <p>The left side of Camperdown Road is partially obstructed by a police cordon, but the road is still open.</p>

            <p>"We are making a number of enquiries into both of these incidents and are working to determine whether they are linked," Leitch said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be a visible police presence in the area while we carry out this work and speak with residents."</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone with information that may help their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Leith said it is possible the intruder had gone to other homes in the area.</p>
