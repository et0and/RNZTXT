            <p>Police have decided not to file charges after a shoplifting allegation was made against former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman.</p>
        
            <p>"The shoplifting occurred at the Pak N Save in Royal Oak on 12 October 2024, and was reported to police for investigation electronically using the Auror platform," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said police have carried out enquiries into the report and a decision has been made to not file charges.</p>
        
            <p>The item taken was valued at less than $40, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any police investigation considers the solicitor-general's Guidelines for Prosecution, including factors such as evidential sufficiency and a public interest test.</p>
        
            <p>"In this case, police have considered the public interest test was not met as well as taking other factors into account."</p>
        
            <p>The store was consulted on the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman has told the New Zealand Herald "I'm relieved police have finally come to the right decision and happy to be moving on".</p>
