            <p>The Commerce Commission has launched investigations into the country's two big supermarket chains.</p>
        
            <p>The commission has confirmed it is looking at Woolworths and Foodstuffs, which operates New World, Pak'n'Save and Four Square.</p>
        
            <p>The watchdog said the focus of the investigations, which were in the early stages, was to consider whether certain pricing and promotional practices of the supermarkets comply with the Fair Trading Act.</p>
        
            <p>Last August, Consumer NZ complained to the commission, asking it to investigate the supermarket duopoly for potential breaches of the Act.</p>
        
            <p>Before that complaint, the consumer group asked New Zealanders to send it examples of "dodgy specials" or examples of unclear or misleading pricing and promotional practices at the supermarket.</p>
        
            <p>It said it received 80 examples of problematic pricing across both operators during June 2023.</p>
