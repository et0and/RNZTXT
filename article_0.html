            <p>Invercargill mayor Nobby Clark says he will not resign over unacceptable behaviour that's prompted multiple calls for him to stand aside.</p>
        
            <p>He is withdrawing from the extraordinary meeting that's been called to deal with a code of conduct complaint against him.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, councillors have agreed mayor Nobby Clark breached its Code of Conduct in a material way.</p>
        
            <p>They are now considering whether he should face a penalty for his behaviour or if his apology is enough during an extraordinary meeting</p>
        
            <p>It comes after councillor Ian Pottinger asked for his resignation, saying his behaviour was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>He and councillor Ria Bond also filed a code of conduct complaint after Clark repeatedly using the N-word.</p>
        
            <p>The latest complaint from the United Fire Brigades' Association (UFBA) said Clark mocked, disrespected, degraded and offended its members and other guests during an event.</p>
        
            <p>UFBA chief executive William Butzbach said Clark said volunteer firefighters were second-class citizens, made personal attacks on the MC - including her appearance, competence and the fact she lived in Ponsonby - and wrongly implied the UFBA president and MC were having an affair.</p>
        
            <p>He apologised in a letter to Butzbach, saying he was suffering from "brain fade" following open heart surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was found to be in breach of the council's Code of Conduct following an investigation.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
