        <h2>Live: 'Mana motuhake is ours, it will last forever' - Kiingi Tuuheitia</h2>
        <p>
Kiingi Tuuheitia has spoken at Tuurangawaewae Marae, where Waikato Tainui estimate at least 10,000 people have come to participate in a national hui.
</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Tainui estimate at least 10,000 people have been welcomed onto Tuurangawaewae marae to participate in a national hui called by Kiingi Tuuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia extended the invite in December last year after iwi leaders highlighted the need for a unified response to coalition government policy impacting Māori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>The iwi say it is the largest contingent of people they have welcomed since the tangi of Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>A flood of people during the pōwhiri saw groups dispersed to the riverside and a series of overflow marquees all fitted with large screens, water, seating and shade.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi representatives from across the country have spoken on the pae with some composing waiata and haka specifically related to the coalition government and the hui.</p>
