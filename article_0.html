            <p>About 2000 people have gathered in Auckland's CBD this afternoon, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the three-month-old Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
        
            <p>They are making their way from Aotea Square along Queen Street to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Quay Street.</p>
        
            <p>Some are waving large Gaza flags carrying banners reading 'Free Palestine, stop genoicde in Gaza', 'NZ Five Eyes but no Spine' and 'Stop Killing our Kids.'</p>
        
            <p>The protest group's goal is to make what they called 'All Out Palestine' be 'the biggest march for Palestine in NZ history'.</p>

            <p>Several other protests calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine war have been held around the country recently including one to the steps of Parliament in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Hamas fighters broke through Israel's borders 7 October, killing 1200 people and taking 240 hostages.</p>
        
            <p>The Hamas-run health ministry has said that Israel has killed more than 17,700 Gazans in its retaliatory campaign, including more than 7000 children.</p>

            <p>The United States vetoed a United Nations resolution on Friday demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament also debated the war this week, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon calling for "steps towards" a ceasefire before a ceasefire begins.</p>
        
            <p>Today's march is organised by Palestinian Youth Aotearoa and Aotearoa Liberation League.</p>
