            <p>A 32-year-old man has been charged with the murder of teenager Ariki Rigby, whose body was found in a burned-out car in a Hawke's Bay reserve two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dave de Lange said Hawke's Bay police arrested an Auckland man today and charged him with the murder of Rigby.</p>
        
            <p>Rigby, 18, was killed in September 2022. Her body was found in the car in River Road reserve near Havelock North.</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man - who was living in Hawke's Bay at the time of Rigby's death - was arrested in Favon.</p>
        
            <p>He has also been charged with arson and will be appearing in the Manukau District Court tomorrow</p>
        
            <p>De Lange said police will be seeking a remand in custody without plea, so the charges can be transferred to Napier District Court.</p>
        
            <p>He said the family had been informed of the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>"While they are very pleased that someone is being held to account for Ariki's death, it doesn't lessen the hurt and pain they have at the loss of Ariki, who would have turned 21 later this month.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge the investigation team, who have worked tirelessly to get this result, and also those members of our community who have assisted our enquiries."</p>
