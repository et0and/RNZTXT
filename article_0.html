            <p>A public radio time capsule has been unearthed by Parliament's security services, who were initially worried the silver cylinder might be a bomb.</p>
        
            <p>But after carefully opening the 20 litre paint tin turned time capsule, and making sure it didn't contain any explosives, they found a treasure trove of old school RNZ records.</p>
        
            <p>A look inside reveals the time capsule was put in the ground on 12 June, 1996 - it was hidden in a tunnel which connected the old Broadcasting House building in Wellington, with Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>It was not supposed to have been opened until 2050.</p>
        
            <p>There are plenty of papers and stickers and other old school RNZ treasures, but also several pieces of audio, some of it dating back to 1972.</p>
        
            <p>And the technology enclosed in the futuristic silver-painted container, well not all of it can be accessed in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>While the old CDs, cassette tapes, and old digital audio tapes (or DATs) could be used, it would take time and money to access an old Cart player that was enclosed in the box.</p>
        
            <p>The audio that can be accessed gives a great glimpse into the past.</p>

            <p>Three cassette tapes include the entire episode of Morning Report from 12 June, 1996, hosted at the time by Geoff Robinson and Mike Hosking.</p>
        
            <p>The show leads with blizzard conditions hitting throughout the country, with large snow flurries in Christchurch and further south, as well as the Desert Road, and the Napier-Taupo road.</p>
        
            <p>It then turns to the big political news of the moment, Michael Cullen being promoted to deputy leader of the Labour Party - with Cullen in the studio at Broadcasting House in Wellington, interviewed by Hosking.</p>

            <p>Those top stories are the same on a copy of The Dominion newspaper from 12 June, 1996.</p>
        
            <p>The newspaper features a cartoon depicting the Labour Party caucus as Egyptian mummies, and says: "Well, we now know how to keep [Winston] Peters out of the limelight".</p>

            <p>A DAT has a near two-hour recording of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in its 50th year, performing Mahler's Symphony No 3 at the Michael Fowler Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Another features a 1972 Spectrum documentary, detailing a day in the life of Broadcasting House, and another recording looks at protests being held against the building's demolition, which eventually happened in 1997.</p>
        
            <p>There is also the first ever episode of the EARS children's programme, featuring a story about Tarzan, and there are two music CDs of the top New Zealand hits of the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside the audio are hundreds of papers, detailing what the RNZ workplace was like at the time.</p>
        
            <p>For instance, there is a New Zealand Public Radio newsletter, dated 31 May, 1996, which lists every member of staff at the organisation at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 29 years later, many of those names remain at RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The newsletter has a pronunciation guide for problem words, and calls out the worst phrase in a bulletin that week - "It's the fifth consecutive year in a row..."</p>
        
            <p>It also details the new smokefree workplace policy - there had been concern in some quarters that people weren't allowed to smoke in the newsroom anymore.</p>
        
            <p>Another item detailed every actor working for the drama department, even listing the phone number and address for each actor.</p>
        
            <p>The likes of Miranda Harcourt, Rachel House, Jed Brophy, and Michael Galvin are in the star-studded document.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most perplexing items included in the capsule are a sick or annual leave approval form, and a poster for the Public Service Association seeking fair pay.</p>
        
            <p>There's also merch in the drum, like a Sports Roundup cap, two Radio New Zealand International tikis, a number of stickers, and a magnet for the side of a car.</p>
        
            <p>Lastly, there's a list of the top 50 songs of the day - the top Kiwi number being 'Right On' by OMC.</p>
        
            <p>The lyrics seem fitting - "Oh, do you remember? When we were young? We just had fun!"</p>
