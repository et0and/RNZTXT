        <p>
The ferry has 88 people on board, but there is no immediate risk to safety, Harbourmaster says.

            <p>A Bluebridge ferry has lost power heading into Cook Strait, and drifted for more than two hours.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the ferry, the Bluebridge Connemara, blacked out after leaving Wellington on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>There was no immediate risk to anyone on board, Nalder said.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been drifting slowly in a southeast direction, so that's away from land, so there's no distress, there's no immediate safety issue - she's quite safe."</p>
        
            <p>By 2am Friday, the tug boat Tapuhi was towing Connemara back to Wellington, and a second tug, Tiaki, was providing steerage.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder believed it was a freight sailing, and said it had just 88 people on board. He said the shipping authority Maritime New Zealand, and the Rescue Co-ordination Centre, were both monitoring the situation.</p>

            <p>MarineTraffic.com's ship tracker showed the vessel was sitting just south of Sinclair Head at 12.30am Friday, and its status was "Drifting".</p>
        
            <p>It had left Wellington at 9.38pm, and Nalder said it lost power about 40 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>In May, passengers on board a different Bluebridge ferry, Strait Feronia, were briefly plunged into darkness when their ship lost power coming into Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on board told RNZ at the time that the ferry gave a "great shudder" and stopped, and all the lights went off.</p>
        
            <p>They said passengers were told the ferry had lost control of the engine, and it was resolved after about 10 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said the outage was caused by a minor electrical fault, which had since been fixed.</p>

            <p>In 2023, the Connemara hit a wharf while it was leaving Wellington, causing a "decent dent" on the hull and a "very small hole" above the waterline, Nalder said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel returned to port and passengers were able to disembark safely.</p>
        
            <p>The Connemara underwent repairs and was back in service later that day.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander ferries have also been plagued by issues in recent months - most notably the grounding of the Aratere near Picton in June.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry, which was on a crew-only sailing, ran aground after a staff member mistakenly changed its course.</p>
