            <p>Ngāpuhi have gathered at Parliament to oppose the government repealing Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, about 200 people - both iwi and tauiwi - attended a rally in Kaikohe to say enough is enough when it comes to Māori mokopuna in state care.</p>
        
            <p>It was a call to action ahead of today's rally.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Ngāpuhi leaders were among those who walked out of a meeting with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, saying the coalition government is running roughshod over iwi Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi Social Services chief executive Dr Moana Eruera told RNZ as of 30 April, there were 827 Ngāpuhi children in the care of the state.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Eruera said this was 29 percent of all Māori tamariki in state care.</p>
        
            <p>"We're treating this as a crisis. It's not a new issue but it's been re-triggered by the release of abuse in state care."</p>
        
            <p>"If 7AA is removed ... it will remove really practical ways of holding the Crown to account and also enabling us to be able to take responsibility for our own solutions."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Eruera said the iwi has solutions.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been trying to engage the Crown with some of those solutions in recent years, and while we get a little bit of traction it's just not enough to support us to manage the crisis we've got right now."</p>
