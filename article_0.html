            <p>Police are trying to extradite Vietnamese officials suspected of indecently assaulting two women at a Wellington restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>The incident happened in March last year. Police received complaints from two different women, but were unable to lay charges as the suspects had already left the country.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, they said an extradition file was being prepared despite no extradition treaty between New Zealand and Vietnam.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had positive engagement with Vietnamese officials to date, and I am confident that will continue," Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"While this process is ongoing and complex, we hope our ongoing efforts provide some assurance to the complainants that we are taking this matter seriously."</p>
        
            <p>Travel alerts were in place at the border, in case the suspects return to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Police in December said there was "no doubt" the incident happened.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff reported a former staff member at Saigon on Willis, who was 19 at the time of the official's visit, recalled the men "pulling us into their laps, pinning us against the wall".</p>
        
            <p>An investigation, including reviewing CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses, showed the suspects were Vietnamese officials, visiting on official business, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, diplomatic staff and their families are granted immunity from arrest or prosecution, and cannot be detained or subpoenaed as a witness.</p>
        
            <p>This can be waived if the New Zealand Government believes a serious crime - an offence for which the penalty is a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more - is alleged to have been committed, and it is in the public interest to prosecute.</p>
