        <h2>Protesters block Jones' bus ahead of mining announcement</h2>
        <p>
The government hopes its new mining plan will create 2500 jobs and be worth $3b in exports. Audio

            <p>The Resources Minister, Shane Jones, has announced the government's final mining strategy half an hour late after protestors blocked the bus he arrived on.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the days of "woke-riddled intimidation" of the mining sector are over - specifically criticising banks that refuse to work with fossil fuel companies</p>
        
            <p>Jones released the mining strategy, including a list of minerals the government believed were critical to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Gold and metallurgical coal have been added to the Critical Minerals List, which now covers a total of 37 minerals after a consultation period that started in September.</p>
        
            <p>The list, released Friday morning alongside a strategy document, outlines the government's plan to double mineral sector exports to $3 billion by 2035 - up from the previous target of $2 billion, thanks to revised export statistics from Stats NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Resources Shane Jones hoped to boost mining to stimulate economic growth, and was eying up Department of Conservation (DOC) land to do so.</p>
        
            <p>In a speech at OceanaGold's Waihi Operation in Hauraki, Jones said further mining projects would be enabled by the Fast-track Approvals Act.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the key areas I see this process improving is concessions for land access. An array of high-value mining and quarrying projects are already approved to travel this consenting pathway," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Officials estimate the number of jobs across the mining projects listed in Schedule 2 of the Fast-track Approvals Act at over 2500 direct full-time jobs at peak production. Many of these roles will be well-paying regional jobs with significant opportunities for training and growing skills."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released alongside the updated list, Jones said a lack of long-term strategic direction had hindered New Zealand's ability to reap the economic benefits of its natural resources.</p>
        
            <p>"I am delighted to say that that ends now," he said. "With the increasing demand and volatility in international markets, I want New Zealand to contribute to the growing critical minerals market as a trusted and reliable partner."</p>
        
            <p>Of the 37 minerals on the list, Jones said 21 could be produced in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We are a prospective destination for sought-after minerals like antimony and we have operators working rare earth, vanadium and titanium projects, which I note are all ways for New Zealand to support a transition to a clean energy future.</p>
        
            <p>"Our minerals sector will increase national and regional prosperity, strengthen critical supply chains, and leverage our relationships and international partnerships to drive economic benefits for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>He said the final plan had addressed feedback received during consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our three key outcomes [have been] refocused around productivity, value, and resilience, guided by overarching principles to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and responsible practices."</p>
        
            <p>Jones' speech was also highly critical of banks that refused to work with fossil fuel companies.</p>
        
            <p>"This malevolence flows from cult like accords fostered within the UN where banks and their sustainability units foolishly believe they can change the weather.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand banks should abandon such agreements as the Net Zero Banking Alliance.</p>
        
            <p>"These instruments are alien and represent a foreign threat to regional development," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones revealed New Zealand First would introduce a bill that would give regulators power to remove a bank's operating license if it refused to do business with mineral firms.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the banks should be made to reappear before the Finance and Expenditure Committee's banking inquiry to explain themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Jones told Morning Report he hoped the announcement would encourage international companies to set up mines in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"If one was to check the share registry on a number of existing entities on the West Coast, you'll see that American capital is already being invested," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the reason they're doing that is because we now have a very rational regime. The gatekeepers hiding behind the Wildlife Act, the people trying to turn DOC into some sort of preservationist state and deny New Zealanders a livelihood... they're going to be marginalised."</p>
