            <p>Donald Trump has claimed victory in a speech in Florida, but some swing states are still counting votes.</p>
        
            <p>Trump spoke after two key battleground states - Pennsylvania and Georgia - were called for him.</p>
        
            <p>The Republicans have also retained control of the Senate.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to supporters, Trump said he had been victorious in the 2024 election after two outlets projected him as winner. Others, including the Associated Press who estimate every election, have yet to make the call.</p>
        
            <p>However, there is almost no way that Vice-President Kamala Harris can win the election even with some votes in key swing states yet to be counted.</p>
        
            <p>Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households, according to exit polls.</p>
