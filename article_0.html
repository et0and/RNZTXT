            <p>Aaradhna dominated the Pacific Music Awards this year, taking out four categories at the Due Drop Event Centre in Auckland's Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>The awards on Thursday night marked two decades of celebrating Pacific music in Aotearoa, recognising not just the artists but also their families, communities and nations, Pacific Music Awards Trust spokesperson Reverend Mua Strickson-Pua said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have not forgotten who we are and where we come from, mindful of the connections from our rich past and bonds of Alofa Aroha to the next Tupulaga, next generation."</p>
        
            <p>Aaradhna won Best Pacific Female Artist, while her track 'She' won the Best Pacific Song Award. The song also won the Best Pacific Music Video award.</p>
        
            <p>The awards follow the Wellington-based artist's win at the Aotearoa Music Awards in May, where she took home the Best Soul/RnB Artist award and 'She' was named Best Video Content winner.</p>

            <p>Aaradhna was in India and was not present at the awards, but sent a video message to her fans.</p>
        
            <p>"God is good, my mum always reminded me of that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to thank my family for being my rock, for keeping me grounded, always reminding me why I started, my solid listeners, my day ones ... I'm not able to do this without you.</p>
        
            <p>"To do this for 20-plus years, I'm very grateful."</p>
