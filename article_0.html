        <h2>Thousands in fines issued for fishing near Cook Strait power cables</h2>
        <p>
Three power cables carry a huge chunk of New Zealand's power between the North and South Islands, but boats keep getting too close.
</p>
        
            <p>Transpower has detailed the thousands of dollars worth of fines dished out for fishing near the Cook Strait power cables.</p>
        
            <p>Three power cables run for 40 kilometres across Cook Strait between Oteranga Bay near Wellington and Fighting Bay in Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>Five telecommunications cables also run across the waterway.</p>
        
            <p>The first cables were originally laid in 1965, making them one of the first submarine cable links in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Replacement cables were laid in 1991 and are due to be replaced again in 2032.</p>
        
            <p>They can transfer up to 15 percent of New Zealand's power between the two islands.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Strait protection zone runs along the length of the cables, is seven kilometres wide and patrolled 24/7 by boat. It prohibits fishing of any type or anchoring.</p>

            <p>Since 2006 there had been about 21 fines dished out for fishing in the area, Transpower executive general manager grid delivery Mark Ryall told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>They included a recreational fisherman who had received multiple warnings, a charter boat which was positioned in the cable zone whilst knowing it was illegal and a person in 2010 who laid cray pots in the zone.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously something like that getting dragged across the cables could do damage."</p>
        
            <p>Fines had ranged from $1000 to $20,000 but generally Transpower would take the approach of educating people in the first instance, Ryall said.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the Cook Strait cable zone being established in 1996, there had been five instances where the cables had to be repaired.</p>

            <p>Ryall said the cables were inspected every year, and modelling showed the likelihood of them failing increasing in the 2030s.</p>
        
            <p>That triggered a plan to replace them in the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>"The international offshore cable market is exceptionally busy, and you are looking at lead times in the ballpark of seven years so we've actually got that project already underway."</p>
        
            <p>Ryall said replacing a cable was a significant exercise, so it emphasised the need to protect the current one whilst it was operating.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum fines for fishing or anchoring in the Cook Strait cable zone is $100,000, while the maximum fine for damaging the cable zone is $250,000.</p>
