            <p>A passenger on board the Auckland bus where a woman was stabbed to death on Wednesday wants the family of the victim to know she did not die alone.</p>
        
            <p>A 37-year-old man was taken into custody on Thursday, in relation to the killing on an Onehunga bus about 2.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The man handed himself in at a North Shore police station, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who was on the number 74 bus when the attack took place has described how passengers tried to help the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"I just want to let her family know that she didn't die alone, that I held her hand in the bus until she got help and we did everything we could."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they believed the attack was random, and the victim and alleged offender did not know each other, though they were sitting near each other.</p>
        
            <p>They did not think there was an altercation before the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Acting detective inspector Alisse Robertson said police would like to thank the wider community in the wake of the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation is still in its infancy and there's still a lot of work to be done to piece together the events leading up to this tragic incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank everyone who has provided information, and would still like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this ordeal."</p>
        
            <p>Information can be provided by making an online report at 105.police.govt.nz using "Update Report" or by calling 105.</p>
        
            <p>Maungakiekie-Tāmaki Local Board chair Maria Meredith told Morning Report the Onehunga community has been on edge as of late, following another death in the Auckland suburb in August.</p>
        
            <p>She said the man handing himself in "brought much relief to our community".</p>
        
            <p>"People were nervous. They didn't feel safe going out there. I did hear of a story where people didn't want to send their children to school because they were just uncomfortable knowing that the culprit was still out there following the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"There certainly was that element of fear."</p>
