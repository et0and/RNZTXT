            <p>The head of one of the government's free school lunch providers says his company is providing numbers of wasted school lunches to the Ministry of Education on a daily basis.</p>
        
            <p>Compass Group boss Paul Harvey told Checkpoint, it was "mission critical" to meet KPIs.</p>
        
            <p>Compass is one of the three companies that make up the School Lunch Collective, which is responsible for running the scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint this week reported more issues with the revamped programme, including one school getting 11 days of butter chicken.</p>
        
            <p>That came after, separately, Compass admitted halal meals it delivers to schools are not halal certified.</p>
        
            <p>Principals have called the revamped menu substandard and nearly a third of schools getting free lunches have contacted the Ministry of Education with queries and complaints.</p>
        
            <p>A Ministry of Education Nutritionist raised a litany of issues with menu, including massive wastage, the concerning quality of meals and the safety of supposedly halal lunches.</p>
        
            <p>Harvey told Checkpoint, every day Compass was improving but it was "not where they want to be".</p>
        
            <p>He said the Lunch Collective was providing meals to 125,000 students at 443 schools.</p>
        
            <p>Harvey would not be drawn on whether his company would face financial penalties on not being able to consistently deliver nutritious and healthy lunches.</p>
        
            <p>"We know what our KPI's are and we're focussed on delivering that."</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint has been inviting the School Lunch Collective to speak since the beginning of the year.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour last year unveiled a school lunches reboot, rolling out a new menu it said would save more than $130 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition announced plans to scale back the cost of the Ka ora, Ka ako free school lunch programme in intermediate and high schools in May last year.</p>
