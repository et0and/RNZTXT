            <p>Eliza McCartney was the last of the Kiwi trio left in the competition but she failed her three attempts at 4.80m and finishes fifth equal in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris bowed out when they failed to clear the bar after it was moved up to 4.70m.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand's cyclists clinched a silver medal in the women's team pursuit a short time ago at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields were beaten by the United States, missing the gold medal by a sixth of a second in the 4000m final.</p>
        
            <p>It is the first Olympic medal New Zealand has won in the discipline and follows the sprint team's silver medal on the opening day of competition.</p>
        
            <p>Hamish Kerr is through to the men's high jump final, after being one of only five athletes to clear a height of 2.27 metres. He made the jump on his first attempt.</p>
