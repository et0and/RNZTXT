            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins has overtaken Christopher Luxon as preferred prime minister, and the centre-left bloc would be able to form a government based on results in the latest Taxpayers' Union-Curia poll.</p>
        
            <p>The poll, conducted between 2-4 March, showed National up 1.7 points to 33.6 percent, and Labour up 2.8 points to 34.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens dropped 3.2 points to 10 percent, while ACT declined 2.3 points to 7.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First was down 1.3 points to 5.1 percent, while Te Pāti Māori was up 2.1 points to 6.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>On these numbers, the centre-right block would not be able to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>And for the first time since the election, Hipkins was ahead of Luxon as preferred prime minister in this poll.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon dropped slightly to 20.3 percent, while Hipkins rose 3.1 points to 20.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour fell to 5 percent, Winston Peters rose slightly to 8.6 percent and Chlöe Swarbrick fell 4.1 points to 4.8 percent.</p>
