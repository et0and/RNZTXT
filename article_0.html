            <p>New Zealand are guaranteed their first medal of the Paris Olympics on Day 4.</p>
        
            <p>With the men's individual triathlon postponed until Wednesday night, the country's medal hopes on the fourth day of competition rest on the women's rugby sevens team.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns beat the United States 24-12 in their semi-final. The match against Canada kicks off around 5.45am.</p>
        
            <p>In other disciplines, New Zealand teams are competing in shooting, swimming, sailing, rowing, dressage and canoe slalom.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a successful night on the water for NZ so far, with Emma Twigg and Tom Mackintosh comfortably winning their single sculls quarter-finals.</p>
        
            <p>Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won their double sculls semi, and Robbie Manson and Jordan Parry came third in the men's event, so both duos are through to the final on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi swimmers have been less fortunate, with Lewis Clareburt (200m butterfly), Cameron Gray (100m freestyle) and Eve Thomas (1500m freestyle) all failing to progress in their heats.</p>
