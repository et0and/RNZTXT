            <p>Thousands of people have arrived at Tuurangawaewae Marae, as iwi and dignitaries continue to pay their respects on the third day of Kiingi Tuheitia's tangi.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors from throughout the country have arrived to pay their respects to the head of the Kiingitanga movement, Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died early on Friday at the age of 69.</p>
        
            <p>The Sunday morning pōwhiri was held at 8am, and organisers say about 3000 people entered the marae.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past two days, the people of Tainui have had the chance to mourn their King, and now iwi from throughout the motu have arrived to pay tribute.</p>
        
            <p>Today's guests include the Governor-General Cindy Kiro, members of the Rātana Church, and iwi including Te Arawa, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ngāti Kauwhata and Ngāti Hine.</p>
        
            <p>More iwi are expecting to be welcomed onto the marae at 2pm, and a Kiingitanga spokesperson said they expected the number of attendees would double this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Arriving this morning, veteran activist Tame Iti - a descendent of Wiremu Tamihana the "Kingmaker" - said Kiingi Tuheitia had truly found his voice and been successful at sharing his own thoughts and ideas this year.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a bit of a change, and rather than rely on his Kāhui Ariki to be his only voice.</p>
        
            <p>"But it was really good to hear the King during that period of time, to hear his own voice, his own thinking, where he is coming from."</p>
        
            <p>Massey University Professor Meihana Durie said Māori must continue to pursue Kiingi Tuheitia's legacy.</p>
        
            <p>"Increasingly, we've seen a remarkable ability that the King had to unite people in what are very difficult circumstances right now.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think for us as Māori we need to ensure that we uphold that legacy and we work in the spirit of kōtahitanga as the King has encouraged us to do."</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Police have advised motorists there would be daily road closures around Tuurangawaewae Marae until Thursday, when Kiingi Tuheitia would be laid to rest.</p>
