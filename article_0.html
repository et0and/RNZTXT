        <h2>Watch live: China committed to renewing 'long-standing friendship' with NZ - Premier</h2>
        <p>
Premier Li Qiang is the highest-ranking Chinese leader to visit New Zealand in seven years.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Chinese Premier Li Qiang are speaking at a joint news conference about 5pm. It will be followed by media stand-up with Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>The highest-ranking Chinese leader to visit New Zealand in seven years was officially welcomed in Wellington on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Li received an official welcome at Government House before having a meeting with Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to a range of officials and ministers present for the meeting, Luxon said the connections between the countries had enriched the cultural, economic and political tapestries of China and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>In his opening remarks, Luxon acknowledged the trade relationship in particular, as well as the need to solve global problems such as climate change, adding China had an integral role to play.</p>
        
            <p>Li's visit comes as regional security concerns begin to overshadow the lucrative trade ties which had until recently dominated the New Zealand-China relationship.</p>
