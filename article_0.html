        <h2>27,000 more people unemployed this Christmas, economists say</h2>
        <p>
But the situation could have been a lot worse, a senior economist at the country's biggest bank says.

            <p>ANZ expects this year to end with an extra 27,000 people out of work - but says the situation could have been a lot worse.</p>
        
            <p>Senior economist Miles Workman said in the third quarter, there were around 12,000 fewer people employed compared to a year period and this would likely rise to 27,000 by the end of December.</p>
        
            <p>The unemployment rate lifted to 4.8 percent in September and Workman expected it to reach 5.1 percent in the following quarter.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was also growth in the working age population and changes in the participation rate.</p>
        
            <p>Workman said more people would continue to lose jobs through the start of next year before unemployment bottomed out around the middle of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a typical lag between economic activity and the labour market."</p>
        
            <p>But he said forecasts for unemployment were now lower than they had been.</p>
        
            <p>"The Reserve Bank's forecast peak is 5.2 percent and our forecast peak is 5.5 percent. Relative to previous economic cycles, the unemployment rate has been more than double that."</p>
        
            <p>He said while it was "not a good news story by any means" and a lot of households would struggle this Christmas, if inflation could be tamed with an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent or less, "it could be worse".</p>
        
            <p>"It has been worse in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"We're coming off an extraordinarily over-stimulated economy where the Government spent way too much money and everything was on a huge sugar rush. It's inevitable it had to come down off that to put the economy on a sustainable path. IF you hit the cookie jar forever, it's not a sustainable diet."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were already some indications of "green shoots" in economic activity.</p>
        
            <p>"They have to emerge and come to fruition, then we'll see that impact on the labour market."</p>
