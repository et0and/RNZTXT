            <p>Hamish Kerr is through to the men's high jump final at the Paris Olympics, after being one of only five athletes to clear a height of 2.27 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr made the jump on his first attempt tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the pole-vaulting trio of Eliza McCartney, Olivia McTaggart and Imogen Ayris will also chase Olympic glory on Wednesday night, with all three in the Paris Olympic Games final.</p>
        
            <p>World-class athletes Aimee Fisher and Dame Lisa Carrington won their kayak sprints heats and will head into the semifinals at the Paris Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Just three times in Olympic history have two New Zealanders stood on different levels of the podium for the same event. Dame Lisa and Fisher could make it happen again.</p>
        
            <p>The women's team pursuit are also on track for gold at the velodrome.</p>
        
            <p>Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields broke the national record and were just 0.4s off the world record in being top qualifiers and advancing to a semi-final against Italy.</p>
