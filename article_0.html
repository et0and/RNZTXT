            <p>A manhunt is continuing in Auckland for a man police believe was involved in the fatal shooting on one of the city's most popular and busiest roads.</p>
        
            <p>Police are searching for a gunman after a man was shot dead on Ponsonby Road on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>A photo of the man - who has been described as extremely dangerous - has been released and police have made an urgent appeal to help identify him.</p>
        
            <p>
Images of the man sought over the shooting were released by police yesterday.

            <p>It is still not clear whether he and the victim were known to each other.</p>
        
            <p>Ponsonby Road was closed for much of the day, but cordons were lifted yesterday afternoon and a short blessing took place on the spot where the man was killed.</p>
        
            <p>The shooting has shaken local retailers and residents.</p>

            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown expressed his shock, saying his thoughts are with the victim's family.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council had been trying to take steps to address safety in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>"We've put 20 groups of staff out there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Really, it isn't really the mayor's job to be policing the city, there's got to be more help."</p>
        
            <p>Brown had twice dipped into the mayor's budget recently to implement crime-stopping programmes.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no excuse for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to come like a ton of bricks on these people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to hear any of this stuff about how they've had a bad life, those are bad people, we've got to stop it."</p>

            <p>Police have made an urgent appeal to the public to help identify the gunman.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry told Checkpoint someone must know who he is.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the images [of the suspect] are of a reasonable quality that someone out there is going to recognise this person," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be a parent, it could be a sibling, another relation, a friend or an associate, and what we need is for someone that does know who this is to pick up the phone and let us know who he is, also, if possible, where he is."</p>
        
            <p>Barry said the shooter had been declined entry into Chapel Bar.</p>
        
            <p>He said police were continuing to work through CCTV footage but it still was not clear whether they were dealing with a random or targeted attack.</p>
        
            <p>"It's too early to put firm labels as to what the motivation for this offending is," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"But, at this point in time, we haven't established what the offender's motive is."</p>
        
            <p>Barry said the gunman, who it is believed had concealed the gun in a bag, fired several shots and it was lucky no one else was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Without giving any details, he said people had come forward with information about the man, and the urgent priority was to find him.</p>
        
            <p>"We are deeply concerned that he does remain out in the community,"</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know, at this stage, who he is, and the best possible outcome for us is for us to detain him as soon as possible,"</p>
        
            <p>"That is going to mitigate the risk to the public," said Barry.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, locals were still trying to come to terms with what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>Jan Farry said she was shocked by the scene as she tried to get into work yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people walk these street in the evenings, because there's so many eateries and things around, so it's a real worry that it can happen," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Retailers along Ponsonby Road have also expressed their shock and sadness.</p>
        
            <p>Ponsonby Business Association general manager Vivienne Rosenberg said they send their condolences to the family of the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"We are shocked and saddened by what has happened," said Rosenberg in a statement to RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Police have said they will maintain a strong presence in the area.</p>
