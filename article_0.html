            <p>Local roads remain closed across Otago this morning, after two days of heavy rain and flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin City Council says clearing slips and reopening roads will be a key focus as the cleanup starts today.</p>
        
            <p>The fire service has released drone footage showing a huge slip near Ravensbourne, which has knocked out the water supply to the West Harbour suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>As of late Friday night, water tanks could not be delivered there because of road blockages, although the city council says residents have reserves.</p>
        
            <p>Both the Dunedin City and the Clutha District councils are asking people not to go out unnecessarily, and states of emergency remain in place.</p>
        
            <p>The army is supporting cordons around flooded parts of South Dunedin, and the council says if people have no reason to be in a particular area, they need to stay away.</p>
