            <p>National Party leader Christopher Luxon has arrived at the Cordis Hotel in Auckland this morning for another day of talks to form the next government.</p>
        
            <p>He is holding individual meetings with New Zealand First and ACT over the weekend and says the discussions are in the final stages.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said he is having a one-on-one meeting this morning with NZ First leader Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll just keep working our way through it. The topic of conversation gets narrower and we're getting close. We're talking about just closing off a few issues on policy and making sure we really understand what we're all signing up for.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important, as I said, we started this process looking at all three parties' manifestos, a lot of detail, gone through line item by line item and we've got a couple of issues to close out and that's what we're working through today."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said yesterday that a deal was "very close", while Peters said it would still take "a few more hours".</p>
        
            <p>- more to come</p>
