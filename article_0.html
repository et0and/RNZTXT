            <p>A leading Māori health advocate is heading a bid in the Waitangi Tribunal to stop the abolition of Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority.</p>
        
            <p>The government plans to disestablish the authority in its first 100 days.</p>
        
            <p>Lady Tureiti Moxon and the head of a Māori primary health organisation, Janice Kuka, have made a request for an urgent hearing regarding the government's plans.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Damian Stone is considering the request and has given the Crown until the end of Monday to reply.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori health authority was set up last year under health reforms, with the aim of giving Māori a greater say in their own healthcare and ending poorer health statistics.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
