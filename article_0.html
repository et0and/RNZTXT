        <h2>Watch live: Luxon faces questions amid Peters-Greens dispute</h2>
        <p>
The Green Party wants the Prime Minister to step in over the NZ First's leaders comments about MP Benjamin Doyle.
</p>

            <p>Luxon is likely to face questions about Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters' comments about Green MP Benjamin Doyle.</p>
        
            <p>The Greens are calling for Luxon to step in, saying an "immense" numbers of death threats have been made against Doyle.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon will speak at 4pm and the press conference will be livestreamed at the top of this page.</p>
        
            <p>Another topic likely to be on the agenda is the announcement of the government's plans to replace the aging Interislander ferries, which has already cost hundreds of millions of dollars without anything being built after the coalition government scrapped Labour's prior plan.</p>
        
            <p>Other issues that might come up include plans to tackle the supermarket duopoly, the possibility of taxpayer funding for Eden Park, and a controversial take on the police by a Green MP.</p>
