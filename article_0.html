            <p>PM Christopher Luxon is holding his first post-Cabinet media briefing this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It is only two days since the new government was sworn in, but it has already faced national and international criticism over its plan to scrap smokefree legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister has attacked media on more than one occasion since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>That prompted opposition leader Chris Hipkins to say Luxon had already lost control of his government.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
