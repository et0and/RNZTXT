            <p>The first official day of the 2024 Olympic Games has begun in Paris, following a colourful opening ceremony on the banks of the River Seine.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Fairweather has narrowly missed out on winning New Zealand's first medal at the Paris Olympics after finishing fourth in the women's 400-metre freestyle final.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously a little bit gutted to get fourth. Nobody wants to be there, but I have done myself proud. I mean that was an Olympic final and I just came fourth in it," Fairweather told media after the race.</p>
        
            <p>"That was everything I had in the bank today. It wasn't the performance I wanted to put out there at all. I've been much faster, and I think I can go much faster, but that is the nature of sport - you can't always be on.</p>
        
            <p>"I might be a little bit upset now, but I can definitely see the bright side of it."</p>
