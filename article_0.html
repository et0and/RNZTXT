            <p>Vanuatu's Port Vila is in urgent need of help and heavy machinery as a rescue operation gets underway in the wake of a 7.3 earthquake, a resident says.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Thompson has told RNZ multiple buildings have come down, including some that have pancaked possibly still with people inside.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in need of help in Port Vila," he says. The New Zealand High Commission is among buildings that have been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>He says most of the communications to Vanuatu have gone, and he is able to post due to Starlink. A journalist living in Vanuatu, Dan McGarry, says police have confirmed to him the quake has claimed at least one life.</p>
