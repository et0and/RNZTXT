        <h2>Shock as speedway car crashes over 4m fence into spectator area</h2>
        <p>
A speedway car has flipped over a 4m safety fence into a spectator area, in a spectacular crash at Beachlands Speedway in Dunedin.
</p>
        
            <p>Speedway NZ is investigating after a car flew over a safety fence in a streetstocks race at Beachlands Speedway in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>A video posted to Facebook from Friday night's racing shows a streetstock turning a corner before suddenly hitting another car and launching over the fences around the track, flipping just metres from the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>The other car on the track also flipped over multiple times, ending on its side at the track wall.</p>
        
            <p>Speedway New Zealand president Ricky Bolton said the driver whose car crossed the barrier was shaken, but no-one was harmed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a freak accident," Bolton told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't had a car breach one of our fences at a speedway venue for a very very long time. Actually, the last time that it happened - I can't actually remember."</p>
        
            <p>He said fence standards were last raised to the current height of 4 metres ten years ago. But investigators would consider whether an improvement was needed and if anything could have prevented the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Mikaela Cruden, who captured video of the crash, said it had been frightening to watch.</p>
        
            <p>"I was sitting very close to where it happened and happened to be videoing at the time which amazes me. [It] was very shocking seeing the car come over the fence.</p>
        
            <p>"They called the meeting off and asked everyone to make their way out of the arena. Thankfully everyone was okay."</p>
        
            <p>Cruden has been going to the speedway for about 15 years, and also had never seen a car go over the safety fence.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably testament to our new fences that managed to slow the car down - [that] it didn't end up going further," Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always room for improvement, and our investigating team will come back to Speedway New Zealand in due course and give us their full report."</p>
        
            <p>Racing at Beachlands Speedway was scheduled to go ahead Saturday night.</p>
