            <p>Jamie Arbuckle, the Marlborough district councillor who became an MP at the October election, says "upon reflection" he will donate the money from his council role to a local charity.</p>
        
            <p>He was at the centre of questions after deciding to stay in the two roles, and continue getting paid for both.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the NZ First MP originally said he would remain as a Marlborough District councillor until October of this year to avoid a "costly" byelection should he resign before then.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, I believe I'm still doing the job of a councillor," he said, video-calling home from Wellington but still making it to most Marlborough District Council meetings in person.</p>
        
            <p>But after "feedback and upon reflection", he said on Tuesday, any money he got from his council role since the election would be "donated to a local district community charity".</p>
        
            <p>Councillors in Marlborough with no extra responsibilities were paid $40,250, but Arbuckle was on the economic finance committee, earning more.</p>
        
            <p>An MP's base salary was $163,961, plus office expenses, superannuation, accommodation supplements and more.</p>
