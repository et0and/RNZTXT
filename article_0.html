        <h2>'A real hero': One All Blacks legend remembers another</h2>
        <p>
When Sir Bryan Williams first saw Sid Going on the field, he was just a schoolboy. The pair would go on to make history together.

            <p>The late Sid Going, who died on Friday aged 80, has been remembered as "a real hero" by one of his team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>Going (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Hine) was part of a famed Northland rugby family and played 86 matches for the All Blacks across a decade in the 1960s and 70s.</p>
        
            <p>When Sir Bryan Williams first saw Going at work, Williams was just a schoolboy, watching the halfback doing some "amazing things" for Northland and the All Blacks.</p>
        
            <p>"He became a real hero of mine, and then two or three years later I was in the same All Blacks team as he was, so suddenly I was playing with someone I absolutely revered."</p>
        
            <p>They went on to play alongside each other for the best part of a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Going was "lethal" on the field and would have shone in any position, Sir Bryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a truly great player, he had the ability to do so many things, running, passing, tackling, kicking, and just reading the play. He just seemed to be able to find a way to get to the try line."</p>

            <p>The pair were friends off the field, too - and that continued long after their playing years ended. They spent time together in Paihia with their wives just two months ago, and were captured in a photograph together which Sir Bryan said he would cherish.</p>
        
            <p>"Sid was a thorough gentleman. He was softly spoken, kind, just a really decent, decent man."</p>
        
            <p>Together the pair made history as two of the first four non-white rugby players to represent New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>They were part of the team that toured South Africa in 1970, as players who were dubbed "honorary whites" - a term Sir Bryan said was used to justify their participation during apartheid.</p>
        
            <p>"All Black teams prior to that had not included Māori or Pacific players, so it was history-making."</p>

            <p>In the last few days the family had spent special time together remembering a great dad, rugby player and role model, Sid Going's eldest son, Milton Going, said.</p>
        
            <p>The number of messages from people who knew him through rugby, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the community showed the example he set in many aspects of his life, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just proud of what he's done, and how he's lived his life."</p>
        
            <p>Milton Going said his father was humble and often bemused by the attention he got at events when he was invited as the "main attraction".</p>
        
            <p>"He was kind of oblivious to that most of the time, and quite shy, and wondering what all the fuss was about. That's the sort of person he was," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Sid Going's funeral will be held on Monday at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the far north town of Maromaku, where he grew up.</p>
