        <h2>Shock closure for family centre after funding pulled</h2>
        <p>
"One minute we're operating beautifully. The next minute, we're not financially viable," a Porirua Women and Famly Centre staffer said.

            <p>A Porirua community centre supporting a wide range of vulnerable families has been forced to shut its doors after the local Women's Refuge pulled its financial support.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua Women and Family Centre chair Mary More said the change came "as a huge shock".</p>
        
            <p>"One minute we're operating beautifully. The next minute, we're not financially viable."</p>
        
            <p>According to the centre's website, it was "established and designed" as an extension of Porirua Women's Refuge Whare Manaaki to "provide a space for wāhine and their whānau to nurture their wellbeing in a safe and supportive environment".</p>
        
            <p>It runs workshops and courses, has an open pantry and a clothing bank, and hosts social and community groups, such as Rape Crisis and Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, as well as providing a base for government agencies like Work and Income, police working in family violence, Oranga Tamariki social workers and lawyers for children to meet with young clients.</p>
        
            <p>Three of its four trustees were employed by Whare Manaaki, and according to its deed of settlement, they had to approve each new trustee and board member.</p>
        
            <p>It registered as a charity in August 2023 and created a separate trust in December.</p>
        
            <p>More said her understanding was that in March, the board of Whare Manaaki agreed to "gift" $400,000 to the centre to allow it to establish itself as a separate entity.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole goal was that Manaaki would support the establishment of the women's centre until we transitioned to independence. And we were in the process of transitioning to independence, making progress with fundraising and getting public support, so we could operate as a separate entity."</p>
        
            <p>However, the centre was contacted by a lawyer to say the fund transfer had been "vetoed" by the national office.</p>

            <p>Whare Manaaki suddenly stopped paying two of the centre's workers - including its social worker - and started sending invoices for power and printer costs.</p>
        
            <p>It also gave notice of its intention to charge the centre $14,000 a month for rent.</p>
        
            <p>A public meeting last Saturday generated huge support, and it was hoped funding would follow.</p>
        
            <p>However, More said a media report on Friday that detailed allegations of financial impropriety by some Whare Manaaki staff, which they denied, had probably killed any chance of reopening the centre.</p>
        
            <p>National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges chief executive Ang Jury said the centre appeared to be an "unfortunate casualty" of the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Their decision to fund a totally separate organisation was misguided - perhaps well-intentioned but misguided - because it's not the intention of the government funding they were receiving."</p>
        
            <p>The national body had informed the local board it was not possible to transfer funding to another charity about six to eight weeks ago, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I regret what is happening with the Porirua Women and Family Centre, I really do.</p>
        
            <p>"But I cannot allow funding that's for a refuge to provide services to women and children to be diverted to another service, that's simply an absolute misuse of government money, it's totally outside the remit of the refuge."</p>
