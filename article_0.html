            <p>Several New Zealand athletes had a tough time at the Olympics overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Lulu Sun lost her first round singles match to Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk and her doubles match with Erin Routliffe was delayed again by rain.</p>
        
            <p>Gymnast Georgia Rose-Brown missed out on the finals, Luuka Jones missed out on the medals in the kayak singles, and Sammie Maxwell finished 8th at the mountain biking.</p>
        
            <p>The sailors and Black Ferns had a more successful night.</p>
        
            <p>But Wellington swimmer Lewis Clareburt is the one to watch for a chance at New Zealand's first medal of the tournament on Monday morning.</p>
