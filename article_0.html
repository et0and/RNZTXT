        <h2>Watch: NZ sending frigate, planes to help monitor N.Korea</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister has announced a ramping-up of Aotearoa's part in monitoring sanctions on the state.
</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa will send an NZDF frigate and planes to military bases in Japan to help support the monitoring of sanctions on North Korea.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon revealed the ramping-up of New Zealand's part in the monitoring at a visite to a navy base in Japan today.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon started his trade mission programme with a full business delegation in tow this morning.</p>
        
            <p>He said Aotearoa was "proud of its part in the Security Council sanctions regime on North Korea which our country has been part of since 2018".</p>
        
            <p>It was part of efforts to get North Korea to give up its nuclear activities.</p>
        
            <p>An ANZAC class frigate will deploy in 2026 and a P8 aircraft will deploy twice a year in 2025-26.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a real uplift in the number of assets we're deploying to support this vital mission" which was crucial for the Indo-Pacific region, Luxon said.</p>
