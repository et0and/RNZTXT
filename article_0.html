            <p>If you cut or bought your real Christmas tree in the first flush of festive spirits, chances are it'll be looking past its use-by date by early January.</p>
        
            <p>In many parts of New Zealand, people will take to theirs with a saw and burn it on an open fire, or shred and spread it on their garden. (Be warned, however: not all plants appreciate pine chippings as it can make the soil more acidic.)</p>
        
            <p>But what if you're a sorry urban-dweller with neither the tools for the job nor the place to chuck it afterwards? Here's how to dispose of your Christmas tree without causing an eyesore.</p>
        
            <p>You definitely shouldn't put the tree in your general waste or recycling bin. Some councils used to offer berm-side pickup in January, but this is no longer the case.</p>
        
            <p>Many Christmas tree farms offer a disposal service. Misa in the Auckland suburb of Balmoral is accepting drop-offs most Friday evenings from 3 January through to 31 January. There is a $15 for this service and there are no drop-offs outside those hours. The tree is taken to Puketutu Island and turned into compost.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Mount Gabriel Christmas Tree Farms in Māngere Bridge - the source of my family's tree this season - accepts any and all used trees for no charge, even if you didn't buy from them in the first place. The used trees are shredded then spread as mulch to feed the next year's crop of trees.</p>
        
            <p>If you bought your tree from a reputable seller, check to see if they'll take it back in January.</p>
        
            <p>Otherwise, Auckland Council suggests these tips - and they'll be applicable in many other parts of the motu as well:</p>
        
            <p>Illegally dumped trees in neighbourhoods, parks or waterways should be reported to your local council.</p>
        
            <p>Tip Shop Wellington is taking all Christmas trees for free at its recycling centre at the Southern Landfill in Owhiri Bay until 20 January. In a post on social media, Wellington City Council said it received 5000 trees each year, which were turned into about 1000 40-litre bags of organic compost.</p>
        
            <p>In Christchurch, the council suggests residents chop up the tree and put it in their green organics bin, or take it to an EcoDrop transfer station in Bromley, Wigram or Redwood; charges apply.</p>
        
            <p>And if you're anywhere near Palmerston North, you can take your tree for free to the Awapuni Resource Recovery Park until the end of January, where it will be recycled and turned into compost for the city's parks.</p>
