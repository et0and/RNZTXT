            <p>The Interislander ferry Aratere won't be refloated until the morning after running aground just outside Picton.</p>

            <p>Interislander general manager Duncan Roy said the vessel, with 47 people on board, departed Picton at 9.45pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It ran aground following a steering failure.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a freight-only sailing with eight commercial vehicle drivers and 39 crew on board. There are no injuries and the vessel is watertight."</p>
        
            <p>Looks like the Interisland ferry Aratere has runaround shortly after leaving Picton this evening! Hope everyone on board is ok! Life jackets have been given out to passengers. pic.twitter.com/hb7yJ82i0F</p>
        
            <p>Roy told RNZ the ferry was "secure" and he, along with KiwiRail's chief executive Peter Reidy, would be taking the first flight from Auckland to Picton in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>The plan was to refloat the ferry on the high tide, between 8am and 10am Saturday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It would be assisted by harbour tugs, and he was confident they could do the job.</p>
        
            <p>It was too early to discuss what impact the grounding would have on the company's freight in the Cook Strait, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now I'm totally concentrated on our passengers on board and our crew on board - that is our main focus.</p>
        
            <p>Right now we're totally focussed on recovering our vessel but most importantly making sure our people are safe and sound."</p>
        
            <p>Roy said he understood other ships were still coming and going from the port.</p>
        
            <p>Low tide was expected in the area around 2.20am, according to MetService.</p>

            <p>Port Marlborough said the Harbourmaster was enforcing a 500-metre exclusion zone in the harbour and would be patrolling.</p>
        
            <p>"We have mobilised our marine and pilotage teams, and the two Port Marlborough tugs which are on the water, on standby to assist as required.</p>
        
            <p>"Port Marlborough is working closely with the Harbourmaster, ferry crew and relevant authorities to provide all necessary support and resources."</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand said in a statement that it would be investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 2.8km north of Picton.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack said it would have been a "pretty frightening" incident for those on board.</p>
        
            <p>"I have heard that the Harbourmaster is on board doing checks but I'm trying to find out further information. Obviously it's a pretty concerning incident."</p>
        
            <p>Boyack said she had been advised everyone on board had been given a lifejacket.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com showed the ferry was near Pine Bay and not moving just after 11pm Friday. It was about half an hour out of Picton.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel's status was "aground", the website said.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance said it was notified of the incident at 10.04pm.</p>
        
            <p>"We ... are currently on scene with two ambulances, one first response unit, one manager and a Major Incident Support Team. There are no reports of injuries."</p>

            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said in a social media post that he had been advised there was no indication of injuries, danger to life, or danger of oil polluting the marine environment.</p>
        
            <p>"The vessel is watertight. Both KiwiRail and Maritime NZ are actively dealing with the situation."</p>
        
            <p>In January 2023, the Interislander ferry Kaitaki broke down in the Cook Strait and ended up drifting, resulting in a mayday call.</p>
        
            <p>Tug boats had to escort the ferry, which had 880 people on board, to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A report later found the breakdown was partly due to KiwiRail not replacing critical engine parts.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ has since filed a charge against KiwiRail under the Health and Safety at Work Act in relation to the incident. The maximum penalty is $1.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, all passenger sailings on the Interislander's Kaiarahi ferry were cancelled for several days due to a mechanical fault.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a project to build two new ferries and redevelop the ports was canned by the coalition government after spiralling costs meant it was no longer economically feasible to proceed.</p>
        
            <p>The project would still be $1.5 billion in the hole after 2050, documents revealed.</p>
