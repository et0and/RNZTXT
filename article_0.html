            <p>A large 7.3 magnitude Pacific earthquake poses no tsunami threat to New Zealand, the National Emergency Management Agency says.</p>
        
            <p>The quake, at a depth of 10km struck Port-Vila, Vanuatu, on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey says.</p>
        
            <p>NEMA and GNS Science assessed the quake and said based on current information, it's unlikely to pose a threat to NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The tsunami threat for Vanuatu and its Pacific neighbours has also now passed, according to the USGS.</p>
