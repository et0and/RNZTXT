            <p>Biosecurity New Zealand is investigating and boosting trapping after new Auckland fruit fly was found on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>An operation is under way and extra field teams are in the suburb of Birkdale, on Auckland's North Shore, after the discovery of the single male Oriental fruit fly.</p>
        
            <p>The fly was found in a surveillance trap in a suburban backyard, Biosecurity New Zealand Commissioner North Mike Inglis said.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after another oriental fruit fly was found in South Auckland's Papatoetoe at the start of January.</p>
        
            <p>The fruit fly was considered a significant threat, with maggots capable of feeding on more than 300 different fruit and vegetable crops.</p>
        
            <p>MPI restricted the movement of fruit and vegetables around Papatoetoe for a time, but restrictions were lifted a week ago.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
