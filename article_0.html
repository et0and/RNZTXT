            <p>Polls are closed and the results are coming in after almost two weeks of voting for the Port Waikato seat.</p>
        
            <p>With 84 percent of the vote in, National party candidate Andrew Bayly has 13147 votes, while New Zealand First candidate Casey Costello, the only other major party candidate, has 2579, a margin of more than 10,000 votes.</p>
        
            <p>Costello has told RNZ that she concedes the race tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Labour, the Greens and the ACT Party were not standing for the seat. A variety of small minor parties were also standing.</p>
        
            <p>Voting closed at 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>More than 12,000 people had turned out to vote with two hours to go before voting stations shut.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 37 voting places open for the by-election.</p>
        
            <p>The Electoral Commission said the stations have been operating with no issues to report.</p>
        
            <p>The by-election was sparked by the death of ACT candidate Neil Christensen just before the general election on 14 October.</p>
        
            <p>The seat has long been a National Party stronghold. At number 15 on the party list, Bayly is an MP no matter what the results are today, as is Costello, who is number 3 on NZ First's list.</p>
        
            <p>If Bayly wins the seat, Parliament will have 123 seats - the biggest ever.</p>

            <p>Former Labour MP Sue Moroney said adding a few more MPs won't change too much.</p>
        
            <p>"Doesn't necessarily change the way in which Parliament operates. It simply changes the numbers available for voting and of course increases the cost to the taxpayer slightly.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's something that should be brought in mind when the new government thinks about how they address this for the future."</p>
        
            <p>There had been concerns over voter turnout, with public confusion over another election being held just six weeks after the general election.</p>
        
            <p>The official results, including special and overseas votes, will be released on 6 December.</p>
