        <h2>Copper and robbers: Waikato vicar camps out to catch thieves</h2>
        <p>
Julie Guest says the copper stolen from the St John's Church roof was worth just $500, but the damage caused will cost $125,000.

            <p>A Te Awamutu church has taken extreme measures to stop copper thieves.</p>
        
            <p>St John's Church Reverend and parish vicar, Julie Guest, said since November, people had been ripping copper off the church's roof.</p>
        
            <p>Three 4sqm panels had been stolen during multiple incidents, as well as the church's last remaining copper downpipe, Guest said.</p>
        
            <p>Since the theft started ramping up, Guest and her husband had been camping at the church every night and installed security cameras to deter thieves.</p>
        
            <p>"We're campers so we already had the equipment and we have to protect this building."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Guest and her husband caught a thief in the act.</p>

            <p>"We were here in the building sleeping. We thought the noise we were hearing was the building moving in the wind but it was someone on the roof.</p>
        
            <p>"My husband saw him jump off and run away. But because we disturbed him he wasn't able to take anything."</p>

            <p>The incident was caught on camera and they gave the footage to police, Guest said.</p>
        
            <p>The damage to the 60-year-old church was heartbreaking and unnecessary, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The silly thing is a generous cost of what has been stolen might come to $500 in total but they've caused $125,000 of damage."</p>
        
            <p>The church was fundraising to replace the copper roof with a less robust material, which Guest said would cost more to maintain.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only have they caused us expense now, but in the future because the new roof will have to be replaced but copper wouldn't be."</p>
        
            <p>Having copper on the roof put the building's viability at risk, she said.</p>

            <p>"The copper is still in as good of knick as it was when it went on. It doesn't need replacing at all.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad because there's no better material than copper but to put it back would be asking for trouble."</p>
        
            <p>They had temporarily covered the roof, but it was a short-term solution, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Guest, who had led the Waikato parish of four Anglican churches since 2019, said St John's was also used as a shelter for rough sleepers.</p>
        
            <p>"When things like this happen fingers are pointed at them which is not what we're about. We don't believe it's someone in our community."</p>

            <p>The copper spouting on another one of the parish's churches, St Paul's on Rangiaowhia Rd, was also stolen in November.</p>
        
            <p>She said the community was devastated by the damage.</p>
        
            <p>"A place that is taonga and that brings people together is being attacked.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hurting, especially because it is happening at this time of year."</p>
        
            <p>Guest said she would continue to stay at the church overnight until the situation was resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't do it for the rest of our lives but I don't see an end to it until we have a new roof.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope it happens sooner rather than later."</p>
        
            <p>The church had set up a Givealittle page to help fund repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they received a report on 17 December that copper had been stolen from a roof on Arawata Street and they were making enquiries.</p>
