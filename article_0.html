            <p>A spokespersons says crews are working to restore as much capacity as possible to the network and power from local sources is being utilised.</p>
        
            <p>Some Northland residents have their power restored amid the ongoing, wide-spread outages.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower earlier said Northland lost power after a tower fell near Glorit about 11am and most of its 65,000 customers were affected. Top Energy was also reporting outages from KaitƒÅia to Cape Reinga.</p>
        
            <p>About 2.30pm Transpower said partial restoration was on the way for Northland. Crews are at the site of the fallen tower, working through options to restore further power to the region.</p>
