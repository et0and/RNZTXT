            <p>Aotearoa has reclaimed the Guinness World Record for the largest haka from France after thousands performed Ka Mate at Auckland's Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The previous official record was 4028, held by France since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>While the official number of participants is yet to land, Guinness World Records adjudicator Brian Sobel confirmed New Zealand has smashed that record. Estimates were that up to 10,000 people attended.</p>
        
            <p>People travelled from far and wide to support the kaupapa, with American TV host Conan O'Brien, director Taika Waititi and boxer David Tua spotted in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Gates opened at 4.30pm before the haka attempt itself just after 8pm. Local entertainment included Six60, Alien Weaponry, Che Fu, Rob Ruha and the Topp Twins.</p>

            <p>Dame Hinewehi Mohi championed the world record attempt as part of the 20th anniversary of the Raukatauri Music Therapy Trust, named after her daughter Hineraukatauri, who has severe cerebral palsy.</p>
