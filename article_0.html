            <p>Policy programmes have been agreed with ACT and New Zealand First and with ministerial positions now being discussed, National Party leader Christopher Luxon says.</p>
        
            <p>Arriving for more talks at the Cordis Hotel in Auckland on Monday - more than two weeks on from the return of the final vote count without a deal to form a government - he told reporters of the progress being made.</p>
        
            <p>"We've achieved a significant milestone overnight and that is actually that we have closed out and agreed policy programmes with both ACT and New Zealand First, that's a major achievement," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Importantly we've had ACT and New Zealand First meeting over the course of this last week talking about their major priorities and importantly this morning they've continued those conversations to make sure that they can both sign on to each others' policy programmes and agendas that we've agreed with them individually.</p>
        
            <p>He said they had not made any policy tradeoffs for ministerial positions, and those roles would be what the partner parties sorted out next, which they wanted to get through "as quickly as possible".</p>
        
            <p>"We sort of want to kick on, and move on into ministerial responsibilities and cabinet positions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way we set this up from the beginning, as I said, is we're trying to do something quite unique, which is that we're taking three parties into a coalition government that we want to make sure that is strong and stable. That means that we have gone through every line item of all three parties manifestos and we've worked our way through all the policy positions and the differences and the different mechanics for achieving the same with different goals.</p>
        
            <p>"We've done the policy work first and foremost before we've had any conversation around Cabinet positions and we'll now kick that off."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
