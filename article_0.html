        <h2>Watch: Trump vows 'America's decline is over'</h2>
        <p>
The returning president has said has promised to send troops to the Mexico border, to declare there are 'only two genders', and put people on Mars in his first speech after taking office.

            <p>Donald Trump has been sworn in as the president of the United States of America for the second time.</p>
        
            <p>Trump announced on Friday that frigid temperatures meant the inauguration would have to be moved inside the Capitol building.</p>
        
            <p>The Republican president invited a number of tech titans to attend as VIPs, including billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, as well as Shou Chew, the head of Chinese social media giant TikTok, according to US media.</p>
        
            <p>Outgoing president Joe Biden attended the ceremony - despite Trump's refusal to appear at Biden's swearing in when he beat Trump in 2020. All living former presidents - Bill Clinton, George Bush and Barack Obama - will attend, as will their wives, except for Michelle Obama.</p>
