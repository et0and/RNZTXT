        <h2>Watch Live: Coalition deal still not finalised</h2>
        <p>
National Party leader Christopher Luxon says a coalition deal is close - but there are still issues to be dealt with, and deputy prime minister role is one of the sticking points.
</p>
        
            <p>National Party leader Christopher Luxon says a coalition deal is close, and who takes the role of deputy prime minister is one of the final issues to be dealt with.</p>
        
            <p>The negotiations to form a new government have been going on for several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media on Wednesday afternoon, Luxon said: "As I said yesterday we are int he final stages of our coalition conversations, and we've made tremendous progress as I've said before".</p>
        
            <p>"We've agreed fully a policy programme, we've also agreed the processes and ways of working as a government, we've importantly largely worked through ministerial responsibilities and positions."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was fair to say deputy prime minister is one of the sticking points, but "those are conversations I've said I'd have with the leaders".</p>
        
            <p>It will take as long as it takes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we're so close, we've come so, so far. And we need to close it out quickly and get to work.</p>
        
            <p>"Suffice to say we've got a couple of issues to close out and then we can get this thing done ... largely we've agreed our ministerial positions and appointments."</p>
        
            <p>He said Nicola Willis as deputy prime minister was never a consideration.</p>
        
            <p>"No, absolutely not. It had never been a consideration for Nicola, her and I both spoken well before the negotiation and of the view that frankly given our past convention that actually deputy prime ministership is a role that should be held by coalition leaders."</p>
        
            <p>He continued to repeat his position that he would conduct negotiations in the room with the other party leaders.</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at how MMP works around the world and you look at how long it takes to form governments in other MMP environments, I think we've made tremendous progress and the fact that we have agreed an aligned policy programme that all the party leaders can support is a fantastic achievement. The fact that we've agreed processes is really important and the fact that we've largely resolved our ministerial appointments and responsibilities is great.</p>
        
            <p>"The three parties are very aligned around the goals of how to take this country forward ... we're gonna work on that together."</p>
        
            <p>Today some senior National MPs, including deputy leader Nicola Willis and Chris Bishop returned to Wellington, with Willis telling RNZ her job in Auckland was done.</p>
        
            <p>It has now been nearly six weeks since the 14 October election, and almost three weeks since the final vote total was announced. Special votes saw National and ACT lose their majority, meaning they need NZ First to form a government.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been holding talks with ACT leader David Seymour and NZ First leader Winston Peters for several days in Auckland, and has indicated talks were nearing their end.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Luxon said policy programmes had been agreed with ACT and NZ First and ministerial positions were being discussed.</p>
