        <h2>Live: Willis vows inject 'genuine competition' into banking</h2>
        <p>
The current market is a less of a battle and more of a "cosy pillow fight", the Finance Minister says as a major Commerce Commission report calls for changes.
</p>
        
            <p>The Finance Minister says the government will respond to all 14 recommendations from the Commerce Commission's long-awaited report into banking competition.</p>
        
            <p>Responding to the report, Nicola Willis said the sector was less like a battle between retail banks and more like a "cosy pillow fight".</p>
        
            <p>She has asked Treasury to engage with Kiwibank's parent company Kiwi Group Capital on options for raising new capital - including from KiwiSaver funds and investment funds.</p>
