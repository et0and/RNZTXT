            <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia has thanked the estimated 10,000 people who answered his call to come together today to participate in a national hui at Tuurangawaewae Marae.</p>
        
            <p>In his address he told those gathered that the turn out of Māori and non-Māori at the hui sent a strong message that the government would not be able to ignore</p>
        
            <p>Ngā Hau e Whā, kia Kotahi ra, a short but powerful statement shared by Kiingi Tuuheitia signalling the Hui aa Motu would extend to the four winds to strengthen the movement.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Hui aa Iwi would continue to evolve and announced it would also be travelling to Te Waipounamu (the South Island) and Te Tai Rāwhiti (the East Coast).</p>
        
            <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia said the world was watching and the government would be foolish to underestimate what te ao Māori was capable of.</p>
        
            <p>Indigenous nations across the globe were supporting the cause and the kohanga movement was shining through with a new generation of leaders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Read back on how the day unfolded here:</p>
