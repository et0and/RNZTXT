        <h2>Live: 'We must accept the results': Harris concedes US election</h2>
        <p>
"The light of American's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting," Harris has told the crowd as Donald Trump's margin of victory grows.

            <p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has addressed supporters after conceding victory in the US election to her Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Trump is projected to win the election, clinching 291 electoral college votes so far. The candidates needed 270 to win.</p>
        
            <p>Votes are still being counted in some areas, with the winners in a handful of states - Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Nevada - yet to be announced.</p>
        
            <p>Harris has called Trump to concede and made a speech at Howard University in Washington DC where she said "we must accept the results of this election", but "while I concede this election I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign".</p>
