            <p>Gymnast Georgia Rose-Brown missed out on the finals, Luuka Jones missed out on the medals in the kayak singles, and Sammie Maxwell finished 8th at the mountain biking.</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Lewis Clareburt made it to the 400m individual medley final but came 6th.</p>
        
            <p>The sailors and Black Ferns had a more successful night.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns won their first two games of the tournament this morning - besting both China and Canda - they take on Fiji in their final pool match early on Tuesday.</p>
