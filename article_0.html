            <p>Traffic was being diverted along the interstate or through the harbour tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>The BBC has reported that the bridge was struck by the Singapore-flagged Dali container ship, a 300m-long vessel that was on its way to Colombo in Sri Lanka.</p>
        
            <p>On marine radars, the Dali departed from the terminal at Port Breeze at around 12:45am ET (4:45am GMT). It travelled towards the Francis Scott Key Bridge, but became stationary at the site of the bridge 45 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>The bridge that collapsed is named the Francis Scott Key Bridge, or the Key Bridge for short. It is part of the 695 highway that circles Baltimore.</p>
        
            <p>The shipping company Synergy Marine Group confirmed that its ship Dali collided with a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst the exact cause of the incident is yet to be determined, the 'Dali' has now mobilised its Qualified Individual Incident response service," it says.</p>
        
            <p>It said all crew members were accounted for and there were no reports of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
