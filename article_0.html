            <p>A severe thunderstorm that caused more than 70 floods in Auckland is heading south and east.</p>
        
            <p>There is now a severe thunderstorm watch in place for Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Rotorua, Taupō and Gisborne until noon on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said rainfall of this intensity could cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas near streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also cause slips.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay is forecast to receive up to 200mm of rain, mostly south of SH5..</p>
        
            <p>Overnight torrential rain and thunderstorms hit Auckland and saw fire crews called to 71 flooded or weather-damaged homes.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 100mm of rain fell in places between 9pm and 11pm on Monday night, MetService said.</p>
