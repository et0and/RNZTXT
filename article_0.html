            <p>The gates of Tuurangawaewae Marae have been opened to everyone on the third day of Kiingi Tuheitia's tangi.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands paid their respects on Saturday to Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died early on Friday at the age of 69.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past two days, the people of Tainui have had the chance to mourn their King - now iwi from across the motu would be arriving from this morning to pay tribute. An 8am pōwhiri (welcoming on to the marae) was beginning at Tuurangawaewae.</p>
        
            <p>More than 500 people from across New Zealand were expected at Tuurangawaewae on Sunday, including Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro and members of the Rātana church.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi including Te Arawa, Ngāti Kauwhata and Ngāti Hine would be in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>Also arriving today was the ariki of Ngāti Tuwharetoa - Tumu Te Heuheu - and his iwi.</p>
        
            <p>Tūwharetoa have been close allies of the kiingitanga since its formation.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Police have advised motorists there would be daily road closures around Tuurangawaewae Marae until Thursday, when Kiingi Tuuheitia would be laid to rest.</p>
