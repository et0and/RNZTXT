            <p>Wellington Council netted nearly $10,000 on the first day of two new fixed bus lane cameras being live in Newtown.</p>
        
            <p>The new fixed cameras went live on Riddiford Street and Adelaide Road northbound on Monday, with anyone caught using the bus lane getting an immediate $150 fine.</p>
        
            <p>On day one, 55 infringements were issued on Riddiford Street and 11 on Adelaide Road - a total of 66 infringements.</p>
        
            <p>A camera also went live at the same time on Chaytor Street South in Karori , but no fines were issued there.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council has launched a number of bus lane cameras across the city this year, including a southbound camera on Adelaide Road back in June.</p>
        
            <p>The council has also had 'tripod' crews monitoring some of the bus lanes ahead of the cameras being turned on.</p>
