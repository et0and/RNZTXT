            <p>New Zealand has spent $113 million so far to help build and use a web of United States military satellites, government papers show.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has relied for 12 years on the Wideband Global Satellite Communications web, built by Boeing and run by the Pentagon for several allied countries.</p>
        
            <p>The US has recently been asking partners to stump up more cash, and New Zealand said it would put $15m towards sending up two much more powerful satellites to take the web up to one dozen.</p>
        
            <p>It also pays an annual operating fee of just over $1m.</p>
        
            <p>A briefing from April released under the Official Information Act showed the total costs since 2012 were $113m.</p>
        
            <p>Of that, $83m was the fee that New Zealand paid in 2012 for access to the web of 10 satellites.</p>
        
            <p>The briefing also said that the Defence Force was looking to boost its very limited space capabilities, and was interested in more ground-based space infrastructure at a time of "rapid" growth of the country's commercial space operators.</p>
        
            <p>"This could include vertical or horizontal launch infrastructure, and other ground-based infrastructure that supports the testing and trialling of uncrewed aerial vehicles, rockets and supporting technologies," a briefing to the government late last year said.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force told RNZ that its updated Defence Capability Plan would lay out any indicative investments relating to space through to 2040.</p>
        
            <p>The new plan is due to go to the defence minister next month.</p>
