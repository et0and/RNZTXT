            <p>A school lunch that left a school child in Gisborne burnt should never have been reheated in a commercial oven.</p>
        
            <p>A message from the Ministry of Education to education peak bodies, published on social media by education union NZEI Te Riu Roa this afternoon, said lunch provider Compass had been instructed not to use those packaged meals again as they were never intended for use in commercial ovens.</p>
        
            <p>The message said the ministry had asked the Ministry for Primary Industries to expand its investigation into the school lunch programme to include heating practices.</p>
        
            <p>The note posted by the union said the Ministry said "we have instructed Compass that these particular types of packaged meals cannot be served again in the programme, as they were never intended to be reheated in a commercial oven."</p>

            <p>"We have also directed the School Lunch Collective to publish visual evidence daily of the quality of meals produced across all kitchens," the note added.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Bay of Plenty school says its school lunches have been delivered so hot, containers have exploded.</p>
        
            <p>Te Puke Intermediate deputy Principal Stephen Knightly told Checkpoint the Watties flexi lunches are so overheated and heavy he has had to buy rubber gardening gloves to remove the hot lunches from the food bins they are delivered in.</p>
        
            <p>He said one student "chomped down on a meatball with plastic".</p>
        
            <p>Knightly said the sheer weight of the meals squashes the ones underneath and one day looked like a "cottage pie massacre". He said he spent seven hours between Monday and Wednesday this week cleaning up the mess.</p>
        
            <p>He has emailed the Lunch Collective regularly and even visited the kitchen to pick the meals one day to see the issues for himself.</p>
