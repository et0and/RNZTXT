        <h2>Watch live: Power outage to 88,000 homes 'entirely avoidable' - report</h2>
        <p>
Staff had raised concerns about the refurbishment of the tower in 2021.
</p>
        
            <p>A massive power outage across most of Northland was entirely avoidable, a major report into the cause has found.</p>
        
            <p>The Electricity Authority has just released its review into the collapse of the electricity transmission tower that left 88,000 in Northland without power in June.</p>
        
            <p>The report found Transpower missed an opportunity to take action when staff raised concerns relating to baseplate refurbishment of the tower in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>A senior engineer had then identified a gap in the knowledge of maintenance crews undertaking the foundation work.</p>
        
            <p>The report estimates the economic loss for Northland ranged between $37.5 to $80 million.</p>
        
            <p>In August an independent report found contractor error was to blame for the collapse of the power pylon in Auckland's Golrit.</p>

            <p>It said a relatively inexperienced and inadequately supervised worker removed nuts from three of the four legs of the pylon, compromising its stability and causing it to rupture and fall, cutting power for hours.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the outage, Energy Minister Simeon Brown ordered the Electricity Authority to review the cause.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
