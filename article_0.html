His family say they've been "ghosted" by government ministry staff and left in the dark about the reasons for the cut. Audio

            <p>The family of a disabled man who needs round-the-clock care say they are having to let go of his support staff after funding was suddenly cut.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan Cook's family said they had been "ghosted" by government ministry staff and left in the dark about the reasons for the cut.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Ministry of Social Development said it was waiting for more information from the family, who had asked for a funding increase.</p>
        
            <p>The Woodville family rejected that, saying they had provided everything asked of them.</p>
        
            <p>After more than three years of funding under the Enabling Good Lives scheme, administered by Mana Whaikaha, a payment on 13 September was missed.</p>
        
            <p>And since then Ryan Cook's family have not received a dollar - nor a reason why.</p>
        
            <p>"How on earth do they think Ryan is actually surviving?" his mum, Pip Cook, said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about going to the park for him, or going to a group. It's actually about his daily needs."</p>

            <p>Ryan, 20, has cri-du-chat syndrome, and has many physical and developmental challenges. He came to the Cooks under foster care, but they consider him part of their family.</p>
        
            <p>Under Enabling Good Lives they have received an annual budget to spend on his support, including a team of carers.</p>
        
            <p>But it was not renewed this year and from June they were getting fortnightly payments. Now, these had stopped.</p>
        
            <p>As well as waiting for more information the Ministry of Social Development, which has taken responsibility for disability services from the Ministry of Disabled People, said the Cooks asked for a "significant" increase in funding, and officials needed more details about this.</p>
        
            <p>"We have answered all of their questions," Pip Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been in front of a panel and they have just stopped Ryan's funding with no communication to us at all."</p>
        
            <p>This has forced the Cooks to dip into their own pockets.</p>
        
            <p>"We are having to subsidise [Ryan's care] ourselves. We are having to cut our carers' hours back.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of that one of our carers is laying a grievance against us as an employer because we haven't been able to give her proper notice."</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>If the funding was not restored, Pip Cook said she would have to stop working on the family dairy farm to care for Ryan.</p>
        
            <p>They live in Woodville, where there are no suitable residential care options.</p>
        
            <p>Family advocate Jane Carrigan said she disputed that the Cooks asked for a significant increase, saying they had requested an extra $40,000 out of a budget of more than $250,000.</p>
        
            <p>That was because of Ryan's changing needs - for example, as he grew he needed two people to lift him.</p>
        
            <p>Carrigan said her attempts to contact staff in the ministries of disabled people and social development to find out what was happening had gone unanswered.</p>
        
            <p>The family received an email this week from one official saying they were off sick, but providing no alternative contact.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't go from funding a high-needs man, with a large funding package, then whip it out from under the family without having serious ramifications across the board.</p>
        
            <p>"Ryan's mum has been hugely distressed by this."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ministry of Social Development disability support services programme director Alastair Hill said the Cooks needed to give Enabling Good Lives provider Mana Whaikaha the information it said it needed.</p>
        
            <p>"We would urge the family to provide the information Mana Whaikaha needs for disability-related support to be provided.</p>
        
            <p>"Mana Whaikaha is committed to ensuring Ryan has access to the supports he needs, and to working with the family to progress the proposal for funded disability supports."</p>
        
            <p>Despite payments to the Cooks stopping, Hill said their funding was not cut.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the family needed to provide details to confirm an increase in funding was appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"Mana Whaikaha has asked for clarification about what the requested funding will be used for, and how this will support Ryan's disability-related needs, as this remains unclear from the information provided so far."</p>
        
            <p>Once the information was provided, and Mana Whaikaha assessed it, it would then go to a review panel.</p>
        
            <p>"After the panel decision, Ryan or his representative can seek reconsideration of the decision if they don't agree with it. The panel can meet as required so a decision can be provided quickly."</p>
        
            <p>The Cook family appeared before a panel three months ago, but it did not reach a decision about the annual budget. Until the payments stopped, they received fortnightly payments.</p>
        
            <p>Hill said Enabling Good Lives funding had increased this year.</p>
