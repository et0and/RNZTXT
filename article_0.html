            <p>The body of a five-year-old boy missing near Gisborne has been found in a farm pond near his home.</p>
        
            <p>Kaizer went missing from his home in the rural Hangaroa district of Gisborne and had not been seen since about 2pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Kazier's family have taken him home and have requested privacy to mourn.</p>
        
            <p>Specialist search teams, rescue dogs, a helicopter and up to 300 people from the area were involved in searching for him.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said the pond was about 100 metres from the house.</p>
        
            <p>The police dive squad spent about an hour searching before he was found.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier RNZ reporter Alexa Cook told Checkpoint the area where Kazier went missing was a "really rough part of the country".</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful but it is steep, it's gnarly, there's lots of big high hills, low gullys, lots of ponds and rivers and waterways that can all be pretty treacherous for a little five-year-old autistic boy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said people from Wairoa, Gisborne and even a busload of people from Tolaga Bay had turned up for the search on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Tai Rāwhiti area commander Inspector Darren Paki on Monday said there had been an "overwhelming outpouring of support from the community, with many people turning up wanting to help".</p>
