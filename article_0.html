            <p>State Highway 1 through the Brynderwyn Hills, between Kaiwaka and Waipū, has been closed after heavy rain caused some slips onto the road.</p>
        
            <p>However the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) was hoping for it to reopen by 3pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The route was Northland's main connection with the rest of the country, and reopened in June after a four-month closure due to earlier slips.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA project director for Northland recovery Mark Ware said heavy rain overnight had caused the slips.</p>
        
            <p>Machinery was on site to move the soil, he said.</p>

            <p>There was a detour in place for cars and other light vehicles detour via Nova Scotia Drive, Cove Road, Garbolino Road, and Kaiwaka-Mangawhai Road.</p>
        
            <p>In an earlier statement, NZTA said because it was a "significant slip", the detour was not suitable for trucks; instead, they needed to detour via State Highway 12 and SH14.</p>

            <p>"We have been advised by our council partners that Paparoa Oakley Road is unsuitable for freight at this time as there has been a significant under slip on the road."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA would continue to monitor the routes and provide updates.</p>
        
            <p>It advised drivers to check road and weather conditions before they travelled.</p>
