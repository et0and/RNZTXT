            <p>It is election day in the United States, with Americans heading to the polls to choose Kamala Harris or Donald Trump as their next president.</p>
        
            <p>Opinion polls show the candidates running neck and neck in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        
            <p>In Philadelphia yesterday, Vice President Harris repeated a common message that America was ready to move on from a decade of politics that she said had been driven by fear and division.</p>
        
            <p>Trump held his final campaign rally in Grand Rapids in Michigan - just as he did in 2016 and 2020 - and said he would fix all the country's problems and lower taxes.</p>
