            <p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is expected to address supporters on Thursday (NZT) after her Republican rival Donald Trump claimed victory in the United States presidential election.</p>
        
            <p>Trump is projected to win the election, clinching 291 electoral college votes so far. The candidates needed 270 to win.</p>
        
            <p>Votes are still being counted in some areas, with the winners in a handful of states - Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Nevada - yet to be announced as of 5am Thursday NZT.</p>
        
            <p>Harris has called Trump to concede and will make a speech on Wednesday afternoon in the US (about 10am Thursday NZT).</p>
