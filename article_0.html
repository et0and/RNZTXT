            <p>Former Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman has been charged with stealing nearly $10,000 worth of items from two different boutique stores.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman was due to appear in the Auckland District Court on Thursday, charged with three counts of shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>Her appearance has now been delayed, but court documents, released to media, show the value of the goods allegedly stolen.</p>
        
            <p>The documents say Ghahraman is accused of stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx store on 22 October.</p>
        
            <p>She is also charged with stealing $7223 of items from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby on 21 December and $2060 worth of goods from the same store the next day.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years if convicted.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, she said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character. I am not trying to excuse my actions, but I do want to explain them".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman is set to appear in court on 28 February.</p>
