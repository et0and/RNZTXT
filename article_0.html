        <p>

            <p>Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins says it was right for New Zealand On Air board member Andrew Shaw to quit over posting critical comments about Winston Peters - but the new prime minister should pull his deputy into line.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw resigned over a post he made regarding the deputy prime minister, and unreservedly apologised for comments made about Peters on LinkedIn.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw was responding to comments from Peters on Monday, during which he accused state-funded media organisations of a lack of independence from the previous government.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins told Morning Report the board member's comments were not appropriate in the context of his role.</p>
        
            <p>"While I've a lot of sympathy for his comments, I think Winston Peters' behaviour's been outrageous, "I think as a member of the New Zealand On Air board, I think it's very important that Andrew Shaw upheld the ... political independence of New Zealand on here as an entity.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think he's done the right thing in standing down."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said in reference to the Public Interest Journalism Fund that media "cannot defend $55m of bribery".</p>
        
            <p>The three-year $55m contestable fund for journalists initially set up to shore up public interest media during the Covid-19 pandemic, was wound up in July.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said the fund was established under the coalition government of which Winston Peters deputy prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "absolutely no basis in fact" for the accusation of bribery and Prime Minister Christopher Luxon should be "pulling Winston Peters into line".</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
