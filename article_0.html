            <p>His family were sobbing and keening as they walked his body across a paddock after he was found.</p>
        
            <p>Kaizer's father yelled out "I've lost my f***ing son" as he nearly fell, but he was held up by whānau.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of people surrounded the grieving family as they lifted Kaizer's stretcher up and carried him down the driveway to his home.</p>
        
            <p>The family have requested privacy to mourn.</p>

            <p>Earlier, RNZ reporter Alexa Cook told Checkpoint the area where Kaizer went missing was a "really rough part of the country".</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful but it is steep, it's gnarly, there's lots of big high hills, low gullys, lots of ponds and rivers and waterways that can all be pretty treacherous for a little five-year-old autistic boy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said people from Wairoa, Gisborne and even a busload of people from Tolaga Bay had turned up for the search on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Tai Rāwhiti area commander Inspector Darren Paki on Monday said there had been an "overwhelming outpouring of support from the community, with many people turning up wanting to help".</p>
        
            <p>Specialist search teams, rescue dogs, a helicopter and up to 300 people from the area were involved in searching for him.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
