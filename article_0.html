            <p>The government has been warned to "be careful" with its policies affecting Māori at the National Iwi Chairs Forum (NICF) on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Pressure is mounting ahead of Waitangi Day, as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon continues to defend the coalition arrangement to support ACT's Treaty Principles Bill to Select Committee.</p>
        
            <p>The NICF has been clear its criticism does not stop at this legislation; saying it will also fight policies like repealing Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority) and reinstating deep sea mining.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon lead a ministerial entourage to the Turner Centre, the venue for today's closed-door NICF hui, in Kerikeri this morning and told reporters it was a constructive meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"I leave there feeling very encouraged that actually we can do business," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that we can actually get on and get the programmes in place and get the programmes delivered to get the better outcomes that we want to see for Māori and non-Māori up and down the country.</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour said it was a fantastic meeting; claiming he changed some iwi representatives' minds about his Bill.</p>
        
            <p>"There's clear differences but there's lots of talking. That's a positive. After the speeches, going around having a bit of kai and talking to people there was really mixed reactions: people asking for selfies, saying they want to show this to my kids because 'I've changed my mind', while others say 'we'll never agree'."</p>
        
            <p>Iwi Chairs Forum Pou Tangata co-chair Rahui Papa said the discussions today were free and frank, kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face).</p>
        
            <p>He said the forum was hopeful that the government had heard their concerns - especially in regards to any meddling with Te Tiriti - but the proof will be in their actions.</p>
        
            <p>"In the coalition arrangements and in the 100-day plan, there were some notions of meddling with Te Tiriti and He Whakaputanga. That will be intolerable to Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"And so that was plainly stated, because that was the statements out of Ngāruawāhia, that was the statements out of Rātana, and those will still be the statements leading Waitangi."</p>

            <p>Ngāti Mutunga chair Jamie Tuuta said the NICF was looking forward to holding the government to account.</p>
        
            <p>He said the NICF would fight back against the removal of section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act through to the dismantling of the Māori Health Authority and any repeals of Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the key messages was to be careful. To set out what some of those bottom lines and what some of those particular issues that we will fight vigorously on but secondly also inviting the government to work with us to be our partner."</p>
        
            <p>Tuuta said the NICF recognised that they would not always agree with the government, but they could still work together where they did agree, such as on housing issues and the review of Kainga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>It would take time to build trust and confidence between the government and the NICF, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Māori-Crown relations has been a dominating issue since the coalition was formed and this looks set to continue - with the government back in Te Tai Tokerau in a few days' time for Waitangi commemorations.</p>
