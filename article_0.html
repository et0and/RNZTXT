            <p>Neighbours have described hearing gunshots and a commotion during what police say was a woman's kidnapping on Auckland's North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>Three locations on Auckland's North Shore were under police cordon on Tuesday night after a woman was forced into a car.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to Sunnyhaven Ave in Beach Haven at 7.30pm, after three people arrived at a home.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Callum McNeill said a woman was forced into a car during an 'altercation'.</p>
        
            <p>"As this has unfolded the firearm has been discharged."</p>
        
            <p>Despite more officers being called out and the use of the Eagle helicopter, the vehicle was not located. But police were soon called to Mackay Drive in Greenhithe, where they found the woman from the Beach Haven address.</p>
        
            <p>"She has sustained injuries and is in a stable condition, receiving treatment," McNeill said, noting they were not gunshot injuries.</p>
        
            <p>She was being treated at North Shore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>No arrests had yet been made.</p>
        
            <p>"We're making inquiries at this stage. There's still a lot of enquiry work that needs to take place in order to locate people that we need to speak to."</p>
        
            <p>Two armed police were still stationed outside the Beach Haven property, on the corner of Sunnyhaven Ave and Drome View Place, on Wednesday morning</p>

            <p>Three locals RNZ spoke to in Beach Haven on Wednesday morning said they heard the helicopter hovering in the area overnight. Some people reported on a local Facebook page of hearing gunshots and "a commotion".</p>
        
            <p>All cordons in both Greenhithe and Beach Haven were lifted by dawn on Tuesday, though police remained in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information could call police on 105 or use the online form, and cite file number 240402/3715.</p>
