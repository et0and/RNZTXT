            <p>Emergency department doctors at two Auckland hospitals are warning someone could be killed or seriously injured if security is not improved.</p>
        
            <p>The senior doctors at North Shore and Waitākere hospitals have written to their bosses this month, pleading again for a dedicated security guard.</p>
        
            <p>Their union said on a single day earlier this year a doctor was punched, a patient in a wheelchair was punched and police brought in a man in a spithood but security often had to come from elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter, the doctors, known as SMOs, said the violence and aggression experienced by front-line staff was getting worse.</p>
        
            <p>"SMOs believe death or serious injury from a violent incident in NSH [North Shore Hospital] and WTK [Waitākere Hospital] EDs is an imminent short-term risk," they said.</p>
        
            <p>They asked for a dedicated security team to try to reduce the risk, something they - and nurses - had repeatedly asked for.</p>
        
            <p>Currently each hospital was covered by a team of up to five guards. The doctors said they valued them highly.</p>
        
            <p>"However, at present this security service is not adequately resourced and often not available to respond immediately to incidences of violence and aggression at the EDs," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Association of Salaried Medical Specialists executive director Sarah Dalton said the assault on the doctor happened earlier this year but violence and aggression was now a daily occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>The doctor had stepped in as an agitated patient headed to the ambulance bay where several elderly and sick patients were waiting.</p>
        
            <p>"The doctor went to see if they could get that patient back and make sure that any vulnerable patients were kept safe by shutting a door, so the patient then turned around and punched the doctor," Dalton said.</p>
        
            <p>They were not seriously injured but were very shaken and went home early.</p>
        
            <p>One medical staff member told RNZ they could not understand why the security request was not being granted by Te Whatu Ora.</p>
        
            <p>"The lack of action, the lack of believing us is quite breathtaking," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"[They] seem to accept that working in ED is a violent place, part of the job and we should just suck it up. They have decided it is an operational risk that is acceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said a dedicated security guard should be a "no-brainer".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a Te Whatu Ora spokesperson said they were taking the concerns seriously and were looking at more funding for security.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope to be in a position very soon to introduce a new security staffing model that will address the concerns raised by senior doctors," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, the public can be assured it is safe to seek care when needed."</p>
        
            <p>Doctors and nurses have been asking for full-time security at the hospitals since last year after a growing number of assaults and aggression directed at staff and patients.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, a patient at North Shore Hospital punched someone who had been brought in by ambulance, a stranger, knocking her to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, a man drove his car at the packed department, crashing into safety bollards outside the door.</p>
        
            <p>In August, it was revealed staff at the two hospitals hit panic buttons or called security thousands of times in seven months.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter to Te Whatu Ora, the doctors said a dedicated, round-the-clock security service would be a strong deterrent to aggressive behaviour, could help deescalate behaviour and would ensure staff and patients were treated with respect.</p>
        
            <p>Only a fraction of incidents were reported, they said.</p>
