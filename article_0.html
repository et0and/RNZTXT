            <p>Watch - Police have arrested and charged a man with the murder of Auckland man Fuk-Fu Kwok, and his wife Mei Han Chong.</p>
        
            <p>Kwok, who was 66, was found dead at his Ellerslie home on Monday evening having suffered violent injuries, while Chong had been missing since then, along with their car.</p>
        
            <p>The 42-year-old Glenfield man charged with their murders is due to appear in Auckland District Court this morning, lead investigator Detective Inspector Scott Beard told media at Auckland Central Police Station.</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man was found in Hamilton on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Chong and the car were found early this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe multiple people were involved in Kwok's murder, due to the nature of his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>They could not yet say the same about Chong, until her post mortem is carried out tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard remains at the Ellerslie address.</p>
        
            <p>There will be an increased police presence across Auckland as the investigation are ongoing, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage police are not ruling out further charges and arrests.</p>
        
            <p>He would not provide any more detail about the arrested man, as the matter is before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of hours of CCTV footage were reviewed, and helped to lead to the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle registration plates on Chong's car had not been found, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>At a briefing on Thursday Detective Inspector Beard told the media that police held grave fears for Chong and suspected that she was also a victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's son said it was totally out of character for her not to contact them.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday morning police cancelled all their pre-booked media interviews on the Ellerslie case and subsequently scheduled the media briefing.</p>
