        <h2>Watch live: Civil Defence gives update on Otago flooding</h2>
        <p>
Otago's state highway network is beginning to reopen with the worst of the wild weather now passed. Follow RNZ's blog for the latest weather updates.
</p>
        
            <p>Local roads remain closed across Otago this morning, after two days of heavy rain and flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin City Council says clearing slips and reopening roads will be a key focus as the cleanup starts today.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is assuring people in North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha, that any rainfall today will not be significant.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Clutha District Council has had reports of human waste around treatment plants that have overflowed.</p>
        
            <p>It wants people to treat all floodwaters as contaminated and avoid contact with it.</p>
        
            <p>The waste was found at seven plants, including Tapanui, Balclutha and Kaka Point.</p>
        
            <p>Both the Dunedin City and the Clutha District councils are asking people not to go out unnecessarily, and states of emergency remain in place.</p>
