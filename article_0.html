            <p>Police investigating the Ponsonby homicide case have named the man who they believe shot one person dead on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Hone Kay-Selwyn, 31, has been on the run since the fatal shooting two nights ago.</p>
        
            <p>Now police have a warrant for his arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Chris Barry said police were keen for any information on Kay-Selwyn's whereabouts.</p>
        
            <p>"We are reiterating that Kay-Selwyn is considered dangerous and should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who sights him should contact police immediately on 111."</p>
        
            <p>He said the investigation had made progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that the community have several questions about what has occurred in Ponsonby on Sunday evening and we can reassure you police are working tirelessly to give the victim's family answers and to put this man before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone concealing his identity or whereabouts could find themselves facing prosecution for being an accessory after the fact, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Police "received a number of calls" to help identify the man.</p>
        
            <p>"We now need your help to locate him," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to ask anyone who has information or footage of the incident to get in touch with us."</p>
        
            <p>A dedicated police portal has been set up for this investigation called Operation Hurley.</p>
