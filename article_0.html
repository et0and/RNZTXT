            <p>Repair teams are "making good progress", after a lightning strike caused a large power outage in Hawke's Bay, Transpower NZ reports.</p>
        
            <p>The strike hit their equipment and caused a fault, the company said, and thanked their customers for their patience.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of lightning is happening in the area," a Transpower spokesperson told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The lightning in Hawke's Bay has hit the lines that feed the region."</p>
        
            <p>The outage is affecting much of the central North Island, including all Firstlight Network customers in Gisborne and Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>Line provider Unison said the outage is affecting at least 50,000 people in Napier and Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>"A strike hit equipment and caused two circuits that feed the HB region to fault; we are now looking at ways to get that circuit back up and running," Transpower communications spokesman Nathan Green told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower is still confirming where the lightning strike hit, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are trying to get the affected circuits back on line so power can be restored to the entire region."</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council said they have sent a generator to the Haumoana pump station, to keep it working during the power cut.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team is on the ground monitoring river and stream levels across Hawke's Bay and is ready to deploy additional generators and/or portable pumps to other pump stations if required," a council spokersperson said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ listeners have been texting in about the power outage.</p>
        
            <p>"What's happening with the power? Out in Clive, Napier ... perhaps even further," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"No power as far north as Gisborne," another person reported.</p>
        
            <p>Others on social media helped with brainstorming how to heat milk for babies to make it safe, during the power outages.</p>
        
            <p>Reports of a lightning strike affecting Transpowers power supply to New Zealands east coast.   No power here in Hawke's Bay. Seems like Cyclone Gabrielle all over again ‍</p>
        
            <p>The outage website for Unison is also reportedly down.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has warned of thunderstorms in much of the North Island today.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning has also been issued for South Waikato, Matamata Piako, Waipa, Taupō, Otorohanga and Rotorua until 4.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a severe thunderstorm warning in the South Island near Timaru.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued until 5pm for areas near the Four Peaks Range. MetService has reported lightning strikes throughout much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>These severe thunderstorms are moving towards the south-southeast, and are expected to lie near Beautiful Valley and the Four Peaks Range.</p>
