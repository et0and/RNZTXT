            <p>A baby has died from whooping cough two months into an epidemic in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Health officials declared an epidemic late last year, as cases spiked to levels not seen since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>What you need to know about the whooping cough epidemic</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand confirmed the infant who died over the Christmas period was the first death recorded since the epidemic was declared on 22 November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Figures from the time showed nearly 10 percent of cases - 117 people - had to be hospitalised, while two thirds of babies under 12 months ended up in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Public Health Medicine specialist Dr Matt Reid said it was one death too many.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts go out to the family who have lost their child to this highly infectious disease.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the last news any of us wanted."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "incredibly important" that people be alert to the symptoms of whooping cough and urged any pregnant people and babies to get immunised.</p>
        
            <p>"Whooping cough is highly contagious and can cause serious harm to pÄ“pi, especially those aged under six weeks old, who are too young to be vaccinated," Dr Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>"Parents or caregivers should seek medical advice for their tamariki if they have a cough that ends with a 'whoop' sound or vomiting."</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said 1232 cases had been notified since the onset of the epidemic (from 19 October 2024 to 10 January 2025) and 101 people hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, three babies died from whooping cough.</p>
        
            <p>Babies are particularly at risk of catching the disease.</p>
        
            <p>About one or two in 100 of the babies hospitalised with pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, die from infection.</p>
        
            <p>Cases of whooping cough are also being reported in Samoa, with 321 reported cases from September to 5 January.</p>
        
            <p>Almost all the cases are in Upolu.</p>
        
            <p>A whooping cough outbreak was declared last November.</p>
