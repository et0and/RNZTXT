            <p>The police are asking the public for help in identifying a woman dressed in black and carrying a suitcase in relation to an assault on a 16-year-old student last week.</p>
        
            <p>Jason was on a bus travelling from Howick towards Auckland City along Pakuranga Road to play basketball with some friends, when an unknown woman started beating him with a metal rod while yelling racist slurs.</p>
        
            <p>He suffered severe facial injuries and is now missing several teeth.</p>
        
            <p>A 75-year-old passenger intervened to stop the attack near Williams Ave in Pakuranga, Jason said.</p>
        
            <p>The woman disembarked the bus a short time later and fled the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police have now released CCTV images of a woman of interest.</p>

            <p>Acting detective senior sergeant James Mapp said the woman boarded at a bus stop on Pakuranga Road, by the intersection with Johns Lane.</p>
        
            <p>"Police want to hear from anyone who may know who this woman is or who have information about her identity and I'm asking anyone who knows who they are to get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident who hasn't already come forward."</p>
        
            <p>Mapp said police were still investigating why the offender did what she did and they could not say if it was a hate-related crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to have no tolerance for this type of crime or intimidation in our communities.</p>
        
            <p>"We work with Auckland Transport on a range of issues, and will continue to do so to prevent incidents like this or in response to situation like these."</p>
        
            <p>Support continued to be provided to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to encourage people to report all crimes to police rather than taking matters into your own hands as this can put yourself at risk."</p>
