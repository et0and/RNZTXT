        <h2>'Inspiring and empowering' to be a part of meth study</h2>
        <p>
A former addict participating in research into long-term impacts of the drug says it has made her more positive and helped her gain a new outlook on life.

            <p>For more than 15 years Jasmine Taare was a meth addict.</p>
        
            <p>The Gisborne musician and early-childhood educator kept it a secret, turning to the drug to cope with life's difficulties.</p>
        
            <p>Now, she's stopped using it and is part of a groundbreaking Tairāwhiti study into how people's brains and hearts recover from damage caused by its long-term use.</p>
        
            <p>Taare told Checkpoint she was an undercover user.</p>
        
            <p>Outwardly successful, she has won country entertainer of the year and was the first champion of Māori TV's talent show, Homai te Pakipaki.</p>
        
            <p>No one knew the 37-year-old had a methamphetamine habit that sometimes cost several hundred dollars a day.</p>
        
            <p>"I became a straight-up bullshitter to my family and especially my friends," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They knew me, but nobody could understand how they didn't pick that up. I was just good at covering it."</p>
        
            <p>The harm meth does to communities is well known - an academic study last year ranked it only behind alcohol in the damage it causes.</p>
        
            <p>She needed the drug to function and for motivation.</p>
        
            <p>"If I didn't have it then I couldn't get out of bed or work, and stuff like that.</p>
        
            <p>"I was undercover because, I guess, in society it's not okay to talk about things.</p>
        
            <p>"That's just what it was for me. I didn't have anyone where I could just be like, 'Hey I'm going through things,' because it was frowned upon."</p>

            <p>Taare had a beautiful upbringing from her loving whānau, she just lacked the tools to cope with trauma, such as losing family members to suicide, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Striving to keep her drug use secret, she kept up a facade.</p>
        
            <p>"It became really tiring because I didn't want to be portrayed in any type of way.</p>
        
            <p>"When you think about meth users and you ask people here they immediately think you're out the gate - you can't trust them.</p>
        
            <p>"I was actually high functioning and I was all good."</p>
        
            <p>She kept working and making music.</p>
        
            <p>Feelings of shame helped lead Taare's turnaround, which began more than a year ago when she entered rehab after seeking help from community advocate, the late Tuta Ngarimu.</p>

            <p>Soon after, she joined Mātai Medical Research Institute's study into the effects of meth on users' brains and hearts.</p>
        
            <p>The Gisborne institute uses high-tech scanning technology to track about 20 people who have recently stopped using the drug.</p>
        
            <p>Seeing the scans proved an eye opener for Taare.</p>
        
            <p>They highlighted the damage meth had done, but also more recent signs of improvement.</p>
        
            <p>"It's given me better knowledge about my body and how it's been affected," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I take my health quite seriously now, more than I ever had, since being a part of this study."</p>
        
            <p>PhD candidate Ben Bristow will analyse data from the study. A Gisborne local, Mātai lured him home.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always heard that Gisborne is the P capital of New Zealand and that it's easier to find P than weed around here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been exposed to that stuff. When I joined this study my eyes were opened to this world."</p>
        
            <p>Initial results are expected next year.</p>
        
            <p>In keeping with Mātai's kaupapa they will be communicated to the local community as well as academic journals.</p>

Mātai research fellow Maryam Tayebi says it's hoped a larger study can happen in the future.

            <p>Mātai research fellow Maryam Tayebi said based on the limited number of similar studies it was unclear what the results would be.</p>
        
            <p>"We are interested in looking at what happens to their brain and heart during their abstinence period.</p>
        
            <p>"Is there going to be a recovery? If there is, which part of the brain and heart will be recovered and which part will not?" Tayebi said.</p>
        
            <p>Damage among users was likely.</p>
        
            <p>"It is serious, especially in the long term when it's chronic, when it happens for many years.</p>
        
            <p>"That's one of the reasons that I did this study, to see if serious damage exists and if there is a chance that some part of it can be reversed."</p>
        
            <p>She hoped the study could expand in the future.</p>
        
            <p>Taare is doing her best to publicise the research, and hopes sharing her experiences will affect others positively.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually really inspiring and empowering to be a part of this research.</p>
        
            <p>"It's given me so much hope for my life as well knowing that there are ways to help when you've had addiction for the majority of your life.</p>
        
            <p>"It's changed my mind to be positive in so many ways and I have a new outlook on life."</p>
        
            <p>Now she's off meth Taare's still writing songs and making music, and she's free of the burden of secrecy.</p>
