            <p>The New Zealand Defence Force, in conjunction with Australian authorities, are continuing to monitor a People's Liberation Army - Navy (PLA-N) Task Group in the Tasman Sea about 350 nautical miles northeast of Australia's Bass Strait on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The Task Group consists of the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class cruiser Zunyi, and the Fuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu.</p>
        
            <p>All three of the Chinese naval vessels have been off the coast of Australia for more than a week, the Defence Force said on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Defence Minister Judith Collins said China had "not deigned to advise us what they're doing in the middle of the Tasman sea" but said it was "quite a significant event".</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Morning Report on Friday, Collins called it an "unusual move".</p>
        
            <p>A furore broke out on Friday after an Emirates flight from Sydney to Christchurch was warned by the Chinese military to avoid an area of airspace, before Chinese vessels were believed to have conducted live-fire exercises.</p>

            <p>The ABC understood the Chinese naval vessels were seen deploying a floating target, changing formation, and then resetting formation consistent with a live-fire event. However, Collins and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese both said there was no confirmation whether that had occurred.</p>
        
            <p>An Emirates spokesperson told RNZ: "When a change in air space activity was detected, the flight deck crew on EK 412 (21 February) made a slight routing deviation as per standard industry protocol and in conjunction with ATC [Air Traffic Control], to maintain optimal safety margins.</p>
        
            <p>"Emirates uses advanced flight planning systems that optimise each route, carefully considering several factors to ensure a safe and smooth journey. Our crew also have rigourous protocols to maintain vigilance during operations."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand and Jetstar had also modified flight paths as needed to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, the Defence Force confirmed a vessel from the Task Group had broadcast a safety message indicating their intent to conduct a live-firing activity in the vicinity of the Task Group on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the lack of advanced notification of the firing, by standard practice of providing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), this activity caused several commercial aircraft to divert course."</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force said the Task Group had transmitted a second radio message of its intention to conduct live-firing on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Personnel on the New Zealand Navy frigate HMNZS Te Kaha also reported observing the Renhai class cruiser firing its main gun.</p>

            <p>While a security analyst and an academic have expressed concerns, both seemed to boil down to a lack of transparency from China.</p>
        
            <p>"I've not heard of China conducting live-fire exercises this far south, in fact it's very unusual for their surface task groups to come this far at all, so in combination I think it's fair to say it's unprecedented," Euan Graham from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said.</p>
        
            <p>Collins confirmed there was no ongoing danger to New Zealand on Friday.</p>

            <p>In a statement on Sunday, China's Ministry of National Defence spokesperson Wu Qian accused Australia of "deliberately hyping up" the live-fire exercises.</p>
        
            <p>Qian said China had given notice in advance, complied with international law, and did not affect aviation safety.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia, fully knowing this, made unreasonable accusations against China and deliberately hyped it up.</p>
        
            <p>"We are deeply surprised and strongly dissatisfied."</p>
        
            <p>Guo Jiakun, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, shared a similar statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The [People's Liberation Army] Southern Theatre Command organised the Chinese fleet to conduct a far seas exercise," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The drill was carried out in a safe, standard and professional manner in accordance with the relevant international law and international practice."</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese both made it clear that China had complied with international law on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>However, Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles told ABC that China was yet to provide a "satisfactory answer".</p>
        
            <p>"When Australia, for example, does a live-firing event such as this - which countries are entitled do on the high seas and that's where this task group is, they're in international waters - we would typically give 12 to 24 hours' notice, which enables aircraft that are going to potentially be in the vicinity to make plans to fly around."</p>

            <p>Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong also sought an explanation from China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, Wong said she "raised Australia's expectations around safe and professional military conduct, consular cases, human rights and other issues of concern".</p>
