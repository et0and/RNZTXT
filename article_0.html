            <p>The Hurricanes Poua have defied orders not to take a political stance with their haka, and again called out the government.</p>
        
            <p>The side caused a massive controversy this week, after their pre match haka against Manawa, making reference to a "redneck government."</p>
        
            <p>Hurricanes CEO Avan Lee earlier told RNZ the franchise would apologise for the haka, and that it would not happen again.</p>
        
            <p>However, prior to kick off in this afternoon's clash with Matatu in Wellington, Poua performed another alternative haka with references to the government and to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>Poua haka leader Leilani Perese doubled down on last week's performance, hitting back at opponents and saying the government should "whakangarongaro" or disappear.</p>
        
            <p>Perese smiled before rallying the team, calling out those who said women should not haka and presented the team as "āhuru te ārangi" - trouble-makers or disruptors.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Chiefs Manawa are two from two to start their Super Rugby Aupiki campaign after holding off the Blues women 17-10 this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The big names struck early for the visitors, Black Ferns stars Grace Steinmetz and Ruby Tui scoring to give Manawa a 12-0 lead at Bell Park.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues pulled them back early in the second with two tries of their own through Tafito Lafaele and Mel Puckett to reduce the margin to two.</p>
        
            <p>However, just five minutes in Grace Kukutai pounced on a Blues mistake, to stretch it back to 17-10, with the Blues unable to convert their late chances.</p>
        
            <p>The Hurricanes Poua and Matatu have just kicked off in Wellington.</p>

            <p>Manawa 17 (Tui, Steinmetz, Kukutai tries, Holmes 1 con)</p>
        
            <p>Blues 10 (Lafaele, Puckett tries)</p>
