            <p>New Zealand is still hunting for Olympic medals after Sam Gaze couldn't keep up with the pace in the men's short-course cross country mountain biking race.</p>
        
            <p>Gaze - who is the defending world champion - placed sixth in the race. Conditions on the course were so hot, race marshalls had to hold umbrellas over the competitors' heads before the start.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the equestrian eventing team finished outside medal contention, placing eighth overall as the competition concluded with show jumping at the Chateau de Versailles.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time, Tim Price and Clarke Johnstone qualified eighth and 16th for the individual jumping event; the final for that starts around 1am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Ferns take on Fiji in their group match at the Stade de France at 2.30am. They are already in the quarter final, which starts at 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Read back on all the night's action as it happened:</p>
