            <p>A Cabinet paper released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in December highlights the challenges the coalition government faces in sealing a free trade agreement with India over the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party's coalition deal with New Zealand First singled out India in a reference to pursuing free trade agreements with other nations.</p>
        
            <p>National Party leader Christopher Luxon also pledged to clinch a free trade deal with India on the campaign trail in the run-up to the election, promising to visit the South Asian nation within a year of taking office.</p>
        
            <p>And yet several obstacles need to be overcome in order to make this pledge a reality.</p>
        
            <p>The Cabinet paper released by MFAT before Christmas said New Zealand needed to foster regular dialogue with India, particularly at senior political levels.</p>
        
            <p>The paper also said the government should cooperate with India in areas of mutual interest and collaborate with other trade partners when facing issues of disagreement with India.</p>
        
            <p>The Cabinet paper said a free trade agreement with India was the "ultimate goal".</p>
        
            <p>It noted that India, now the world's fifth-largest economy, could be second only to China in terms of economic scale by 2050.</p>
        
            <p>"For New Zealand itself, India has been the largest source of skilled migrants and second-largest source of international students in recent years," the paper said. "The country's Indian-origin diaspora of around 300,000 people now makes up at least 5 percent of our population, contributing significantly to social, political and economic life here."</p>
        
            <p>MFAT believes that India views New Zealand as a key strategic partner in the Pacific as the South Asian nation seeks to expand its sphere of influence.</p>
        
            <p>"It is in our interest to support India to engage as a constructive partner in the region and to work through existing regional architecture," the paper said.</p>
        
            <p>"As India wants a broad-based relationship with New Zealand incorporating political, defence and security, people-to-people as well as economic links, it is important to continue to show progress in these areas as we look to re-energise discussions on the trade relationship."</p>
        
            <p>The ministry acknowledged recent cooperation between the two countries in priority sectors such as horticulture, agriculture and education.</p>
        
            <p>While it was important to continue a business-focused track of cooperation, this approach alone would not transform New Zealand into a more compelling trade partner for India, the paper said.</p>
        
            <p>India is currently New Zealand's 19th-largest export market, accounting for 1 percent of all exports shipped abroad.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand provides just 0.1 percent of India's import market and is ranked 75th on the list of the South Asian nation's trade partners.</p>
        
            <p>"There is scope for us to significantly lift this performance," the Cabinet paper said. "There are few markets over the coming decades which offer a greater growth at scale opportunity for New Zealand business than India, as we build our economy, grow our trade and diversify our export markets."</p>
        
            <p>The Cabinet paper called on the government to elevate and maintain regular high-level political discussions across a range of portfolios, including trade, foreign affairs, defence, education, agriculture, food safety and customs.</p>
        
            <p>The India-New Zealand Memorandum of Arrangement for Defence Corporation currently under negotiation would also be important for bilateral ties, the paper said.</p>
        
            <p>The paper said New Zealand should increase its presence both in terms of scale and seniority at the annual Raisina Dialogue (India's equivalent of Singapore's Shangri-La Dialogue) as well as prioritise engagement with India on the sidelines of regional and multilateral forums.</p>
        
            <p>The paper confirmed the ministry was exploring opportunities for Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters to meet his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Such visits and interactions between New Zealand ministers and their Indian counterparts would form policy settings and pave the way for the prime minister's visit with a trade delegation in the second half of 2024, after India's general elections, the paper said.</p>
