        <h2>Rare 'UFO cloud' out of this world</h2>
        <p>
Beam me up, Scotty: It might look like a spaceship, but there's a scientific explanation.

            <p>The truth is out there - a "UFO cloud" seen in Auckland's north was not the work of aliens, but a rare meteorological phenomenon.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Wellsford, Te Hana, Pakiri and the Hibiscus Coast reported seeing the circular cloud formation high in the sky on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Those who saw it said it looked like a hole in the cloud cover, with some saying a small rainbow was visible inside.</p>
        
            <p>Sheila Russell was at Forestry Beach in Te Arai on Thursday morning taking photos when the cloud appeared.</p>
        
            <p>She said the sky was "already pretty stunning" and the cloud's formation was the cherry on top.</p>
        
            <p>"It literally just appeared in front of me on the empty beach. My initial thought [was] 'wow a UFO cloud'."</p>
        
            <p>Adele Rhead was working at Wellsford Golf Club when a member told her to come outside and take photos.</p>
        
            <p>The member, an older man, told her the cloud was "super rare" and he had only seen two in his lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>It was "super cool" to see, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Lyubov Bykova saw the cloud from Pakiri.</p>
        
            <p>She said she had never seen a formation like that before and would be interested in the scientific explanation.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] looks unnatural, definitely."</p>

            <p>Meteorologist Ben Noll from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said while the cloud could be mistaken for a UFO, it was a completely natural phenomenon.</p>
        
            <p>It was known as both a "fall streak hole" and a "punch hole cloud", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Its formation was "pretty rare" and he had only seen one or two in his lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>Some cumulus clouds contained what was known as supercooled water, "which is basically water that is below freezing, but it actually hasn't frozen yet into ice crystals", Noll said.</p>
        
            <p>"Typically what happens is there's some sort of atmospheric disturbance within that supercooled water - it could be an aeroplane or something similar - and that atmospheric disturbance causes that supercooled water to rapidly turn into ice crystals."</p>
        
            <p>Those ice crystals were heavier than the surrounding cloud, so they fell out, leaving a hole behind, Noll said.</p>
        
            <p>The process happened high up in the atmosphere and was fairly quick, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the disturbance comes through, it's probably minutes, maybe tens of minutes."</p>
        
            <p>Noll said the rainbow effect inside the hole was likely another process called cloud iridescence - sunlight interacting with the ice crystals inside the cumulus.</p>
        
            <p>It was a "confluence of unique meteorological phenomena", he said.</p>
