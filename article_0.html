            <p>A blog site, known for breaking news about political corruption, governance and human rights issues in Fiji, has released explosive allegations of extramarital affairs between two Cabinet ministers - one of them dismissed for an unrelated issue on Friday - while on official business in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The issue has divided Fijian public opinion online - with some calling for accountability and an explanation from their elected officials, while others say it is a targeted campaign to defame the character of the ministers involved.</p>
        
            <p>FijiLeaks - a website with a reputation to feature high-profile leaks and controversial stories involving Fiji's political and business elites - told RNZ Pacific it received explicit details of an intimate night in Melbourne between Fiji's women's minister Lynda Tabuya and education minister Aseri Radrodro, when they were part of a parliamentary delegation to Victoria.</p>
        
            <p>According to FijiLeaks, the rendezvous took place during a three-day ministerial trip in Melbourne] organised by the Victorian Parliament for "whipping up stronger" Fiji-Australia ties, which New Zealand Whips also attended.</p>

            <p>Screenshots of communications and images allegedly shared between the two government MPs are now circulating on the internet - on social media platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter).</p>
        
            <p>The leaked images show one minister allegedly admitting to "getting drunk and high" on marijuana and sharing lewd images.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific has made attempts to verify the veracity of the images and messages, including contacting the blog's editor Victor Lal, a veteran Fijian journalist who now resides in London and is based at Oxford University.</p>
        
            <p>While Lal has refused to share the original copies of the messages and images to protect his sources, he has provided screenshots. He said he stood by his sources - who are in Fiji - and said they were "impeccable".</p>
        
            <p>Lal said "Lynda [Tabuya] and Aseri [Radrodro] were both equally at fault" for their actions and is calling for both the ministers to step down from their ministerial roles for "abusing their position".</p>
        
            <p>"They should be equally and harshly dealt with by [Prime Minister Sitiveni] Rabukaâ€¦because it takes two to tango," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He is also calling on the authorities to investigate how the ministers were able to have access to marijuana while on official duties.</p>

            <p>RNZ Pacific contacted both the ministers via phone, text messages, and email to respond to the allegations as well as if they would be taking any actions.</p>
        
            <p>Tabuya declined to respond to specific questions, only replying: "It is fake news."</p>
        
            <p>Radrodro, who was dismissed by Rabuka from Cabinet on Friday for "insubordination and disobedience", did not respond.</p>
        
            <p>According to local media reports, Radrodro's dismissal is unrelated to these allegations.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, The Fiji Times reported in an article titled 'Probe into porn image' the Fiji Police Force has confirmed receiving a report from Tabuya.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Police Commissioner Juki Fong Chew told the newspaper the Cyber Crime Unit is investigating the circulation of a "fake image" of the minister.</p>
        
            <p>"We confirm receiving her report," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team also works with our bilateral police partners (Australian federal police/NZ police) who can assist the police for verification purposes."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific's attempts to get comment from Fiji police have been unsuccessful.</p>

            <p>The two ministers are key members of the Rabuka-led coalition government, which came to power in December 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year, initial allegations of an affair between two government ministers began circulating online.</p>
        
            <p>But they were shut down by the Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who at the time said, he had spoken with the ministers involved and was "satisfied" with the explanations received.</p>
        
            <p>The following month, Tabuya was stood down as the leader of government in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Rabuka said the decision to remove her was due to a "discomfort" in the relationship between the Speaker of Parliament and Tabuya.</p>
        
            <p>Lal said there was a "culture of entitlement in Fiji politics" and that Rabuka must take "accountability" by addressing the fresh evidence of the affair.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Pacific contacted Rabuka for comment. He has not responded.</p>
        
            <p>However, the prime minister told state broadcaster FBC he had addressed the matter last year and "there have been no developments" since.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not comment on comments on social media," he said.</p>
