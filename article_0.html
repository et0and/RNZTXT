        <h2>Backpackers destroyed in fire had 'a number' of compliance issues</h2>
        <p>
The council had been working with the owner of the Parnell lodge that went up in flames to sort the problems, Auckland's deputy mayor says.

            <p>The council had been working with the owner of the Parnell lodge that went up in flames over building issues, Auckland Deputy Mayor Desley Simpson says.</p>
        
            <p>City Garden Lodge had "a number of issues that we were working through last year", Simpson said.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson later confirmed the final council inspection was due on take place on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Ten people were evacuated from the building around 4.30pm on Sunday, as large flames were seen and thick black smoke billowed across the suburb.</p>
        
            <p>At its peak, 16 fire appliances were called to bring the blaze under control, with firefighters remaining on standby overnight.</p>

            <p>There were a number of non-compliances to do with external escape routes at the lodge in July, Simpson said.</p>
        
            <p>There was a short-term repair in place and it was due to be checked next week to see if there was a permanent solution.</p>
        
            <p>The building got a warrant of fitness in November last year.</p>
        
            <p>Simpson was unable to confirm if the council was satisfied the building met fire safety requirements, and said she would have to check with her team later this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The lodge was not being used as emergency accommodation, the Ministry of Social Development has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigators were expected to return to the scene of the central Auckland blaze on Monday morning.</p>

            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene on Sunday said smoke could be smelt from a block away, with thick plumes of smoke spilling out onto the street.</p>
        
            <p>Local MP David Seymour was also at the scene, and said crews had done an extraordinary job controlling the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, they couldn't save a building that is a 120-year-old wooden building, already alight, but they prevented the fire spreading, and they allowed people to escape," he said.</p>

            <p>Residents near the scene said it was only a matter of time before something happened at the backpackers.</p>
        
            <p>John Eichelbaum said residents at the lodge were often unruly.</p>
        
            <p>"The police are down here all the time."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said there had been "a lot of unrest and disturbance" from three hostels in the area, but that was only caused by a relatively small number of residents and "good people" also lived there.</p>
        
            <p>According to the hostel's website, the building was originally the embassy of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III, who ruled Tonga from 1918 to 1965.</p>
        
            <p>Its visitors ranged from "young people and students on a shoestring budget to open-minded mature travellers", the website said.</p>
