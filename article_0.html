            <p>An interisland ferry passenger has been injured and cars have been damaged during a rough Cook Strait crossing this morning.</p>
        
            <p>A KiwiRail spokesperson said the Kaitaki left Wellington at 8.45am and experienced significant rolling about 10.30am when it passed near the Karori Lighthouse.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said some passenger vehicles shifted and suffered minor damage. One passenger suffered a minor injury and was given medical assistance by the crew.</p>

            <p>Interislander is supporting affected customers and a full assessment is being carried out.</p>
        
            <p>Two other Interislander ferry crossings - the 6.15am from Picton and the 11am return service - were cancelled today, as strong winds pummelled central New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Interislander has provided passengers with tips to avoid seasickness for other sailings.</p>
        
            <p>It said anyone who was worried about seasickness should sit at the back of the ship and should not sail on an empty stomach.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said the stormy weather had forced the ferry operator to cancel its two Picton-bound services, and three Wellington-bound services for Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It had put on four additional sailings for this weekend, and rescheduled some services, to accommodate those who could not travel today.</p>
        
            <p>A lingering low-pressure system is bringing rain or showers to many parts of New Zealand, with thunderstorms, large swells and strong winds affecting the centre of the country.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a heavy rain warning remains in place for Wairoa District until noon Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>There are also heavy rain watches for Gisborne/Tai Rāwhiti about and south of SH2 to 2pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The warnings come after two months worth of rain fell over the Gisborne/Tai Rāwhiti and Wairoa districts since Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said people could expect 100-130mm of rain in Wairoa district, on top of what had already fallen - especially about the ranges - with peak rates of 10mm/h.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of the eastern side of the North Island saw more than 100mm of rain in the tops of the ranges in the last 24 hours, and about 70mm fell in Gisborne city, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The rainfall added to an already wet month, at a time when the average at this time of year should be about 55mm.</p>
        
            <p>There was more wet weather forecast for the start of next week, he added.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne police told drivers to avoid the Wharerata Road area due to high winds. The road was impassable due to fallen trees in many places.</p>
        
            <p>Police urged drivers to avoid the area if possible and only travel in there if essential.</p>
        
            <p>Strong wind watches remain in force for the following areas:</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned that southerly and south-west winds may approach severe gales in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media, MetService said large, powerful, four-metre southerly swells were impacting the south and east coasts of the North Island.</p>

            <p>There was a heavy swell warning in place for Wairarapa (Turakirae Head to Mataikona) until 9pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Large swells - rising to 3 to 4 metres - would be accompanied by large wind waves that would peak around high tide before easing overnight, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>These would gradually ease overnight into Saturday morning. The highest risk period would be around high tide on Friday afternoon, the forecaster added.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, several parts of West Auckland are without power this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Lines company Vector's online outage map shows a number of streets are without electricity.</p>
        
            <p>A business on Morus Road said power has been out for properties in the area since about 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached Vector for more information.</p>
