            <p>Close to 8000 people have been told to be on standby for evacuation from a landslide-prone area of Papua New Guinea.</p>
        
            <p>Enga provincial disaster committee chairperson and provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka told RNZ Pacific some were already being evacuated, but that number was not clear.</p>
        
            <p>As many people as possible - including those working in the recovery - were hoped to be evacuated by tomorrow, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He had visited the disaster site twice and it was "very" dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2000 people are thought to have been buried from Friday's landslide - and rescue attempts have been hindered by the unstable terrain and lack of heavy machinery.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, humanitarian aid is starting to trickle in for survivors.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has pledged practical and financial assistance worth $1.5 million.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters says the precise nature of the assistance will be decided after discussions with the authorities in PNG.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
