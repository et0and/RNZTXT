        <h2>Luxon's 'wealthy and sorted' in running for Quote of the Year</h2>
        <p>
The PM's one-liner received the most nominations for the award and will go up against one-liners from rugby stars and a kidnapped cockatoo. Here's how to vote for your pick.

            <p>One-liners from rugby stars, politicians and a kidnapped cockatoo all feature in the shortlist for Massey University's Quote of the Year.</p>
        
            <p>Speech-writing specialist Dr Heather Kavan and a panel narrowed down more than 70 nominations to 10.</p>
        
            <p>Previous winners in the annual competition include a jibe from ACT leader David Seymour about a potential lamington attack from protesters ("I would have thought that Grant Robertson would be a much bigger threat to lamingtons than lamingtons would be a threat to Grant Robertson") and three Cyclone Gabrielle heroes' response to being asked if they were in the Navy: "Nah, we're just three Māori boys."</p>
        
            <p>This year, the highest number of nominations was for Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's comments on the sale of his Wellington apartment, where he referred to himself as "wealthy" and "sorted".</p>

            <p>Voting closes at midnight on Wednesday and can be done at Massey University's website here.</p>
        
            <p>The nominees are:</p>
        
            <p>Kavan said they would not normally shortlist two quotes from one event, but the Black Ferns meeting the king inspired them to break protocol.</p>

            <p>And while Luxon's quote was the most nominated, Kavan said it was often the quiet contenders that surged into the lead - and this year, that could be be the quote from Pepper the cockatoo.</p>
        
            <p>At the Porirua station, officers were almost certain Pepper was the missing bird, but it was confirmed when her Staglands carers arrived and she chirped her signature phrase, "Hello darling!"</p>
        
            <p>This year also saw the creation of the Freddie Award, for quotes that made their splash in a year after they were said.</p>
        
            <p>The award was sparked by a remark Resource Minister Shane Jones made in Parliament in December 2023: "If there is a mining opportunity and it's impeded by a blind frog, goodbye Freddie."</p>
        
            <p>The one-liner inspired this year's 'Save Freddie' rallying cry at pro-environment protests, appeared often in the discourse around the government's new Fast-track Approvals Bill, and featured in the title of a scholarly article by Professor Jonathan Boston from Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
