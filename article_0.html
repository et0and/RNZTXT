        <p>
"First impressions are they have been hit very hard - 400 properties have been impacted... They've been hit very hard, without a doubt," he told RNZ.

            <p>Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell arrived in Wairoa earlier this evening, and has met with council and emergency staff.</p>
        
            <p>"First impressions are they have been hit very hard - 400 properties have been impacted and, of course, 100 people out of their houses, which, of course, we can see there's people getting shelter here in the hall… They've been hit very hard, without a doubt," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obvious that they're going to need support… I've obviously met with the team, I've met with the mayor and made and said that look, I'm here and from a central government point of view, we just want to make sure that we support them and that we're here to get through the response phase."</p>
        
            <p>More than 400 properties in the town appear to have been affected by flooding, Civil Defence said earlier, with more than 100 significantly impacted.</p>
        
            <p>"To get through the next high tide, at around 9pm, and ensuring people are safe and those who are not in their homes are cared for is our focus," Civil Defence controller Juanita Savage said.</p>
        
            <p>The town centre has so far been spared. Around 90 percent of the town's power had been restored as of 6.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said he get a briefing early on Thursday morning before heading out with Wairoa Mayor Craig Little to survey the damage.</p>
        
            <p>States of emergency remain in place in Heretaunga and Wairoa.</p>
