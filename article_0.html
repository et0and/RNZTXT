            <p>A large hole has been ripped in the hull of the Cook Strait ferry Kaiarahi.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington harbourmaster Grant Nalder said the hole above the waterline in the Interislander ferry "looks quite dramatic".</p>
        
            <p>"You can actually see through to the other side of the ship."</p>
        
            <p>
The hole was about one metre across, the harbourmaster said.

            <p>The ferry was damaged as it came into the berth in Wellington at 10pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said the gash in the Kaiarahi was about one metre across.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously not good for the ship but it is high up on the hull, it's away from the waterline and it happened as it came into the berth.</p>
        
            <p>"The ship itself is quite safe in the harbour - there's no risk there - but they've got a bit of work to do before it can resume service."</p>

            <p>Last week, a Bluebridge ferry had to turn back after it hit a wharf as it was leaving Wellington, causing a dent and a small hole in the hull.</p>

            <p>The Connemara hit the southern end of Glasgow wharf in Wellington on 8 November, and was sailing towards the entrance to the channel when the operator StraitNZ decided it should turn back.</p>
        
            <p>Nalder said at the time risk had been low given the size of the hole, its height above the water, and that it was going into a relatively small compartment.</p>
