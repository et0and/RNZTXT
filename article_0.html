            <p>An investigation into five Wellington City councillors has found they breached their code of conduct policy.</p>
        
            <p>The probe was launched in relation to the councillors' actions following a publicly excluded briefing regarding the future of Courtenay Place's Reading Cinemas earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>It found councillors Diane Calvert, Nicola Young, Iona Pannett, Ray Chung and Tony Randle were in breach of the code - with some making more than one breach.</p>
        
            <p>The review's findings were councillors Calvert, Young, Chung and Pannett breached the code by failing to observe confidentiality when they responded to media inquiries.</p>
        
            <p>Randle and Young breached the code by failing to show respect to other councillors when they made comments casting aspersions on the actions and motivations of fellow councillors who could not speak out in reply.</p>
        
            <p>Chung, Calvert and Young breached the code by criticising council staff in public statements.</p>
        
            <p>The report made a number of recommendations that included refresher training be provided to all councillors on sections 6 and 7 of the Local Government Information and Meetings Act.</p>
        
            <p>That would include practical guidance on where it is appropriate to withhold information from the public, in what circumstances it might be in the public interest to do so and how to maintain confidentiality in circumstances where information is being withheld.</p>
        
            <p>It also recommended a workshop where all councillors convened under the stewardship of an independent trained facilitator, in which the complaint can be discussed and all grievances about it aired.</p>
        
            <p>It was recommended this be held with the public excluded.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau thanked Linda Clark for conducting the review and said she would accept the recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau has asked Chief Executive Barbara Mckerrow to provide advice on progressing the recommendations as well as bringing forward an update to their Code of Conduct policy in our work programme.</p>
        
            <p>"As mayor, I want to have a collaborative working environment where we robustly debate ideas, policy detail, and the decisions we make. That is critical for a healthy democracy and what our city deserves."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said the decision to appoint a reviewer to investigate the Code of Conduct complaint reflected the seriousness of the issues raised.</p>
        
            <p>"I want us all to be delivering for the city in a way that always has good conduct at the heart of how we work, and I really do hope we can come together to remedy it."</p>
        
            <p>She said that now the investigation had concluded she would review the council committee chairperson positions as she committed to a year into the role and to reflect the resignation of former Councillor Tamatha Paul.</p>
        
            <p>"I did not want to review the chair positions whilst the investigation was underway, as I felt that was unfair for those being investigated and the inquiry needed to run its course."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau acknowledged that the release of the reports comes at a time when she recently admitted to having a problem with alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst a very different issue, it is clear is we must all lift our game and work towards being better stewards of the city and this is something I am deeply committed to.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that our residents don't want to see us distracted by internal spats or personal issues. I hope reviewing the Code of Conduct will help draw a line in the sand so we can focus on the issues that matter."</p>
