            <p>Hayden Wilde has won New Zealand's second medal of the Paris Olympics, crossing the finish line second to claim silver in the men's triathlon event.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.</p>
        
            <p>While the NZ athletes were unable to claim a medal in the women's competition, Wilde put in a strong performance to take silver in the men's.</p>
        
            <p>Wilde was a minute behind the leaders after the first swimming leg, but clawed back that time on the bicycle and took the lead early in the final running section, before being overtaken by Great Britain's Alex Yee in the final sprint.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the Black Ferns Sevens fought back to beat Canada 19-12 to defend their Olympic gold and hand New Zealand a first medal of the Paris Games.</p>
