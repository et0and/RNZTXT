            <p>Lulu Sun's dream run at Wimbledon was ended in the quarter-finals by Croat Donna Vekic under the Court One roof.</p>
        
            <p>Sun beat Britain's Emma Raducanu in the fourth round and was hoping to become the first qualifier to reach the women's semi-finals since 1999 when American Alexandra Stevenson caused a sensation.</p>
        
            <p>However, the world number 123 was beaten 5-7 6-4 6-1 by Vekic who will face Jasmine Paolini or Emma Navarro in the last four.</p>
        
            <p>World number 37 Vekic, at the age of 28, is into her first Grand Slam semi-final.</p>
        
            <p>She set up four break points across the first set but was unable to beat Sun's dogged defence, and then dropped serve at 5-5 as the opener tilted in her opponent's favour.</p>
        
            <p>Vekic broke to go up 5-3 in the second set but briefly lost her confidence, double-faulting three times to hand Sun a break back.</p>
        
            <p>Buoyed by the crowd, Vekic quickly recovered and levelled the match with a sublime drop shot.</p>
        
            <p>She rode her momentum from there, dominating the decider.</p>
        
            <p>Sun, 23, is the first New Zealand woman to reach the quarter-finals at the prestigious British tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Sun, who was born in Te Anau and earlier this year switched allegiance from Switzerland to New Zealand, outplayed Raducanu 6-2 5-7 6-2 in the fourth round on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>She beat China's Zhu Lin on Saturday and won against world number eight Qinwen Zheng in the first round of the women's singles.</p>
        
            <p>The last time a New Zealander reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon was in 1983, where Chris Lewis went on to lose the final.</p>
        
            <p>Sun is now guaranteed at least $782,000 in prize money for the tournament.</p>
