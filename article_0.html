        <h2>Threat of power cuts will become more common - industry group</h2>
        <p>
Big industry has been scaling back production to help ease the load on the electricity network as Transpower tries to avoid power cuts this morning.

            <p>A group representing big industry is warning that appeals to conserve electricity will become more common.</p>
        
            <p>The country is waking to a bitterly cold morning with temperatures dropping as low as -6C in some areas overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Electricity grid operator Transpower on Thursday warned the low temperatures could see power cuts occur if electricity demands spiked too high, particularly between the hours of 7am and 9am.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses were asked to help and the Major Electricity Users' Group said industry starting cutting back production on Thursday, which had provided some relief.</p>
        
            <p>The group's chair John Harbord said they had moved quickly to help shore up supply.</p>
        
            <p>"So already we're no longer looking at a shortage of 22 megawatts, we're looking at a surplus of supply of 33 megawatts."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to that, there were 243 megawatts of electricity "sitting in reserve", he said, though he warned that did not mean people could be complacent.</p>
        
            <p>Harbord said appeals for people to conserve power were going to become more common.</p>
        
            <p>"As we become even more reliant on intermittent renewable electricity generation like wind and solar... these types of scenarios become more likely."</p>
        
            <p>Harbord said a balance needed to be struck between renewable energy sources and thermal generation.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third time this month Transpower has issued a notice about low power supply but the first time it has put out a warning for the public to cut back on power usage.</p>
