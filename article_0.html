            <p>The Hīkoi mō te Tiriti convoy will cross Auckland's Harbour Bridge this morning and commuters are being encouraged to plan ahead to avoid congestion.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA) and police have confirmed the two outer northbound lanes on the bridge will be closed this morning until all hīkoi participants are safely across.</p>

            <p>The core hīkoi contingent which has travelled more than 400 kilometres from Te Rerenga Wairua to Auckland will cross the bridge first at 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Remaining groups of less than 200 people will follow at staggered times for safety, while kaumātua will be transported across in busses.</p>
        
            <p>Major Operations director Superintendent Kelly Ryan said the event remains peaceful and that people's safety was ensured.</p>
        
            <p>"Our expectation is clear that the group moves safely and efficiently across the Harbour Bridge, in a controlled fashion before marching through parts of the CBD towards Ōkahu Bay."</p>

            <p>Real time updates will be posted on the NZTA website and the lanes will be re-opened to traffic as soon as it's safe to do so.</p>

            <p>No significant issues have been reported, other than complaints of delays since the convoy began its journey</p>
        
            <p>NZTA have advised that traffic movement and roads will return to normal when it is safe to do so .</p>
        
            <p>A series of rallies will take place across Auckland after the hīkoi has crossed the bridge, with Ōkahu Bay being the first stop.</p>
        
            <p>The convoy will move on to Takaparawhau (Bastion Point) where another rally will be held before it makes its way to south Auckland,</p>
