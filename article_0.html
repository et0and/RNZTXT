The Te Atatū Library became the scene of a violent protest last month, but librarians say that they are facing threats almost daily in many places.

            <p>A former Auckland librarian says threats and intimidation have become a daily part of library life, as advocates call on councils and the government to do more to keep workers safe.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people have appeared in court over a violent protest against a rainbow community event at Te Atatū Library in Auckland last month.</p>
        
            <p>But that was far from the only incident.</p>
        
            <p>Sixteen people were trespassed from Ashburton's new library in its first eight months and Whanganui Council reported incidents of threatening behaviour this month.</p>
        
            <p>Advocates said the fact libraries need to be prepared for challenges to their content or events is a sad indictment.</p>
        
            <p>Hannah Edwards was a librarian for just under 23 years, and said she loved the job.</p>
        
            <p>But last year, she resigned from the Ōtāhuhu library.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes people can be really stressed, and you know, cost of living, difficult home life, difficult situations can make people really stressed, so that takes a lot out of the staff, dealing with that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the time we just felt like we were sort of social workers really."</p>

            <p>She described instances of unsafe behaviour as a daily occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>"I was never sexually harassed by any of the men but a lot of people were... We had teenagers coming into the library with knives, there was fighting," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards said something more must be done to keep librarians safe.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that the people I worked with love working in libraries, I loved working in libraries, but some of those things that happen day to day, and they do happen daily, are really, really draining."</p>
        
            <p>Public Libraries NZ and the Library and Information Association penned an open letter to local governments, highlighting the need to make sure library workers are safe.</p>
        
            <p>Executive director of the Library and Information Association, Laura Marshall, said they had an online toolkit to help libraries defend against those wanting to restrict content.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit of a sad indictment of society that, before you run an event, you have to be prepared to have a challenge, but I think that's just where we are in society at the moment," Marshall said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, that's what we're trying to do, is support members to be ready for those challenges and then successfully run their programmes."</p>
        
            <p>"With our Freedom-To-Read toolkit, it has some really practical advice, it has some of the legalities of being challenged, it has event support, it recommends that you have your key messaging before you even start an event.."</p>
        
            <p>"But also there's some case studies too, so you can read up on other libraries and how they dealt with that as well, and I think to support members, it's knowing you're not alone, someone else has done this, you can do it, and freedom of information is very important, and you're being supported by your wider members as well and by your peers."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council director of community Rachel Kelleher said the council does take steps to keep staff and visitors safe.</p>
        
            <p>"We provide training, and that training is focused on dealing with both conflict, but also de-escalating those situations as they occur."</p>
        
            <p>"We've got really strong connections with social services and outreach providers, so that we can loop in with those where we have customers that might need some additional support, and when necessary we also have on site security at some of our library facilities," Kelleher said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the open letter sent to councils raised some fair points.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen increases in some of the anti-social behaviour in some of our community facilities, and I think what's really important is that we make it really clear that the safety of our staff and customers is always our priority."</p>
