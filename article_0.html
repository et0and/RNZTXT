        <h2>Watch live: Luxon addresses Andrew Bayly complaints</h2>
        <p>
The prime minister is set to give an update after a regular meeting of the government's top ministers. Follow our live coverage.
</p>
        
            <p>Watch the press conference from 4pm:</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is set to face questions after Cabinet's weekly meeting.</p>
        
            <p>His briefing comes as Health NZ announced it would be making 400 staff redundant, and RNZ revealed 300 of its staff ate $9000 worth of canap√©s at a national conference, just as the financial crisis hitting hospitals was revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is also being asked about Commerce Minister Andrew Bayly and his apology Friday for reportedly swearing at and offending an employee at a business visit.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is also likely to be asked about New Zealand potentially hosting the America's Cup after Emirates Team New Zealand successfully wrapped up its third successive defence in Barcelona on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Former prime minister Helen Clark said the government would need to act "pretty quickly" if it wanted the chance to boost the economy and take advantage of all the benefits that stemmed from hosting it here.</p>
