            <p>TVNZ has proposed cutting several roles within its Breakfast and Seven Sharp shows, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>It's also understood, the broadcaster has proposed cutting its only Northland reporter role and having Northland stories covered by its Auckland office, along with reducing one South Island reporter role.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ reporters and camera operators are among those being called to meetings on Thursday to hear more about company's plans to axe 50 jobs in a bid to save $30 million.</p>
        
            <p>The company has proposed to get rid of 90 roles and create 41 new ones.</p>

            <p>Two staff members told RNZ camera operators are having meetings on Thursday morning and reporters for the 6pm news bulletin meetings later in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They said the current proposal is to reduce four camera operators in Auckland, up to two in Christchurch and one in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The entire Q+A team and some staff from the One News website will be attending meetings later on Thursday as well.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ said the proposals include dis-establishing roles, reducing roles, and changing reporting lines.</p>
        
            <p>Another TVNZ staff member told RNZ almost everyone at the company had been scheduled for a meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd almost find it harder to find someone that isn't affected," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Last week TVNZ backtracked on its earlier decision to close its 1News website, it then said it would retain a reduced version of the website.</p>

            <p>E tū union confirmed staff are being invited to individual and small group meetings.</p>
        
            <p>Negotiation specialist Michael Wood said staff have been through a lot this year and were feeling worried about their jobs - and about TVNZ's outsourcing plans.</p>
        
            <p>The job cuts at TVNZ would have a significant impact on its staff and its news and current affairs capacity, Wood said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are small cuts across nearly every team, with some specific roles being disestablished, and other cuts in the form of reduced roles in teams.</p>
        
            <p>There had been more significant reductions in camera operator roles, Wood said, which would have a big impact on coverage of news in the regions.</p>
        
            <p>Media and communications minister Paul Goldsmith said TVNZ needed to be economically stable but the proposed job cuts would be difficult for people.</p>
        
            <p>There was no question it was a difficult time in the media space, Goldsmith said, but TVNZ needed to ensure its expenses were in line with its revenue.</p>
        
            <p>It was up to TVNZ how it allocated its resources, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A powerpoint slide that TVNZ chief executive Jodi O'Donnell shared with staff last week said it was proposing to outsource some content workflow and technology areas from FY26 onwards.</p>
        
            <p>The slide stated TVNZ had received a large amount of feedback from staff regarding proposed changes, and the executive team needed more time to consider the feedback before making decisions.</p>
        
            <p>It said TVNZ had decided to defer a decision on the proposal to early December.</p>
