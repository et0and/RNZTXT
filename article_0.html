            <p>Analysis - Nando Pijnaker etched his name into Auckland FC folklore over the weekend. In the final seconds of seven added minutes, an inventive backheel from the centre-back clinched a memorable 1-0 win over Sydney FC at Mount Smart.</p>
        
            <p>In doing so, Auckland became only the second franchise in history to win their first two A-League games and Pijnaker was the well-deserved hero, albeit an unlikely one - this was only his second professional club goal.</p>
        
            <p>Pijnaker stood out in defence, alongside the impressive Dan Hall, repeatedly putting his body on the line as Auckland weathered pressure from their more established opponents.</p>
        
            <p>Pijnaker also earned his moment, symbolising why a second professional football team in New Zealand was needed and viable. His journey has taken him to Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, and Ireland - quite the whirlwind for a 25-year-old from Ngongotahā in Rotorua.</p>

            <p>Such far-flung stops left him relatively unknown to many, including the Sky Sports team, who misspelt his Dutch surname, "Pijnaker," as "Pijanker" on two separate occasions during his All Whites appearances.</p>
        
            <p>In the past, Pijnaker's only option to return home was the Phoenix - a fine opportunity, but limited. This summer, he felt his time abroad had run its course, and Auckland offered him a new path, one where he could reunite with longtime teammate Max Mata, be close to family, and potentially cement his spot as a starting All White.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC now offers a compelling alternative for players like Pijnaker and Mata, who may have been open to returning to New Zealand if it meant being based in Auckland rather than Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Cam Howieson is another example. His first professional start since a Scottish Championship game for St Mirren in 2016 came at the weekend. In the interim, he was the beating heart of Auckland City in the National League, until a professional option close to home finally emerged. Logan Rogerson is another, a former Phoenix player spun out to the backwaters of Finland and Armenia - but now home again.</p>

            <p>Other players - Liam Gillion, Francis De Vries, Luis Toomey, Joseph Knowles, Adama Coulibaly, Finn McKenlay, and Oli Middleton - have also signed with the fledgling franchise. All are either from Auckland or were playing National League football there last season.</p>
        
            <p>There's nothing wrong with the setup at the Phoenix; it's a solid pathway, as shown by Auckland goalkeeper Alex Paulsen. However, he still had to relocate from Tāmaki Makaurau to make it in Wellington. Now, that's no longer a requirement, which can only benefit New Zealand's football scene - especially for the young talent north of the capital who may now see a homegrown path forward.</p>
