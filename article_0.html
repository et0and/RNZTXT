            <p>Air New Zealand says a customer and crew member were injured during turbulence on a domestic flight at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ607 was travelling from Wellington to Queenstown on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the flight told Central Otago media outlet Crux that a crew member said the intense turbulence was the worst she had experienced in her career.</p>
        
            <p>They said a woman was burnt to blistering when a full coffee pot was poured on her and another crew member told them they hit the ceiling.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said crew were trained to respond to such situations, and their procedures detail when passengers and crew are required to take their seats during different levels of turbulence.</p>
        
            <p>Chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said clear-air turbulence can happen when rough air is not visible to flight crew.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were always reviewing procedures to ensure customers and the crew's safety were prioritised.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Airport said an ambulance was requested and on standby.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it was called to Queenstown Airport just before 3pm and took two patients to Lakes District Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
