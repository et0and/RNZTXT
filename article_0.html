        <h2>Watch live: Police fire back at 'insulting' pay rise offer</h2>
        <p>
Officers are considering protesting the offer they say is "an absolute joke" and "farcical" amid a cost of living crisis and a "tough on crime" government.

            <p>Police officers are considering protesting an "insulting" pay offer amid a cost of living crisis and demanding conditions.</p>
        
            <p>After rejecting the government's offer initially in September 2023, police were presented with the same offer on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The government said it was negotiating in "tough economic times", while insisting it would not break its promise to recruit more police.</p>

New Zealand Police Association president Chris Cahill says officers are struggling to pay rent and many are feeling the lure of Australia.

            <p>The New Zealand Police Association Te Aka Hāpai said its members unequivocally rejected the government's pay offer which was finally tabled last week, after months of waiting and eight months after their collective expired.</p>
        
            <p>Association president Chris Cahill said officers had lambasted the offer as "a kick in the guts", "insulting", "demoralising", "farcical", "disrespectful" and "an absolute joke".</p>
        
            <p>The association said many members were facing extreme financial pressures, resulting in an inability to pay rent or mortgages, and many were feeling the lure of Australia.</p>
        
            <p>There had been nearly 800 emails received from members this past weekend, and a consistent theme was of the need to take industrial action.</p>
        
            <p>The government's stance of being "tough on crime" meant more demanding work for officers, Cahill said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yet they insult these very officers by intentionally failing to backdate the pay offer that has been delayed by politics and government processes, not officers.</p>
        
            <p>"A nurse or social worker after six years earns $22,000 more than a six-year police constable.</p>
        
            <p>"No one thinks nurses are overpaid so why are our police constables underpaid? By the time constables reach the top of their pay band, they will have earned $240,000 less than a nurse."</p>
        
            <p>Cahill said for the government to have any chance of meeting its promise of recruiting another 500 officers in two years, it needed to ensure officers were not leaving for better pay and conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Aussie recruitment lines will have been red hot since our members heard of this offer last Friday," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The association has received numerous emails.</p>
        
            <p>"I personally know of two officers who have had to ask for food parcels, in the last few months, just so they can feed their families," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"How can the government pride themselves on law and order, introduce 'tough' new legislation against gangs, and then insult us with a pittance of a wage rise?" another said.</p>
        
            <p>"As I attend the sudden death of a 12-year-old girl and help a grieving family, then go to a gruesome violent stabbing that will stay with me forever, I will remember that I am valued by this disgusting offer."</p>
        
            <p>"Teachers, nurses, fire all had massive presence in the media, where's ours?"</p>
        
            <p>"My feedback is not printable."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell has been approached for comment.</p>
