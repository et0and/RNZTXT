        <h2>Warning as fire burns through 10 hectares in Porirua</h2>
        <p>
Smoke is drifting over a large part of the city, with fire crews hoping wind doesn't send a blaze at Titahi Bay towards homes.

            <p>Eight fire crews and helicopters with monsoon buckets are working to bring a vegetation fire in Titahi Bay under control.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency received a call about the fire at about 11pm on Thursday and the first crews were onsite 10 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>By Friday morning the fire had burnt through 10 hectares of vegetation in Whitireia Park, Fire and Emergency said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>If you've witnessed the fire, and would like to share photos or your story with us, please email it to: iwitness@radionz.co.nz</p>
        
            <p>Incident controller Steve Hudson told Morning Report the 10-hecatre blaze covers very hilly terrain, and strong winds overnight had helped the flames to spread quickly.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were hoping the forecast dropping winds would help the situation, but there were a number of houses that could be in the firing line if the wind changed, he said.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency said additional rural firefighters were being brought in to support and relieve the urban and rural crews who had been working overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke is affecting a large part of Porirua and the Public Health Service said those who are affected should go inside and close the windows and doors and turn off air conditioning units.</p>
        
            <p>Smoke could irritate the eyes, nose, throat and airways and smokers, the elderly, children and those with asthma, heart or lung disease were most at risk, it said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said no homes had been told to evacuate, but the public should stay away from the area.</p>
