            <p>US President Trump says he has agreed to "immediately pause" tariffs on Mexico for a month after a "very friendly" conversation with the country's president Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
        
            <p>"I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
        
            <p>"These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a "deal" between our two Countries," the president went on.</p>
        
            <p>The 25 percent tariffs on Mexico had been set to take effect at midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Sheinbaum also posted on social media about the pause, saying she and Trump had reached agreements on security and trade.</p>
        
            <p>Mexico will immediately reinforce the border with 10,000 members of its National Guard, while the US committed to working on preventing high-powered weapons from being trafficked to Mexico, Sheinbaum said.</p>
