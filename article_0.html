            <p>The economy fell back into recession in the fourth quarter of last year, driven by weak consumer spending and wholesale trade.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data showed seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.1 percent in the three months ended December, taking the annual growth rate to 0.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second consecutive quarter of contraction, following the previous quarter's 0.3 percent fall, meeting the technical definition of a recession.</p>
        
            <p>GDP per capita decreased by 0.7 percent, on the back of higher net migration, and real gross national disposable income fell 1.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Wholesale trade was the largest downwards driver this quarter, led by falls in grocery and liquor wholesaling; and machinery and equipment wholesaling," Stats NZ national accounts industry and production senior manager Ruvani Ratnayake said.</p>
        
            <p>Retail trade activity also fell, driven by furniture, electrical and hardware retailing, and food and beverage.</p>
        
            <p>Retail trade and accommodation fell 0.9 percent, while wholesale trade fell 1.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said eight out of 16 industries saw increased activity, including rental, hiring, real estate, public administration, safety and defence.</p>
        
            <p>The 2023 general election led to growth in public administration, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The primary sector posted growth of 0.3 percent, after shrinking in the September quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Manufacturing rebounded slightly, but fell 0.4 percent, following the previous quarter's 3.5 percent fall.</p>
