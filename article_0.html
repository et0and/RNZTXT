            <p>Police have confirmed they shot a man in Wainuiomata today, after he was seen holding a weapon to a woman's neck and threatening to harm her.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they were called to a suspected family harm incident at a Coast Road property at about 11.45am.</p>
        
            <p>When they arrived a man was behaving in an agitated manner and was seen holding a weapon to a woman's neck, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The man continued threatening harm to the woman and at about 1pm police shot the man once.</p>

            <p>The woman involved was not injured but was understandably shaken by what had occurred, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons will remain outside the Coast Road property for some time with a scene examination underway.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they would have a large presence in the area to reassure the public.</p>
        
            <p>Several investigations are now underway and the matter has also been referred to the Independent Police Conduct Authority.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said they were responding to a serious incident south of the suburb in the Wellington region on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Wainuiomata resident Elizabeth Lister told RNZ a woman ran out of a car towards her neighbours' house and believed the woman was being threatened at knife point by a man.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard this loud car coming down the road... and I thought that's just a stupid guy and before he hardly even stopped outside ... the girl opened the door and she ran up the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>"It looked like he threw a rock or something at the windscreen of the car, then it wasn't long ago after that the police arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"We could hear the police yelling drop the knife, drop the knife."</p>
        
            <p>Moments later she heard a gun shot.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was then taken away by an ambulance "screaming her head off".</p>
        
            <p>The armed offenders squad were still on Coast Road, Lister said. She said there were about 12 to 15 officers at the scene.</p>

            <p>Earlier, two armed officers visited Lister's home and asked if they could get in the bushes to get a better view.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed they had closed off Coast Road after being called to the area just ahead of midday.</p>
        
            <p>They say a cordon has been put in place south of the Wainuiomata Golf Club.</p>
