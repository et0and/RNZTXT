            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for the Bay of Plenty, says the MetService.</p>
        
            <p>Ōpōtiki and Whakatāne are the latest towns forecast to be in the firing line, with MetService weather radars detecting severe thunderstorms near Murupara, Galatea and Kopuriki.</p>
        
            <p>That weather system is expected to move towards Matahi just before 6.30pm. A heavy rain watch has also been in place for the Bay of Plenty, east of Rotorua and Gisborne on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, MetService said a severe thunderstorm warning issued for parts of Canterbury and Gisborne had been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>Its weather radar forecast severe thunderstorms for Gisborne, Selwyn, Waimakariri and Ashburton on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch has also been cancelled for Northland, although a severe thunderstorm watch is still in place.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch remains in place for Gisborne and the Hawke's Bay until midnight tonight.</p>
        
            <p>A local resident Roger Handford said that dark clouds could be seen piling up over the hills to the west just after 1.15pm and then minutes later the rain burst over Gisborne, accompanied by thunder.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane advised people to stay updated on the weather forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"Severe thunderstorms bring a risk of very intense downpours and the possibility of surface flooding.</p>
        
            <p>"While festivities are underway, it's prudent to stay updated on the latest forecasts ... as a Red Thunderstorm Warning will be issued for any storms that become severe."</p>
        
            <p>For the eastern South Island though, Tuesday marked a shift to cooler, fresher air, extending to the lower North Island on Wednesday, temporarily lowering temperatures in those regions.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said this brief cooldown, following warm and humid days, preceded a return to warmer conditions on Friday, potentially reaching 30°C in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>As warmth dominates the east, Friday brings a wetter narrative elsewhere, courtesy of one of the last active weather system of the year.</p>
        
            <p>But wet weather was set to remain for western parts of the North and South Island, accompanied by strong winds in the South Island and lower North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane encouraged everyone to "take full advantage of the good weather when it's there" during this changeable week.</p>
