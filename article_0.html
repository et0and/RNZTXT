            <p>Canterbury has been lashed by heavy rain and hail as severe thunderstorms roll up the country's east coast, flooding houses and cancelling flights.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch has now been lifted for Christchurch, but remains in place for the Canterbury Plains, Canterbury High Country, Marlborough, Wellington, Wairarapa, Kapiti-Horowhenua, Tararua, Manawatu, Hawke's Bay and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>In Christchurch, Fire and Emergency New Zealand said heavy rain had flooded houses in the suburbs of Belfast and Middleton.</p>
        
            <p>Four flights have been cancelled and others delayed at Christchurch Airport, where MetService said sensors detected 2mm of rain falling in just one minute.</p>
        
            <p>An airport spokesperson said lightning strikes had affected airfield lighting and navigation systems, although the airport was still open.</p>
        
            <p>Three fire crews were responding to a hedge fire in Yaldhurst sparked by lightning about 10:15am.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris said the risk was mainly for the heavy rain, large hail and strong wind gusts, making driving conditions hazardous.</p>
        
            <p>"That hail did really decrease visibility so if you happen to be out driving out in a severe thunderstorm or a thunderstorm with hail in your path maybe slow down, maybe even pull off the road, it will pass," he said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warns that large hail which can come with thunderstorms can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vehicles and glasshouses.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
