            <p>A big jump in the number of Wellington parents who cannot afford to pay school fees and donations is being blamed on recent public service redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington High School emailed families last week to say it was aware some families have been affected by the recent slew of public sector job cuts and they should consider school donations and fees a "low priority".</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of public sector roles have already been axed.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Girls college has also seen a significant jump in families struggling financially.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Julia Davidson told RNZ the school was hearing from parents that job cuts in the public sector were causing anxiety about their finances.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was unusual for parents to be so proactive about telling the school they were struggling to pay the fees.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly, the number of people has increased significantly."</p>
        
            <p>She said there was usually a steady amount of people who had issues with paying fees, but there had been a marked increase this year.</p>
        
            <p>"These are people who would usually have paid their donations without a a question, but this time they're not just questioning, they're asking for help."</p>
        
            <p>The public service sector cuts were "definitely" a factor, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what they're telling us - I'm either about to lose my job, or I think I'm going to lose my job. So they're being quite honest about that."</p>
        
            <p>She said the school was waiving the charges and relying on charitable donations to cover the shortfall, so kids did not miss out.</p>
        
            <p>"So it won't mean anything for the kids, we'll simply not invoice them for it, and the school will pick up the bill. We've been quite fortunate in getting some money from charitable trusts who have been happy to give us money to fill those gaps.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not going to go on forever, but if it came down to it, we would just find the money, because you have to, you don't want kids missing out on things. So we'll do anything to keep them engaged, and keep them playing sport or going on camps or doing those things that they love."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said there were some parents who could afford it, and were offering to pay double to allow another student to take part in trips and activities.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's always fantastic and amazing when that happens, so we are very fortunate there."</p>
