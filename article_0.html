            <p>It is up to individual schools to decide if a student leaving class to attend a protest is an unjustified absence, principals say.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of young people on Friday joined rallies calling for action on climate change.</p>
        
            <p>Secondary Principals' Association president Vaughan Couillault said although students had a right to attend protests, walking out of class could come with consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"These young people who are taking strike action, they weren't in class, it wasn't a school trip. They were not in class.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew where they were, and so you could say it's an explained absence. Whether you call it justified or not is up to you as a school member."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour criticised the rallies, saying students should be in school rather than protesting.</p>
        
            <p>"If students feel strongly about sending a message, they could have marched on Tuesday when there was a nationwide teacher-only day, or during the upcoming school holidays. It has become far too common to sacrifice valuable learning time for other causes."</p>

            <p>One student at a rally in Auckland told RNZ while her school disapproved of her extracurricular activities as an organiser, behind closed doors some teachers had expressed support.</p>
        
            <p>Another protester, draped in a Palestine flag, told 1News Seymour was "a dick". Green Party co-leader Chloe Swarbrick said Seymour's view was "straight-up embarrassing".</p>
        
            <p>Protest organiser Sophie Handford said if Seymour did not want students to miss school, then he needed to step up and treat the climate crisis for what it was.</p>
        
            <p>Couillault said students could make their own choices.</p>
        
            <p>"If the students want to rally and organise groups to express themselves, that's on them to do that. From a school perspective, we respect their right to do that. But there are consequences for that - you're not at school, you're marked absent - that's how it works."</p>
        
            <p>Couillault said it was up to individual schools to decide if an absence was unjustified.</p>
