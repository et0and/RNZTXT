        <h2>Live weather updates: Hundreds of homes flooded</h2>
        <p>
Civil Defence is focusing on getting through the next high tide at 9pm in Wairoa, with more than 400 homes affected by flooding.
</p>
        
            <p>More than 400 properties in Wairoa appear to have been affected by flooding, Civil Defence says, with more than 100 significantly impacted.</p>
        
            <p>"Vehicles, sheds, garages have also been flood-inundated," it said in the update.</p>
        
            <p>"Back country rain" was flowing down the Wairoa River, saturating the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"To get through the next high tide, at around 9pm, and ensuring people are safe and those who are not in their homes are cared for is our focus," Civil Defence controller Juanita Savage said.</p>
        
            <p>The town centre has so far been spared. Around 90 percent of the town's power had been restored as of 6.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Mayor Craig Little earlier said he doesn't know how the town is going to get through this latest onslaught from the weather, which has wound back the clock on repairs done after Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>And Gisborne Mayor Rehette Stoltz says it is a "dark time in Tai Rawhiti", coinciding with the deaths of three local fishermen.</p>
        
            <p>States of emergency remain in place in Heretaunga and Wairoa.</p>
