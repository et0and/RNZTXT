        <h2>'It will save money' - National on promise to extend parliamentary term to four years</h2>

Among a number of agreements made during talks with New Zealand First and ACT, National has agreed to push for a four-year term between general elections.

            <p>National's Christopher Luxon has promised New Zealand First and ACT to introduce legislation on a referendum to extend the parliamentary term to four years.</p>
        
            <p>The agreement with ACT promises to move this within the first 15 months in power.</p>
        
            <p>The new government - a three-way coalition between National, New Zealand First and ACT - was revealed on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>National's Luxon will be the new Prime Minister, with New Zealand First's Winston Peters and ACT's David Seymour each appointed Deputy Prime Minister for 18 months - with Peters going first.</p>
        
            <p>Talks between the parties had been ongoing until earlier this week, with Peters telling media they were "seriously long, difficult and complicated ... arduous and extreme".</p>
        
            <p>Among a number of agreements made during the talks, National has agreed to push for four years between general elections.</p>
        
            <p>The agreement with ACT states it will: "Pass the Constitution (Enabling a 4-Year Term) Amendment Bill through first reading in the first 15 months of the term."</p>
        
            <p>Where the agreement with New Zealand First states it will: "Support to Select Committee a bill that would enact a binding referendum on a four-year term of Parliament."</p>
        
            <p>Both parties have pushed for an extension of the parliamentary term in the past.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also supports extending the term, the New Zealand Herald reported earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Peters wanted it done at this year's election, telling a crowd in August that the current three-year term was too short.</p>
        
            <p>But he wanted voters - not political parties - to be the ones who decided whether it be extended or not.</p>
        
            <p>"Elections are expensive so it will save money and get better long-term outcomes for our country," he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>In 2021, Seymour introduced a bill to Parliament - the Regulatory Standards Act Bill - which he hoped would give more time for the government to implement laws.</p>
        
            <p>During the 2020 general election, then Labour leader Jacinda Ardern and National leader Judith Collins were asked about four-year terms.</p>
        
            <p>Both replied with an emphatic "yes" with Ardern adding "we might be able to do that".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has one of the shortest parliamentary terms in the world.</p>
        
            <p>Of 190 countries with parliaments, 103 have five-year terms, 74 have four-year terms, and just nine governments are in power for three years before an election is held.</p>
        
            <p>A 2020 survey, conducted by Research New Zealand, showed of 1000 people, 61 percent supported moving from a three-year term to a four-year term.</p>
        
            <p>About 25 percent were against it, and the rest were undecided.</p>
