        <h2>'Reckless and dangerous' - NZ must make Gaza, Trump stance clear, expert says</h2>
        <p>
Otago University professor of international relations Robert Patman says New Zealand should provide a robust response to Donald Trump's Gaza plan, and also "should stop tip-toeing" around Trump.

            <p>New Zealand should be robust in its response to the "unacceptable" situation in Gaza but it must also back its allies against threats by the US President, says an international relations expert.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University professor of international relations Robert Patman said the rest of the world also "should stop tip-toeing" around Donald Trump and must stand up to any threats he makes against allies, no matter how outlandish they seem.</p>
        
            <p>Trump doubled down on his proposal for a US takeover of Gaza on Friday, after the idea was rejected by Palestinians and leaders around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters told RNZ that New Zealand would not comment on the plan until it was clear exactly what was meant, but said New Zealand continued to support a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.</p>
        
            <p>Patman said president's plan was "truly shocking and absolutely appalling" in light of what has unfolded in Gaza in the last 15 months.</p>
        
            <p>It was not only "tone deaf" but also dangerous, he added, with the proposal amounting to "the most powerful country in the world, the US, dismantling an international rules based system that [it] has done so much to establish".</p>
        
            <p>"This was an extraordinary proposal which I think is reckless and dangerous because it certainly doesn't help the immediate situation. It probably plays into the hands of extremists in the region."</p>
        
            <p>"There is a view at the moment that we must all tiptoe round Mr Trump in order not to upset him, while he's completely free to make outrageous suggestions which endanger people's lives."</p>

            <p>Peters' careful position on a potential US takeover of Gaza was "a fair response ... but the Luxon-led government must be clear the current situation is unacceptable" and oppose protectionism, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The government ] wants a solution in the Middle East which recognises both the Israeli desire for security but also recognises the political right to self determination of the Palestinian people, in other words the right to have a state of their own."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand should also speak out against Trump's threats to annexe Canada, "our very close ally", he said.</p>
        
            <p>He was "not suggesting New Zealand be provocative but it must be robust", Patman said.</p>

            <p>The Green Party said US President Donald Trump had been explicit in his intention to take over Gaza, and New Zealand needed to make its position crystal clear too.</p>
        
            <p>Greens co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said the Prime Minister needed to stand up and condemn the plan as reprehensible.</p>
        
            <p>"President Trump's comments have been pretty clear to anybody who is able to read or to listen to them, about his intention to forcibly displace, or to see displaced, about 1.8 million Gazans from their own land, who have already been made refugees in their own land."</p>
        
            <p>France, Spain, Ireland, Brazil and others had been "unequivocal" in their condemnation of Trump's plan, and the Foreign Minister should be too, she added.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders value justice and they value peace, and they want to see our leadership represent that, on the international stage. So [these were] really disappointing and unfortunately unclear comments from our Deputy Prime Minister."</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday Foreign Minister Winston Peters told RNZ that New Zealand still supports a two-state solution, but said he would not comment on Trump's Gaza plan until officials can grasp exactly what this means.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, an international law expert says New Zealand's cautious position following Trump's sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) staff is the right response - for now.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of countries have expressed "unwavering support" for the ICC in a joint statement, after the US President imposed sanctions on its staff.</p>
        
            <p>The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.</p>
        
            <p>Trump has accused the court of improperly targeting the US and its ally, Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Neither New Zealand nor Australia had joined the statement, but in a statement to RNZ the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had always supported the ICC's role in upholding international law and a rules-based system.</p>
        
            <p>University of Victoria law professor Alberto Costi said currently New Zealand is at little risk of sanctions and there's no need for a stronger approach.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage there is no reason to be stronger. New Zealand is perceived as a state that believes in a rules-based order and is supportive of the work of the ICC.</p>
        
            <p>"So there's not much need to go further but it's a space to watch in the future, should these sanctions become a reality. But as far as New Zealand is concerned, at the moment there is no need to antagonise anyone at this stage."</p>
