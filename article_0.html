            <p>Milton is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Thursday NZ time as a dangerous major hurricane, the second huge storm to hit the US in a fortnight.</p>
        
            <p>The storm has exploded in strength as it nears the Tampa region.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole," US President Biden said from the White House, urging those under orders to leave to "evacuate now, now, now".</p>
        
            <p>Across the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief after Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>
