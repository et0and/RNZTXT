            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron attempted to correct his US counterpart on the nature of European support for Ukraine during Oval Office talks, interrupting President Donald Trump as he spoke to note he was misstating the facts.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting at the White House on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, came as European leaders navigated the US president's upending of foreign policy on the war.</p>
        
            <p>The extraordinary moment underscored the strained dynamics of Monday's talks, CNN's Kevin Liptak wrote. While Trump and Macron otherwise appeared friendly and willing to engage on the future of Ukraine, the talks have been against the backdrop of Trump's sometimes-false statements about the war effort.</p>
        
            <p>"Just so you understand, Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They're getting their money back," Trump began as he was preparing to make the case for a new deal to secure Ukraine's mineral revenues as back-payment for American assistance.</p>
        
            <p>Macron reached over to grab Trump's arm to interject.</p>
        
            <p>"No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60 percent of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants," he said. "We have $230 billion in frozen assets in Europe, Russian assets. But this is not collateral of a loan because it is not our belonging. So they are frozen."</p>
        
            <p>Trump seemed to shrug off the interjection: "If you believe that, it's OK with me. They get their money back, and we don't. But now we do."</p>
        
            <p>The US president said Zelensky "may come" to Washington this week or next as the two countries are "very close" to coming to an agreement on a rare earths minerals deal.</p>
        
            <p>The deal would grant the US access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, if Washington provided security guarantees to Kyiv in return.</p>
