            <p>A 61-year-old man who survived nearly 24-hours stranded at sea is adamant the experience has taught him some valuable safety lessons.</p>
        
            <p>Will Fransen fell overboard while on a solo fishing trip just off the coast of Whangamatā on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fransen said he fell out of the boat after he had hooked a marlin, put a tag on it and was trying to release it back into the water.</p>
        
            <p>He said he knew he was in serious trouble after he was unable to get back into his boat, the Betty G, and saw it heading over the horizon.</p>
        
            <p>No one knew he was out fishing and the chances of him being seen were very slim, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There were two boats quite early on near me that I unsuccessfully tried to shout to and wave to, they didn't see me, but I knew as soon as I was in the water that the chances of getting a boat to be close enough to see me and grab their attention, very slim," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fransen said when he had been in the ocean for a couple of hours he saw a shark which got his "heart racing" but fortunately it circled and then left.</p>
        
            <p>There was a lovely sunset but he wondered what the night would bring.</p>
        
            <p>"I was cold in the sun in the mid-afternoon let alone that night, I was shivering like for 15 hours I suppose, I dunno... and apart from seeing the light on Slipper Island and the light on the Aldermans and the glow of Tauranga behind the Mayor Island, there's not a lot of light apart from stars, the stars were really bright, a nice astronomical sky."</p>
        
            <p>He did not have a life jacket, and spent a difficult night at sea, trying to stay afloat on a gimbal harness before being rescued by using his watch to reflect the sunlight.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw a bigger boat and I tried to use my watch then to flash towards it but to try and get above the wave height, I had my arm fully above me and then I'd sink under the waves again. So I knew that I'd probably not even managed to get a signal to them."</p>
        
            <p>The wind and the waves then dropped but Fransen said he was hallucinating due to too much time in the sun and had seen a few boats that were not there.</p>
        
            <p>"And then I looked up and saw the boys in their boat and it was not that far away and I looked again they're still there and I thought yip, and I flashed them with my watch and fortunately they saw the flashes from my watch face."</p>
        
            <p>The boat had started to turn after seeing the flashes and Fransen said he then waved at them.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a huge relief to get on board the boat.</p>
        
            <p>"I surprised myself with how I scrambled up the ladder into the boat, and yet I couldn't stand properly inside it, I was just exhausted."</p>
        
            <p>Fransen said he collapsed on a chair and the crew on the boat gave him their clothing and wrapped him in an insulating sheet.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was incredibly thirsty after the ordeal and drank about three litres of water in the one and a half hours it took to return to Whangamatā Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>"God was looking out for me and all that stuff, I knew that my chances were next to nothing, so to be here, I'm very grateful."</p>
        
            <p>His three rescuers were "really down to earth Kiwi lads out there having a fish and they did the right thing by me", Fransen said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were several things that he could have done differently.</p>
        
            <p>"I could've worn a life jacket because I was on my own and a personal locator beacon, a PLB, so I could've set that off, I could have just tied a tether to myself to do what I did and then if I had of fallen in I could've pulled myself in."</p>
        
            <p>Fransen said he would definitely be wearing a lifejacket, buying a personal locator beacon and improving guard rails the next time he went fishing.</p>
        
            <p>Fransen, who has three adult children, said his family came to see him in hospital after the ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty emotional, my daughter wouldn't let me go."</p>
        
            <p>But he said he got a "telling off" from his son for being so poorly prepared on the boat.</p>
