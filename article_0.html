            <p>US President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump, leaving the presidential race in uncharted territory.</p>
        
            <p>Biden, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.</p>
        
            <p>He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.</p>
