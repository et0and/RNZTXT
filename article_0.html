            <p>A New Zealand citizen has died attending hajj in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) says.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, MFAT said consular assistance was being provided to the person's family.</p>
        
            <p>In Saudi Arabia, nearly 2 million Muslim pilgrims have been finishing hajj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters reported foreign authorities had said hundreds of people from around the world had died on their journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also confirmed an Australian citizen is among the deceased.</p>
        
            <p>The ABC reported Yahya Ibrahim, a Muslim Chaplain at Curtin University and the University of Western Australia, told RN Breakfast that funeral prayers had been held for the Australian, believed to be a man from Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"It is somebody who was elderly who sadly found his last moments seeking God," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Causes of death were not immediately clear for all.</p>
        
            <p>Egyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Muslims are required to take part in hajj once in their life - if financially and physically capable - with it being considered one of the pillars of Islam.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of the largest annual religious gatherings in the world.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
