            <p>Luxon left for the Pacific state on Thursday morning, where he will talk to other leaders at Apia and Mulifanua on topics such as the climate, the Middle East and small nations on the world stage.</p>

            <p>"CHOGM is a fantastic opportunity to connect with other Commonwealth leaders," Luxon said earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>"In these uncertain geopolitical times, it is important to meet face-to-face to talk about how we can be more resilient in the face of global challenges."</p>
        
            <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla also arrived earlier on Thursday. Charles is expected to speak on Friday.</p>
