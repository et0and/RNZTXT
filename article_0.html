            <p>The Transport Minister is warning people should expect to be paying more tolls under the Government's new roading plan.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the government unveiled its $20 billion draft plan for transport, promising more than a dozen new highways and a new fund to fix potholes.</p>
        
            <p>But the cost of petrol and annual car registration will go up to help pay for the policies, prompting outrage from Opposition parties.</p>
        
            <p>Simeon Brown told Morning Report the plan allowed the Government to keep its election promises while still building and maintaining roads.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had to fly to Australia this morning after problems with the Defence Force plane.</p>
