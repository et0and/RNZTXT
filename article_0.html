            <p>The Attorney-General has called for an investigation into the top District Court Judge's behaviour at a private event in November.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Ema Aitken apologised last month after reports she and her husband gatecrashed a private New Zealand First event on 22 November.</p>
        
            <p>The Post reported Aitken was attending a separate event with her husband David Galler, an intensive care specialist and star of TV programme Middlemore,  and heard Winston Peters making a speech.</p>
        
            <p>She then allegedly tried to get into the venue and yelled "He's lying! How can you let him say that?", while Dr Galler allegedly also yelled at Peters and is accused of cornering Minister Casey Costello.</p>
        
            <p>The Post reported he said Peters was "doing a s--- job in government", and tried to block the deputy prime minister's exit, and later verbally attacked Costello over the repeal of smokefree legislation.</p>

            <p>Collins said she had passed the matter to the Judicial Conduct Commissioner, who had recommended a judicial conduct panel be set up to investigate and report on the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of my role in making the referral, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith will act as Attorney-General on this matter, to avoid any perception of conflict of interest, bias or pre-determination on my part in the decision yet to be made," Collins said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Goldsmith will therefore now consider the Commissioner's recommendation. No further comment will be made."</p>
