            <p>Green Party members are gathering in Christchurch this weekend for the party's annual general meeting, with the fate of former MP Darleen Tana set to play a big part in the agenda.</p>
        
            <p>Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick has urged the party faithful to build the biggest Green movement the world has ever seen.</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick is now addressing members at the Green's AGM in Christchurch - her first since becoming co-leader in March.</p>
        
            <p>She is telling them the party needs to go through some growing pains and reflect on what it used to be and what it wants to be.</p>
        
            <p>One of those difficult conversations is set to happen this afternoon, with members discussing whether to use legislation it has been historically opposed to.</p>
        
            <p>Members will discuss whether to use the party-hopping legislation to remove Darleen Tana from Parliament - but a vote will not be forced.</p>
        
            <p>Tana was ousted by the Greens and asked to quit politics altogether this month after an independent investigation found the MP likely knew about allegations of worker exploitation at husband Christian Hoff-Nielsen's business, and did not disclose them to the party until after last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>Despite voting for the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act in 2018, the Greens have long made their opposition to the legislation clear.</p>
        
            <p>However, with Tana determined to stay in Parliament, and the Greens' proportionality now affected, Swarbrick said the party would now formally explore other avenues at the AGM.</p>
        
            <p>More to come</p>
