            <p>Kiwi shot putter Tom Walsh is out of medal contention after throwing three fouls and apparently suffering an injury.</p>
        
            <p>His teammate Jacko Gill also fell short of winning a medal, coming in sixth. The gold went to US shot putter Ryan Crouser for the third Olympics in a row.</p>
        
            <p>NZ sprinter Zoe Hobbs managed 11.13s in her 100m semi-final, but it was not enough to qualify for the final.</p>
        
            <p>"I just didn't execute a good race. I think I let it go from the get-go," she told RNZ. "My reaction wasn't great and over the first 10 I was already behind, and I let it slip through my fingers, and that's just the reality of the 100m sometimes."</p>
        
            <p>"You have to put together a perfect race, especially to make an Olympic. I'm really disappointed."</p>
        
            <p>Swimmer Erika Fairweather is also up in an Olympics final on Sunday morning - the 800m freestyle at 7.09am.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Emma Twigg has been pipped for the gold by the Netherlands in the event she won at Tokyo 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Twigg was unable to defend her Olympic title, settling for silver as she was beaten in the women's single sculls final by Dutch rower Karolien Florijn. Tom Mackintosh came fifth in the men's single scull final.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the week, New Zealand rowers won three medals - a gold, silver and bronze - in quick succession in a magic hour on the water.</p>
