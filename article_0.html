        <h2>Watch live: Hīkoi mō te Tiriti converges on Parliament</h2>
        <p>
Tens of thousands are expected to gather as a sea of red, black and white flags makes its way along the waterfront and a march down SH2 reaches the central city.
</p>
        
            <p>We are livestreaming the hīkoi at Parliament at the top of this page. You can follow live updates from our blog below.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people have marched into and across central Wellington as the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti heads to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd on Tuesday was led by kairākau - men with rākau - and is making its way along Petone esplanade toward State Highway 2. There have been karakia, waiata and haka ringing out. Māori Queen Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po will join the hīkoi's final stage to Parliament, where tens of thousands are expected to congregate.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is considering how to address the hīkoi when it arrives at Parliament. A spokesperson said a small delegation of National MPs will be available to meet the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill architect, ACT leader David Seymour, says he supports the right to protest, but thinks participants are misguided and have a range of different grievances.</p>
