            <p>The top five finalists for the APRA Silver Scroll Award have a chance of winning the prize for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>They are Stan Walker (for 'I Am'), SKILAA (for 'Jenny Greenteeth'), Anna Coddington (for Kātuarehe'), Georgia Lines (for 'The Letter'), and Mermaidens (for 'I Like to Be Alone').</p>
        
            <p>Walker is also a top three contender for the APRA Maioha Award, which recognises contemporary Māori music and songwriters telling Te Ao Māori stories. His song 'Māori Ki Te Ao' is a celebration of his Tūhoe identity.</p>
        
            <p>The other finalists for this award are TAWAZ for 'He Aho' and Jordyn with a Why for 'He Rei Niho'.</p>
        
            <p>The winners are determined by the votes of New Zealand APRA members (who are also songwriters, producers and performers).</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of the awards ceremony in Pōneke Wellington, the five finalists told Music 101 the stories behind their nominated songs.</p>
