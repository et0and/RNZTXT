            <p>The Springboks have scored two late tries to beat the All Blacks 31-27 in a tense Rugby Championship test in Johannesburg.</p>
        
            <p>In the first match between the teams since the 2023 World Cup final, Codie Taylor put the first points on the board.</p>
        
            <p>Winger Caleb Clarke scored two of the All Blacks' four tries and Jordie Barrett clinched one.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was ahead 12-11 at halftime and increased their lead going into the final quarter, to 27-17.</p>
        
            <p>However, after prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi was shown a yellow card, the Springboks rallied to power home in front of a massive, passionate crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Two tries in quick succession, by Kwagga Smith and Grant Williams, put the South African side out in front, where they wound down the clock to finish five points ahead.</p>
        
            <p>New Springbok first five-eighth Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu proved his worth for the home team, kicking 16 points - four penalties and two conversions.</p>

            <p>"We made sure not to panic and picked ourselves up," Springbok captain Siya Kolisi told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't give up, we've been behind before and we can draw on those experiences."</p>
        
            <p>The atmosphere at Ellis Park was jubilant from the start, with the crowd of 62,000 raising their voices to the heavens during the South African national anthem.</p>
        
            <p>As the All Blacks did the haka, the South Africans mounted an early response in the form of a South African Airways A380 jumbo jet blasting its way over the stadium.</p>
        
            <p>This is the third win in a row in this competition for the Springboks, who beat Australia in Brisbane and Perth.</p>
        
            <p>They will face the All Blacks again in Cape Town next weekend.</p>
