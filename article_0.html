            <p>TVNZ is warning of a large underlying loss amid a worsening advertising downturn.</p>
        
            <p>The state-owned broadcaster said it now expected an underlying loss of between $28 million and $33m in the 2024 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>It said on top of the underlying loss, TVNZ's full-year result would include a significant non-cash write-down as the value of its assets would be affected by future earnings forecasts.</p>
        
            <p>It said traditional television advertising was down nearly 16 percent from last year, and only partially offset by digital revenue, despite revenue growth on its TVNZ+ streaming platform.</p>

            <p>"We have made significant strides in our path to being a digital-first broadcaster over the past six months, however, as a fully commercially funded organisation, we are exposed to the ad market," chief executive Jodi O'Donnell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since we announced our interim position, the advertising downturn driven by recessionary conditions and structural market change has deepened. TVNZ's revenue position as a result has deteriorated, despite a continued focus on cost saving initiatives," O'Donnell said.</p>
        
            <p>In its half-year results announced in March, TVNZ reported a bottom line loss of $16.8m, and an underlying loss of $4.6m.</p>
        
            <p>Following the results, TVNZ announced 68 jobs would be cut, including its Sunday and Fair Go programmes.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Employment Court ruled it had failed to consult with staff before cancelling the programmes and cutting jobs.</p>
        
            <p>O'Donnell said despite the tougher results, it was not looking for a government handout.</p>
        
            <p>"While we strongly support regulatory and legislative change to encourage a fairer playing field and fit-for-purpose operating environment, we are not seeking financial support from the Crown," O'Donnell said.</p>
        
            <p>She said TVNZ's balance sheet was "robust".</p>
        
            <p>In response to the tougher television advertising market, TVNZ said it would be accelerating its digital changes.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to invest aggressively in a digital future to build online audience and revenue scale, and to secure a profitable and sustainable future for the business," O'Donnell said.</p>
