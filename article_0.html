            <p>Almost a third of people who have applied for the government's accommodation support for those displaced by storms have been turned down.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) said 132 applications have been processed so far, of which 90 have been granted and 42 declined - including a dozen whose homes are held in trusts.</p>
        
            <p>Most are in the Auckland region, where 72 have been granted and 30 have been declined.</p>
        
            <p>Another 24 applications for the support were still being processed.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai resident Maria Koppens said people were missing out on the support because the eligibility criteria is too tight.</p>
        
            <p>"Not all that need the support meet the eligibility criteria. There is some very strict criteria around who is eligible for the support and who isn't. The ownership structure of the house is a factor, whether or not they have a formal tenancy agreement is another factor."</p>
        
            <p>Koppens said she had heard from displaced people who were not applying because they did not meet the criteria because their family home is in a trust.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a hugely stressful time for these people who need the support desperately and know that they won't get it unless the eligibility criteria is reviewed."</p>
        
            <p>She said she would be calling on the incoming Cyclone Recovery Minister to prioritise the matter.</p>
        
            <p>MSD said the Temporary Accommodation Assistance payments were set up as targeted support for a specific group of people, and the Ministry can only provide these payments when specific eligibility criteria are met.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 42 applications declined, 12 were because the house was held in a trust, and another 12 were because the property was not impacted by the storms.</p>
        
            <p>Other reasons included applicants had not provided costs for the damaged property, were staying with family or friends or had other temporary accommodation available, or the financial circumstances were not met.</p>
        
            <p>In September, the government established the Temporary Accommodation Assistance package for people unable to get back into their homes, providing up to $610 a week to help with the cost of renting another home.</p>
        
            <p>But the package only covered displaced homeowners, meaning people with property held in trusts had to fend for themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Insurance payments helped many people to cover their additional rent costs in the wake of the Auckland flooding and Cyclone Gabrielle. But for some, these payments have already run out.</p>
        
            <p>When the government announced the Temporary Accommodation Assistance package in July, Minister for Social Development and Employment Carmel Sepuloni said at the time</p>
        
            <p>"This payment will help bridge the gap until repairs are undertaken or a decision is made on the future of their property,"</p>
        
            <p>Payments ranged from $250 to $610 depending on family size and location.</p>
        
            <p>Koppens said that was not enough for larger families seeking three or four bedroom homes in Auckland, given rents had increased.</p>
        
            <p>"The level of support that is offered by the package is not adequate to meet the rising Auckland rent costs," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So every week they have an additional amount to find to cover that shortfall."</p>
