            <p>The pressure to impress dinner guests over summer can generate a lot of food waste, says Alicia Mendez, head chef at the Wellington community restaurant Everybody Eats.</p>
        
            <p>There's no shame in choosing to keep it simple instead, she tells RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Follow your heart, stick to the things that you like, things you're confident in doing and you feel really proud of."</p>
        
            <p>Every Sunday to Wednesday, Alicia Mendez designs a three-course gourmet dinner menu from a random daily haul of donated food to serve hundreds of restaurant guests that night.</p>
        
            <p>Susie Ferguson visited the Everybody Eats kitchen to watch her in action.</p>
        
            <p>Everybody Eats now has three restaurants in Wellington Central, Onehunga and Glen Innes that serve high-quality meals made with food that would otherwise be headed to the landfill.</p>
        
            <p>Their head chefs must be quick-thinking, very methodical and resourceful at figuring out how to get the most use from each donated food item, Mendez says.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot of grading the produce that comes in and quickly thinking 'What can I do with this item to give it a longer shelf life? Can I incorporate it into the day's set menu?</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lot of research on my bus ride, trying to figure out multiple ways to use it and be creative."</p>
        
            <p>Having a "lovely list of pantry items," on hand - inspired by Israeli-British chef Yotam Ottolenghi - gives Mendez comfort that she'll be able to turn what she's given into something delicious.</p>

            <p>Using frozen peas donated by New World Willis Street, leftover blue cheese from a private catering event and one of Ottolenghi's recommended pantry staples - dukkah - Mendez comes up with a vegetable side dish of Grilled Courgettes, Blue Cheese Spread & Dukkah.</p>
        
            <p>To ensure this and all of her other dishes tastes great, she uses the principles of Samin Nosrat's best-selling cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a really great way to understand how all of those things contribute to a good meal."</p>
        
            <p>"[In this dish] we've got fat in our dairy, we've got salt in our lovely dukkah, we've got a little acid in our vinegar and oil."</p>
        
            <p>"If you make a nice big batch you can keep it on your shelf and put it on your fried eggs in the morning or just on toast alone I think is really nice. [Or with] any grilled veg."</p>
        
            <p>Mendez is a fan of lateral cooking which involves repurpousing something made for a specific dish in a new culinary direction.</p>
        
            <p>Leftover tomato-based pasta sauce made into the Middle Eastern baked egg dish shakshuka the next day is a good example of this approach, she says, as is her One Pot Wonder.</p>
        
            <p>"You put everything in a pot, put some puff pastry on the top and you've got a lovely pie for anyone to enjoy. I think is a great way to just use root vegetables in your fridgeâ€¦ cut 'em down, cook 'em, make a little gravy."</p>
