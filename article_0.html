            <p>Former Greens co-leader James Shaw is set to make his farewell speech after 10 years in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw stepped down as co-leader in January, but remained at Parliament as an MP to try and shepherd a member's bill through the House.</p>
        
            <p>The bill - which would have changed the Bill of Rights to include the right to a sustainable environment - did not pass its first reading.</p>
        
            <p>Shaw was climate change minister in the Labour led-governments from 2017 to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>In an exit interview with RNZ this week, Shaw summarised his time in politics: "It's been the greatest privilege of my life, it really has, and it was the hardest thing I've ever done, and probably will ever do, and by the end of it I was not in great shape."</p>
