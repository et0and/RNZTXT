            <p>Māori educator Dame Iritana Te Rangi Tāwhiwhirangi, a founder of the Kōhanga Reo movement, has died. She was 95.</p>
        
            <p>A social media pānui posted to Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust's Facebook page said Dame Iritana died on Saturday, surrounded by whānau at home.</p>
        
            <p>"As a whānau we are deeply proud of all her work and accomplishments, particularly raising her children and mokopuna."</p>
        
            <p>"She did all of this without her late husband by her side, while leading, contributing and supporting Māori development through kaupapa such as Te Kōhanga Reo, Māori Womens Welfare League, Tu Tangata and many other kaupapa," the post read.</p>
        
            <p>Born at Wharekāhika on the East Coast, Dame Iritana was a descendant of Ngāti Porou, Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāpuhi.</p>
        
            <p>"She had high expectations and demanded the best for, and of Māoridom. She worked tirelessly to strengthen whanau and she was adamant that whanau knew what was best for them, and that they only needed to be empowered and enabled to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Dame Iritana was a life member of the Māori Women's Welfare League, a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit and made a Dame Companion in 2009 for services to Māori education.</p>
        
            <p>"We as a whanau are very much aware of the importance of our mother and grandmother to the motu, and we would like to thank all those who have sent love over the past few weeks."</p>
        
            <p>"She challenged the status quo and pushed for better outcomes for whānau. She gave her life to the greater cause ensuring Māoridom achieved independence and self-determination with a flourishing Reo. Her passion was the development of whānau, community and iwi."</p>
        
            <p>In a post to the Kiingitanga's Facebook page, Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po has confirmed she will attend the tangihana on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"He wahine kaha, he aarero whakatika, he ngaakau nui ki ngaa iwi puta noa."</p>
        
            <p>"Whoatu ki Te Arikinui me ngaa mana nunui i hii ake Te Kohanga Reo. Kua pae koe ki te papa hurihanga o ngaa tuupuna, ko te pae o mahara ki a koe e kore e wawe te petapeta noa," the post read.</p>
        
            <p>Iritana Tāwhiwhirangi began teaching in the 1940s and became a welfare officer in Ruatōria, developing playcentres on the East Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The first Kōhanga Reo was opened in April 1982 in Wainuiomata and the Secretary for Māori Affairs at the time, Kara Puketapu, engaged Dame Iritana to promote Kōhanga Reo throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>In 2010, Dame Iritana told Waka Huia her greatest wish was that the movement was carried by all Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a mutual ground where Māori and Pākehā can meet to resolve past issues, there are benefits there for us all but first we have the massive task of unifying our people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Iritana will be taken to Te Poho-o-Rawiri Marae in Gisbourne where she will lie until Thursday before being taken to Rahui Marae in Tikitiki.</p>
        
            <p>She will be laid to rest at Porourangi Tawhiwhirangi Urupa, alongside her late husband Porourangi Tawhiwhirangi and her two children Tangopahika (Boy) and Heni Whakamaungarangi.</p>
