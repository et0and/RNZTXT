            <p>Angela Blackmoore's murderers stole a young mother's bright future and the life of her unborn baby, the High Court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>David Hawken and Rebecca Wright-Meldrum today received life sentences for their roles in the almost 30-year-old slaying in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken, 51, received a non-parole period of 10 years, while Wright-Meldrum, 51, will also serve at least 10 years behind bars.</p>
        
            <p>Blackmoore was bludgeoned and stabbed 39 times in her Wainoni home while her two-year-old son slept in a nearby room on 17 August 1995.</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old was pregnant with her second child at the time of the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Her friends and family waited almost 25 years for answers, until Jeremy Powell confessed to the killing in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The cold case breakthrough led to Powell's life imprisonment a year later and police laying charges against Hawken and Wright-Meldrum.</p>
        
            <p>Powell was a key crown witness in the four-week trial late last year.</p>
        
            <p>Powell told the court Hawken ordered Blackmoore's murder and offered $10,000 to him and his then-girlfriend Wright-Meldrum to carry out the hit.</p>

            <p>Blackmoore's partner at the time of her murder, Laurie Anderson, told the High Court today that Hawken and Wright-Meldrum had robbed Blackmoore of her future, robbed him of the love of his life and robbed Blackmoore's young son of his mother.</p>
        
            <p>"I used to rub her tummy at night knowing we were making this beautiful baby," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were planning all the things we were going to do together as a family."</p>
        
            <p>Hawken's evil plans had destroyed the life Blackmoore had worked to build after turning her life around, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"If it wasn't for you, Angela would have been happy and getting on with her new life. If I could I would let you rot in jail for the rest of your life ... you are sheer evil."</p>
        
            <p>Their decision to keep their roles in Blackmoore's murder secret meant many of her loved ones, including her parents, had died without knowing the truth of her death, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I will always miss Angela. She's the love that will never leave me."</p>

            <p>Blackmoore's son, who was 2-years-old at the time of her murder, said his mother's death and the circumstances which led to it, had robbed him of a normal life.</p>
        
            <p>It was especially distressing knowing he had been robbed of the chance of being a brother to Blackmoore's unborn child.</p>
        
            <p>"Vengence for my fallen brother is best served by a life-long hell," his victim impact statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Blackmoore's cousin Jill Purvis asked Wright-Meldrum how she could betray the trust of a friend.</p>
        
            <p>"What made you think you had the right to take part in the murder of a young mum?" Purvis said.</p>
        
            <p>"How dare you betray a friend in such a cruel way.</p>
        
            <p>"Angie's life was worth more than any amount of money."</p>
        
            <p>Another cousin, Leanne Keen, said she had dedicated her life to bring those responsible for Blackmoore's murder to justice since she was a teenager.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disgusted by your lack of remorse and your attitudes while sitting in the dock, shaking your heads while evidence was being presented against you," she told the two murderers.</p>
        
            <p>"You are stealers of life."</p>

            <p>"Rot in hell the pair of you. The pain, anger and stress you have put us through has been hard to contend with. I really haven't got the words to describe it."</p>
        
            <p>Anderson's niece, Stacey Brosnan, said the pair had "destroyed so many lives and you just don't care".</p>
        
            <p>"Angela and baby may be gone, but she will never be forgotten," Brosnan said.</p>
        
            <p>"You may have taken her away, but you will never take the memories away."</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Powell told the jury in Hawken and Wright-Meldrum's trial that Hawken threatened to kill his family if he did not murder Blackmoore, and boasted about his numerous gang connections.</p>
        
            <p>Powell claimed he was reluctant to carry out the killing, but eventually succumbed to Hawken's threats.</p>
        
            <p>Powell explained that he killed Blackmoore several days later and felt panicked before, during and after her murder.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember hitting her two or three times with a bat, I remember the bat breaking," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said he hit her with a bat first because he wanted to knock her out "so that she wouldn't feel anything".</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't want to hurt her," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wright-Meldum, who was a friend of the Blackmoore's, was described by the prosecution as essential in securing access to the Wainoni property on the night of the murder.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken never paid him after the killing, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>It took the jury two days of deliberations to decide on Hawken and Wright-Meldrum's guilt.</p>
