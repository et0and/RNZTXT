        <h2>Live: Prime Minister talks to media from Papua New Guinea</h2>
        <p>
Christopher Luxon is in Papua New Guinea, stopping for fuel on the way to Japan.
</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon is in Papua New Guinea, on a brief stopover while the Air Force plane he is on with a business delegation gets refuelled.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was to meet this weekend with his Papua New Guinea counterpart, Prime Minister James Marape.</p>
        
            <p>In Japan, he will meet with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. More than 30 companies are represented on the trip, including Air New Zealand, ANZ, Fonterra, Silver Fern Farms, Zespri and Rocket Lab.</p>
        
            <p>"I know Japan well as a country, having visited there many, many times and I know the economic opportunities that exist there," he told RNZ ahead of leaving.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited for those companies and how they can present themselves and how New Zealand can present itself in an economic sense."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon was expected to speak to media sometime between 2.30pm and 3.30pm Sunday (NZ time) - watch it live in the player above.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon recently finished his first trip around the Pacific as prime minister.</p>
