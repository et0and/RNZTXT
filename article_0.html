            <p>Singer-songwriter Alastair Riddell of Space Waltz fame has revealed he has stage three metastatic prostate cancer.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ's Sunday Morning show, hosted by Jim Mora, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the band's 1974 number one hit 'Out on the Street', Riddell said this was the first time he was revealing his diagnosis in public.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't told many people this but I've had a real battle with cancer, Jim.</p>
        
            <p>"The last two or three years have been a bit tough, but I'm taking a fairly new drug which is doing a pretty good job.</p>
        
            <p>"I am looking at doing another album, I would really love to do another album, I've got lots of songs. I'm working away on that, just quietly and trying to enjoy my life as much as I can. Because I've spent a lot of time - I'm a musician in New Zealand, I've renovated houses - more houses than I should've - to greater or lesser success, and I've worked my bum off really, for not a great deal.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think when you get something like cancer, it does make you sort of straighten up and fly right or try to, because you don't know how long you've got really."</p>
        
            <p>Space Waltz was formed in 1974 by Riddell as a frontman, and it included artists who went on to become distinguished in their own bands; keyboardist Eddie Rayner of Split Enz, and guitarist Greg Clark and drummer Brent Eccles of Citizen Band.</p>
        
            <p>Riddell had twice declined to join Split Enz, upon which Neill Finn did.</p>
        
            <p>"Hindsight is 20/20, isn't it? I mean I probably should've joined.</p>
        
            <p>"They were in the UK at the time and Mike Chunn came back to New Zealand and I was ... watching Neil Finn give a concert.</p>
        
            <p>"And Mike just turned up ... he said come outside I want to talk to you ... he said we'd like you to come to the UK and join the band, and I was just in the throes of finishing my second album.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a mixture of things but I think the thing at the time I really felt I had a commitment to Glyn Tucker who had produced that record and put quite a lot of his own money into it, and of course if I'd gone to the UK I would've walked away from that project."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Space Waltz reunited for a second album, Victory, which featured new songs as well as re-recordings of selected tracks from their first album.</p>
