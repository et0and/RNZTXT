        <h2>Live updates: Ferry refloated after nearly 24 hours grounded</h2>
        <p>
The Aratere is back on the water, but will now be placed under a detention order barring it from service. Follow our live updates here.

            <p>The stranded Interislander ferry Aratere has been successfully refloated.</p>
        
            <p>The ship ran aground near Picton on Friday night after suffering a reported steering failure on a freight-only sailing.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured and there was no environmental damage, KiwiRail said.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough District Council said the refloat attempt commenced with the high tide around 9pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Two tug boats and the ferry's own propulsion were used to get it off the rocks.</p>
        
            <p>While the council had earlier said the refloat attempt could take "several hours", the ferry was free of the shore by 9.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>It had been towed to a safe anchorage point and would be re-ballasted and stabilised overnight.</p>
