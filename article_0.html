            <p>The government is installing Health NZ Te Whatu Ora's board chair Lester Levy as a commissioner, replacing the organisation's board.</p>
        
            <p>The board normally has seven members but this is down to two, after three members opted not to serve another term and two others resigned with more than a year remaining.</p>
        
            <p>Levy was recently appointed chair of the organisation, and will take over as Commissioner for 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti announced the move alongside Prime Minister Christopher Luxon at the weekly post-Cabinet media briefing on Monday, saying it was a response to "serious concerns around oversight, overspend and a significant deterioration in financial outlook".</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said Health NZ was heading towards a $1.4 billion deficit by the end of the financial year, initially reported to him in March.</p>
        
            <p>"In the months since, the situation has worsened. Health NZ is currently overspending at the rate of approximately $130 million a month," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Levy would be tasked with saving $1.4b, focusing on cost efficiencies including "any back-office bureaucracy which has blown out, particularly in middle management".</p>
        
            <p>He blamed the previous government, saying the "botched health reforms have created significant financial challenges at Health NZ".</p>
        
            <p>"The issues at Health NZ stem from the previous government's mismanaged health reforms, which resulted in an overly centralised operating model, limited oversight of financial and non-financial performance, and fragmented administrative data systems which were unable to identify risks until it was too late."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said he had previously appointed a Crown Observer, a new chair and a board member with financial expertise to tackle the financial problems at the organisation, and bringing in a Commissioner was the strongest ministerial intervention available under the Act.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not a decision he had taken lightly, "however the magnitude of the issue requires such action".</p>
        
            <p>"Lester Levy has assured me there will be no adverse impacts on the delivery of care in implementing a turnaround plan - rather, he and Health NZ will be seeking to bring the frontline closer to decision-making."</p>
