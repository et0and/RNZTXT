            <p>The body of British TV presenter and healthy living advocate Michael Mosley has been found on the Greek island of Symi, a deputy mayor on the island said on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley had been missing for several days.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a police spokeswoman said that the body of a person believed to be Mosley had been found in the area of Agia Marina on the island, but identification was pending.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley, 67, who endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>He had disappeared after setting out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi.</p>
        
            <p>Teams of police, firefighters and volunteers had been searching for him for five days, using drones, a sniffer dog and divers.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Mosley's wife, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley, had told the BBC that the days since her husband went missing had been "the longest and most unbearable".</p>
        
            <p>"Our family are so incredibly grateful to the people of Symi, the Greek authorities and the British Consulate who are working tirelessly to help find Michael," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not lose hope."</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Mosley had been searching the island, assisted by friends. The couple's four children had also travelled to Symi to help with the search.</p>
        
            <p>Greek police spokesman Constantina Dimoglidou earlier told the Daily Mail that Mosley may have tripped and fallen, or even been bitten by a snake.</p>
        
            <p>"There is just no trace of him. None whatsoever. And that means that for us at least, every potential scenario is open and being investigated."</p>
        
            <p>The terrain, which was described as very rugged, made search efforts difficult, officials told local media.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
