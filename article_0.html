        <h2>Watch live: 'The era of extreme price increases is over' - Willis</h2>
        <p>

            <p>The prime minister and finance minister are due to speak to media about 4pm. You can watch in the stream at the top of this story.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Finance Minister Nicola Willis are speaking to reporters after the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by 25 basis points.</p>
        
            <p>The first reduction in the cash rates in more than four years, it has led commercial banks to start cutting their interest rates almost immediately.</p>
        
            <p>However, it has not been received well by some economists, who criticised it as a significant shift from RBNZ's previous statements.</p>
        
            <p>Willis, in a written statement ahead of this afternoon's media conference, said the move would be welcome relief for families and businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has been suffering an acute cost-of-living crisis since the middle of 2021, with weekly food budgets stretched thin, mortgage repayments high and confidence in our living rooms, offices and boardrooms low," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased the Reserve Bank's decision to lower the OCR today shows it has confidence that inflation is under control and the era of extreme price increases is over."</p>
        
            <p>She said it would mean New Zealanders paying less interest on mortgages and credit cards, and signalled the hard conditions faced by businesses were easing - giving those businesses confidence to invest and hire again.</p>
        
            <p>She took some credit for the economic shift.</p>
        
            <p>"This government has delivered on its promise to Kiwis - our careful and deliberate plan to get on top of inflation is working, and we are seeing the green shoots of recovery."</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party, however, said the government's policies were driving poverty in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Co-leader Chl√∂e Swarbrick said the Reserve Bank's decision would be welcome news for some, "but won't help the approximate 23,000 more kids the government is pushing into poverty".</p>
        
            <p>"This government is actively pursuing policies shown to enhance hardship and grow poverty. They're making thousands unemployed while simultaneously cutting support for those without work and threatening them with sanctions. Benefit sanctions are a tried, tested and failed policy."</p>
        
            <p>She said the RBNZ's monetary policy approach was a blunt instrument, and fiscal policy - the government's choices on tax and spending - were what defined the winners and losers of the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"It beggars belief that of all the issues in front of us, this government has chosen to focus on making life harder for those struggling to get by. But of course, the prime minister didn't think to check the average beneficiary's income before pursuing the anti-evidence, punch-down policy."</p>
