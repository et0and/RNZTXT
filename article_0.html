            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is set to face questions as he visits an Auckland high school.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, Luxon drew the ire of local council leaders after his address at the Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) conference on Wednesday</p>
        
            <p>In his speech, the prime minister called for councils to rein in spending and focus on basics.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also faced a challenge at the annual Koroneihana celebrations for M훮ori King T큰heitia, held at T큰rangawaewae Marae, this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We've watched your government dismantle everything that is meaningful to M훮ori in this country," Tukoroirangi Morgan told Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Next week, Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters will travel to Tonga for the 53rd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' week.</p>
