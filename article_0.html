            <p>Two people have been seriously injured after a car collided with a freight train in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the crash about 4.30am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said a vehicle collided with one of its freight trains on Peachgrove Road.</p>
        
            <p>It's been reported that there have been deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Two people have been taken to Waikato hospital in a serious condition, St John said.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who lives near the scene of the crash said she heard a long drawn out sound early this morning but didn't realise what it was.</p>
        
            <p>The resident, who did not want to be named, said the crossing had barrier arms and bells and she can't understand how the crash happened.</p>
        
            <p>She was unsure if the crossing bells sound at night because of surrounding houses. The woman said the crossing and 50kmh road was usually safe and she felt for the train driver.</p>

            <p>"It's just really a terrible tragedy and really awful for the train driver."</p>
        
            <p>The train was travelling from Mount Maunganui to Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said the level crossing where the train and car collided was protected with lights and barrier arms.</p>
        
            <p>Its manager of freight and rolling stock operations Paul Ashton said the driver of the train would be given leave, and all staff would be offered support and counselling.</p>
        
            <p>The bells, lights and barrier arms at the level crossing were all working, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The track is closed between Ruakura and Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier Peachgrove Road was closed and motorists were advised to take an alternative route.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit has been notified.</p>
