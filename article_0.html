            <p>Three children narrowly missed being seriously injured when a car in Upper Hutt hit the adults they were with just before 1.45 this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>An Upper Hutt hairdresser said she ran outside to help.</p>
        
            <p>Wendi Isaac said it was harrowing.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard the bang and I turned to look and ... at the time I looked, all the debris was still in the air, just dropping, the car had come around here.</p>
        
            <p>"And the children, luckily ... the little kids instinctively crouched down and just ran."</p>
        
            <p>Four people have been taken to hospital, one in a serious condition, after a blue car hit a silver vehicle on Fergusson Drive in Trentham.</p>
        
            <p>The silver car crashed into a garden and hit a house.</p>
        
            <p>The other vehicle mounted the curb narrowly hitting two children, but struck the two adults they were with.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told RNZ there were a lot of people at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"My wife and I went out just to have a look and that's when we saw the one car was pushed in right up to the windscreen."</p>
        
            <p>Another witness said they believed one of the drivers suffered a medical event.</p>
        
            <p>Two patients have been taken to Hutt Hospital, one in a serious condition and one with mild injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Two others are in Wellington Hospital with mild injuries and a fifth person was treated at the scene.</p>
