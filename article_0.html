            <p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters is expected, later today, to call on all parties involved in the Gaza conflict - including countries with influence in the region - to "take urgent steps towards establishing a ceasefire".</p>
        
            <p>Parliament's agenda for this afternoon states that Peters will ask Parliament to express grave concern at the ongoing violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
        
            <p>He will also "unequivocally condemn" the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October and call for the release of all hostages.</p>
        
            <p>Peters will also move that Parliament recognises Israel's right to defend itself acting in accordance with international law and that all civilians be protected from armed conflict.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
