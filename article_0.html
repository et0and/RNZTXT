        <h2>Watch live: Harris and Trump clash in first debate</h2>
        <p>
It may be the only time the pair face off ahead of the US presidential election, and could turn out to be enormously consequential. Video
</p>
        
            <p>Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are facing off in their first televised debate of the US presidential campaign this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The debate - at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, which will not have a live audience - is due to start at 1pm NZT (9pm local time).</p>
        
            <p>For Harris, the square-off in Philadelphia is an opportunity to lay out her priorities and show her mettle against a rival who has belittled her intelligence and subjected her to racist and sexist attacks. Trump will get a chance to try and blunt some of Harris' momentum in a race that has tightened considerably since she became the Democratic nominee in July.</p>
        
            <p>Most opinion polls show Harris to be slightly ahead nationally and in the majority of battleground states, but Trump remains well within striking distance to win the 5 November election.</p>
        
            <p>Debates can be enormously consequential, and this could be their only one.</p>
