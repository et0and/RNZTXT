            <p>A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the border of Tibet and Nepal on Tuesday morning, the China Earthquake Networks Centre said, killing people, damaging buildings and sending people running to the streets in Tibet, Nepal and India.</p>
        
            <p>At least nine people died and "many buildings" had collapsed, Chinese state media reported.</p>
        
            <p>The quake was centred close to the city of Shigatse, one of Tibet's holiest cities, in Dingri county, and struck at 9:05 am (0105 GMT) on Tuesday, according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The US Geological Survey reported the quake as magnitude 7.1.</p>
        
            <p>The quake at 9.05am local time, had an epicentre depth of 10km, the report added, revising the magnitude from an earlier 6.9.</p>
        
            <p>"Dingri county and its surrounding areas experienced very strong tremors, and many buildings near the epicentre have collapsed," state broadcaster CCTV said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reporter learned that nine people have been confirmed dead so far," adding that as of 10 am local time, "multiple aftershocks" had been recorded.</p>
        
            <p>Xinhua news agency said that "local authorities are reaching out to various townships in the county to assess the impact of the quake".</p>
        
            <p>Shigatse is the seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism, whose spiritual authority is second only to the Dalai Lama. Dingri county is on the side of Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video showing the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters was able to confirm the location from nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery.</p>
        
            <p>Local government officials were liaising with nearby towns to gauge the impact of the quake and check for casualties, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
        
            <p>A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.</p>
        
            <p>There are six villages within 5 km of the epicentre, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said, without giving any further details.</p>
        
            <p>Tremors were felt as far away as Nepal's capital Kathmandu some 400 km away, where residents ran from their houses.</p>
        
            <p>An AFP reporter said in Nepal, powerful tremors shook buildings in the capital Kathmandu just before dawn on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The US Geological Survey's earthquakes map showed one large earthquake (at UTC 1.05) for the Himalayas region, affecting both Nepal and Tibet. It measured it at 7.1, with the epicentre 93 km from Lobuche in Nepal, along the mountainous border with Tibet in China.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's map also showed a series of strong aftershocks in the same area since the 7.1 quake, in magnitudes of low 5's or high 4's.</p>
        
            <p>Officials in Kathmandu said they were checking for damage.</p>
        
            <p>Areas around Lobuche in Nepal, in the high mountains near Mount Everest, were also rattled by the tremors and aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>"It shook quite strongly here, everyone is awake, but we don't know about any damages yet," said government official Jagat Prasad Bhusal in Nepal's Namche region, which lies nearer to Everest than Kathmandu.</p>
        
            <p>Shaking was also felt in Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and in the northern Indian state of Bihar (bordering Nepal), where people also rushed from their homes as their walls shook.</p>
        
            <p>So far, no reports of any damage or loss to property had been received, officials in India said.</p>
        
            <p>"We felt a very strong earthquake. So far we have not received any report of injuries or physical loss," said Anoj Raj Ghimire, chief district officer of Solukhumbu district in Nepal, at the foot of Mount Everest.</p>
        
            <p>"We have mobilised police and other security forces, as well as locals to collect information about the damage," he added.</p>
        
            <p>Nepal lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, nearly 9000 people died and more than 22,000 were injured when a 7.8-magnitude quake struck Nepal, destroying more than half a million homes.</p>
        
            <p>Southwestern parts of China are also frequently hit by earthquakes. A huge quake in Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, there have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 km of the Shigatse quake in the past five years, all of which were smaller than the one that struck on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in neighbouring Nepal, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in that country's worst earthquake.</p>
