            <p>A second young person is on the run from the government's trial boot camp, after one vanished while at the funeral of another participant, Oranga Tamariki senior executives have told a parliamentary committee.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday it was reported that one of the young men taking part in the boot camp pilot was on the run after attending the funeral of another who had died.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki deputy chief executive of youth justice services and residential care Tusha Penny told a parliamentary select committee on Friday morning that two participants were actually on the run.</p>
        
            <p>One escaped from the tangi and another a day later, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Penny acknowledged the death of one of the boot camp's participants and their whānau.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki and Waikato police both confirmed the 15-year-old, who was granted bail on compassionate grounds to attend the funeral by the Youth Court, had absconded.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato police said he was wanted to arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported it understood the young man who died was the fatality in a crash on State Highway 1 near Tīrau on Wednesday last week between three vehicles, including a tourist bus, which injured 14 others.</p>
