            <p>TVNZ has told staff it will make an announcement about the future of news at the broadcaster tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>They have been told to watch their inboxes.</p>
        
            <p>Broadcasting Minister Melissa Lee told Checkpoint she had a conversation with TVNZ on Friday after the company announced cuts would be needed.</p>
        
            <p>But said it was up to TVNZ to announce any redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had conversations with TVNZ on various different things including the conversation about how Warner Bros has in fact approached them, but like I said, these are conversations that TVNZ have had with Warner Bros, these are issues TVNZ board and leadership is facing, it is not for me to actually announce for them."</p>
        
            <p>When asked if TVNZ should consider cutting back its news to 30 minutes and get rid off its current affairs programmes, lee said it did not matter what she thought about how news was produced and shown.</p>
        
            <p>The decisions were for broadcasters and news entities.</p>
        
            <p>"I think news entities need to realise people are consuming news in a very different way."</p>
        
            <p>Lee said audiences no longer wanted to sit down and watch news for an hour every night.</p>
        
            <p>Companies needed to analyse how it best reached audiences.</p>
        
            <p>She said advertising dollar had also dropped "tremendously" and organisations needed to work out how they would entice advertisers to a advertise on its platforms.</p>
