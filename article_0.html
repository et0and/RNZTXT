            <p>House prices are likely to stay flat through this year but increase 7 percent over 2025, BNZ says.</p>
        
            <p>In an update on Tuesday, chief economist Mike Jones said demand and housing activity would pick up from here as interest rates fell.</p>
        
            <p>But at first, that demand would just soak up some of the increased number of houses for sale and avoid further price falls.</p>
        
            <p>Real Estate Institute data shows there were almost a third more properties listed for sale in July than the same time a year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones said towards the end of the year, there would be a "modest upswing" in prices.</p>
        
            <p>Although the labour market might deteriorate for another year or so, he said, sharp falls in mortgage rates would probably boost the housing market as other economic activity improved.</p>
        
            <p>"Anecdotal evidence points to a lift in prospective buyer inquiry and confidence. No doubt some of this reflects borrowing capacity estimates getting a small uplift and people being able to draw a line under prior concerns that interest rates may yet go higher."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the switch from flat house prices to 7 percent per year growth might seem like a leap. "But the context is that by the end of this year we think we will have had two years of basically flat house prices. All we're really talking about is a return to some sort of average, which tends to be 6 or 7 percent [per year] over the long run. You're not getting house prices back to anywhere near the peaks we saw almost three years ago. The context is still one of a slow and low sort of housing market."</p>
        
            <p>He said affordability had improved a little in recent years as prices fell, household incomes increased and now interest rates were dropping.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would normally take about six months for changes in mortgage rates to feed through to house prices.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ expects floating home loan rates to be in the 6 percent range by mid next year, from about 8 percent now.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the wholesale market had already factored in an official cash rate of about 3 percent by the end of next year.</p>
        
            <p>That meant it was reasonable to assume that declines in retail interest rates would not be as rapid in future as the falls experienced over the past month-and-a-half, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Shorter-dated mortgage rates - floating out to 18 months - which, by their nature incorporate less of the expected easing cycle, have more room to fall than longer-term mortgage rates.</p>
        
            <p>"These considerations are important inputs into our broad interest rate view. Altogether it implies, at a high-level, a two-year fixed mortgage rate closer to 5 percent by mid-2025 with a five-year fixed rate a little higher than that around 5.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"If correct, this would amount to a steepening of the mortgage curve and a return to the 'normal' situation of an upward-sloping curve - longer-term rates sitting above shorter-term rates."</p>
