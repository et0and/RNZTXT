            <p>Hokitika is shaping up as one of the best places to be for fine weather on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>A frontal system passing over the country is causing a low to hit the East Coast of the North Island, bringing heavy rain and hail, with thunderstorm watches in place until later on Monday night, MetService meterologist Alec Holden said.</p>
        
            <p>He warned the unsettled weather will continue over much of country on Tuesday, with parts of the North and South Island likely to get off to a soggy start.</p>
        
            <p>While rain is anticipated to ease off, with sunshine breaking through later in the day in the upper North Island, Holden said strong winds were expected in places like Auckland and Norsewood and advised people to ensure anything that could fly away are well secured.</p>
        
            <p>He said the West Coast has a better chance for sunny and still conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Hokitika I would probably say is the place to be tomorrow - it's pretty much fine all day, winds are not particularly strong, and a clear evening for watching fireworks."</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown was Holden's other pick, which he said will be clear and still for the big night.</p>
        
            <p>But Holden said it could be a soggy night for the country's largest New Year's Eve festival, just outside of Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines festival goers arrived to the three-day event amongst warnings to avoid beaches and waterways after Boxing Day's severe rain overwhelmed the city's wastewater system, while weather conditions caused strong rips and large waves.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm watches remain in place on Monday, with more rain on the way.</p>
        
            <p>Holden said the rain is expected to ease later in the evening on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>"It does thankfully dry up a bit heading towards midnight tomorrow, but it's still pretty soggy at that point, and not particularly an appealing place to be."</p>
        
            <p>A SwimSafe warning is still in place for Waikanae Beach due to dangerous conditions, while Gisborne District Council is warning against swimming, fishing or shellfish gathering at Turanganui River and Waikanae Beach due to sewage pollution for at least five days after the sewage outfall valves are closed and warning signs are removed.</p>
        
            <p>Holden said there was a possibility the severe rain watch in place for Wairoa could be upgraded to a severe rain warning depending on how the forecast thunderstorms play out in the district.</p>
        
            <p>He said the erratic weather is not entirely unexpected, with summer often providing extremes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a double edged sword at the best of the times, sometimes you get a big high pressure system, with lovely settled weather and clear skies, otherwise you just get these awful energetic systems that are drinking all the summertime heat and getting more severe."</p>
