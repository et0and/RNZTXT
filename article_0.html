            <p>The Greens are demanding the prime minister step in over Winston Peters' statements, saying they have led to "immense" numbers of death threats against Green MP Benjamin Doyle.</p>
        
            <p>Peters in social media posts said questions needed be asked about Doyle's social media accounts and pictures, symbols and language included.</p>
        
            <p>Doyle had posted a series of messages and images on the private account before they were an MP, including an image of their child.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party co-leader Chloe Swarbrick said a term Benjamin Doyle used had been co-opted by rainbow communities for use with irreverence and absurdity.</p>
        
            <p>She said the party had been screening "immense numbers" of death threats after Peters' comments.</p>
