            <p>The vice presidential candidates in the US election are set for their first and only debate before the November election.</p>
        
            <p>Republican JD Vance, a US Senator from Ohio, will face off against Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a debate in New York City hosted by CBS News.</p>
        
            <p>The race between former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris remains close a little over a month before the 5 November (US Time) election.</p>
        
            <p>While vice presidential debates have historically rarely moved the needle much in past elections, there's always the chance for a big surprise or gaffe that US political tragics will be talking about for the next several news cycles.</p>
        
            <p>And with no other debate scheduled between Trump and Harris after their first one last month, this might be one of the last chances to shape the race as absentee voting has already begun in many states.</p>
