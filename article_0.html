            <p>New Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will is taking questions from the media with Erica Stanford, the new Minister of Education.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are fronting at Manurewa Intermediate School in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon says the decile 1 school does an incredible job, does an incredible job on attendance, led by an inspiring principal and "this is a school where an hour of maths, and hour of reading and an hour of writing is done, just where the basics are taught brilliantly each and every day".</p>
        
            <p>It's his first school visit as prime minister, and he says he's inspired each and every time he returns there.</p>

            <p>Luxon says they are going to ban phones in schools.</p>
        
            <p>He says all ministers and National's MPs are required to hand over their phones for both caucus and Cabinet meetings.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to ban phones across New Zealand in schools as well, and that's very simply that you see good schools like this that have already taken that decision, and it's been a long-standing practice getting great educational outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>He says the government will "work with councils in a different way", saying all three parties want to ensure the regions are all being invested in, and refers to the city and regional deals they plan to enter into.</p>
        
            <p>"That actually means we have to enter into different arrangements, whether it be between how we actually agree who's going to fund it between central and local government, but then we lock up a 10-year programme essentially of infrastructure that actually will make a difference to people's daily lives."</p>
        
            <p>He says they've only been sworn in just this week, and Simeon Brown will be having a big series of meetings - including meeting with Auckland's mayor Wayne Brown today.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of the councils have actually been talking with us and have been preparing for our government and actually been thinking deeply about what partnership they want to have with central government and we want to pick those conversations up with them."</p>
        
            <p>He says the reality is Labour's legacy is high, embedded inflation.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen that in recent announcements even from the Reserve Bank governor in the last day or so ... we know that has been a burden for councils as well.</p>
        
            <p>"You've seen us come together, within three days put together a 100-day plan to do one of the things we have to do which is tackle the underlying causes of inflation ... that's actually how we get the economy working and that's how we make it easier for councils ultimately as well."</p>

            <p>Stanford says with the recent introduction of the literacy and numeracy standards, only about half of young people aged about 15 are able to pass, "which means they are not able to go on and live the life that they want with those basic standards that they need".</p>
        
            <p>She says what's needed is a clear curriculum that's knowledge-based, with the right pedagogy "in terms of structured literacy, structured mathematics".</p>
        
            <p>"And then we also need to make sure we're regularly assessing our children along the way to make sure that we're making progress, so those three core ingredients will make up the core part ... of ensuring our kids are at curriculum."</p>
        
            <p>She says the national standards were quite different from what's proposed.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't perfect, and we learned from the mistakes, and I think one of the core things is to make sure we are measuring progress: it's not a line in the sand 'do you meet this standard' but are you making the progress to get you where you need to be. And in some cases that will be accelerated learning."</p>
        
            <p>The presser follows a rough first week for the new coalition government, overshadowed by the behaviour of Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, condemnation of its ditching of smokefree efforts, a surprise tax windfall for landlords despite planned cost-cutting and accusations it has kowtowed to conspiracy theorists.</p>
