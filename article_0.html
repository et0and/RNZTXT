            <p>Wellington Water board chair Nick Leggett says he is "taking soundings" on whether he should resign after a scathing report revealed possible theft and problems at his organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"I could be the sacrificial lamb," he told Morning Report on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He could also help with the fix, he told the programme.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the leadership, and improving things, is where we need to be heading with this."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an urgent meeting has been called in the wake of a damning report into Wellington Water.</p>
        
            <p>The report - released on Monday - found structural problems and theft at the agency, and said the capital's ratepayers were paying nearly three times more for water repairs than in other parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second report to show poor control of contractors and finances.</p>
        
            <p>The water Advisory Oversight Group, chaired by former Wellington mayor Dame Kerry Prendergast, is scheduled to meet this morning at 7.30am to discuss the report.</p>

            <p>It was established under the government's Local Water Done Well initiative to set up a new organisation to oversee water services in the region.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister yesterday described Wellington Water as "a total basket case" without proper governance or proper management.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon wanted to see the water assets professionally managed under a Local Water Done Well model.</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins said Wellington Water needed to urgently change the way it operated.</p>
        
            <p>He said Wellington Water's problems were the result of the government scrapping reforms already underway when it came to power.</p>
