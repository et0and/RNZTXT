            <p>As Team New Zealand lifted the Auld Mug to celebrate their America's Cup, crowds of onlookers have celebrated alongside them, after a day of thrilling racing.</p>
        
            <p>Barcelona, which is playing host to the Louis Vuitton 37th America's Cup, has been inundated with sailing fans for the series.</p>

            <p>The teams have been based at Port Vell - their departure point for this race, where crowds watched in the scorching sun, as well as from several spectator areas on the waterfront set up to view the action.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said before the final race against Ineos Britannia had even begun today, "the Barcelona waterfront was treated to the spectacle of a record-breaking 350 Patí Catala catamarans on the racecourse".</p>

            <p>It is the first time Spain has hosted the event since 2010, and Barcelona City Council (Ajuntament de Barcelona) has run a Cultural Regatta alongside the racing, and estimated there had already been 1.6 million visitors connected to the Cup events by early October - though there have been disputes over their figures.</p>

            <p>After delays to the start for the wind to pick up, the right conditions aligned, and the race got underway.</p>
        
            <p>"In a shifting breeze of 7-11 knots on flat water, [both teams] entered on starboard, before gybing immediately onto the Kiwi line to trail them out to the far-right boundary of the box - and the race was on," organisers said.</p>

            <p>Once they were off, the British boat reached the starting line a knot faster than the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>The two boats then each jostled for turns in the front position running up to the first marker on the course, before Team New Zealand swung into the top spot and held it, battling on to hold their place and extend the lead.</p>

            <p>Onlookers were on the edge of their seats for the thrilling finish as Team New Zealand, onboard the Taihoro, "flew" down the final line of the course with textbook execution, before gybing across the finish line 37 seconds ahead of their rival.</p>
        
            <p>"The finishing delta was recorded at 37 seconds, and as Ineos Britannia crossed the line, they were quick to round up and applaud the victorious Emirates Team New Zealand crew, who were almost immediately surrounded by an armada of spectator boats and supporters."</p>

            <p>After stowing their sails, the Kiwis ran up the New Zealand flag, along with another banner - thanking the host city, with the words: 'Moltes Gràcies Barcelona', Catalan for 'Many Thanks, Barcelona'.</p>
        
            <p>Bernard Arnault, head of the race sponsors Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, boarded Taihoro along with the customary bottles of champagne, which Team New Zealand broke out in clouds of bubbles.</p>

            <p>Surrounded by spectator boats, both racing yachts were towed back to the dock.</p>
        
            <p>At Port Vell, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei welcomed the victors, while hundreds of fans scrambled to catch sight of them arriving. And "The sense of elation around the dockside was palpable," organisers said.</p>
        
            <p>Dockside, Team New Zealand Skipper Peter Burling said he was struggling to take the victory in.</p>

            <p>"It's a pretty surreal feeling, it's still definitely sinking in. In the America's Cup you're all ready for a long battle, but to be able to get it done today in just beautiful sailing conditions with a little bit of shift in it and just so many people cheering us on, was amazing."</p>
        
            <p>The Britannia team had been "amazing challengers", and pushed Team NZ all the way, Burling said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. The America's Cup has got to be one of the hardest sporting trophies in the world to win. You've got to have so many parts come together to make it all work and now having done that three times in a row, it's incredibly special."</p>
        
            <p>"The boat was feeling awesome today and it was a real team effort."</p>

            <p>On the British side, Skipper Sir Ben Ainslie reflected on their campaign: "Mixed emotions of course, first of all I've got to say credit to Emirates Team New Zealand, an amazing achievement for that organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"For our team to get into the America's Cup itself was a huge achievement ... Ultimately to fall short at the final hurdle is always tough, but we know that we've been up against one of the best if not 'the' best teams in the history of the Cup. We have to take that on the chin, and I think that the team have done a brilliant job to develop through this campaign, through this series ..."</p>

            <p>As the day turned to evening in Barcelona the ceremonies continued, and the official presentation of the Cup was made.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand "accepted the trophy with class and grace officially at the main stage of the Race Village", cup organisers said:</p>
        
            <p>"One of the finest sports teams in the world, Emirates Team New Zealand have consistently set the bar high. Here in Barcelona, they just pushed it even higher with their historic third consecutive victory in the Louis Vuitton 37th America's Cup - a remarkable achievement by a truly remarkable team."</p>

            <p>According to America's Cup traditions, the first steps toward the next cup begin immediately after the last - with a challenge issued to the victors once the winning boat crosses the finish line of the last race.</p>
        
            <p>This challenge will help decide the next stage toward the 38th America's Cup, and details will be announced in "due course," Team New Zealand chief executive Grant Dalton said.</p>
