        <h2>Watch live: Hipkins delivers state of nation speech</h2>
        <p>
The Labour leader has been hitting back at some of the coalition government's moves recently.
</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins is speaking about the state of the nation.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, he accused National of creating a fiscal hole, adding New Zealand could not afford tax cuts and must borrow more money to bring infrastructure up to scratch.</p>
        
            <p>Labour also conceded it could have done more to deal with disruptive state housing tenants while in government, but said the current coalition was going too far with its directive to KƒÅinga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>Ministers on Monday demanded the housing agency take a tougher line on tenancies, evict the worst offenders and chase down overdue rent.</p>
