        <h2>NZ joining AUKUS could erode China's trust, ambassador warns</h2>
        <p>
Asked about the consequences for NZ-China relations, Wang Xiaolong said: "Trust is one of the most fragile commodities. It may take years to build up; it just might take seconds to be destroyed."
</p>
        
            <p>A decision by New Zealand to join AUKUS would 'inevitably" have negative consequences for the country's relationship with China, Chinese ambassador Wang Xiaolong says.</p>
        
            <p>In a wide-ranging interview on 30' With Guyon Espiner, Dr Wang expressed significant concerns about the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>"AUKUS entails the transfer of weapons-grade nuclear materials from a nuclear weapon state to a non-nuclear weapon state for the first time in history," Dr. Wang said. "If that is allowed to happen, it will raise serious questions about the integrity of the [nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty regime."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has been invited to join 'Pillar Two' of the initiative, focusing on non-nuclear military technology-sharing.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond nuclear concerns, Wang called AUKUS the product of a "zero-sum Cold War mentality".</p>
        
            <p>The pact would "lead almost inevitably to greater divisiveness, confrontation, or even conflict and war", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether New Zealand will want to relate to AUKUS is a call to be made by New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope that when weighing up this all-important decision, New Zealand will take into account its own long-term best interests, the potential implications for regional security, and the impact on the relationship between China and New Zealand."</p>

            <p>When asked about the potential economic consequences if New Zealand joined Pillar Two, Dr Wang said: "Inevitably, that will have a negative impact on the relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"Trust ... is one of the most precious but also one of the most fragile commodities. It may take years to build up; it just might take seconds to be destroyed."</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing happens in a vacuum, and nothing can be taken for granted," Wang said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would advise against anything that threatens to erode that very important trust between us."</p>
        
            <p>His remarks follow comments from Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who said earlier this month that any potential response from China, should New Zealand sign up to AUKUS, was "not a consideration for us".</p>
        
            <p>"Whether New Zealand gets involved or not is a conversation we continue to explore and get into," Luxon said then.</p>
        
            <p>But Wang's comments reflect the delicate balancing act New Zealand faces as it seeks to maintain its longstanding trade partnership with China while navigating an increasingly fraught geopolitical environment.</p>

            <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Dr Wang rejected accusations that China sought to control or monitor Chinese expatriates in New Zealand or to undermine New Zealand's democracy.</p>
        
            <p>"We never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. These claims are baseless and false," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said other countries - not China - were guilty of interference.</p>
        
            <p>"When it comes to foreign interference, we know who the king interferer is.</p>
        
            <p>"They launch disinformation warfare, carry out comprehensive surveillance operations, and instigate chaos or even revolutions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pressed to name the country he was talking about, Dr. Wang deflected, saying, "You know as well as I do."</p>
        
            <p>He said allegations of political interference had led to unfair targeting of New Zealand's Chinese community.</p>
        
            <p>"Most [Chinese expatriates] came to New Zealand because they think it's an open, inclusive, and welcoming society. But now, there's nervousness and fear. They're worried things are taking a disappointing turn."</p>

            <p>Dr Wang also addressed the implications of Donald Trump returning to the US presidency next year for global trade.</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever America elects as its president is a choice, obviously, for the American people, and we respect that choice," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Beijing wished to maintain a "mutually respectful, peacefully coexisting, and cooperative" relationship with the US.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about Trump's campaign rhetoric regarding significant tariffs - potentially as high as 60 percent - on Chinese imports, Wang acknowledged the economic challenges such measures could pose but said China was committed to continued dialogue.</p>
        
            <p>Bilateral trade had been "mutually beneficial" over the last 40 years but China would take "resolute and determined measures" to protect its interests if necessary, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He attributed the country's economic growth to its openness and integration with global markets and acknowledged the irony of a socialist Chinese economy championing free trade while a historically capitalist United States leaned toward protectionism: "It's a reversal of roles, in a way."</p>
        
            <p>During the interview, Dr Wang referred to China's defence spending as being about 3 percent of the country's GDP.</p>
        
            <p>Following the interview the Chinese Embassy contacted RNZ to say this was "a slip of the tongue" and the figure was less than 2 percent.</p>
