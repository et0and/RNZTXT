            <p>Support for National has increased since the Budget, according to the latest 1News Verian poll.</p>
        
            <p>The poll has National up 2 points to 38 pe cent, ACT steady on 7 percent and New Zealand First up 2 points to 6 percent - over the 5 percent threshold.</p>
        
            <p>The results would see the coalition government retain its hold on power.</p>
        
            <p>On the left, Labour is down 1 point to 29 percent, the Greens down 1 point to 13 percent and Te PƒÅti Maori down 1 point to 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The poll surveyed 1002 eligible voters by mobile phone and online and was weighted for demographics, with a margin of error of 3.1 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval. It was conducted between 15 and 19 June.</p>
        
            <p>Polls compare to the most recent poll by the same polling company, as different polls can use different methodologies. They are intended to track trends in voting preferences, showing a snapshot in time, rather than be a completely accurate predictor of the final election result.</p>
