        <h2>'Long, long way to go' to reduce crime - Luxon announces 500 new police assignments</h2>
        <p>
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon spoke to media after police revealed where the additional 500 officers the government has promised to recruit and retain will be assigned.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon spoke to media in Wellington after police revealed where the additional 500 officers the government has promised to recruit and retain will be assigned.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Luxon said staffing attrition rates were coming down.</p>
        
            <p>The government's goal was to have 500 more staff recruited in the next five years and it was great to see some of them already deployed in key areas, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He faced questions from reporters about that figure, saying it was a "net gain" and there was still "a lot of work to do".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said 160 officers would be put into community beat teams, and another 77 would be added to the National Gang Unit and frontline gang disruption units.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining 263 roles will be in public safety teams, youth policing, and filling vacancies in districts.</p>
        
            <p>Police were allocated $191 million over four years in Budget 2024 to recruit and retain the extra officers, plus $34.6 million to equip them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are putting these additional officers where the need is greatest," Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having more officers on the beat is important for deterring crime and increasing feelings of public safety.</p>
        
            <p>"We have already seen great success from our Community Beat Teams and are looking to continue that momentum across the country."</p>
        
            <p>The deployment of additional staff to the gang units would be concentrated in areas with the highest gang activity, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The National Gang Unit would support districts to plan and coordinate operations, share intelligence and good practice.</p>
        
            <p>The Gang Disruption Units would be focused on enforcement - in particular once the new gangs legislation came into effect, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Applications to join the NZ Police were trending up, with 1371 in July 2024 - the highest numbers of applications for any month since the national database was created in 2014.</p>

            <p>Minister of Police Mark Mitchell said he was "thrilled" with the extra staffing.</p>
        
            <p>"We've already seen the positive impact of having a higher police visibility in our CBDs. Our beat officers engage with the public and retailers, and their presence discourages crime - it's exactly what Kiwis want to see.</p>
        
            <p>"Extending community beat teams into towns and regional centres will mean a more reassuring and responsive policing presence for the general public and retailers across the whole country," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>The government wanted to make sure police had "every tool possible" to do their job, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Police Mark Mitchell said police were used to dealing with gangs, and the new legislation would target those who flouted the law.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions about how and when that would be enforced, Luxon said the law was currently going through the House, then there would be a period of engagement with communities from late November, then it would be implemented.</p>
        
            <p>Staff would be trained in how to understand the laws and enforce them, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions about lowering crime rates, there was still "a long, long way to go", Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the government had set targets on the recruitment of additional police officers, but where there would be deployed was ultimately an operational decision for NZ Police.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the Firearms Registry, Luxon said they had committed to review it to ensure it was being used in the right way and functioning effectively.</p>
        
            <p>In response to a question about the GDP falling 0.2 percent, Luxon said it was a "very tough time economically for New Zealand", and many businesses were "hanging in there".</p>
        
            <p>The government had predicted a lot of "pain and suffering" when they were first elected, he added.</p>
        
            <p>Relief would come with lower interest rates and that was when people would see the economy grow, Luxon said.</p>
