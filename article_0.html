        <h2>Live updates: Trump suggests Zelensky doesn't want to make peace with Putin</h2>
        <p>
"He doesn't have to stand there and say about Putin this, Putin that - all negative things."
</p>
        
            <p>A meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky devolved into a shouting match at the Oval Office, with the US president berating Ukraine's leader and Vice President JD Vance questioning whether Zelensky had demonstrated enough gratitude for US support.</p>
        
            <p>Democratic House of Representatives leader Hakeem Jeffries has condemned President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</p>
        
            <p>He said the meeting was appalling and had embarrassed America on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>Before the blow-up, Trump said he and Zelensky would be signing a natural resources agreement.</p>
        
            <p>However, a source told CNN that did not happen.</p>
        
            <p>Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social and said Ukraine's president was "not ready for Peace if America is involved".</p>
        
            <p>"I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace," Trump wrote said.</p>
        
            <p>White House officials confirmed the Ukraine leader had left the White House early and a scheduled news conference was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Zelensky is also due to meet with US politicians later on Saturday, but it is unclear if those meetings will take place.</p>
