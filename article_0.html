            <p>Emergency services are at a derelict central Wellington hotel, with reports people have been injured.</p>
        
            <p>A number of police cars, ambulances and fire vehicles are outside the Amora Hotel on Wakefield Street.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reports "multiple people" have been injured due to "structural issues".</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it was there to assist the ambulance service.</p>
        
            <p>The 192-room hotel shut in 2017 for extensive refurbishment after the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>It has been boarded up since.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Free Ambulance says it is an "active scene" and will get more information shortly.</p>
