        <h2>West Coast ratepayers have direct debits charged twice</h2>
        <p>
A West Coast Regional Council rates mess has reared its head again with the council admitting an "administration error" caused some ratepayers to be charged twice through direct debit.

            <p>A West Coast Regional Council rates mess has reared its head again with the council admitting an "administration error" caused some ratepayers to be charged twice through direct debit.</p>
        
            <p>Council's Risk and Audit Committee chair Frank Dooley said front line staff had been wearing the outcome of a poor system, which reflected years of under investment because of a fear of "putting the rates up".</p>
        
            <p>The latest blunder came after council overcharged some West Coast ratepayers last year, forcing officials to reissue invoices in December.</p>
        
            <p>Invoices for 2023-24, from 12 December, should show exactly what people owed for their second instalment, Dooley said.</p>
        
            <p>Ratepayers had been contacting Local Democracy Reporting and posting to social media after their rates direct debits were double dipped - and sometimes for variable amounts.</p>
        
            <p>"Incomprehensible" invoices, some with charges dated as 2022-23 instead of 2023-24, had also been pointed out.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Darryl Lew said the direct debit mistake reflected ongoing issues with the council's rates accounting system.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the administration error that resulted in duplicate payments. Those individuals affected have been reimbursed within 24 hours," he said.</p>

            <p>Council had also responded "to a small number" of ratepayers concerned at their accounts, and having "difficulty understanding the invoices".</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate this is a complex matter for many ratepayers and rates direct debits are calculated on an individual basis, taking into consideration many factors including rating district levies and the ratepayer's current account balances."</p>
        
            <p>Lew said the direct debits had been recalculated to reflect the difference between the previous rates payments and the new calculation for the rating period.</p>
        
            <p>"Those affected ratepayers will be notified in due course," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In the first problem to arise, as the 2023-24 invoices arrived, ratepayers in special rating districts like Greymouth and at Hari Hari were shocked to find huge rates increases of up to 300 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The final due date was 20 January, after two previous payment extensions.</p>
        
            <p>However, ratepayers were encouraged late last year to still pay their first incorrect instalment, with the assurance this would be balanced out with the second instalment.</p>
        
            <p>Lew was also asked why the refreshed 2023-24 rates invoices sent out on 12 December still had 2022-23 quoted at the bottom.</p>
        
            <p>Cr Dooley, an accountant, said the new invoices sent out should have said 2023-24.</p>
        
            <p>The invoice system problem reflected wider issues affecting council administration due to under investment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cr Dooley said they are awaiting a final report from Price Waterhouse Cooper, commissioned by council late last year, to investigate the rates system.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to improve that system, but without seeing the PWC report, I can't make further comment."</p>
        
            <p>Council rates staff had been "inundated" over the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a system break down and that shouldn't have been the case. Councils need to make sure the systems are right.</p>
        
            <p>"Why haven't we got an annual report? Exactly the same problem: we haven't invested in systems and we haven't invested in people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The lack of investment over a number of years is coming back to bite us and we have got to change that."</p>
