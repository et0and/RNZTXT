            <p>Fire crews are fighting multiple vegetation fires in the South Island, evacuations are under way in Amberley, Broomfield and Waipara and some buildings have been destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ (FENZ) mid-south Canterbury district manager Rob Hands said the blazes were widespread, particularly in Canterbury, and being fanned by strong winds that could cause them to spread quickly.</p>
        
            <p>At least seven vegetation fires were burning between North Canterbury down to Shannon near Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"They range from Amberley, Waipara, Springfield, Rangiora, Rakaia, Leeston and Tekapo," Hands said.</p>
        
            <p>A fire in the North Canterbury town of Amberley was the most significant, Hands said, with two outbuildings and a caravan already destroyed, and flames threatening more properties in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Five houses had been evacuated there, and an evacuation centre had been set up in the town.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of a house in Waipara had also been forced to leave.</p>
        
            <p>Hurunui District Mayor Marie Black said residents in Broomfield were being evacuated from their homes in Racecourse Road, east of Mt Brown Road, due to a vegetation fire there.</p>
        
            <p>Residents on Rubicon Road just south of Midland Road in Springfield should prepare to leave also, FENZ said. Police would advise them if they needed to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>Black said volunteer firefighters were travelling from up to 30km away to help to contain the blazes, and it was all hands on deck at the emergency welfare centre that has been set up in Amberley.</p>
        
            <p>"The welfare centre is at what we call the Tin Shed, which is a community building in Amberley.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be doing everything to make sure that people are safe and that the impact on their lives will be reduced as best we can."</p>
        
            <p>Black urged people to stay away from the fires.</p>
        
            <p>Mid-South Canterbury Fire and Emergency said two helicopters and fire crews from Tekapō, Burkes Pass, Timaru and Twizel had brought a fire under control that had been burning in tussock and pine trees near Tekapō on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Reduced crews were finishing mop up at the site, and would continue to monitor the fire.</p>

            <p>FENZ urged South Islanders not to burn any fires outdoors due to the high winds, and to thoroughly put out any fires already burning.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury fire chief Rob Hands said there were fears the flames would spread rapidly as they were being buffeted by high winds.</p>
        
            <p>The weather conditions were making it hard work for firefighters, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were forecasting strong wind warnings this weekend... and that's what's happened. We've got wind anywhere from over 100km to 60kmh on these fire sites."</p>
        
            <p>MetService earlier on Saturday warned of "severe gale west to northwesterlies" for southern parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Strong wind watches were in force for Inland Canterbury Plains, Queenstown Lakes District, Central Otago, Stewart Island and coastal parts of mainland Southland, Clutha and Dunedin, as well as southern parts of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>"A front over the south of the South Island continues to move northeast. The front is bringing a period of heavy rain to Westland, and severe gale west to northwesterlies to parts of central and southern New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Watches and warnings for heavy rain and severe gales are in force. People are advised to keep up to date with the latest forecasts and check for areas being added or upgraded."</p>
