        <h2>Labour backs new Police Commissioner - but warns against routine arming</h2>
        <p>
The alternative to policing by consent would be a police state, which New Zealanders don't want, the party says.

            <p>Labour is defending the policing by consent approach, saying it's the same thing as new Police Commissioner Richard Chambers' talk about "trust and confidence".</p>
        
            <p>The party says the alternative to policing by consent would be a police state, which New Zealanders do not want to see.</p>
        
            <p>It warns against reopening the topic of routine arming of police, but backs Chambers in his new role - saying he will serve New Zealanders well.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ on Wednesday revealed Chambers was understood to be the only remaining candidate for the Police Commissioner role vacated by the incoming Social Investment chief executive Andrew Coster.</p>
        
            <p>The government confirmed the appointment less than three hours later, with Chambers outlining his four priorities alongside Police Minister Mark Mitchell at the Beehive.</p>
        
            <p>Coster had been known for talking about policing by consent, and was targeted by Mitchell - in opposition at the time - who vowed to "scrap Labour's policing-by-consent philosophy, which has been a failure, and encourage a back-to-basics policing model".</p>
        
            <p>Chambers - having arrived in New Zealand on Monday after leaving his job at Interpol in France - backed that stance, saying he did not subscribe to policing by consent.</p>
        
            <p>"No, I don't. I don't talk about policing by consent, I talk about trust and confidence, and it is fundamentally important that the police have the trust and confidence of the public."</p>
        
            <p>He said trust in police in New Zealand had fallen in recent years, and the organisation had work to do in restoring that.</p>
        
            <p>"It's true that New Zealanders have experienced more crime, particularly when it comes to fraud and scams and and other forms of internet-enabled crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Social media has got a bit to say about that as well, because people's perceptions of what's happening out there - and I think about retail crime, and I think about youth crime - those are all considerations that we need to take into account.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not only important to understand what the public are thinking about our organisation and the work that we do, but also internally ... I don't talk about policing by consent, I talk about trust and confidence both internally and externally."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell was quick to back that.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say I support that, and I think that the best way to police by consent is by maintaining the trust and confidence of the people that you serve and that's what you should be focused on."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if it was a difference of words rather than substance, Chambers said "well, I think people understand trust and confidence".</p>
        
            <p>"That's right," Mitchell intoned.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's Ginny Andersen told RNZ they were one and the same thing.</p>

            <p>"The alternative to policing by consent would be policing by non consent, and that conjures images of quite a strict military or police-led state, and that is not something I think most New Zealand communities would want to see here in New Zealand," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the government attempting to look tough. The way we do good policing is to make sure our police service is well resourced to be able to respond to communities' needs, and there is a real concern that the cuts that police have had to undergo over the past few months leave them underresourced."</p>
        
            <p>Coster had also previously spoken of the increased politicisation of his role as commissioner. Chambers said he was "absolutely" ready to face political heat in the role, but did not have a view on how that had changed over time.</p>
        
            <p>"Look, I don't really have any thoughts on it, to be honest - I just want to be a good policeman and a good leader of my organisation, and I know that working with the minister is an incredibly important role."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers had also said he was open to a conversation about the potential for police to be routinely armed.</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not think New Zealanders wanted or needed that, but the policing environment was growing more volatile and unpredictable.</p>
        
            <p>"And I am not going to shut down listening to the reflections of my frontline staff in terms of what they might think they need. It's obviously a significant debate for our country, but ... I am open to having that conversation."</p>
        
            <p>Andersen was less keen.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now police have access to firearms in their cars. I think the average New Zealander would be concerned if they saw a police officer walking around with a pistol on their hip. I don't think that's what Kiwis want.</p>
        
            <p>"The best way to get good outcomes for public safety is having a community that is able to access and approach police. My concern [is] that having a police officer with a pistol on their hip takes away from the ability for public to feel they can approach and talk to the police."</p>
        
            <p>But she backed Chambers as the right person for the job.</p>
        
            <p>"Richard Chambers is a great person. I've worked with him personally, and I have every confidence he'll be great in his new role.</p>
        
            <p>"Richard is determined and focused on his job. He takes his role in leading police very seriously, and I think he will do not only police, but New Zealand proud in doing that good work."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers had also acknowledged accessibility and approachability of officers was a key concern.</p>
        
            <p>He also indicated he would look at the potential for body cameras for police but did not elaborate other than to say it was a "key tool and asset for police" to gather evidence and help keep officers safe.</p>
