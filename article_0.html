            <p>Residents of Waiau will be reeling from a shooting that left one person dead and another seriously injured, the local MP says.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to The 309 Road just after 2pm Friday, where two people were found with gunshot wounds. One later died and another was airlifted to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A person was arrested and charges were being considered, police said on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>They were not seeking anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel MP Scott Simpson said this was not the way Coromandel residents would want to start their Christmas season.</p>
        
            <p>"The 309 Road is a really special part of the Coromandel," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an unsealed metalled piece of road - it's in many respects like Coromandel [that] used to be in classic years gone by.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tight-knit community and I'm very much feeling for those people who live in and are part of that community as we come to terms with this news."</p>
        
            <p>A former army medic who gave CPR to one of the victims said they were pig hunters.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who did not want to be named, told Checkpoint that he was serving customers at his small business when someone told him they had heard gun shots.</p>
        
            <p>The man said he found an injured man near the edge of his property. He put him in the recovery position and got a compression bandage, for what looked like a gunshot wound, before starting CPR. The victim did not survive his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>He said he later noticed there was a second man, who appeared to be a "young lad" in his 20s, who had a gunshot wound to the upper chest. He was later airlifted to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The man said 120 children were on-site celebrating the end of the school year.</p>
        
            <p>He did not think they would have seen anything as they left through a different exit on the property.</p>
