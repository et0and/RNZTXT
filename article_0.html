        <h2>The stoush between NZ and the Cook Islands, explained</h2>
        <p>
Diplomatic tension between the Cook Islands and New Zealand is growing. Here's what it's about about, what China has to do with it, and why it matters.

            <p>Explainer: New Zealand and the Cook Islands are in the middle of a diplomatic row.</p>
        
            <p>A series of events has frustrated New Zealand, with the latest being the island nation's prime minister going to China where he is set to sign a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" without consulting with New Zealand on its contents.</p>
        
            <p>While the agreement has been long-signalled, the manner at which it is being concluded, as well as the specifics of its contents, have concerned New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands, meanwhile, believes it does not need to consult with New Zealand on the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>It all comes down to constitutional arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>The Cook Islands was administered by New Zealand as a dependent territory from 1901 to 1965, and since then has been self-governed in 'free association' with New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It means the island nation conducts its own affairs, but Aotearoa needs to assist when it comes to foreign affairs, disasters, and defence.</p>
        
            <p>In 2001, New Zealand and the Cook Islands signed a Joint Centenary Declaration, which requires the two to "consult regularly on defence and security issues."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand believes because of this arrangement, the Cook Islands needs to consult with New Zealand - to the extent of seeing the proposed text of the strategic partnership with China before it is signed.</p>
        
            <p>And by failing to do so, it is breaching the terms of the Joint Centenary Declaration.</p>

            <p>On Friday, Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown and New Zealand Foreign Affairs minister Winston Peters spoke over the phone.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Peters said the minister impressed on Brown the importance of further information.</p>
        
            <p>"The Deputy Prime Minister, in the phone call and in writing within hours of the call, repeated to the Prime Minister a months-old request that the government of the Cook Islands share with New Zealand the contents of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) and other agreements that Prime Minister Brown intends to sign in China, in line with the requirement for consultation in the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration between New Zealand and the Cook Islands," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>But Brown disagrees, saying New Zealand has been advised that the deal with China does not include matters on security (unlike other agreements that have been signed in the Pacific with China), but New Zealand does not need to see the wording of the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us while we are going through our comprehensive agreement with China.</p>
        
            <p>"We have advised them on the matter, but as far as being consulted and to the level of detail that they were requiring, I think that's not a requirement," he told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Brown views the Cook Islands-New Zealand relationship as a reciprocal one, not one that the Cook Islands needs to go to New Zealand to get permission.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ Pacific New Zealand did not consult with the Cook Islands when New Zealand signed off on similar deals.</p>
        
            <p>Brown also does not see this agreement with China as being different to similar deals the Cook Islands has signed off on with other countries.</p>
        
            <p>Cook Islanders are also New Zealand citizens.</p>
        
            <p>To mark the sixtieth anniversary of free association, Brown had floated the idea of a Cook Islands passport, but New Zealand was firm that could only happen if the Cook Islands became fully independent, and Cook Islanders gave up their New Zealand passports.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Brown scrapped the idea, saying New Zealand would essentially "punish" Cook Islanders seeking a Cook Islands passport.</p>
        
            <p>China has had diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands since 1997, and has been a development partner since 2001.</p>
        
            <p>It is the Cook Islands' third biggest development partner, after New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Grants from China have been used to help pay for public infrastructure like the court house and police station in Rarotonga, as well as agricultural equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Grants and loans have also been used to go towards public events like the Pacific Mini Games, and the arena which hosted them.</p>
        
            <p>Te Mato Vai, an infrastructure project to replace the nation's water network, has been developed between New Zealand and China. New Zealand provided a grant, while China provided a loan and oversaw the construction of the project.</p>
        
            <p>While specifics of the new agreement between the Cook Islands and China are unclear, Brown has singled out a new inter-island vessel as an area the Cook Islands needs help with.</p>
        
            <p>His statement announcing his state visit to Beijing said it would be an opportunity to also enhance cooperation across trade, investment and tourism, infrastructure, climate resilience and renewable energy, agriculture, and maritime and oceans (including shipping and seabed minerals development).</p>
        
            <p>He has also indicated the deal will not come with any debt.</p>
        
            <p>This is the second stoush between New Zealand and a Pacific nation in as many weeks - and the second to catch Peters by surprise.</p>

            <p>New Zealand has put diplomatic aid for Kiribati under review, after a perceived 'snub' by president Tanetu Maamau towards Peters.</p>
        
            <p>The Foreign Affairs minister was set to visit Kiribati this month after months of organising, but a week beforehand was told Maamau was no longer available.</p>
        
            <p>Kiribati has insisted it was not a snub, but a clash with another commitment. Peters did not buy it.</p>
        
            <p>His decision to put the aid under review has attracted criticism from the opposition in New Zealand and the Kiribati government.</p>
