            <p>The investigation into leaked Cabinet paper about Fair Pay Agreements has been unable to find evidence of how it got to the media.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment chief executive Carolyn Tremain said they investigated all relevant agencies and staff who had access to the paper and coversheet.</p>
        
            <p>"We have not found any evidence across the public service of how this information was sent to media. I have shared this with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety and the Public Service Commissioner."</p>
        
            <p>She said Oranga Tamariki's chief executive had reported the documents were forwarded "in error" to a person outside the agency, but there was no evidence linking that to the media receiving it.</p>
        
            <p>"While this investigation is now concluded, MBIE takes any unauthorised disclosure of information very seriously and this has been communicated with our people," Tremain said.</p>
        
            <p>"MBIE followed standard cross-government policy processes and protocols for consultation both inside and outside of MBIE."</p>
        
            <p>The papers obtained by media in early December revealed advice to the government showing the agreements would have disproportionately benefited MƒÅori, Pacific People, women, and young people.</p>
        
            <p>One paper taken to Cabinet by Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Brooke van Velden showed she did not believe a 'blunt tool' such as FPAs would have improved employment terms for those groups.</p>
        
            <p>Days later, Van Velden told RNZ's Checkpoint it was possible an enthusiastic supporter of the government had been behind the leak.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
