        <h2>Multiple parties complain over Green MP's conduct</h2>
        <p>
Speaker Gerry Brownlee won't say which parties have taken issue with Julie Anne Genter's outburst.
</p>
        
            <p>Multiple parties have complained to Parliament's Speaker about Green MP Julie Anne Genter's angry outburst in the House .</p>
        
            <p>Genter has apologised after waving a book in National MP Matt Doocey's face and shouting at him during a debate on roading projects on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Brownlee has told MPs Genter has until midday Monday to respond to the complaints before he decides on referring the matter to the Privileges Committee.</p>
        
            <p>The Rongotai MP was working from home on Thursday, Green co-leaders Marama Davidson and Chl√∂e Swarbrick confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's best that she was working from home today. We are making it really clear to her that behaviour shouldn't have happened," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have got a disciplinary process happening. We will be making it very clear that this must not happen again and providing personal and professional support."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said her party had had a rough start to the term, referring to the sudden death of Efeso Collins, but there was no excuse for Genter's behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone knows that the Greens have had a heck of a rough time, just two days ago our grief was resurfaced for our beloved colleague but nothing excuses the behaviour that happened in the House last night."</p>
        
            <p>The co-leader was repeatedly asked if she knew of any other instances where Genter had lost her temper.</p>
        
            <p>"What I can comment on today is the incident last night which I know and can see and have got the facts on exactly what happened and it did not meet the standards that we expect."</p>
        
            <p>Swarbrick said another instance where Genter tried to walk out of an interview with 1News on roadside drug testing had been dealt with at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"She is being subjected to an internal disciplinary process as a result of the actions last night. It crossed a threshold last night and when you're reflecting on, for example, the interview ... that was an instance where, as I understand it, the co-leaders at that point in time had a conversation with Julie-Anne.</p>
        
            <p>"But again, what occurred last night is completely unacceptable, completely inexcusable and there is an internal disciplinary process that we'll be following. We also will be participating in all of the processes of the House to ensure that order is restored."</p>
        
            <p>The Greens would "absolutely" facilitate an in-person meeting between Genter and Doocey for a face-to-face apology if that was what was wanted, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wasn't in parliament for the incident but he said it was "quite unbelievable when I did see it".</p>
        
            <p>He said he had checked in with Matt Doocey, and hoped the Green Party's leadership had checked in with Genter.</p>
        
            <p>"Given this is an issue for parliament, it's inappropriate for me to comment on it."</p>
        
            <p>Doocey did not respond to questions as he made his way into the House on Thursday afternoon, saying he would not be commenting on the matter yet.</p>
