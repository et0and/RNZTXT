            <p>Te Arikinui Kuini Nga wai hono i te po has made her first visit to Rātana Pā, bringing with her the memory of her late father Kiingi Tuheitia.</p>
        
            <p>Followers of the Rātana Church, called mōrehu, gather at the small settlement south of Whanganui each year in January to celebrate the birthday of the movement's founder, Tahupōtiki WiremKiingi Tuheitia u Rātana.</p>
        
            <p>Tainui leader Tuku Morgan said it was only a year ago - only a short time after the hui ā motu - that Kiingi Tuheita was in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"We're here to bring his mate (death) so we can mourn his loss and pay tribute to his courage, vision and strength in terms of igniting the fire so Māori across this country can unite on issues."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiingitanga and the Rātana Church were inextricably bound together, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The unity of the two movements have echoed through the ages. Many of the important leaders of the Kiingitanga have come here not only so they might take the time to discuss issues but actually unite as Māori across this country."</p>
        
            <p>Both institutions share a long history going back to the second Māori King Tawhiao.</p>

            <p>Among the many rangatahi (young people) at Rātana on Thursday were Imara Ruth Tamou (10) and Anahera Apanui Hohepa (11) who were excited to see Te Arikinui for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>While Tamou said the celebrations brings a lot of happiness, Hohepa said it's a time to be with whānau and friends.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels so happy to see all the family gather around and see each other, little kids getting along, making new friends, and just smiling," Hohepa said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Tai Hauāuru MP Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said this years celebrations have been packed with rangatahi and Te Arikinui has a lot to do with that.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Kuini is bringing rangatahi out and bringing them to kaupapa that perhaps they otherwise may not have been, their whānau might have always been here, but they're coming with the anticipation, if not to hear, to observe, I think that's magic."</p>
        
            <p>Ngarewa-Packer said she is excited to see the intergenerational transmission of knowledge in action.</p>
