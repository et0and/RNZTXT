            <p>The second most powerful police officer in the country is on leave pending separate investigations, the Herald can reveal.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming is being investigated by the Independent Police Conduct Authority, and the New Zealand Police.</p>
        
            <p>The nature of the allegations against McSkimming cannot be reported.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the police are "not in a position to comment on any active investigation".</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said in a statement: "While investigations are underway, it would be inappropriate to comment."</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority's manager for investigations Emma Bunny said via a spokesperson: "We will not be making any comment on this matter at this time."</p>
        
            <p>The Herald understands McSkimming has been on leave from Police National Headquarters for several weeks.</p>
        
            <p>He was one of the final two candidates to replace the outgoing Andrew Coster as the Commissioner of Police, although he was overlooked in favour of Richard Chambers who was appointed to the role last month for five years.</p>
        
            <p>McSkimming remains an important figure in the police executive.</p>
        
            <p>He is one of two statutory Deputy Commissioners, an appointment made by the government, which is an important role within the constitutional framework of police and carries a safeguard of independence from the Police Commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>If Chambers was to be incapacitated, for example, McSkimming or fellow statutory deputy Tania Kura would assume office until a new commissioner was appointed.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, if any allegations were made against Chambers, the pair have the independence to investigate without interference.</p>
        
            <p>So the revelation that McSkimming is under investigation by the IPCA and his own staff is hugely significant.</p>
        
            <p>McSkimming graduated from Police College in 1996 and spent the first 10 years of his career in frontline roles in Auckland, Southland and the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>He shifted to the Wellington district for several years in leadership positions, before moving to Police National Headquarters (PNHQ) in 2010 and rising through the ranks there.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, McSkimming was promoted to deputy commissioner on the recommendation of Chris Hipkins, who was Prime Minister at the time, following a Public Service Commission selection process.</p>
        
            <p>"Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming brings a relatively unique career path within New Zealand Police," according to a report presented by Hipkins to Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>"He has been a police officer for 27 years but, since 2010, McSkimming has used his operational skills across the organisation to shape strategy, service delivery and resolutions, financial planning, arms administration, ICT and infrastructure."</p>
