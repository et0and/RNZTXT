            <p>Two bodies have been recovered following a quad bike accident in the Far North Friday night, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Peria, east of Kait훮ia, just after 5pm Friday when the bike, which reportedly had six people on it, crashed into a swimming hole in the swollen Waik훮inga Stream.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were able to make it out of the water and were taken to hospital with minor to moderate injuries, but two others were not found.</p>
        
            <p>A r훮hui has been put in place on the Waikainga Stream from Shepherds Road to the Peria Saleyards Bridge.</p>

The accident occured near the small community of Peria.

            <p>Earlier today, Far North Mayor Moko Tepania told RNZ it was terrible to learn of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"Any loss of life, or any accidents, or anyone going missing in any community in Aotearoa is obviously going to be terrible so just really hoping that our search and rescue can find our missing wh훮nau members."</p>
        
            <p>"Just really tragic to hear of this ... up here in the Far North over the summer season."</p>
        
            <p>While he had not had any calls with any residents in Peria yet, Tepania said he knew that the community there would be "devastated".</p>
        
            <p>"This area is really quite remote and really tight-knit as well so I know they will be incredibly anxious at this time."</p>
