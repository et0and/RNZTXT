            <p>The Reserve Bank has slashed the OCR by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Economists had expected the central bank to deliver a third consecutive big cut on Wednesday, in a bid to support the weak economy.</p>
        
            <p>Two banks had already announced they would cut their interest rates, ahead of the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Economists have suggest future OCR cuts will be smaller, fewer, and spread out.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
