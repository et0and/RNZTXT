        <h2>Watch live: Christopher Luxon speaks at post-Cabinet briefing</h2>
        <p>
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is due to speak to media for the post-Cabinet media briefing.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will be speaking at the post-Cabinet media briefing after announcing more repeals of the former government's policies.</p>
        
            <p>The latest project to go is Let's Get Wellington Moving, with the new government instead opting to fund a second Mount Victoria tunnel and upgrade the Basin Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>It will also be releasing a "mini, mini, mini Budget" on Wednesday, which is set to coincide with the Treasury's latest economic update.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been under fire today after it was revealed that taxpayers paid for his te reo Māori lessons, despite criticising spending on te reo Māori lessons for public servants.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
