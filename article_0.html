            <p>Two men have died and three are critically injured after a huge brawl in Gisborne overnight.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 people were involved in a massive fight on Lytton Road in Elgin, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers arrived about 11.30pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of police units were needed to gain control of the scene, and during this time two men were located deceased," acting inspector Danny Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>"Three others have been transported to hospital in a critical condition."</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons remain in place and a scene examination will be carried out this morning," Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that events like this are incredibly concerning for our community. Police will have a highly visible presence across Gisborne over the coming days, and extra patrols will be carried out to provide reassurance to members of the community."</p>
        
            <p>Additional police staff had been called on to assist, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Further information would be released when it became available.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne Mayor Rehette Stoltz said the news was "heartbreaking".</p>
        
            <p>"It's heartbreaking for our community and it's heartbreaking for the families of the men involved."</p>
        
            <p>Mass brawls had not been an ongoing problem in Gisborne, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that our community will feel this. It doesn't matter what happened, families are affected and there are families mourning this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with them and our thoughts are also with our police who have to deal with this and keep our community safe."</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said she had spoken to police on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The update I got is that they want to reassure the community and them having more visible police around will give that reassurance to the community in this tough time."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had heard the brawl was a party gone wrong.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
