            <p>One Corrections staff member has resigned and another is on their final warning after two prisoners escaped custody from Waikato Hospital in the space of a month.</p>
        
            <p>Damon Anderson, 48, who was in custody for breaching his home detention, spent nine days on the run after a daring escape from the hospital on 23 December.</p>
        
            <p>Video footage showed Anderson shimmying down a pipe on the outside of the building. Corrections confirmed he was handcuffed and wearing a GPS monitor at the time.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second time a prisoner had escaped from Corrections custody at the hospital inside a month.</p>
        
            <p>In November, a 25-year-old man assaulted two officers before carjacking a vehicle from the hospital carpark. He was arrested later that day.</p>
        
            <p>Spring Hill Corrections Facility acting general manager Alan Lamb said any escape was unacceptable and confirmed one employee had left the organisation and another received a final written warning following last year's bids for freedom.</p>
        
            <p>He said staff have had extra training on managing prisoner escorts and Corrections would look at changing procedures once its investigations into the escapes were complete.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a prisoner remains on the run after escaping police custody from outside the Taup≈ç District Court on Monday.</p>
