            <p>Wellington city councillors could sell off the land underneath several CBD buildings to pay for the council's insurance risk.</p>
        
            <p>Last Thursday councillors voted to stop the sale of the council's 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The sale was part of the council's long-term plan, with money raised from it set to be used to establish an investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>The fund would help the city's recovery following a future natural disaster, address the council's insurance risk and reduce reliance on future borrowing.</p>
        
            <p>But with the sale grounded, councillors have to amend their long term plan with an alternative to deal with the council's insurance woes.</p>
        
            <p>Latest council estimates state it is underinsured by $2.6 billion.</p>
        
            <p>After an urgent meeting on Wednesday councillors came out of it indicating a sale of the council ground lease portfolio could be on the cards.</p>
        
            <p>Ground leases are the land underneath buildings that the council owns and leases to building owners.</p>
        
            <p>It has 63 leases which include Datacom's former waterfront building (which the council plans to move into soon), Bowen House near Parliament and the Oaks Complex on Cuba Street.</p>
        
            <p>Their full portfolio value is $234 million.</p>
        
            <p>There is no indication yet of what leases, if any, the council would sell.</p>
        
            <p>See the full list of leases below:</p>
        
            <p>Council said in a statement it has 450,000 carbon credits which could also be considered for sale, at an estimated $60 per credit (at today's pricing). </p>
        
            <p>Advice on this will be provided to the Council as part of the LTP amendment process.</p>
        
            <p>After the meeting yesterday city councillor John Apanowicz told media there could be a new perpetual investment fund created through the sale of the council's ground leases.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau said councillors had a "shared commitment" to investigate their sale.</p>
        
            <p>She said they would also consider selling carbon credit holdings to make up a fund that could offer both returns and be a form of self-insurance to council which would grow over time.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be a vital step towards a long-term solution to our insurance risk."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors have also signalled that capital projects would likely be cut as a result of the recent airport shares' decision.</p>
        
            <p>In agenda documents released prior to last week's vote staff said councillors might have to consider almost doubling their debt ceiling from $272 million to $500m and cutting capital project spend by $400m or tripling the council's debt ceiling to $750m and slashing capital spend by $600m.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff said at the time projects that could be cut included the Golden Mile upgrades, the cycleway programme and the Khandallah Pool strengthening, which campaigners fought to save.</p>
