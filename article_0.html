            <p>The Auditor-General has criticised the way the University of Waikato contracted former finance minister Steven Joyce without looking at other firms.</p>
        
            <p>In an open letter to the university, Auditor-General John Ryan said that Joyce's consultancy firm Joyce Advisory had been paid $1.1 million in public funds between 2019 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the contractor's work is ongoing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Public organisations were typically required to invite multiple contractors into the procurement process to ensure that public funds were spent responsibly.</p>
        
            <p>But Ryan said the University of Waikato did not engage in a competitive procurement process and had reached out to Joyce directly.</p>
        
            <p>"Where there has been a direct procurement like this, and one that to date has cost well over $1 million of public money, we would expect to see a clear and documented reason for the services that were needed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That explanation, and the assurance it would provide to the public that public money has been appropriately spent, is missing."</p>
        
            <p>He said the matter was a "useful reminder" for public organisations to be transparent while hiring contractors.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Waikato has been contacted for comment.</p>
