            <p>Aotearoa has reclaimed the Guinness World Record for the largest haka from France after thousands performed Ka Mate at Auckland's Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The previous official record was 4028, held by France since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>While the official number of participants was yet to land on Sunday night, Guinness World Records adjudicator Brian Sobel confirmed New Zealand had smashed that record.</p>
        
            <p>Preliminary numbers were 6531, but that was expected to fluctuate.</p>
        
            <p>People travelled from far and wide to support the kaupapa, with American TV host Conan O'Brien, director Taika Waititi and boxer David Tua spotted in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Gates opened at 4.30pm before the haka attempt itself just after 8pm. Local entertainment included Six60, Alien Weaponry, Che Fu, Rob Ruha and the Topp Twins.</p>
        
            <p>The haka had to be performed for one minute, so those present performed Ka Mate four times in a row.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Hinewehi Mohi championed the world record attempt as part of the 20th anniversary of the Raukatauri Music Therapy Trust, named after her daughter Hineraukatauri, who has severe cerebral palsy.</p>
