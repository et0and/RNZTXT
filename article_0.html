            <p>A woman has been taken away by an ambulance "screaming her head off" after a serious incident today, a Wainuiomata resident says.</p>
        
            <p>Police have said they are responding to a serious incident south of the suburb in the Wellington region this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Wainuiomata resident Elizabeth Lister told RNZ a woman ran out of a car towards her neighbours' house and believed the woman was being threatened at knife point by a man.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard this loud car coming down the road... and I thought that's just a stupid guy and before he hardly even stopped outside Margaret and Bunter's driveway the girl opened the door and she ran up the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>"It looked like he threw a rock or something at the windscreen of the car, then it wasn't long ago after that the police arrived</p>
        
            <p>"We could hear the police yelling drop the knife, drop the knife."</p>
        
            <p>Moments later she heard a gun shot.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was then taken away by an ambulance "screaming her head off".</p>
        
            <p>The armed offenders squad were still on Coast Rd, Lister said. She said there were about 12 to 15 officers at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, two armed officers visited Lister's home and asked if they could get in the bushes to get a better view.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed they had closed off Coast Road after being called to the area just ahead of midday.</p>
        
            <p>They say a cordon has been put in place south of the Wainuiomata Golf Club.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
