        <h2>Gene Technology Bill: The public have their say</h2>
        <p>
Nearly 25 years after the "corngate" saga, the debate on genetic modification is back thanks to the Gene Technology Bill currently in select committee.

            <p>Parliament's Health Select Committee has heard a diverse range of views from the public during its hearings on the Gene Technology Bill.</p>
        
            <p>The Bill, which draws inspiration from Australia's 25-year-old Gene Technology Act, was introduced last year as part of the coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>It seeks to enable the use of safe gene technology through establishing a new regulatory regime (led by the Environmental Protection Agency) for genetically modified organisms (GMO).</p>

            <p>The government said New Zealand had lagged behind other countries, which they said were increasingly using gene technology to their benefit in areas such as agriculture, medicine and climate adaptation.</p>
        
            <p>It has been 30 years since GMO-related legislation was last debated in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>The Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act passed into law in 1996, making it very difficult to release genetically modified organisms into the New Zealand environment.</p>
        
            <p>Back then the debate on GMO was divisive and heated, with protests in the streets, a Royal Commission and the 'corngate' story capturing public attention.</p>
        
            <p>A shadow of that debate has returned with the Gene Technology Bill. Although it has dropped down the ranking of public passions, it is still divisive.</p>
        
            <p>Genetic modification (GM) gets technical quickly, and unless you're in the field of biotechnology it can be difficult to get your head around.</p>
        
            <p>In brief, GM refers to the altering of an organism's DNA to change its traits. That can involve borrowing genetic code from a second organism.</p>
        
            <p>During the first reading of the Gene Technology Bill, Te Pāti Māori's Hana Rāwhiti-Maipi Clarke, summed it up for any young people listening as "like editing a recipe to make it better, different or potentially even worse."</p>
        
            <p>Back in 2001, the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification decided that New Zealand should 'proceed with caution' in regards to GMO.</p>
        
            <p>Dr William Rolleston submitted on the current bill and was among the most supportive.</p>
        
            <p>He told MPs at Wednesday's hearing that "there has been a lot of caution in the last 20 years, and not a lot of proceeding".</p>

            <p>Rolleston is chair of the Life Sciences Network, which he said "works to improve scientific literacy and hold misrepresentation of science to account".</p>
        
            <p>He told the Committee "whether-in the words of the Nobel laureates-you base those recommendations on emotion and dogma or on data.</p>
        
            <p>"…what evidence you consider credible will determine that future".</p>
        
            <p>Others were staunchly opposed, such as GE Free New Zealand's Claire Bleakley.</p>
        
            <p>She believed the potential for human error in GMO laboratories was too high and the consequences too great.</p>
        
            <p>She said to the Committee that "consumers …and farmers are …guinea pigs subject to genetic experiments that will threaten the livelihood of producers, whether they are organic or not."</p>
        
            <p>This week's hearing concluded with evidence from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Simon Upton.</p>
        
            <p>He is Parliament's environment watchdog.</p>
        
            <p>Upton was largely supportive of the law change, but warned MPs against allowing too much ministerial discretion or lobbyist influence.</p>
        
            <p>"The Bill is drafted in a way that gives the minister significant opportunities to influence the regulator without actually taking responsibility for any specific decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"The Bill allows the minister to give wide-ranging general policy directions and regulations that determine the regulator's risk tolerance, risk assessment criteria and conditions for risk management.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, if Parliament wants citizens, businesses and overseas trade partners to have confidence in the decisions of the regulator, the regulator's decisions must be independent of political interference or industry lobbying - social license and trade credibility demands that."</p>
        
            <p>The Gene Technology Bill is due to be reported back to the House by the end of July, when it will be available for a second reading.</p>
        
            <p>It is currently supported by all coalition parties and opposed by all opposition parties.</p>
