            <p>She has returned an adverse analytical finding, according to the IOC.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's Imogen Ayris will be the 10th athlete to compete in the final, followed by Eliza McCartney in 13th and Olivia McTaggart in 16th.</p>
        
            <p>The field has been reduced to 19 due to the withdrawl of another Greek athlete.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Kiwi paddler Luuka Jones says after 20 years of competing in Europe she is ready to make the leap and retire from kayaking.</p>
