            <p>There are signs the final deal between National, ACT and New Zealand First will be ready for final consultation today, with the actual announcement likely Friday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters says negotiations for his party are now over.</p>
        
            <p>One of the last outstanding issues was who would be given the role of deputy prime minister and RNZ understands that has now been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>The solution remains unclear, but one option could be splitting the term with ACT holding the job for one half and New Zealand First, the other.</p>
        
            <p>Peters this afternoon rubbished the idea of co-deputies, a prospect which both Luxon and Seymour earlier declined to rule out.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never had a co-deputy prime minister ever," Peters told reporters this afternoon. "Why would we [be] starting?"</p>
        
            <p>The leaders of all three parties are now all in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>National's Christopher Luxon and ACT's David Seymour flew into the capital last night.</p>
        
            <p>Peters arrived in Wellington earlier this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking outside Treasury on the Terrace, he was asked whether a deal has been reached.</p>
        
            <p>"Well if that was the case, I would have told you", was his reply.</p>
        
            <p>Before any deal between the three parties can be finalised, it first has to go to their respective boards and caucuses for sign off.</p>
        
            <p>Peters did however, confirm that his party is no longer negotiating.</p>
        
            <p>"No - well think about it, you're not going to nail me down, this is not my first rodeo, right", he told reporters.</p>

            <p>Also speaking this afternoon, Seymour said he was "feeling very good about the future of the government".</p>
        
            <p>"We've come through a long, and I know many people would say too long a process, but it's come together to create a very good deal and with some 'i's' and 't's' I think we'll be in a position to form that government.</p>
        
            <p>"But obviously I'm not in a position to say the exact details of that or what any outstanding tasks or issues might be."</p>
