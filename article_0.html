            <p>A 77-year-old man has been charged with murder and attempted murder after a shooting in Waiau, Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>He will appear in Hamilton District Court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a post mortem would be carried out on the deceased, while the other victim remained in hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>The 309 Road had been reopened, though police remained in the area examining the scene. Residents should expect to see a police presence.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries into the incident were ongoing.</p>

            <p>Police were called to the 309 Road just after 2pm on Friday, arresting a suspect at the scene. They were not seeking anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>A former army medic who gave CPR to one of the victims said they were pig hunters.</p>
        
            <p>An extremely winding, curvy road, local tourism sites say it "takes you on a journey through dense bushland with lots of surprise stops to make along the road".</p>
        
            <p>According to Wikipedia, it either got its name from there being 309 bends in the road, or because horse-drawn coaches used to take 309 minutes to travel it.</p>
        
            <p>The road was reportedly developed the Gold Rush era.</p>
        
            <p>A Coromandel travel blog called it "a largely unpeopled landscape, bordered by river, backdropped with birdsong".</p>

            <p>On TripAdvisor, one dissatisfied traveller wrote, "Avoid that road.. Just too dangerous, that road can turn your beautiful holiday to a terrible memory."</p>
        
            <p>Another described it as a "drive through Jurassic Park", saying they "loved the pure adventure of this secluded drive through exotic tropical rainforest which I never knew existed".</p>
        
            <p>Among the attractions described on the road was a honey shop and an ancient kauri grove, places for swimming an picnicking, as well as Waiau Falls and the scenic Castle Rock.</p>
        
            <p>The Waiau Waterworks park featured a display of water sculptures, while a large wild pig farm was another well-known stop.</p>
