            <p>US President Donald Trump did not dismiss the idea of pursuing a third term in the White House, despite the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution prohibiting it, claiming in an interview that "there are methods" for achieving this and emphasising he was "not joking."</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people would like me to do that. But, I mean, I basically tell them, we have a long way to go," Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News that published Sunday (US time).</p>
        
            <p>"I'm focused on the current," he added, referring to his current administration.</p>
        
            <p>"There are methods which you could do it," the president responded, when asked if there are strategies on the table to allow him to seek another presidency.</p>
        
            <p>The term-limited president has teased a third presidency time and time again.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not joking," Trump told NBC News, but reiterated, "It is far too early to think about it."</p>
        
            <p>Trump said at a rally in Nevada in late January, "It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice or three times or four times."</p>
        
            <p>He later added: "No, it will be to serve twice. For the next four years, I will not rest."</p>
        
            <p>Weeks later, Trump asked supporters, "Should I run again?" at a Black History Month event at the White House, to chants of "Four more years!"</p>
