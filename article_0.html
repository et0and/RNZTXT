            <p>Graham Philip, 64, who attacked the North Island power grid in 2021, walked free from Tongariro Prison on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Philip, a campaigner against the Covid-19 vaccination regime, was set free on his statutory release date despite the Parole Board saying as recently as last month that he remained an "undue risk".</p>
        
            <p>The Parole Board has set conditions on his release and Philip will be monitored by the Probation Service for the next six months, with electronic monitoring and a ban on using an internet-capable device without permission.</p>
        
            <p>The former IT professional from Taupō was sentenced to three years and one month in prison in December 2022 on seven charges of sabotage.</p>
        
            <p>However, he had been in custody since he was arrested on 8 December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>As time behind bars on remand is counted towards an imprisoned person's sentence, Philip has now served his full term without parole.</p>
        
            <p>The Parole Board turned him down for earlier release several times, as recently as last month when Philip waived his right to appear before them.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Mr Philip's imprisonment, it has become apparent that he has a mistrust of authority, which includes the New Zealand Parole Board," the board's latest report, dated December 16, said.</p>
        
            <p>He has been reluctant to admit that he has caused harm and there are victims involved.</p>
        
            <p>"The psychologist noted that he has a strong dislike and distrust of government agencies and associated professionals. There has been no rehabilitation and no safety plan oversight."</p>
        
            <p>Philip attacked electricity infrastructure, intending to cause disruption to draw attention to the then government's Covid-19 response, which he felt was harming people.</p>
        
            <p>Philip's release on Wednesday was announced by supporters on the Free Graham Philip Facebook page, which has 3400 followers.</p>
        
            <p>"Graham was released from Tongariro Prison this morning and after three long and difficult years, has finally been reunited with his lovely wife [Marta]," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today will be the beginning of a new chapter for them both, where they can hopefully put the past three years behind them and enjoy a happy, peaceful, quiet life together.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you all for your continued prayers, love and support," the Facebook post said.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of encouraging messages we have received and the outpouring of love has been very, VERY humbling!</p>
        
            <p>"You guys are truly amazing and we will be forever grateful."</p>
        
            <p>Details of Philip's offending are subject to a permanent suppression order, although it can be reported his attack was against Transpower infrastructure and resulted in a fire that caused $1.25 million in damage.</p>
        
            <p>He pleaded guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Under his release conditions, Philip will also have to live at an approved address in the Taupō district and stay at least 50m away from Transpower properties.</p>
        
            <p>He will have to undergo a psychological assessment and do any treatment directed by a probation officer.</p>
