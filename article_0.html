            <p>Despite a podium finish at the last Games Dylan Schmidt is the least prominent of Kiwis fancied to win a medal this time round.</p>
        
            <p>Schmidt is now at his third Olympics which has just "flown by", he says.</p>
        
            <p>"To go to my third Games and have the chance to do something special is pretty amazing and I really love being part of the wider New Zealand team."</p>
        
            <p>His bronze medal was the first for a Kiwi in any gymnastics discipline and he also won the country's first world title in his event.</p>
        
            <p>Trampoline sees athletes perform routines composed of 10 elements which are scored according to their difficulty, execution and time spent in the air. Athletes bounce over eight metres into the air.</p>

            <p>Schmidt and fellow gymnast Maddie Davidson were Olympic team-mates in Tokyo but are returning to the Games as a couple seeking medals and inspiration from each other.</p>
        
            <p>While Schmidt and Davidson can bounce ideas off each other as elite trampolinists both are mindful of the need to keep a healthy split between their sport and private lives.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the first topic that comes up when we go out to dinner," Schmidt told Reuters of their athletic pursuits.</p>
        
            <p>"We tend to leave the advice to our coaches."</p>
        
            <p>The trampoline competition at Paris 2024 will be contested on 2 August at the Bercy Arena.</p>
