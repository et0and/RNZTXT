        <h2>Wellington to lose an electorate in proposed change</h2>
        <p>
Three electorates would vanish and two new ones would be set up in the capital as lines for local seats are redrawn.

            <p>The lower North Island will lose one electorate, under proposals from the Representation Commission.</p>
        
            <p>It's proposed creating two new electorates, called Kenepuru and Kapiti, and removing the Ōhāriu, Mana, and Ōtaki electorates.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission has also proposed some boundary changes, due to population changes.</p>
        
            <p>In West Auckland, the New Lynn, Kelston, and Te Atatu electorates will be re-configured, with the proposed new names of Waitākere, Glendene, and Ranui.</p>
        
            <p>The Tauranga and Bay of Plenty electorates will also be re-configured, with a new Mount Maunganui electorate to reflect the re-drawn boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>The public will be able to make objections and counter-objections until May 21, with public hearings set down for June.</p>
        
            <p>The boundaries and names will be finalised on the eighth of August.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
