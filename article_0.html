            <p>Dame Lisa Carrington and her women's kayak fours crew have taken gold in their final.</p>
        
            <p>Carrington, Alicia Hoskin, Olivia Brett and Tara Vaughan flew through their earlier heat and were the ones to beat going into the final on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Their gold medal win adds to the bronze won by sailors Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson in the mixed multihull Nacra race in Marseille earlier on Thursday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The sailing pair were trailing the UK team on points, but gained a place after the British sailors were taken out of the race due to a false start, and came in for third.</p>
        
            <p>The men's K4 team did not fare so well in their final, finishing at the back of the pack.</p>
