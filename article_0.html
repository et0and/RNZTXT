            <p>A female police officer has died from her injuries after being hit by a car in Nelson in the early hours of this morning, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers and Minister Mark Mitchell are talking to media after multiple people were injured at an event in Buxton Square early on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers confirmed this afternoon that Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming had died from her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The two officers were on foot patrolling the square at the time of the incident about 2am, Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"A vehicle drove at them at speed and collided with them. The injuries that they sustained were critical. The vehicle then turned and drove at a police car, ramming it.</p>
        
            <p>"Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming is a daughter and a mother.</p>
        
            <p>"She has done 38 years of service to the communities. She was a beautiful soul and an outstanding police officer."</p>
        
            <p>The other officer is undergoing surgery, but is expected to recover.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old who was allegedly driving the vehicle was tasered by other police staff and taken into custody at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Two other members of the public were injured. One woman received a broken arm and a male who came to assist police was injured in his shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point our priorities obviously are to provide support to Lyn's family, Adam's family and Adam.</p>
        
            <p>"The strength of the police family is something that we are all very proud of and it's times like these we all come together," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"A tragic day for New Zealand police, for New Zealand, where we have lost a police officer," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating any possible motive for the attacker.</p>
        
            <p>"This was an unprovoked and senseless act," Chambers said. "There was no indication that what was about to occur."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if police officers in New Zealand were safe, Chambers said he was proud of the work officers did and the challenges they faced.</p>
        
            <p>"We have lost staff over the years. We recover, but it hurts forever.</p>
        
            <p>"We must be reminded that behind the uniform is a human being."</p>
        
            <p>Chambers said an investigation will look at if anything could have been done differently, but he said both officers were highly trained and capable.</p>
        
            <p>"They were faced with the senseless act of an individual who was determined to cause harm. I'm not sure if Lyn or Adam or anyone could have done anything differently."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said the news was "gut-wrenching".</p>
        
            <p>"They are outstanding leaders, they are highly respected," he said of the victims.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been targeted in what I consider a very cowardly attack, and of course now we have lost Lyn, and that is going to cut very deep.</p>
        
            <p>"For a minister of police, any minister of police, it's your worst nightmare when you lose a front-line police officer."</p>
        
            <p>The attack highlights the risk that is posed to any front line police officer, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been updated throughout the day, he added.</p>
