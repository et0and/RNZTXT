        <h2>Live: Wairoa urged to not panic buy despite state of emergency declaration</h2>
        <p>
State of emergencies have been declared in the Heretaunga Ward in Hastings and Wairoa, due to the potential risk to lives and properties.
</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa's mayor says he spoke to the local supermarket operator and has been assured supplies will be able to get into the region.</p>
        
            <p>A slip on State Highway 38 earlier closed the road but Craig Little says it has now reopened.</p>
        
            <p>He says the owner of the local supermarket has told him he is already thinking about how to get stock in if the road does close.</p>

            <p>It come after a state of emergency was declared in Wairoa over the risk to lives and properties.</p>
