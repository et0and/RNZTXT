            <p>In its 10th year of operation, ReliefAid has delivered aid to more than a million people in international conflict zones.</p>
        
            <p>The charity supports civilians in Gaza, Ukraine, Lebanon, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>
        
            <p>Founder Mike Seawright told Sunday Morning they know the numbers because they counted.</p>
        
            <p>"We count every family that comes to our distributions, every family that we visit, everyone that we give something to or help, we count them.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been counting them for 10 years now."</p>
        
            <p>The charity was founded by Seawright after his experience in conflict zones around the world. He realised not enough aid reached those who desperately needed it most.</p>
        
            <p>ReliefAid's first place of intervention was Aleppo in Syria.</p>
        
            <p>"No one was either able or willing to operate in there and of course it comes at a cost, we lost two staff in 2016," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the "terrible times", Seawright said the ReliefAid workers remained strong.</p>
        
            <p>"What is amazing is our teams pick themselves up, dust themselves off and go back to work the next day.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel privileged actually to do the work that we do. We are lucky because we see the absolute terrible nature of war, we see homes destroyed, bodies broken, lives lost, but we also see everyday people going out everyday and helping their fellow citizen."</p>
        
            <p>ReliefAid was founded in late 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Seawright said the reason it had been able to help those in need around the world was because of people like communications director Anne Bulley.</p>
        
            <p>"She has worked for us for 40-60 hours a week pro bono for nine years now. These are incredible Kiwis digging deep either with their time or their money to make sure we got to the million.</p>
        
            <p>"And we are gonna keep going until we get to two million ... we will continue as wars continue to break out."</p>
