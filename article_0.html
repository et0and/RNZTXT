            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will be talking at the Palmerston North Function Centre on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Both National and the Greens will on Sunday lay out their respective visions for their parties, the country and the planet in several set-piece speeches.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after 10am, Luxon will address members at National's regional conference in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>At noon, the Greens' co-leaders will deliver scene-setting speeches, which they call their 'State of the Planet' addresses.</p>
        
            <p>The events follow an address from Labour's leader Chris Hipkins on Saturday, where he laid out his ambitions for New Zealand, painting an image of a country with cheaper childcare and a bigger tax bill for mega-landlords.</p>
