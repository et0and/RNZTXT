            <p>Warning: This story includes details of a graphic nature and may be upsetting. </p>
        
            <p>The unpredictable nature of Ross Bremner's schizophrenia - and not his mental health care - led to a frenzied attack on his parents and a couple he didn't know that killed three of them, and ended when he took his own life.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Michael Robb's findings into the cause of Clare Bremner, Maurice O'Donnell, Mona Tuwhangai and Bremner's deaths on 4 October, 2016 have been released, and show the 35-year-old was extremely mentally unwell when he inflicted the fatal attacks, which left his father in critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Keith Bremner survived his injuries but couldn't remember the attacks. He died in June, almost eight years after the murders.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time, details of the attacks can be reported.</p>

            <p>On the day of the attacks, Keith, 64, and Clare, 60, arrived at their Ōtorohanga home separately before 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier Clare texted Bremner, who lived with his parents, to ask if he was okay and tell him she was on the way home. At 3.11pm he replied saying: "Good see you then."</p>
        
            <p>At 4.19pm, Clare spoke to one of her sisters on the phone for seven minutes and they made plans to catch up.</p>
        
            <p>About 8pm, a neighbour heard gurgling noises from the front of the Bremner house and went with her adult son to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>"They went to Keith and Clare's property at about 8.20pm and were met with a traumatic scene."</p>
        
            <p>Keith was lying on the front porch in a pool of blood, with significant knife wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called and he was rushed to hospital in critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police found Clare deceased, lying in a pool of blood with similar wounds to her head and throat.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Robb said evidence showed a "very violent" and "frenzied attack on Clare and Keith".</p>
        
            <p>Police said the attack happened about 6.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>They were unable to locate the weapon, and Bremner and his silver Holden Vectra were gone.</p>
        
            <p>His mobile phone was in his bedroom, with his last communication the text to his mother.</p>
        
            <p>At 3.30pm that day, O'Donnell, 72 and Tuwhangai, 82, arrived home at Kinohaku from shopping in Te Awamutu.</p>
        
            <p>The property on Kāwhia Harbour is an hour's drive from Ōtorohanga.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Robb found that after the attack on his parents, Bremner drove to the property, selecting it at random, and parked the car behind a shed so it could not be seen from the road or house.</p>
        
            <p>The car became stuck in a boggy patch and Bremner approached the house on foot.</p>
        
            <p>He hopped into the couple's car - his fingerprint was later lifted from the gearstick - but the car keys were inside.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Robb said the couple were in the middle of a meal when Bremner attacked them violently, using items from a shed.</p>
        
            <p>"The actions are not carried out as some kind of robbery, but are essentially frenzied and purposeless."</p>
        
            <p>Bremner took off his Guns N' Roses t-shirt after the attack and made a half-hearted attempt to wash it.</p>
        
            <p>It was found in the kitchen, damp and with splatters of O'Donnell's blood.</p>
        
            <p>Bremner tried to find something to wear before tipping Tuwhangai's handbag upside down, rummaging through the contents and pocketing her bank card.</p>
        
            <p>He also tried to clean blood off a knife outside.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Robb said Bremner took his own life shortly after the killings. The method by which he died cannot be reported.</p>
        
            <p>It was three days before their bodies were discovered by a neighbour.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Bremner was the oldest of three siblings and a "loving" brother to his sisters, but his mental health took a turn in 2003.</p>
        
            <p>He began smoking weed as a teenager and after one session aged about 24, he claimed someone laced the marijuana with "magic mushrooms".</p>
        
            <p>Bremner was admitted to hospital for paranoid delusions between 2003 and 2013.</p>
        
            <p>He assaulted his grandparents and once assaulted a man while experiencing hallucinations, and a psychologist.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic psychiatrist Dr David Chaplow said 1500 pages of clinical notes pointed to challenges stabilising Bremner's illness.</p>
        
            <p>Both Chaplow and a Te Whatu Ora Waikato serious event review found Bremner became paranoid with the urge to fight people whenever he reduced his anti-psychotic medication.</p>
        
            <p>In April 2016, with the support of his parents, Bremner asked his GP to decrease his clozapine medication because of side-effects including anxiety, panic, poor short-term memory, being overweight, constipation, lethargy and lack of motivation.</p>
        
            <p>He was referred to a psychiatrist who reviewed Bremner's file and declined the request.</p>
        
            <p>In August, Bremner went to his GP with Keith and asked to go off his medication.</p>
        
            <p>The GP suggested a very small, slow reduction in one of his four medications.</p>
        
            <p>Five weeks later on 19 September, the pair revisited Bremner's GP and he reported mild anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>Bremner was advised to return to the original dose and there's no indication he refused.</p>
        
            <p>A week later - on 26 September - Bremner picked a fight with a stranger in Te Awamutu, prompting his father to call community mental health services.</p>
        
            <p>After a telephone triage, he was referred to a psychiatrist two days later.</p>
        
            <p>That psychiatrist noted a single psychotic event and discussed admission to the Henry Rongomau Bennett Centre or a respite facility, but both were declined by Bremner and his parents.</p>
        
            <p>No change to his medication was made and blood tests were ordered.</p>
        
            <p>Bremner was to return to the psychiatrist on 5 October.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Robb found Bremner should have been assessed by a psychiatrist on the day of the Te Awamutu attack, but there was no evidence to show the delay impacted on the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>He said for Bremner to be admitted under compulsory care he needed to be mentally disordered on 28 September, but he was not.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner found Bremner, who always expressed remorse for his actions, was taking his medication.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no obvious error or omission in Bremner's care between his last appointment and the murders.</p>
        
            <p>"If Ross was showing symptoms supportive of an ongoing decline, I consider it highly likely that his attentive parents would have voiced their concerns about this as their previous communications had demonstrated.</p>
        
            <p>"The result leaves me to conclude that Ross was simply not presenting with symptoms of acute decline until his tragic actions on 4 October, 2016."</p>
        
            <p>He did not find an obligation for Bremner to meet WINZ to find work triggered the events.</p>
        
            <p>Instead he said the unpredictable illness - impacted by slight medication changes - caused Bremner's sudden and dramatic deterioration.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner made no formal recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>A lawyer acting for the Bremner family said he had been instructed not to speak to journalists.</p>
        
            <p>The Tuwhangai and O'Donnell whānau did not wish to participate in an inquest.</p>
        
            <p>Daughter Jo Kukutai previously told Checkpoint she forgave Bremner.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Waikato operations director Michelle Sutherland acknowledged the tragic event and the findings, noting no recommendations were made to Health NZ.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
