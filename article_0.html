            <p>PM Christopher Luxon is holding his first post-Cabinet media briefing this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He began with a cheerful "Well, kia ora, good afternoon everybody. Welcome to what is our very first press conference in the beginning of the 54th Parliament".</p>
        
            <p>Leader of the House Chris Bishop is also present to speak about business in Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say it's been a very busy three days for our new coalition govenrment which was sworn in on Monday ... it was a really special occasion for myself and I think for all my ministers that were sworn in on Monday," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he laid out his expectations of his ministers in yesterday's initial Cabinet meeting, "and reminded them of why were are all here, which is to deliver and get things done for the New Zealand people".</p>
        
            <p>"The last few years have been incredibly hard for so many New Zealanders, almost everyone is struggling with the cost of living. Just today we've seen again the Reserve Bank warning that high inflation means interest rates may have to be raised."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the government's work started today, "because today I am outlining our work plan for this coalition government's first 100 days in office. It is ambitious but it is necessary in order to bring about the relief to New Zealanders who have been doing it tough for way too long".</p>
        
            <p>"Put simply, that means more money in your pocket, safer homes and workplaces, better, faster and more reliable healthcare, and an education for your children that delivers them the better choices for their futures."</p>
        
            <p>Parliament will sit next week and begin to put in place the 49 actions in the plan, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The governor-general will give the speech from the throne next week to open the new Parliament. Bishop said the week will start on Tuesday with the election of the new speaker, with National nominating Gerry Brownlee for the role.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday at 11am, the MPs will meet for the state opening and governor-general's speech, other presiding officers will be elected, followed by the response from MPs - particularly, the party leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday will have the first Question Time at 2pm, followed by the continuation of the address in reply debate.</p>
        
            <p>"There are 42 maiden speeches in the new Parliament," Bishop said. "Not all the maiden speeches will be able to be done this side of Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>He said the final two weeks of the year for Parliament would include more of the debate, maiden speeches, and the Parliament moving into urgency.</p>
        
            <p>It is only two days since the new government was sworn in, but it has already faced national and international criticism over its plan to scrap smokefree legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Prime Minister has attacked media on more than one occasion since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>That prompted opposition leader Chris Hipkins to say Luxon had already lost control of his government.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
