        <h2>David Seymour touts ACT's deputy PM qualifications</h2>
        <p>
The ACT Party leader says having the second-largest government party with the second-biggest role makes sense - but it's still up for negotiation.

            <p>ACT Party leader David Seymour says having the second-largest government party with the second-biggest role makes sense - but it's still up for negotiation.</p>
        
            <p>National leader and incoming Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has continued to hold coalition talks in Auckland on Tuesday, hosting Seymour at his home.</p>
        
            <p>Discussions are now focused on ministerial responsibilities and Cabinet positions in an arrangement likely to a be a three-party coalition.</p>
        
            <p>The negotiating is likely to be centred on key positions like Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Ministers and Attorney-General, and the level of influence in crucial portfolios like Finance.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour, leaving the meeting shortly before midday, was asked if he wanted the position of Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there's a very clear agenda that the ACT Party is the second-largest party in the government and if there's a second role in the government that should go to the second party," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But having said that, a negotiation's a negotiation, and you never know your luck."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon on Monday said all three parties had agreed a policy platform, with ACT and New Zealand First now agreeing on one another's deals with National.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
