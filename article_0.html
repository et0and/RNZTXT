            <p>Donald Trump is safe and a shooter and bystander dead after multiple shots rang out at a rally by the Republican presidential candidate in Pennsylvania, reports say.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"</p>
        
            <p>Trump expressed thanks to law enforcement and condolences to the family members of a person in the crowd who was killed and another who was injured.</p>
        
            <p>Later the Secret Service reported that two spectators were critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>It said the shooter had fired from outside the venue.</p>
        
            <p>Trump said nothing was known about the shooter.</p>
        
            <p>"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country," Trump wrote.</p>
