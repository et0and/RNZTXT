            <p>Firefighters have contained multiple scrub fires that threatened homes in Canterbury, and are continuing to work on the hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>A number of spot fires broke out along a railway line between Aylesbury and Darfield, west of Christchurch and were first reported about 4.30pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>By 7:30pm Fire and Emergency (FENZ) confirmed that houses in the area, and especially near Kirwee, were "no longer ... under immediate threat from fire", and no homes had been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>People were initially asked to keep away from the area, with police working on setting up road closures, but State Highway 73 would be reopened soon, FENZ said. However the train line remained shut.</p>
        
            <p>One of the blazes was believed to have started by sparks from a train travelling toward Darfield, and the fire crews had been working on multiple blazes at once.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said the police have lifted a cordon which was set up at the intersection of West Coast Road and Courtenay Road.</p>
        
            <p>Three helicopters were still at work on the hotspots, along with 17 ground crews, using pumps, tankers, smoke chasers and a Command Unit. Crews had come from from Kirwee, Darfield, West Melton, Hororata, Dunsandel, Springfield, Wigram, Canterbury High Country and the Christchurch Command unit.</p>
