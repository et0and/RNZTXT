            <p>Team New Zealand supporters in Barcelona are keeping a close eye on the weather ahead of what could be the last race in the America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand side only needs to win one more race to take home the trophy in the first-to-seven series.</p>
        
            <p>Racing was scheduled to begin at 1.10am Sunday NZT but was postponed due to a lack of wind. It was due to start at 1.50am.</p>

            <p>House chairman of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Hamish Williams, said supporters in Spain were checking the forecast in anticipation.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland University of Technology sailing professor Mark Orams said the forecast had been for little to no wind.</p>
        
            <p>"Now of course these are very experienced sailors, and all sailors understand and have experienced that you can't control the weather, and the wind, so you learn to switch off and switch on again when you need to, either off the water or on the water."</p>
        
            <p>Orams said the team would not be thrown by the forecast, and would use the time to prepare for the next race.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday morning, Team New Zealand clinched two back-to-back wins to give them a 6-2 lead over the British challengers.</p>
        
            <p>"It was nice to bounce back from a few mistakes the other day and put a couple of solid races on the board ... it was just awesome, we were loving it," skipper Peter Burling said on the America's Cup live broadcast.</p>
        
            <p>The British coach said the team's boat may have sustained some rudder damage during the second race, making it harder to handle Britannia, the boat which skipper Peter Ainslie and his billionaire backer Jim Ratcliffe hope will "bring the Cup home".</p>
        
            <p>"Hats off to the Kiwis ... they sailed two really nice races," Ainslie said as he and the team digested defeat, adding that they would have to "take that on the chin".</p>
