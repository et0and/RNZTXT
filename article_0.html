            <p>The man accused of stealing Te Whatu Ora Covid-19 data and using it to spread disinformation will stay behind bars after he was denied.</p>
        
            <p>Barry Young, 56, appeared in the Wellington District Court, charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora says an employee - who has no clinical background - downloaded data, which was published on an overseas website and did an interview alleging a cover-up of vaccine-related deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Young's case was pushed back to Monday afternoon after police announced they opposed bail, claiming a possible risk of interference to evidence.</p>
        
            <p>Police prosecutor Lydia McIvor told the court that police were in the process of downloading a large amount of information from cloud storage but that process would not be completed until tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was a risk that if released on bail, Young could have an opportunity to interfere with that process.</p>
        
            <p>HIs lawyer, Matthew Hague, argued there was no evidence he would interfere with the process, but the court could manage that risk with bail conditions, such as a 48-hour ban on using the internet.</p>
        
            <p>However, Judge Andrew Nicholls said he was satisfied there was a risk that could not be managed, and Young would be released automatically in the afternoon.</p>
