            <p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran on Wednesday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said in separate statements.</p>
        
            <p>The Islamist faction mourned the death of Haniyeh, who it said was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran".</p>
        
            <p>Hanieh attended Iran's new president's swearing in ceremony on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Early this morning, the residence of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was struck, resulting in his and one of his body guards' martyrdom. The cause is under investigation and will be announced soon," the Revolutionary Guards said.</p>
        
            <p>The assassination is a "cowardly act that will not go unpunished", Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV cited senior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk as saying.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh, 62, was a prominent member of the Hamas movement in the late 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.</p>
        
            <p>He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but he was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence.</p>
        
            <p>Haniyeh rejected his sacking as "unconstitutional", stressing that his government "would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people", and continued to rule in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the past several years.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
