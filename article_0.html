            <p>Drivers on the West Coast are being warned to limit travel to essential trips only, with widespread heavy rain, strong winds and snow creating hazardous conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Snow has closed State Highway 73 between Springfield and Otira. And State Highway 7 between Stillwater and Greymouth is closed due to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency says the flooding is widespread across the West Coast's highway network and has caused trees to fall and slips.</p>
        
            <p>A number of weather warnings are in place for most of the South Island and central North Island.</p>
