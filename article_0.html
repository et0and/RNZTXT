            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred's centre is expected to hit Australia on Saturday morning, with impacts already being felt across south-east Queensland and northern NSW.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were searching Friday night for a man who has been washed into floodwaters in northern NSW.</p>
        
            <p>About 2.20pm today, emergency services responded to reports that a four-wheel drive had been washed off a bridge into fast-running water whilst driving across Wild Cattle Creek Bridge off Old Coramba Road, Megan - approximately 23 kilometres north-east of Dorrigo.</p>
        
            <p>The male driver was able to get out of the vehicle and secure himself to a tree branch approximately 30 metres from the river bank.</p>
        
            <p>Officers from Coffs/Clarence Police District were able to talk with the man.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after 3pm the man was swept from the tree and seen to go beneath the water where he has not been sighted since.</p>
        
            <p>Catch up with today's live coverage:</p>
        
            <p>The cyclone continues to track slowly towards Australia, which means the impacts of the weather event will last longer.</p>
        
            <p>Australians in the two affected states have been experiencing persistent rainfall, strong winds and large swells. Tens of thousands of people are already without power in the Gold Coast and New South Wales.</p>
        
            <p>The category two system was expected to remain of similar intensity until the centre started to interact with the coast and islands. The most intense weather conditions are expected on Saturday morning.</p>
