        <h2>Live: PM speaks to media as 100th day in power looms</h2>
        <p>
It comes as the coalition enters the final stretch of its 100-day plan, ticking off the last jobs on its to-do list before the Friday deadline.
</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking to media at the regular post-Cabinet press conference.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the coalition enters the final stretch of its 100-day plan, ticking off the last jobs on its to-do list before the Friday deadline.</p>
        
            <p>Parliament will continue in its state of urgency this week, processing a raft of legislation.</p>
        
            <p>MPs will begin repealing the Auckland fuel tax, enabling more virtual participation in courtrooms, and introducing a fast-track resource consenting regime.</p>
        
            <p>Announcements are also expected about the government's transport priorities, and emergency housing.</p>
        
            <p>Updates could also be forthcoming about the coalition's promise to establish a National Infrastructure Agency, and the repeal of the Therapeutic Products Act.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, RNZ In Depth revealed officials warned the government it may face requests to bailout media companies if it failed to progress a law forcing digital platforms to pay local media for using their content.</p>
        
            <p>The briefings made it clear Media and Communications Minister Melissa Lee was on notice about media job losses, months before Warner Bros Discovery said last week it would close down Newshub in June with the loss of about 300 jobs.</p>
