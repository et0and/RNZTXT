            <p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello is expected to speak to journalists after quietly halving tax on heated tobacco products (HTPs).</p>
        
            <p>The move took effect this month, with Costello saying she wanted to see whether HTPs would be a useful cessation device similar to vaping - despite advisors warning there was no evidence to support their use for quitting smoking.</p>
        
            <p>She refused to be interviewed by RNZ, but is speaking to reporters in Christchurch about the launch of community beat teams.</p>
        
            <p>Police Assistant Commissioner Mike Johnson, Superintendent Lane Todd, Christchurch mayor Phil Mauger, and Business Canterbury chief executive Leeann Watson will also be at the launch event.</p>
