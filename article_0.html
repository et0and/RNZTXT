            <p>A leap year technical glitch is being blamed for causing outages at fuel stations across the country.</p>
        
            <p>Fuel provider Allied Petroleum and Gull say they are aware of nationwide technical issues affecting motorists across all fuel brands.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has spoken to one motorists who said he tried four petrol stations this morning and was told the outage was caused by leap day not being factored into the system.</p>
        
            <p>Gull spokesperson Julien Leys said it was a leap day issue with their technology provider.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, Gull said it was aware of a nationwide technical issue affecting motorists across all fuel brands where payment at the pumps is not working.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working closely with the technology provider to resolve this issue as quickly as possible for our customers.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the frustration our customers are feeling and we will have a discount day next week to make up for the inconvenience."</p>
