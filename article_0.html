        <h2>Watch: MPs savour 'so good' school lunches after menu reboot</h2>
        <p>
David Seymour says the beef rissoles dish is "one of the best meals that you're going to have".
</p>
        
            <p>About a dozen foil trays of school lunches took centre stage in Parliament's Banquet Hall on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The government was unveiling its school lunches reboot, rolling out a new menu it says will save more than $130 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>The beige display made a terrible first impression, with one colleague remarking the cold meals "smelt a bit off".</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't until after a few speeches, when reporters crowded around a table of hot meals, that the new school lunches truly shone.</p>
        
            <p>The heated food had a pleasant aroma and, upon a taste test, blew Associate Education Minister David Seymour's socks right off.</p>
        
            <p>"It is so good. I mean, it's one of the best meals that you're going to have."</p>
        
            <p>The meal in question, beef rissoles with mash and gravy, attracted an impressive 9.5/10 rating from Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>The butter chicken option wasn't far behind at 9.25/10 - but only because the rissoles were "even better", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm absolutely stoked and I think a lot of kids will be stoked when they see this. There's been a lot of trepidation. I think they're going to be blown away by this."</p>
        
            <p>It's hard to gauge just how stoked kids might be about the meals and there were none in sight at Tuesday's announcement.</p>
        
            <p>But ACT Minister Andrew Hoggard taste-tested a serving of mince and beans and reckoned his daughter would endorse them.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty sure my daughter will eat this. She's pretty fussy but she does like butter chicken and stuff like this."</p>
        
            <p>I took a handful of packaged school lunches back to the office to see what my colleagues thought.</p>
        
            <p>The chickpea curry attracted a "tasty enough" 6/10 rating from one reporter and a "not bad" 7/10 score from another.</p>
        
            <p>The beef rissoles that blew Seymour away attracted a "would eat because it's free" 5/10 from a colleague, and a "pretty good" 7/10 from me.</p>
        
            <p>Some schools would continue to prepare meals internally, while being able to access a range of government-negotiated wholesale ingredients.</p>
        
            <p>The transition to the new programme was expected to be ready by Term 1 2025.</p>
