            <p>RNZ understands the Ministry of Health is proposing to cut 134 jobs to meet the government's demands to reduce costs.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Doctor reports the ministry needs to reduce spending and is expected to slash its budget by $78 million between 2023/24 and 2024/25.</p>
        
            <p>Over a quarter of all positions could be directly affected.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Health staff are meeting on Thursday and Friday to discuss the proposal. Consultation will close on 26 April and a final decision will be made in June.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Social Development is expected to contact staff about voluntary redundancy options on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Next week the Department of Conservation and the Department of Internal Affairs will announce their plans for cuts, and the following week Oranga Tamariki will do the same.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association earlier said Ministry of Health cuts would mean the country would lose vital expertise when it needed it most.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA represents about 400 ministry staff and national secretary Kerry Davies said such a big cull was heartless and cruel.</p>
        
            <p>It could also destabilise the health system, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of these people have been working for the ministry and formed very strong bonds - particularly during the Covid period, giving their all to meet the demands of that pandemic crisis for New Zealand," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The work that is needed to prepare for the health needs of the country - that's really serious, important work. It's the backbone of the health system."</p>
