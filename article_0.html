            <p>A programme to combat loneliness over the phone is aiming to double its volunteer numbers, as demand for the service continues to grow.</p>
        
            <p>St John's free Caring Caller service has been running for more than 25 years, and has about 600 trained volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>They make regular phones calls to people who are feeling lonely or socially isolated, offering companionship and support.</p>
        
            <p>Bank worker Carolyn Reeves, who is a volunteer caring caller, said the regular calls mean a lot to people.</p>
        
            <p>"I know my person really enjoys it," she told Checkpoint. "She was actually just saying to me she really looks forwards to my phone calls every week, and I know I do too."</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said it gives them somebody to talk to, and get things off their chest too.</p>
        
            <p>She calls her person once a week at an agreed time, and said conversations can vary, but they usually last for about 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"We just talk about what's happening with her week, how her family are, what she's got planned, and making sure she's okay.</p>
        
            <p>"Because that's the big thing for me, making sure she's feeling safe, and if she's got any worries or concerns about anything.</p>
        
            <p>"We try not to get too personal about me, we talk about my work a bit as well. She knows my first name, but not my last name or where I live or where I work or anything. She knows I have children."</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said the interview process in order to join the programme was more extensive than she had anticipated.</p>
        
            <p>But they tried to match a person with someone with similar interests, such as gardening or cooking.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers were taught what they could not say, and who to reach out to if they had concerns for the person, Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said she was "100 percent" certain there were a lot of lonely people out there, and that the programme made a great difference in their lives.</p>
        
            <p>She said 15 minutes went a long way, and anyone interested should read up on the positive impacts the service has on the St John website.</p>
