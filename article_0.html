            <p>Whānau of the men killed in an Auckland house fire on Monday, say the pair were best friends who were "joined at the hip".</p>
        
            <p>Kiwa Ropitini-Fairburn, 25, and Tony Marsters, 24, died in the blaze on Freshney Place in Hillpark, shortly before 7am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had been living at the home with their friend, who survived the fire and is in Middlemore Hospital recovering from serious burns.</p>
        
            <p>Ropitini-Fairburn had been a "loved member" of Kaihaka Kapa Haka group, founder and owner Eru Rarere-Wilton said.</p>
        
            <p>He noted Ropitini-Fairburn travelled to places, including China and Italy, to perform with the group.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwa was my wife's nephew and lived with us for a bit before moving into that house with his best friends."</p>

            <p>Rarere-Wilton said he was at the hospital with other whānau members of Ropitini-Fairburn, while they waited for his body to be released to them.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all come as a shock. He was such a loving and beautiful soul and so talented.</p>
        
            <p>"He had an amazing singing voice and when we were in China they all called him the karaoke king."</p>
        
            <p>Learning of the deaths of Ropitini-Fairburn and Marsters was "deepely saddening", Rarere-Wilton said.</p>
        
            <p>Parents of the sole survivor of the fire spoke to journalists at the scene on Monday, and said they were "devastated" by the deaths of their son's friends.</p>
        
            <p>Pana Rangitaawa, the survivor's dad, said his son was expected to recover although he would need plastic surgery.</p>

            <p>"I don't know what to say ... I'm waiting for other family to arrive. We still don't know what's actually happened," he said through his tears.</p>
        
            <p>He said his mother and his 91-year-old grandmother usually lived at the house along with the three others.</p>
        
            <p>Jonathan Asafo, who lives two minutes from the fire scene, was on his way to drop off his son in daycare when he saw the flames.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw the whole house on fire and then I quickly reversed back and seeing as no one was on the road and no one knew the house was on fire, I quickly ... drove up the driveway and I started tooting my horn and then calling, running around for any response."</p>
        
            <p>He saw a truck in the driveway, and with flames coming out of the house he ran to the neighbour's house and alerted them.</p>
        
            <p>By the time he returned, a survivor had made it onto the back lawn. He had been sleeping downstairs, but he feared for his two friends who had been sleeping upstairs, Asafo said.</p>
        
            <p>The young man was in shock, and the skin had burnt off his hands, Asafo said.</p>

            <p>He escaped the fire after hearing Asafo's horn.</p>
        
            <p>"He quickly went through the back door ... [he was] fully in shock."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Daniel Newman, who had dealt with the family previously on storm water issues, said the deaths were devastating.</p>
        
            <p>He said the family were engaged members of the community.</p>
        
            <p>Police and fire investigators were still working to determine how the fire started.</p>
