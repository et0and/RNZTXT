            <p>Waimakariri mayor Dan Gordon is calling for the government to apply the brakes on the Fast-track Approvals Bill.</p>
        
            <p>While the Waimakariri District Council supports the intent of the legislation, it has called on the government to "slow down" and reconsider its approach.</p>
        
            <p>"We agree there is merit in streamlining the multiple consenting and permissions processes that would apply under a range of legislation that are typically required for large and/or complex projects," Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We also feel the purpose of the Bill should be amended and expanded to include provisions around safeguarding the environment, and recognising local knowledge, experience and priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"We certainly don't want to lose local decision making."</p>
        
            <p>He suggested the government's objectives could be achieved by amending the existing fast-track process under the Resource Management Act.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions closed last month on the government's Fast-track Approvals Bill, which aimed to cut red tape for major infrastructure projects.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon also called for a moratorium on private plan changes while a district plan was under review "to ensure the process is not undermined".</p>
        
            <p>In the latest amendment to the Resource Management Act, developers of large infrastructure projects will be able to apply to the government for a fast-tracked consent, bypassing the normal council consenting process.</p>
        
            <p>An expert panel will be appointed to give recommendations, but ministers will make the final decision.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said his council supported the clause for having a local representative on the expert panel to ensure local views were considered.</p>
        
            <p>"Applying local district knowledge would be advantageous to the decision making of ministers, and reflect local knowledge, priorities, and aspirations."</p>
        
            <p>But the council believed the timeframe of 10 working days for parties, including councils, to provide comments was too short as it limited a council's ability to consult stakeholders or seek professional advice.</p>
        
            <p>In a submission on the Bill, Environment Canterbury said it supported the intent of the legislation.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was concerned about reduced opportunities for public participation, reduced protection for mana whenua, political influence in decision-making and the impact on councils.</p>
        
            <p>In granting power to government ministers to make the final decision, the legislation went against a fundamental principal of New Zealand's democratic system, the regional council said.</p>
        
            <p>"Separation of powers acts as an important check and balance on the system by ensuring power is not concentrated within any single branch of government.</p>
        
            <p>"This blurring of powers poses risks to the legitimacy of the fast-track process and a better approach would be to make the expert panels responsible for the decisions on applications."</p>
        
            <p>The Hurunui and Kaikōura district councils chose to endorse the Canterbury Mayoral Forum's submission, rather than making their own.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu has expressed concern the legislation could give ministers the ability to grant consents for projects which were inconsistent with the iwi's Treaty of Waitangi settlements.</p>
