        <h2>Unexpected bright aurora surprises and thrills</h2>
        <p>
Aurora fans have been treated to an unexpectedly bright display lighting up the skies, with photographers capturing the lights as far north as the Bay of Plenty.

            <p>Aurora fans have been treated to an unexpectedly bright display lighting up the skies, with photographers capturing the lights as far north as the Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>The US government's Space Weather Prediction Centre said overnight Saturday into Sunday (New Zealand time) their instruments observed changes in the geomagnetic field up to level G4 on the-scale (one is the lowest and five is the highest) - enough to be seen from some populated areas.</p>
        
            <p>Photographers posted pictures of the colourful lights - which are often able to be recorded by cameras even when they can't be seen with the naked eye - as far north as Nelson, Wellington and Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Belle managed to get some lucky shots of the Southern Lights from Springston, south of Christchurch shortly before 3am on Saturday, as she was up early for an airport trip.</p>
        
            <p>Her children, aged 6 and 4 years old, loved seeing the colourful lights captured through the phone's camera, she said.</p>

            <p>Nick Keizerwaard watched the display from Lake Henry in Te Anau, both through his camera lens and without it.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think anyone was expecting it to pop off as big as it did. You could see early in the evening that there was a fair bit of power [and] colours visible by the naked eye; but things really spiked around 1:30am.</p>
        
            <p>"When it peaked early this morning, you could easily see the vibrant reds and pale greens ... it was a really pretty display."</p>
        
            <p>Keizerwaard said learning to photograph aurora is challenging.</p>
        
            <p>"Like trying to photograph a fast-moving target, you're constantly having to change/adjust your camera settings to capture the action; it's a fine balancing act ... but I enjoy the learning process."</p>
        
            <p>Emma Jenkinson was also thrilled to capture the geomagnetic lights early on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"Last night was a bit unexpected, I just happened to be heading home and noticed the glow. [The] camera showed up the colours."</p>
        
            <p>She snapped her shots at 2:30am in Halfmoon Bay on Rakiura - Stewart Island.</p>
        
            <p>The US Space Weather Prediction Centre posted that while more geomagnetic activity is expected overnight into Sunday, it's only expected to reach G1 - not high enough for aurora hunters to get excited.</p>
