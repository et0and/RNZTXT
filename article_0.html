            <p>New details on the huge deficit facing New Zealand hospitals have been revealed in a document dump by health authorities this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>More than 450 pages of financial reports have been released - mostly monthly financial reports from Health New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Overspending had dropped from $163m in July to $149m in August.</p>
        
            <p>The papers showed April was a turnaround month, where Health NZ went from expecting a big surplus to a $1.4 billion deficit that the government has promised to handle with impacting the front line.</p>
        
            <p>The papers reveal a panicked tone.</p>
        
            <p>"We are intensely focused on managing this situation," one report said.</p>
        
            <p>But Health NZ was warning of "fundamental deficiencies" in its systems that made cost controls difficult.</p>
        
            <p>The newly-released papers show that a March monthly report had Health NZ still forecasting a surplus of half a billion dollars. March was when Health Minister Shane Reti has said he found out for the first time massive overspending that would incur a $1.4b deficit by mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>The board was swiftly sacked and Dr Lester Levy was appointed a commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>Stat holiday costs over Christmas and later holidays added significant costs.</p>
        
            <p>The reports said there were three main drivers of the deficit, including such one-off costs, an unfunded pay equity payment that did not come through by July of more than $400m, and writing off of Covid stocks.</p>
        
            <p>Official Information Act papers previously reported by RNZ showed Treasury and the ministry were aware in early 2024 that they did not have visibility of just what was going on, even to the extent that HNZ's information for Budget 2024 was inadequate, with the ministry pleading with it on 2 February to get vital data to it by a 15 February cut-off.</p>
        
            <p>The papers stated: "The underlying expenditure run rate in April has deteriorated dramatically, circa $100m per month, due to additional hours being paid for largely additional nursing FTE although vacancies in all staff categories have reduced."</p>
        
            <p>One impact has been infrastructure capital spend. This has been much less, at only about half the $1.5 billion budgeted.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
