            <p>A man has been shot in the legs trying to stop people breaking into vehicles in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>A resident told RNZ they heard shots ring out, losing count of how many there were, and saw a person running up the street.</p>
        
            <p>Rachel Mariu said she told her children they were fireworks to calm them down, and locked her doors and windows.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all a bit of a tight-knit community, we all know each other's kids, so yeah, we were all, like, kind of on edge last night knowing that, you know, we've all got families.</p>

            <p>"I knew straight away where it came from, so I was like, 'Oh, these poor babies, poor whanau."</p>
        
            <p>Mariu says car theft and break-ins were a constant worry in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The incident took place on Monday night in Tītahi Bay, and police are appealing for information.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said officers were called to a Dimock Street address at about 10.20pm, with initial inquiries suggesting "the man was shot after disturbing two people attempting to break into cars on the street".</p>
