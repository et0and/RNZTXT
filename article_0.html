            <p>The worst of the wild weather appears to be over for the capital, following a brief but powerful storm on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple roads were blocked in Hutt Central after extensive damage by weather, with multiple reports of trees down over roads, glass across roads, and extensive damage to roofs, windows and cars, police said. People are advised to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, two people were in hospital, one in a serious condition, after suffering injuries as the storm hit Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, eyewitnesses described a tornado whipping through the Hutt Valley as heavy rain, hail and thunderstorms lashed the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Windows were blown out of a bus in Lower Hutt, but no one was hurt.</p>
        
            <p>The storm front hit the region after battering Canterbury earlier this morning, and is moving up the east coast of the country.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning earlier in the afternoon was later downgraded around 5pm to a watch, covering Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Tararua, Kapiti-Horowhenua, Wairarapa, Wellington and Marlborough. By 5.45pm, the watch region had been reduced to just Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and Tararua.</p>
        
            <p>Rainfall up to 30mm/h, hail and wind gusts over 110km/h were possible in Tararura, the forecaster said, with flash-flooding possible.</p>
