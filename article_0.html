            <p>Police searching for items as part of the investigation into the death of baby Ru in Lower Hutt now say they were deliberately removed from the scene, which was 'cleaned' before officers arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Toddler Ruthless-Empire Ahipene-Wall, also known as Baby Ru, died just before he would have turned two. It was found he had suffered violent injuries at a home in the suburb of Taita before his death.</p>
        
            <p>Police have now issued a new appeal for anyone who had seen items connected to the case, or who knows where they are to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>A hard drive, power back up unit, duvet cover and strap were among the items they want to find, which they believe were taken from the Poole Street house.</p>
        
            <p>"Attempts have been made to clean and alter the crime scene before police arrived ... people seen using a grey-green 1994 Nissan Sentra, registration TE6972, were responsible for disposing of this evidence," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The Nissan travelled to and from the Poole Street address three times, after Ru was taken to hospital on 22 October and before Police were able to secure the scene."</p>
        
            <p>
Baby Ruthless-Empire died just before his second birthday.

            <p>A long length of fabric was also being searched for.</p>
        
            <p>"Although not a direct cause of his death, the fact that such an item was around his neck is incredibly concerning, and we appeal for information from anyone who has seen this item or what it was used for," police said.</p>
        
            <p>What the police are looking for:</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was asked to call Police on 105, or to visit their Update Report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number 231022/1708. Information could also be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or on their website.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
