            <p>Holiday makers have been left adrift after six passenger ferry crossings were cancelled today due to strong winds and large swells in the Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander cancelled two morning sailings of the Aratere while Bluebridge has cancelled five sailings today, including a freight-only crossing.</p>
        
            <p>The Aratere was supposed to depart Wellington at 6.15am and return from Picton at 11am.</p>
        
            <p>On its website Interislander said all passengers had been moved to other sailings and it was putting on additional sailings tomorrow morning.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said customers affected by its cancellations would be contacted about alternative sailings.</p>
        
            <p>It warned the "unsettled" weather causing the disruptions could last until Monday evening.</p>
