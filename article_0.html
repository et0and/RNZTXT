            <p>The Health Ministry has uncovered the public servant who leaked information to RNZ which contradicted claims being made by a Cabinet minister.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ last month reported on a Ministry document which showed the Associate Health Minister Casey Costello had requested advice on freezing the annual increase in tobacco tax.</p>
        
            <p>That was despite Costello saying she had not sought advice on that.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Director-General of Health Diana Sarfati said the individual responsible for the leak had been identified after an investigation - and was no longer working at the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>She said the ministry's job was to work to the direction of the government and any efforts to undermine that eroded public trust.</p>
        
            <p>In a separate statement, the Deputy Public Service Commissioner Heather Baggott said she supported the strong action, describing the leaking of official information as "unacceptable".</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
