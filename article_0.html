            <p>The condition of a main arterial route out of Invercargill has been described as "embarrassing" by a city councillor who wants action.</p>
        
            <p>Ian Pottinger took aim at Bluff Highway (State Highway 1) during an Invercargill City Council meeting this week where a response to the government's draft policy statement on transport was discussed.</p>
        
            <p>The council has until 2 April to submit on the plan, which it said prioritised the maintenance of state highways and local roads.</p>
        
            <p>Following a recent trip south of the city, Pottinger believed the council should push hard on getting better outcomes for that stretch of road.</p>
        
            <p>"I really couldn't believe NZTA (Waka Kotahi) could let it get that bad.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've got to be talking to our own local MP. We've got to be going stronger than a submission.</p>
        
            <p>"I could not believe how bad that road is, and what it has to deliver."</p>
        
            <p>The highway is the only route between Invercargill and Bluff, and provides a key link for large stakeholder South Port.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Tom Campbell pointed to the amount of money going through Bluff as reason enough for the council to strengthen its letter to the government.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the interesting things is the dollar value of exports through Bluff has doubled in the last 10 years," he said, noting that inflation needed to be factored in.</p>
        
            <p>"About $2.4 billion of goods go throughout Bluff every year."</p>
        
            <p>In its submission to the government, the council said it supported the call of many South Island mayors for State Highway 1 to be recognised as a road of national significance.</p>
        
            <p>It made a special request for the section between Invercargill and Bluff to be recognised in view of its safety rating and importance as the only route in and out of Bluff.</p>
        
            <p>The community was "effectively isolated" whenever the road was closed due to an accident, and low-lying areas were at risk of climate change, the letter said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is essential that further investment is made into this area in order to achieve economic, resilience and safety outcomes," it read.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past five years, there had been nine serious crashes on the section of Bluff Highway beginning at Elles Road in Invercargill - three of which were fatal.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty percent of traffic on the road was from heavy vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors ultimately resolved for staff to rework the letter - signed by Campbell - to strengthen the message they were trying to send.</p>
