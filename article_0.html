            <p>The body of British TV presenter and healthy living advocate Michael Mosley has been found on the Greek island of Symi, a deputy mayor on the island said on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley had been missing for several days.</p>
        
            <p>Police spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou had earlier said that the body of a person believed to be Mosley had been found in the area of Agia Marina, but that identification was pending.</p>
        
            <p>"The mayor of the island and a state TV ERT journalist were filming the area of Agia Marina, when they spotted the body," deputy mayor Nikitas Grillis said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is certainly him."</p>
        
            <p>Another police official said the body had been found on rocky terrain, close to the sea, dismissing earlier reports that said he was found in a cave. Police were investigating the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley, 67, who endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>He had disappeared after setting out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi.</p>
        
            <p>Teams of police, firefighters and volunteers had been searching for him for five days, using drones, a sniffer dog and divers.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Mosley's wife, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley, had told the BBC that the days since her husband went missing had been "the longest and most unbearable".</p>
        
            <p>"Our family are so incredibly grateful to the people of Symi, the Greek authorities and the British Consulate who are working tirelessly to help find Michael," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not lose hope."</p>
        
            <p>Bailey Mosley had been searching the island, assisted by friends. The couple's four children had also travelled to Symi to help with the search.</p>

Mosley presented a popular health podcast called Just One Thing.

            <p>Greek police spokesman Constantina Dimoglidou earlier told the Daily Mail that Mosley may have tripped and fallen, or even been bitten by a snake.</p>
        
            <p>"There is just no trace of him. None whatsoever. And that means that for us at least, every potential scenario is open and being investigated."</p>
        
            <p>The terrain, which was described as very rugged, made search efforts difficult, officials told local media.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley was born in India but grew up in England, working for a short time as a banker before going to medical school.</p>
        
            <p>He had been working at the BBC since 1985, where he produced and presented a number of medical shows.</p>
        
            <p>One, a four-part series called The Human Face, was nominated for an Emmy in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>Mosley wrote several popular books on health and dieting, including The Fast Diet and The 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet.</p>
        
            <p>He took up intermittent fasting after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2012 and was one of the first people to make the 5:2 diet - where people restrict their calories for two days of the week and eat healthily on the other five - popular.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared on New Zealand TV screens in the programme Trust Me, I'm a Doctor and fronted the podcast Just One Thing.</p>
