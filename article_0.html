            <p>Two men have been rescued after a fishing trawler sank suddenly in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf.</p>
        
            <p>The trawler was returning to port when it started taking on water near Moturekareka Island, just south of Kawau Island, just before 9pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Kawau Volunteer Coastguard said the skipper raised the alarm and turned the vessel towards shore.</p>
        
            <p>However, the trawler sank so quickly only the bow was still above water when the rescue boat arrived.</p>
        
            <p>The two fishermen on board, who were shocked but unhurt, had already made it to safety on a yacht anchored nearby.</p>
        
            <p>The Coastguard crew transferred the men to a second trawler that arrived later at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said it was "a salutary lesson" that disaster at sea could happen very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>He urged boaties to avoid the Kawau Bay area due a large amount of debris floating on the surface, including nets and boat parts.</p>
        
            <p>Vessels that were caught in a net or holed by floating debris could end up in the same situation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The call for help came in at 8.49pm and a volunteer crew was at the dock and ready to go within 35 minutes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He described it as "a great response" on the part of volunteers and also passed on "big thanks to the other boats that helped".</p>
