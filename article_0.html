            <p>MetService has issued orange heavy rain warnings for the Tasman, Marlborough, Buller and Westland districts, along with Mt Taranaki in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The heaviest falls were expected in Tasman, northwest of Motueka, with 350 to 450 millimetres of rain forecast, possibly more about the ranges and 150 to 250 mm elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Peak rates of 25 to 35 mm/h expected about the ranges from late Thursday morning and there was a moderate chance of it being upgraded to a Red Warning.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain was also forecast for the Marlborough District, with 200 to 300 mm of rain forecast about the Richmond and Bryant ranges and 100 to 150 mm elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Peak rates of 20 to 30 mm/h expected, mainly about the Richmond and Bryant ranges and there was a low chance it will be upgraded to a Red Warning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said streams and rivers could rise rapidly. Surface flooding, slips, and difficult driving conditions were also possible.</p>
        
            <p>People were advised to clear drains and gutters to prepare for the heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>MetService also warned to avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday the rain would continue to move across the country from the west by a low.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there was a high chance the watches for the South Island would be upgraded to warnings as the weather system progresses.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island the heavy rain forecast for the west of the island including Taranaki would be some of the most significant rain seen this year with parts of the country still officially in drought.</p>
        
            <p>Northland, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Central Plateau would also be hit from Thursday and MetService advised there would also be strong winds for parts of the island.</p>
