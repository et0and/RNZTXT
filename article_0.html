            <p>Hurricane Milton has reached Florida's east coast after making landfall on the west this afternoon (NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>Milton's eyewall has winds screaming at nearly 200km/h with higher gusts. However, it has been downgraded to a category 1 hurricane.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another storm in the Atlantic, Leslie, has strengthened into a category 2 hurricane and may intensify into a major hurricane, the US National Hurricane Centre says.</p>
