        <h2>Live: State of emergency as homes flood, roads shut across Dunedin</h2>
        <p>
Evacuated residents have spent the night at shelters as the region braces for a further 70-100mm of rain.
</p>
        
            <p>Otago is bracing for another day of record rainfall, with MetService warning of life-threatening conditions from swollen rivers.</p>
        
            <p>The red heavy rain alert issued for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha is not due to expire until 9pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Another 70 to 100 millimetres is forecast to fall, meaning the region will have received more than two months' worth of rain over three days.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, a state of emergency was declared in Dunedin, and evacuation centres were opened for residents whose homes were threatened by flooding.</p>
        
            <p>At least 18 roads were closed across the city due to flooding and slips, with further closures announced in Clutha District.</p>
