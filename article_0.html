        <h2>Councils must manage landslip risks better - GNS</h2>

GNS Science says councils should be more proactive to avoid costly and potentially fatal landslides.

            <p>GNS Science says councils should be more proactive to avoid costly and potentially fatal landslides.</p>
        
            <p>The institute has updated its land-use planning guidance which suggests ways councils should manage the risks of future slips.</p>
        
            <p>"Events over the last year have shown that the risk from landslides is substantial," Engineering Geologist Dr Saskia de Vilder said.</p>
        
            <p>This weekend marks one year since Auckland's devastating Anniversary Weekend flooding, and is just a few weeks before the first anniversary of Cyclone Gabrielle which caused destruction throughout the entire country.</p>

            <p>"Landslides on average cost us about $250 million a year. The cost from Cyclone Gabrielle that's attributed to landslides is $1.5 billion."</p>
        
            <p>She said councils had to start considering landslides earlier in their decision-making processes.</p>
        
            <p>"The main recommendation is that councils undertake susceptibility mapping, and what I mean by that is they identify areas they think might be susceptible to landslides," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only where a landslide starts, but what they might impact downslope."</p>
        
            <p>That early work could save millions of dollars in repairs if future weather events caused slips, she explained.</p>

            <p>"One of the main reasons that we're releasing this guidance is to make sure that we use land use planning as a tool to reduce our risk from landslides," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once they've identified areas where landslides might occur they can start to do further analysis, or change how they zone land or what activities they allow on that land."</p>
        
            <p>Dr de Vilder said prospective homeowners should have access to information about potential landslide risks.</p>
        
            <p>"Landslide hazards [should be] considered early on, so when people are looking at purchasing land there might already be information available from the council about landslide hazards," she said.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Senior Natural Hazards Planner Scott Kelly said it was important to bring the guidance up to date.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about preventing development," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about having the right information to inform the right development in the right place."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped smarter planning could prevent the catastrophic damage seen throughout the North Island in early 2023 from happening again.</p>
