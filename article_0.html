        <h2>Watch live: Greens speak as Darleen Tana removed from Parliament</h2>
        <p>
The party's leaders wrote to the speaker late last week, making use of the waka-jumping provision.

            <p>Darleen Tana has officially been ejected from Parliament after the Green Party co-leaders wrote to the speaker late last week, making use of the waka-jumping provision.</p>
        
            <p>"Last week, 185 Green Party delegates, representing our thousands of members across the country, came to unanimous consensus to put this request to the speaker," Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said.</p>
        
            <p>"This, of course, went well above and beyond the requirements in the law. We have always been and remain a proudly grassroots-led party."</p>
        
            <p>Tana will be replaced in Parliament by Benjamin Doyle, the next on the party's list.</p>
