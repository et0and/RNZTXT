        <h2>Watch live: Abuse in State Care announcement</h2>
        <p>
Erica Stanford is set to reveal the next steps of the government's reponse to the inquiry into historical abuse.
</p>
        
            <p>The minister in charge of the government's reponse to a major inquiry into historical abuse in state care is set to make an announcement.</p>
        
            <p>Erica Stanford is set to speak from the Beehive at 12.30pm on Wednesday. The announcement will be streamed at the top of this page.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after survivors of abuse in care were left feeling deflated two weeks on from the Crown's official apology.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission gave the government until late November to publish responses to each of the 138 recommendations in its report.</p>
        
            <p>That deadline passed, though Stanford had long signalled she believed the four-month deadline was not enough time.</p>
