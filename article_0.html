            <p>The 42-year old man charged with the murder of a husband and wife in the Auckland suburb of Ellerslie has been granted interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>Fuk-Fu Kwok, 66, was found dead in his home on Monday night. The body of his wife Mei Han Chong has been found in the early hours of this morning in the Greenhithe area.</p>
        
            <p>Their family car was also found at an address in Glenfield with different number plates.</p>
        
            <p>The accused, who resides at a different address in Glenfield, was arrested in Hamilton last night.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared via audio-visual link in the Auckland District Court before Judge Manuel today.</p>
        
            <p>He will next appear on 29 November.</p>
        
            <p>Watch a media conference with police from earlier today here:</p>
        
            <p>Chong and the car were found early this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland city police have sadly located 67-year-old Mei Han Chong deceased. As a result of enquiries, a male has been taken into custody overnight. This Glenfield man, who we believe to be involved, was identified and located by detectives in Hamilton late last night and has now been charged with two counts murder," Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>Police believe multiple people were involved in Kwok's murder, due to the nature of his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>They could not yet say the same about Chong, until her post mortem is carried out tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard remains at the Ellerslie address.</p>
        
            <p>There will be an increased police presence across Auckland as the investigations are ongoing, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage police are not ruling out further charges and arrests.</p>
        
            <p>He would not provide any more detail about the arrested man, as the matter is before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of hours of CCTV footage were reviewed, and helped to lead to the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team identified activity near the Celtic Crescent homicide scene on the night of the alleged homicide, which has allowed us to scour hours and hours of CCTV footage, which located a vehicle of interest. We're of course devastated to locate Mrs Chong in these circumstances, and we're now providing support to a son who has lost both his mother and his father," Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle registration plates on Chong's car had not been found but based on CCTV footage it had different registration numbers at different times, Beard said.</p>

            <p>At a briefing on Thursday Detective Inspector Beard told the media that police held grave fears for Chong and suspected that she was also a victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's son said it was totally out of character for her not to contact them.</p>
        
            <p>Extending his condolences to the theatre team at North Shore Hospital, Te Whatu Ora WaitematƒÅ operations interim group director Brad Healey said Kwok was a theatre nurse and a "respected colleague".</p>
        
            <p>"Joseph was a valued and well-liked member of our North Shore Hospital family and I would like to acknowledge his exceptional service. Our hearts are with those who worked with him. They are feeling this loss immensely and we will ensure they are supported through this period.</p>
        
            <p>"It has now been confirmed that Joseph's wife Mei has sadly passed also. Our thoughts are with Joseph and Mei's family at this very difficult time. As has been reported in the media, Joseph's death is the subject of a police investigation and it is not appropriate to comment further at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Newly elected Mt Roskill MP Carlos Cheung said it was a tragedy, and acknowledged police for "their very efficient work to find the potential suspect".</p>
