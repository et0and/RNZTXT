        <h2>Govt must act to break supermarket duopoly - consumer watchdog</h2>
        <p>
Even more drastic change than the grocery commissioner's plans to ramp up regulation and enforcement is needed, Consumer NZ says
</p>
        
            <p>The government must break up the supermarket duopoly and stop major players enjoying high profits at the expense of consumers, a consumer watchdog is urging.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission's grocery report released on Wednesday revealed competition in the sector has not improved and margins and profits are too high.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ said it supports the grocery commissioner Pierre van Heerden's plans to ramp up regulation and enforcement - which could come with fines of up to $10 million.</p>
        
            <p>But even more drastic change was needed, Consumer NZ head of research and advocacy Gemma Rasmussen said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, it is the role of government to step in and talk about structural change and market break-ups, if they feel that the supermarkets aren't complying."</p>
        
            <p>It was disappointing the supermarkets had not made the changes the commission wanted to see, she said.</p>

Critics says high supermarket profits are coming at the cost of New Zealand consumers who are doing it tough in a cost-of-living crisis.

            <p>But Woolworths and Foodstuffs both said they had made changes to bring better value for consumers.</p>
        
            <p>That was clearly not enough for van Heerden, who said the report painted a concerning picture of the $25 billion sector.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Andrew Bayly said the commissioner was right to use his powers more forcibly and the government would support him to do so.</p>
        
            <p>But government intervention to break up the duopoly would be a "last resort", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we'd like to do is support the commissioner in the next phase two of his approach: to strengthen wholesale arrangements, make sure that supplier arrangements are good as well, and bring more transparency around the sector," Bayly said.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission would, over the next year, investigate the supermarket giants' "land banking" - holding land without actively using it, to ward off competitors buying it up.</p>

            <p>Bayly said he would be watching that closely.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's found that those land holdings are contrary to the Commerce Act, then I would expect the Commerce Commission to give me advice around that.</p>
        
            <p>"That may involve some divestiture if that's the case."</p>
