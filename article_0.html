            <p>Police have used tear gas and stun grenades on rioters at an airport near Nouméa as the chaos in New Caledonia stretches into its sixth day.</p>
        
            <p>Five people, including two police officers, have died and hundreds of people are injured amid clashes between authorities and pro-independence protesters.</p>
        
            <p>They were sparked by anger at a proposed new law that would allow French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for more than 10 years to vote - which some say will weaken the indigenous Kanak vote.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday evening, local media reported rioters on the field at Magenta Airport had thrown hammers and stones at police.</p>
        
            <p>Officers responded with tear gas and stun grenades.</p>
        
            <p>Police warned that if that was not enough to control the situation, the military was authorised to use lethal weapons.</p>

            <p>A New Caledonia government crisis unit spokesperson said there was enough food in the country to last two months.</p>

            <p>NC la 1ère is strengthening the security surrounding its journalists after an incident where a reporting team was attacked by about 20 hooded men.</p>
        
            <p>A reporter said she and a camera operator were attacked on Friday morning near the centre of Nouméa.</p>
        
            <p>The men ordered them to leave, then smashed the windows of their car, the reporter told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>They also snatched the camera operator's camera from his hands and threatened him with a stone.</p>
        
            <p>The journalists were not injured and were rescued by a passing motorist.</p>
        
            <p>NC la 1ère director of news content Olivier Gélin told AFP the station's journalists would be accompanied by security agents until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>"We will now take people to protect the teams during filming, in addition to the classic protections in this type of situation, helmets and bulletproof vests," he said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Coralie Cochin said her husband, a reporter for AFP, was photographing the burnt ruins of a shop when a man started throwing rocks at him.</p>
        
            <p>An intern who had been working with Cochin at the local media outlet, La Premier, was also attacked on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>She was also rescued by a passing motorist, but lost her belongings in the ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>A resident of Portes de Fer, in the centre of Noumea, said it was terrifying to witness the chaos unfold.</p>
        
            <p>Hari Simon told RNZ Pacific that businesses, houses, car companies and factories in the area had all been burnt.</p>
        
            <p>It was "a very frightening scene punctuated by the sound of gun shots that broke the silence of the night", he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was "a threatening sense of danger looming in the air", he said.</p>
        
            <p>At night, people roamed the streets with guns, burning down buildings and exchanging fire with police officers.</p>
        
            <p>However, since the arrival of the first batch of military policy officers (gendarmes) on Wednesday, the situation had died down a little, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Residents did not expect the violence to escalate so quickly and were caught off guard, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we became fully aware of the gravity of the situation that Monday night and more specifically in the early hours of Tuesday morning, road blocks had already been erected."</p>
