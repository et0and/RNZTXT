            <p>Much of the country can look forward to brighter skies this weekend, with temperatures into the 30s expected for Central Otago for Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said Boxing Day was exceptionally wet across the eastern coast of the North Island, with more than 100mm of rainfall recorded in the Tair훮whiti ranges.</p>
        
            <p>"Gisborne alone received more than a month's worth of rain in just one day, pushing its December rainfall total to over 200mm - close to setting a record for the wettest December there since records began in 1937," a MetService meteorologist said.</p>
        
            <p>The rain was mostly expected to ease on Friday, but to linger in the Wairoa District where a heavy rain warning was in place through to midday Saturday</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the rain, southwesterly winds were expected to approach severe gale force in coastal areas of Hawke's Bay and Gisborne. A strong wind watch was in force for the period until 4am Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Central regions of New Zealand were also being pummelled by strong winds, and two Cook Strait ferry crossings were cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>But meteorologist John Law said clearer skies were on the horizon.</p>
        
            <p>"Saturday promises a dry and sunny day for most of New Zealand, particularly in the western North Island and the South Island," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, some cloud and lingering rain in the east, as well as increasing cloud in the far south, may dampen spirits slightly."</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago was poised to take the lead in temperatures, with Alexandra expected to reach 32째C on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, rain was forecast to return to the North Island early next week, bringing wet weather to the already saturated Hawke's Bay and Tair훮whiti regions.</p>
        
            <p>"As we approach New Year's Eve, it's a good idea to stay updated on the forecast, particularly for areas like Hawke's Bay and Gisborne, which may see a rainy end to 2024," Law said.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines organisers warned people heading to the New Year's music festival in Gisborne to drive and dress to the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We are anticipating some rain, wind and sun across the four days of the festival. So please dress accordingly, including Warm Clothing and Wet Weather clothing," a festival spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines runs from 29 to 31 December.</p>
