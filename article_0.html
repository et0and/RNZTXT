            <p>Hamish Kerr has won the high jump gold medal in a dramatic jump-off.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, he cleared 2.36m - a new national record.</p>
        
            <p>When both Kerr and American jumper Shelby McEwen missed 2.38m, it looked like the Kiwi had won gold.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the duo were forced into a jump-off, with whoever clearing first taking the title.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr eventually jumped clear at 2.34m, before doing a victory lap of the track at the Stade de France.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Lydia Ko claimed a gold medal - New Zealand's second of the day - with a win in the women's golf tournament just before 4am.</p>
        
            <p>She headed into the final round tied for first with Switzerland's Morgane MÃ©traux, but moved into outright gold medal position after the third hole and never relinquished her lead, finishing at 10-under with a lead of two shots.</p>
        
            <p>Her win came just hours after Dame Lisa Carrington triumphed in the great Paris Olympics showdown on the water.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Lisa won the K1 500m at the Tokyo Olympics, however, Aimee Fisher had beaten her at the distance twice this year, including at the last regatta before the Olympics, in Poland in late May.</p>
        
            <p>But Fisher was not strong enough in the final, and Dame Lisa swept to victory to claim her eighth Olympic gold medal, with Fisher coming in fourth.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr is hoping to become the first New Zealander to claim a high jump medal  in his final at 5.10am Sunday.</p>
