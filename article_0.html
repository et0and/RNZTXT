            <p>The Electoral Commission has handed investigation of National MP for New Plymouth David MacLeod's failure to report $178,394 in donations to police.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Friday, the Commission said MacLeod's original candidate return for the 2023 General Election on 13 February 2024 disclosed $29,268 in donations from seven separate donors.</p>
        
            <p>"On 20 May 2024, the Commission received an amended return. The total donations disclosed in the amended return are $207,662 from 24 separate donors."</p>
        
            <p>MacLeod - a backbench MP - unveiled the "inadvertent error" last month, and was stood down immediately from his roles on the Environment and Finance select committees.</p>
        
            <p>He said he thought the return he was filing was for the 2023 year only, so left out 18 donation he had received when he became a candidate the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>He also failed to disclose a $10,000 donation from 2023, which he said was a mistake he could not explain.</p>
        
            <p>He said he "always fully intended for these donations to be made public" and had never tried to hide them, having written to all donors indicating amounts over $1500 would be disclosed.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission confirmed the matter had been referred to police. It previously said this would be done "if in our view there has been a breach of the Electoral Act".</p>
        
            <p>"As this matter is now with the Police, the Electoral Commission will not be commenting further."</p>
        
            <p>Police will now investigate whether laws were broken, and consider any possible prosecution.</p>
