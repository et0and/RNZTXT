        <h2>Watch: Nicola Willis makes announcement about supermarket competition</h2>
        <p>
Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis is to announce government plans to combat the country's supermarket duopoly.
</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Willis spoke at the New Zealand Economics Forum in Hamilton and spelled out findings of a 2022 Commerce Commission report showing "competition between grocery retailers is muted, profits are high, product ranges are limited and shoppers pay higher prices than people in many other countries".</p>
        
            <p>Willis also noted New Zealand supermarkets were the most expensive for kitchen staples compared with the UK, Ireland and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Willis ruled out the government opening its own grocery chain and said the government could not force a third entrant to the market to break the country's supermarket duopoly.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year, Grocery Commissioner Pierre van Heerden said supermarket margins had increased, profits remained high and the two main operators, Foodstuffs and Woolworths, remained dominant.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to see more competition and sustained pressure on the major supermarkets to deliver better outcomes for consumers."</p>
        
            <p>He said in a competitive market retail margins growth would be limited, or reduce, with price competition.</p>
