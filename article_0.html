            <p>Underground rail construction of Auckland's City Rail Link (CRL) is 80 percent complete but there is no guarantee the November 2025 deadline will be met, the project's boss says.</p>
        
            <p>The CRL project is due to be handed over to Auckland Transport in November 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Preliminary work on the 3.4 kilometre track, spanning four underground stations, from downtown's Britomart to Mt Eden, began in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>City Rail Link Limited chief executive Sean Sweeney told Nine to Noon there was still a huge amount of testing that needed to take place before the underground could be opened to the public.</p>
        
            <p>"We're responsible, basically, for handing over a railway that is able to be operated by Auckland Transport," he said. "Once we've handed it over, they have to do a fair amount of work learning how to operate it so that it's ready for public operations."</p>
        
            <p>There was a fifty-fifty chance the project would not come in on time, Sweeney said.</p>
        
            <p>Adding a year to their deadline would provide a higher level of confidence, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If people wanted a guarantee, you'd have to put years onto that date (November 2025), if people wanted a locked in guarantee that was certain to be achieved, and that would be unwise."</p>
        
            <p>Advising of a date years out has proven to be a problem for international projects, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In March the CRL requested an extra $1.074 billion in funding, bringing the total cost to an estimated $5.493b. Until handover there was a risk of further cost blowouts, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone that said otherwise would either be or disingenuous, but the risks are getting smaller as we go through."</p>
