            <p>Tsunami waves of up to 3 metres are predicted to hit Japan after a 7.2 earthquake near Taiwan.</p>
        
            <p>The quake was very shallow, according to the Japan Meteorological Society.</p>
        
            <p>Japan has issued an evacuation advisory for the coastal areas near the southern prefecture of Okinawa over the tsunami warning.</p>
        
            <p>A tsunami of up to 3 metres was expected to reach Japan's southwestern coast around 10am (0100 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.</p>
        
            <p>There is no tsunami threat to New Zealand, GNS Science and NEMA have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The earthquake was also felt in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, and the power is out in some areas of the city, a witness has told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Its epicentre was in the waters off the eastern coastline of Taiwan, according to the country's Central Weather Administration.</p>
        
            <p>The tsunami has already reached Yonaguni island, in southwestern Japan, NHK has reported.</p>
        
            <p>Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about one-fifth of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.</p>
        
            <p>On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami. Those events triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
