            <p>At least 47 people were killed when an airliner veered off the runway and erupted into a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea's Muan International Airport on Sunday, a national fire official said.</p>
        
            <p>Two crew members have been rescued, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred as Jeju Air flight 7C2216, carrying 175 passengers and six crew on a flight from the Thai capital Bangkok, was landing shortly after 9am local time at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>At least 33 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, a fire official told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were found alive and rescue operations were still under way, a Muan fire official said. The official and the transport ministry could not confirm the reports of 28 dead. Yonhap said three people had been rescued.</p>

            <p>Authorities were working to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers included two Thai nationals, and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry.</p>
        
            <p>Aviation tracking site FlightRadar24 said the aircraft appeared to be a Boeing 737-800. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
