            <p>Three weeks into his new role as commissioner of Health New Zealand, Dr Lester Levy says the finances are worse than he thought.</p>
        
            <p>Levy was tasked with solving an estimated $1.4 billion overspend, and fixing a system many have described as broken, when he replaced the board at the end of May.</p>
        
            <p>As well as a massive budget blowout, Te Whatu Ora is facing a shortage of clinicians, overworked and burnt out staff, long waiting lists, and provinces and regions without adequate cover and having to resort to telehealth services.</p>
        
            <p>Levy told Nine to Noon some months the agency's deficit went beyond the estimated $130 million.</p>
        
            <p>Change needed to happen quickly, or the agency faced going broke in coming months.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, this is not a marathon, it's a sprint," he said. "We have to move really quickly to secure our financial position as quickly as possible to order to overcome this particular cash-flow issue that is hanging over us."</p>
        
            <p>It would need to be solved before Christmas, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But while financial issues were critical, "that's not the main show in town," Levy said - rather, "reducing waiting times, because New Zealanders are waiting too long".</p>
        
            <p>But three weeks in, he could not put a number on the shortage of health staff.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had launched a review to determine where staff shortages were most severe.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a review being undertaken right at the moment to determine if there are any areas that are potentially unsafe or challenging," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as I have that, I'll have a clearer view of whether there are any critical issues in relation to staff shortages."</p>
        
            <p>He said they should know more in the next month or two.</p>
