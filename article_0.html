        <h2>What happens when your town's cemetery runs out of space?</h2>
        <p>
With an average of two burials a week, Taruheru Cemetery is expected to be full within 10 years.

            <p>Gisborne's most popular cemetery is running out of space for new graves, forcing the council to look at future burial options.</p>
        
            <p>In Gisborne, 92 percent of burials and ash interments are held at Taruheru Cemetery, with an average of two burials a week.</p>
        
            <p>The cemetery is expected to be full within 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>At a council meeting on Thursday, councillors discussed two potential solutions: Extend the area of the cemetery or look for other land options.</p>
        
            <p>The council owns 2.7 hectares of land opposite the cemetery (on 587 Nelson Road), which is not currently zoned or classified as a cemetery and would take work to develop.</p>
        
            <p>Planning team leader Tyler Kirk said the council was looking at a feasibility study on the Nelson Road land.</p>
        
            <p>The research would take place in three stages: assessing geotechnical hazards and hydrological conditions, investigating the feasibility of re-zoning, and then a cultural impact assessment.</p>
        
            <p>The study could take up to a year to complete, and if any part of the research finds the area unfeasible, the team would come back to the council, Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Aubrey Ria said heavy rain often closed the cemetery to burials and people could not bury t큰p훮paku.</p>
        
            <p>"This [such events] left a lot of distress on some of our community members having to have their loved ones stored and waiting for somewhere for them to lie."</p>
        
            <p>Ria suggested looking for land away from waterways that was not prone to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, she said the area had suburbia around it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's effectively just one paddock, which extends our time to be able to provide a service, but we will have to start looking for another site anyway," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Larry Foster said it would be nice to have the land area close to the cemetery, however, it would only be a temporary fix.</p>
        
            <p>"If we're going to have population growth, this is an area where it is going to expand, and having a cemetery in the middle might not be the best fit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kirk said from a groundwater perspective, Gisborne would have its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"Groundwater isn't unique to that site - it is one large, sandy system," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Te Hapara Sands aquifer that affected Taruheru Cemetery also ran across large parts of Mangapapa, Riverdale, and even into Makaraka and Awapuni, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kirk said the study would investigate the capacity of the site based on the groundwater conditions and measure against burial trends and climate projections.</p>
        
            <p>"Cremation is trending upward; we've moved from a 60:40 or a 30:70 to the inverse in 10 years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be modelling from what we know today, and of what we think the future use of that site will be."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Nick Tupara said given the growing M훮ori population in Gisborne, it was likely that many people would want to go back to their hap큰 and iwi marae for burial.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Rob Telfer said it was obvious the land was inadequate.</p>
        
            <p>"If we listen to the experts that tell us sea levels are rising, just because we own this land next door, it's really obvious that maybe it's not the suitable place."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Tony Robinson and Colin Alder suggested green burial sites, where one can bury and plant a tree on top and regenerate.</p>
        
            <p>"A block of land that allows for native bush I would have thought would be a no-brainer," Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>Kirk said they had been advised to do the study first so that the council could have a strong justification for not using the land that they already owned, if the study showed they needed to look for other options.</p>
