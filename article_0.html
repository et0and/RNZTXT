            <p>Whanganui's biggest encampment of homeless people are being abruptly turfed out of a camping site on the banks of the Whanganui River.</p>
        
            <p>Police and Whanganui District Council compliance officers visited the Anzac Parade site on Monday morning, issuing notices to about 15 homeless people camping at the council's Kowhai Park freedom camping site and on a reserve alongside it.</p>
        
            <p>The council is giving them two days to remove their belongings and leave.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it was temporarily closing the Anzac Parade freedom camping site and has told those occupying the site to remove camping gear, vehicles and personal belongings.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Andrew Tripe said the decision to close the site was due to health and safety concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation there has become entirely unsafe, both for the campers themselves and for members of the public wanting to access these areas."</p>
        
            <p>It is understood community support workers and iwi representatives were talking to the council in an attempt to broker an extension for the campers, to allow time for alternative arrangements to be found.</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said the campsite for the homeless was allowed as a temporary measure during the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Homeless people have occupied the site since then.</p>
        
            <p>The situation had become increasingly problematic, the mayor said.</p>
        
            <p>It was important that the riverside walkway was a family-friendly environment that was safe for the community to enjoy.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now we are faced with a situation that the council believes poses significant risk to the public, our staff and the people camping in this area."</p>

            <p>Tripe said the council had received multiple complaints about the behaviour of campers at the site, including intimidation, assaults, litter, illicit substance abuse and damage to vegetation.</p>
        
            <p>There were also reports that a large number of people residing at the site had previous criminal offences, the mayor said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am not going to underplay or ignore these risks," he said. "I believe we have no option but to close the site."</p>
        
            <p>The riverbank reserve area adjacent to the freedom camping site will also be closed to cars, and anyone camping there will be asked to move their belongings.</p>
        
            <p>Temporary permits were recently issued to allow people to camp there, clearing the freedom camping area for an annual boat race to take place on the river in front of it, but these permits have expired. A chain will be reinstated to ensure cars cannot access this site in future.</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said there was a genuine and concerted effort by the council and multiple agencies to find solutions to address the needs of those in the community who were homeless.</p>
        
            <p>"We remain committed to continuing to support vulnerable people in our community who are genuinely homeless, by partnering with community support agencies such as the Whanganui People's Centre, to provide wrap-around support and to help people into housing and sustain their tenancies."</p>
        
            <p>This approach had proved successful, he said, with 42 people supported into housing over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge that closing the site does not change the problem of homelessness - and that for some, because of previous offending or complex personal circumstances, it will be extremely challenging for them to find suitable accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>"Referrals to support agencies will continue, as this has made a tangible and positive difference in the lives of many individuals and families in our community."</p>
        
            <p>Tripe said the council was also looking to address long-term housing issues through the establishment of a housing trust.</p>
        
            <p>"While managing homelessness is not generally viewed as core council business, we are working alongside other organisations and agencies and giving consideration to long-term prevention strategies, so that future councils do not find themselves in this position."</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive David Langford said the council cannot use the Freedom Camping Act or its Freedom Camping Bylaw as regulatory enforcement tools in this situation.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact, the Act exempts the homeless from any infringement or repercussions under the freedom camping bylaw.</p>
        
            <p>"But under the Reserves Act and our Public Places Bylaw we can address specific issues, such as unauthorised entry onto reserve land, litter, trespass, disorderly behaviour, or obstructing a public way, among other things."</p>
        
            <p>Once the freedom camping site has been closed, the council will undertake compliance and animal management visits as applicable over the summer period, and security monitoring will continue.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also mindful of the safety and well-being of our staff in this environment," Langford said.</p>
