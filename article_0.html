            <p>The death toll from Vanuatu's 7.3 earthquake is expected to rise because concrete buildings have collapsed with people inside, in the capital Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>International Federation of Red Cross Pacific head of delegation Katie Greenwood posted on X that the Vanuatu government is reporting 14 confirmed fatalities and that 200 people have been treated for injuries at the main hospital in Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated 116,000 people had been affected by the quake and earlier said there were six unconfirmed deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu has been experiencing aftershocks following Tuesday's large 7.3 magnitude quake, the ABC reports.</p>
        
            <p>People living in coastal areas were told to move to higher ground. Meanwhile, the extent of damage in the country is being assessed.</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure in rural areas is said to be crippled.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in need of help in Port Vila," Thompson earlier told RNZ. The New Zealand High Commission is among buildings that have been damaged.</p>
        
            <p>A journalist living in Vanuatu, Dan McGarry, said police had confirmed to him the quake has claimed at least one life.</p>
