            <p>A New Zealand woman is fighting for her life in a Queensland hospital after allegedly being set on fire in her own home.</p>
        
            <p>Destiny Otton-Rakuraku, 34, remains in a serious condition in the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital days after the alleged attack, news.com.au reported.</p>
        
            <p>It is alleged Otton-Rakuraku, originally from Auckland, was involved in an altercation with a man at her home in Kingston - about 26km south of Brisbane - on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The 36-year-old man - who 7 News has identified as Renata Menning - allegedly doused her in petrol, before producing a lighter and setting her on fire.</p>
        
            <p>The Courier Mail reported neighbours saw her on fire and ran to her aid.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to 7 News, Otton-Rakuraku's mother Alison Rakuraku and best friend Emma Nguyen described the situation as "traumatic", with Alison Rakuraku saying all she felt was "numbness".</p>
        
            <p>"She's strong," she said of her daughter. "We'll just be strong for our girl."</p>
        
            <p>Otton-Rakuraku's family has launched a Go Fund Me page to raise money in support of the mother-of-two saying they are going through "unbearable pain".</p>
        
            <p>They describe her as having a "natural giving heart" and as someone who "didn't deserve what has happened to her".</p>
        
            <p>"As a mother she is doing everything she can to stay strong for her family during this incredibly difficult journey."</p>
        
            <p>More than $18,000 has been raised so far.</p>
        
            <p>Menning has been charged with one count each of attempted murder and common assault and is due to appear in court on Monday.</p>
