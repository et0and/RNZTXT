Housing Minister Chris Bishop has ruled out a mass sell-off of state houses.

            <p>PM Christopher Luxon and Housing Minister Chris Bishop have spoken to media about a review of Kāinga Ora - but have ruled out a mass sell-off of state houses.</p>
        
            <p>The report, by former prime minister Sir Bill English, found the country's social housing system isn't financially sustainable or delivering the homes people need.</p>
        
            <p>His report, released on Monday, found the agency was not financially viable, had limited attention to value for money and opaque transparency around internal costs and revenue.</p>
