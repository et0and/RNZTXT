            <p>Police have issued a formal warning over Te Pāti Māori's failure to file audited financial statements to the Electoral Commission last year.</p>
        
            <p>The party filed an incomplete 2023 statement in mid-December, well after the July deadline. It was missing signatures and the required audit report.</p>
        
            <p>In requirements brought in under the Electoral Amendment Act in 2022, parties that are incorporated societies must provide audited statements by the deadline to comply with the law.</p>
        
            <p>The commission referred the matter to police in October.</p>
        
            <p>"A decision was made to formally warn an individual. That formal warning has been issued," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission said it had followed up with the party several times, and while the final report was promised, it still had not been delivered.</p>
        
            <p>"When the financial statements were filed on 16 December, the party told us that they had been sent through to the auditors for the audit report to be prepared, and that final versions of the financial statements and audit report would be provided," the Commission's manager or legal, regulation and policy Kristina Temel said.</p>
        
            <p>"We followed up with Te Pāti Māori [in February] and on 12 February were advised the audit report was still being prepared."</p>
        
            <p>BusinessDesk reported last week the donations listed in the financial statements were also $5792.58 less than had been reported in the donations and loans return the party filed in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are waiting for the final financial statements and accompanying audit report," Temel said. "We sought explanations and progress updates a number of times. Sufficient grounds for the financial statements being late were not provided, and the matter was referred to Police."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if any charges would be dropped if the party submitted its audited statement - albeit late - police said they considered the matter resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"Police take allegations of election irregularity seriously. We are satisfied the Police response in relation to this matter was appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori's President John Tamihere was asked for comment on each of these matters and gave this response:</p>
        
            <p>"All will be revealed in good time. Rest assured the naughty Natives always comply to the letter of the law."</p>
        
            <p>All other parties have filed.</p>
