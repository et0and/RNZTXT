            <p>The Crown alleges a retired eye surgeon murdered his wife then staged the scene to make it look like her death was a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court jury trial of Philip John Polkinghorne is underway in Auckland after he pleaded not guilty to murder.</p>
        
            <p>In her opening address, Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock told the court Dr Poklinghorne had strangled his wife shortly before calling 1-1-1 to say she had killed herself.</p>
        
            <p>"He did so, perhaps while angry and high or low, or just plain strung out on methamphetamine, staged the scene to make it look like his wife's death was a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>"It will sound shocking, like something out of a crime novel."</p>
        
            <p>She told the court Dr Polkinghorne was living a double life and his marriage had deteriorated.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is set down for six weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne arrived in court dressed in a suit and surrounded by his legal team, including Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>Before the trial began, Polkinghorne pleaded guilty to two charges that had been suppressed until today - possession of the class A drug methamphetamine and possession of a pipe, at the time his wife died.</p>

            <p>He now faces one charge of murder.</p>
        
            <p>Pauline Hanna, who was 63, was found dead in the Remuera home she shared with her husband in April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Unexplained for more than a year, her death in the upmarket Auckland suburb captured the nation's interest.</p>
        
            <p>Police charged Polkinghorne, who is now 71, with murder 16 months after his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>The trial is set down for six weeks.</p>
