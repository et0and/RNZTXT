            <p>New York has been rattled by an earthquake which was felt by millions on the United States' east coast.</p>
        
            <p>The 4.8-magnitude shake was the most significant earthquake in the area in decades.</p>
        
            <p>The quake shut down air traffic at JFK Airport in New York and Newark International in New Jersey.</p>
        
            <p>All flights had since resumed, the Federal Aviation Administration told BBC News.</p>
        
            <p>The epicentre was in Lebanon, New Jersey, about 64km from New York City.</p>
        
            <p>Residents described their homes trembling and furniture shaking.</p>
        
            <p>New York governor Kathy Hochul said no "life-threatening situations" had been reported, but warned residents of potential aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>New Jersey resident Sally Osman told BBC News she thought the shaking was just intense wind at first.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had early bad weather so I thought it was just wind that was picking up really strong."</p>
        
            <p>Then Osman felt a sudden strong shake.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought a Mack truck hit my home."</p>
        
            <p>When the shaking did not stop, she realised it was an earthquake. Osman grabbed her daughters and stood under a door frame.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty intense," she told BBC News.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't even know how long it was but it felt eternal."</p>
        
            <p>There were reports of cracks in footpaths and roads.</p>
        
            <p>Schools had been told to operate as normal following the quake.</p>
