            <p>A dawn ceremony has marked the beginning of Waitangi Day commemorations at Te Whare Rūnanga Marae on the upper Treaty grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday's celebration came after a tense pōwhiri at the marae yesterday which saw ACT Leader David Seymour's microphone cut off twice, and his speech drowned out by waiata.</p>
        
            <p>The day will include a flag raising ceremony, and the traditional waka parade.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a number of performance from local groups, including kapa haka and reggae, as well as market stalls throughout the grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Follow all the latest updates and listen to our live broadcast from the grounds at the top of this page.</p>
