            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking to the media from Matavai Resort in Niue on his first trip to the Pacific since taking office.</p>
        
            <p>While in Niue, Luxon is meeting with Premier Dalton Tagelagi and will celebrate 50 years of Niue's self-government in free association.</p>
        
            <p>Niue has a similar arrangement to the Cook Islands and Tokelau - as a country with free association within the realm of New Zealand, its citizens are also New Zealand citizens.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand also provides aid to Niue, and assists it with its affairs.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this afternoon Luxon arrived in Niue on a New Zealand Defence Force Boeing 757 which landed on the recently upgraded runway at Hanan International Airport, which New Zealand contributed to.</p>
        
            <p>He will attend a King's Birthday Reception at Niue's official residence later this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Tomorrow, Luxon will be taking a tour on a SAR vessel along Niue's western coast, as well as getting a brief introduction to the Niue Assembly Chamber and attend the official opening of the airport runway resurfacing.</p>
        
            <p>After less than 24 hours in Niue, Luxon will tomorrow head to Fiji.</p>
