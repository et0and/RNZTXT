            <p>Four vehicles, including three police cars, were rammed by a driver attempting to escape officers in the Lower Hutt suburb of Epuni earlier this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Five officers received minor injuries in the "quick-moving" incident, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A 49-year-old man has been arrested and will face multiple charges in court on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington District Commander Superintendent Corrie Parnell said police were called to Trinity Ave at 5.25pm on Tuesday after a report of suspicious behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Parnell said a vehicle of interest was seen leaving the area, but officers signalled for it to stop.</p>
        
            <p>"It did not stop and instead, drove into the police vehicle and then into two other police vehicles that arrived to assist.</p>
        
            <p>"A member of the public's vehicle was also hit by the man's vehicle. Thankfully the member of the public was uninjured."</p>
        
            <p>The driver then fled the scene on foot, but was arrested soon afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Parnell said five police staff had been assessed for minor injuries, and three police vehicles suffered significant damage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff go to work every day to help make our communities safer, and behaviour such as this where police staff and vehicles are targeted is unacceptable," said Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>"I am incredibly proud of the work from our staff in this quick-moving event where a vehicle was used as a weapon against Police, creating a massive risk to the safety of everybody involved."</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man will appear in the Hutt Valley District Court on Wednesday, facing three charges of aggravated assault, a charge of indecent assault and failed to stop for police.</p>
        
            <p>Parnell said further charges have not been ruled out.</p>
