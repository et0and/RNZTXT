            <p>Hand-held radios used by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah detonated across Lebanon's south and in Beirut suburbs, further stoking tensions with Israel a day after similar explosions launched via the group's pagers.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's health ministry said nine people had been killed and more than 300 injured, while the death toll from Tuesday's explosions rose to 12, including two children, with nearly 3,000 injured.</p>
        
            <p>At least one of Wednesday's blasts took place near a funeral organised by Iran-backed Hezbollah for those killed the previous day when thousands of pagers used by the group exploded across the country and wounded many of its fighters.</p>
        
            <p>A Reuters reporter in the southern suburbs of Beirut said he saw Hezbollah members frantically taking out the batteries of any walkie-talkies on them that had not exploded, tossing the parts in metal barrels around them.</p>
        
            <p>Lebanon's Red Cross said on X that it was responding with 30 ambulance teams to multiple explosions in different areas, including the south of Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah, which was thrown briefly into disarray by the pager attacks, said on Wednesday it had attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets, the first strike at its arch-foe since the blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

            <p>Images of the exploded walkie-talkies examined by Reuters showed an inside panel labelled "ICOM" and "made in Japan."</p>
        
            <p>According to its website, ICOM is a Japan-based radio communications and telephone company.</p>
        
            <p>The company has said that production of several models of the ICOM hand-held radio have been discontinued, including the IC-V82, which appeared to closely match those in images from Lebanon on Wednesday and which was phased out in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>There was no immediate reply from ICOM to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The hand-held radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time that the pagers were bought, said a security source.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military has declined to comment on the blasts.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's attack wounded many of the militant group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut.</p>
        
            <p>Frontline workers described hellish scenes: victims of thousands of small explosions linked to pagers used by Hezbollah rushed into hospitals, some with organs protruding, others with missing eyes or fingers.</p>

            <p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called for an independent investigation into the events surrounding exploding pagers.</p>
        
            <p>The United Nations Security Council will meet on Friday over the pager blasts after a request from Algeria on behalf of Arab states, said Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar, president of the 15-member council for September.</p>
        
            <p>Taiwanese pager maker Gold Apollo denied that it had produced the pager devices. It said the devices were made under licence by a company called BAC, based in Hungary's capital Budapest.</p>
        
            <p>Hungary on Wednesday said the devices had never been in the country and that authorities had established that BAC was a trading-intermediary company with no manufacturing or operations in Hungary.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel. The two sides have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza conflict erupted last October, fuelling fears of a wider Middle East war that could drag in the United States and Iran.</p>
        
            <p>A full-blown war with Israel could devastate Lebanon, which has lurched from one crisis to another in recent years, including a 2019 financial collapse and the 2020 Beirut port blast.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of pushing the Middle East to the brink of a regional war by orchestrating a dangerous escalation on many fronts.</p>
        
            <p>"Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war. It still wants to avoid one. But given the scale, the impact on families, on civilians, there will be pressure for a stronger response," said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager "massacre" which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead.</p>
        
            <p>One Hezbollah official said the detonation was the group's "biggest security breach" in its history.</p>
        
            <p>The plot appears to have been many months in the making, several sources told Reuters. It followed a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders and leaders ascribed to Israel since the start of the Gaza war.</p>
        
            <p>Hezbollah had turned to pagers and other low-tech communications devices in an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance of mobile phones.</p>
