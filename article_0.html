            <p>Former All Black Sid Going has died at the age of 80.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from Northland Rugby confirmed the death of a player regarded as one of the country's great halfbacks.</p>
        
            <p>It is with great sadness that we acknowledge the passing of our provinceâ€™s Sid Going. Together, from Te Kao to Mahurangi, from our North Auckland days, and across the country, we will respectfully mourn his passing, but also remember all that he has given to our game of rugby. pic.twitter.com/kGMD6oqLaq</p>
