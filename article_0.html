            <p>A strong 5.7 quake has jolted the lower North Island and top of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>The quake happened at 5.08am, centred 25 kilometres west of Wellington at a depth of 31km.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Region Emergency Management said on its Facebook page there was no tsunami warning.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington transport operator Metlink said it was replacing trains with buses until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>A person in the suburb of Johnsonville told RNZ items fell off their shelves, while a Whanganui resident said it was felt quite strongly there.</p>
        
            <p>So far more than 37,000 people have reported feeling it to the Geonet website, from as far north as Auckland's North Shore down to Invercargill in the south.</p>
        
            <p>A listener in the Wellington suburb of ÅŒwhiro Bay said it was "a mean jolt, like a truck hitting the house, it rocked the house".</p>
        
            <p>And a listener in Blenheim reported: "Heard quake coming, as we often do here - a heavy freight train getting closer, rumbling sound increasing before strong creaking jolt."</p>
        
            <p>Further from the epicentre, in Whanganui, another listener experienced "fine trembling as lead in, then rocking with window sash weights noisy in old two-storey wooden home".</p>
        
            <p>One person on Meta-owned social media site Threads described it as the "strongest quake I've felt since those ones in 2016". Another said it "felt stronger than a 5.8".</p>
        
            <p>"Well that's a check for damage in the morning one," one person wrote on Bluesky. "The whole house bounced up and down," said another.</p>
        
            <p>Several people reported the quake woke them up.</p>
        
            <p>Just on Saturday, emergency response teams from across the North Island took part in an exercise in Wellington to test their ability to respond to a large earthquake.</p>
