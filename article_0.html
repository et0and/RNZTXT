            <p>Te P큰kenga has announced that its chief executive, Peter Winder, has been made redundant.</p>
        
            <p>He will leave the organisation at the end of January.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pukenga Council's deputy chairperson Sue McCormack said in a statement that the function and duties of Winder's role would change "significantly" given the new direction the government had announced.</p>
        
            <p>"Accordingly, Peter and the council have agreed that his role will come to an end by reason of redundancy in accordance with his employment agreement. Peter has agreed to continue in a transition role to assist the Council and its Committees until the end of January 2024."</p>
        
            <p>McCormack said the council was grateful for the hard work and dedication Winder had put in over the past 18 months and for his work on the Establishment Board and Te Pukenga Council prior.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be sorry to see Peter go, and he leaves with the council's thanks, support and very best wishes for the future."</p>
        
            <p>The organisation's deputy chief executive for the academic centre and learning systems, Megan Gibbos, had also resigned.</p>
        
            <p>Her last day would be 12 January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Megan has been in her role since December 2022, and prior to joining Te P큰kenga was chief executive of Otago Polytechnic," a statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"The council thanks Megan for her service to vocational education and wishes her well for the future."</p>
