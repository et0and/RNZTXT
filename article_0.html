            <p>The government intends to introduce the Treaty Principles Bill this Thursday - earlier than expected.</p>
        
            <p>The bill was not set to be introduced until later this month, on 18 November, but a memo sent to lawyers by the Waitangi Tribunal and seen by RNZ, said the Crown had indicated it will be put before the House on 7 November.</p>
        
            <p>The office for the acting leader of the house, Simeon Brown, has confirmed to RNZ the bill will be introduced on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Associate justice minister David Seymour, who is responsible for the bill, had no comment when contacted by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the earlier-than-anticipated introduction, the Waitangi Tribunal has released its second interim report into the bill.</p>
        
            <p>The 145-page report said if the bill were to be enacted, it would be the "worst, most comprehensive breach of the Treaty/te Tiriti in modern times".</p>
        
            <p>It went as far as to suggest the bill could mean the end of the Treaty itself, if it was not repealed.</p>
        
            <p>"Underlying the significant change across all statutory regimes that affect Māori, the Bill would end the Treaty/te Tiriti partnership and any formal relationship between the Crown and Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"At present, the progressing of the Bill is having serious impacts on the relationship but the Bill if enacted would kill that relationship. This is deliberate," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>The introduction of the bill is part of ACT's coalition agreement with National. However, National and New Zealand First have said they will not support it beyond its first reading.</p>
        
            <p>The bill's introduction does not mean it will have its first reading on the same day. The first reading can occur no sooner than the third sitting day after its introduction.</p>
        
            <p>A nine-day hīkoi is due to start next Monday, with the view of arriving at Parliament on 19 November - the day after the the date the bill was originally set to be introduced.</p>
