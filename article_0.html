            <p>Seventy percent of properties that were plunged into darkness this morning should have power back on this evening, Transpower says.</p>
        
            <p>Power has been out for nearly 100,000 properties across Northland after a transmission tower, that carries most of the region's power needs, fell shortly after eleven o'clock this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower's executive general manager grid delivery, Mark Ryall told Checkpoint its alternative supply is now up and running, and will soon power up properties across the region this evening.</p>
        
            <p>But he warned people to conserve power to reduce the risk of overloading the network.</p>
        
            <p>Ryall said he did not know why the tower fell over, but said it should not have done so in calm conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower earlier said Northland lost power after a tower fell near Glorit about 11am and most of its 65,000 customers were affected. Top Energy was also reporting outages from KaitƒÅia to Cape Reinga.</p>
