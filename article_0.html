            <p>Oranga Tamariki has confirmed 447 jobs will be cut, thereby reducing its workforce by 9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It said on Wednesday that 632 roles would be disestablished including 70 vacant roles, and 185 new roles would be created.</p>
        
            <p>About 1900 roles would be affected overall - either changed or disestablished - in the "scope of restructuring work" out of 5100 permanent and fixed-term staff - 37 percent of its staff.</p>
        
            <p>An Oranga Tamariki staff member described Wednesday's meeting on the job cuts proposal as gut-wrenching.</p>
        
            <p>She said all business units within the ministry appeared to be affected, with some facing cuts of up to 50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything from HR to system leadership to policy to the evidence centre. Everything's been impacted really in one way or another."</p>
        
            <p>The worker said her job was set to be disestablished and she would have to apply for a reduced number of roles.</p>
        
            <p>She said leaders at Oranga Tamariki reiterated that the cuts were not a reflection of work ethic.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just purely numbers, which is such a terrible way to look at it because I work alongside some of the most dedicated, hard hard-working, passionate people I've ever met. And seeing the impact that will have on some of them is horrific."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was short-sighted for the agency to say the changes would improve things for tamariki and rangatahi.</p>
        
            <p>"When they're slashing jobs of people who work tirelessly to improve outcomes for them, it's hard to see how this will be a positive impact on any of the work that we do."</p>
        
            <p>The worker said all staff were feeling shocked and uneasy but managers had been supportive.</p>

            <p>Likely to be significantly impacted is the evidence centre which produces research evaluation, analytics and insights about tamariki, rangatahi, their whānau and the work of Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 632 roles slated to be disestablished, 24 percent are broadly manager roles and a third (34 percent) are advisory roles, slides as part of the job loss announcement show.</p>
        
            <p>About 29 percent are from "enabling services functions".</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki's leadership would be disestablished and consolidated going from eight roles to six, and advice and management support for the chief executive is being downsized.</p>
        
            <p>The office of the chief social worker is being merged with the professional practice group, where 92 roles are proposed to be disestablished and 44 new ones created.</p>
        
            <p>There would be a 19 percent reduction in total number of roles in those teams "from current to future state".</p>
        
            <p>The ministry is also disestablishing the Treaty Response Unit and shifting current responsibilities to other areas.</p>
        
            <p>The aim is to create clear lines of accountability, simplify the structure and enable faster decision making and empower frontline staff to work together more effectively, according to the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Oranga Tamariki chief executive Chappie Te Kani said frontline staff were not part of these changes.</p>
        
            <p>"This change goes to our core as a ministry. It fundamentally moves us away from where we are, towards the kind of ministry we need to be."</p>
        
            <p>For the 632 people who may be affected, he said this proposal would be a "hard read".</p>
        
            <p>"The change also delivers on the savings targets set by the government," he said.</p>
        
            <p> </p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, these are proposed changes, once consultation with staff is completed, final decisions will be made."</p>
        
            <p>Likely to be significantly impacted is the evidence centre which produces research evaluation, analytics and insights about tamariki, rangatahi, their whānau and the work of Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>More than 2000 jobs have been cut from the public service so far as ministries try to achieve budget savings of up to 7.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Regulation David Seymour previously indicated that figure could hit 7500.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education is also expected to announce proposed job cuts on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood many of the jobs on the line are in the Ka Ora, Ka Ako school lunches programme.</p>
        
            <p>The programme was introduced in 2019 by the previous Labour government, and currently offers meals to 230,000 students in about 1000 disadvantaged schools.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour has previously confirmed the programme itself is under review and is likely to be cut in the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Jobs being disestablished are understood to include nutritionists, those who monitor and evaluate the programme, sustainability and waste, and people who work in regional branches of the team.</p>
        
            <p>One person close to the matter said the team was set to be "decimated".</p>
