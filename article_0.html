            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack said it was a "pretty frightening" incident for those on board.</p>
        
            <p>"I have heard that the harbourmaster is on board doing checks but I'm trying to find out further information. Obviously it's a pretty concerning incident."</p>
        
            <p>Boyack said she understood no one was injured, but she was waiting for confirmation of that.</p>
        
            <p>She had been advised everyone on board had been given a lifejacket, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Looks like the Interisland ferry Aratere has runaround shortly after leaving Picton this evening! Hope everyone on board is ok! Life jackets have been given out to passengers. pic.twitter.com/hb7yJ82i0F</p>
        
            <p>Hutt City councillor Brady Dyer posted about the incident on X, saying: "Looks like the Interisland ferry Aratere has (run aground) shortly after leaving Picton this evening! Hope everyone on board is ok!"</p>
        
            <p>A man whose father was on board told the New Zealand Herald he understood the ferry had hit a bank. He said all on board were okay.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com showed the ferry was near TÄ«toki Bay and not moving just after 11pm Friday. It was about half an hour out of Picton.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel's status was "aground", the website said.</p>
