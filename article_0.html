            <p>Beneficiaries looking for a job will have to attend a work seminar within two weeks of starting to receive welfare as part of new requirements.</p>
        
            <p>Social Development Minister Louise Upston announced the new compulsory "K≈çrero Mahi - Let's Talk Work" sessions at a Porirua jobs expo on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Upston said people who come on to Jobseeker Support would now be required to meet with the Social Development Ministry within a fortnight to decide the next steps.</p>
        
            <p>Those who failed to attend without a "good and sufficient reason" could face sanctions, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If they're ready to work, they could be helped to apply for a job. If they need re-training or upskilling, they could be referred to a programme that can help.</p>
        
            <p>"These compulsory work seminars will make sure all new Jobseeker beneficiaries get the support they need and understand what's expected of them."</p>
        
            <p>Upston said early intervention was necessary as although almost 190,000 people received Jobseeker Support, just 53,000 of them had case managers at any given time.</p>
        
            <p>"This new initiative follows steps we've already taken to make the welfare system more proactive, which include our expectations about the application of benefit sanctions and new work check-ins for job seekers after six months."</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has set a target of 50,000 fewer people on Jobseeker Support by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not prepared to sit back and let welfare dependency get any worse, which is why we're intervening early to get job seekers on the pathway to work," Upston said.</p>
