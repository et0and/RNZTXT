            <p>Rural homes and a caravan park were evacuated near West Melton overnight as a large vegetation fire was fanned by high winds.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says 12 trucks, tankers and support vehicles are there and its crews are working to contain the blaze, which was reported about 9pm on sunday.</p>
        
            <p>About 50 homes that were evacuated were in an area east of Thompsons Rd to McKays Rd, and a caravan park was evacuated in The Willows area.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were allowed back early on Monday but told to be ready to leave again if required.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says four helicopters will begin operating with monsoon buckets at first light, when firefighters will get a better picture of how big the fire is.</p>
