        <h2>'We're all terrified' - Rock thrower has residents on edge</h2>
        <p>
Neighbours say they've been terrorised nearly daily for months by stones coming through their windows: "We just really want this to stop."

            <p>Residents in a suburban Auckland street say they have been terrorised for months by someone throwing rocks through the windows of houses along the road.</p>
        
            <p>A number of houses on Sackville Street in Grey Lynn had their windows smashed by rocks on Monday, the latest in a series of attacks dating back to February last year.</p>
        
            <p>A long time Sackville Street resident - who RNZ has agreed not to name - said residents have spent thousands of dollars to repair damage and install security cameras.</p>
        
            <p>"We just really want this to stop," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really nice street with mixed housing, so there's some rentals, and there's some owners, and there's the Kainga Ora flats, which we all really like.</p>
        
            <p>"This person is the most unwelcome and frightening intrusion that I could imagine.</p>
        
            <p>"It's terrifying lying in bed, waking up for every sound, thinking that a rock's going to be thrown through your window."</p>
        
            <p>Six windows had been smashed on Monday, said the resident.</p>
        
            <p>They said it was a near daily occurrence.</p>
        
            <p>"All it takes is for somebody to be on the other end of that rock for it to escalate to grievous bodily harm," they said.</p>
        
            <p>They said the person they believed was responsible for the damaged property stayed with a tenant in the nearby Kainga Ora development, but was not a tenant themselves.</p>
        
            <p>The resident said police were on the street on Monday night after more properties were damaged.</p>
        
            <p>They believed the person's behaviour was escalating.</p>
        
            <p>"All of us are having sleepless nights, we're all terrified," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've all been told by the cops to ring 111 when it happens, but only occasionally when we do that do the cops turn up, because it's not a hugely high priority for them."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City West acting Inspector Alan Rowland said they had received complaints from Sackville Street residents in recent weeks regarding wilful damage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff are actively looking into this matter," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will take appropriate action as necessary.</p>
        
            <p>"In the meantime, we ask any residents that have not yet reported offending to ensure they lodge a report online or call 105," said Rowland.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the tenant will have to be moved on," said the longtime Sackville Street resident.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that will be the only solution, and how Kainga Ora go about that I don't know."</p>
        
            <p>Kainga Ora regional director for central and east Auckland John Tubberty told RNZ they were aware of the situation, and that the behaviour was clearly unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"The allegations involve a person who has been visiting one of our properties - they are not a tenant," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking into whether we can take any action under the Residential Tenancies Act to address the situation."</p>
        
            <p>Tubberty encouraged anyone witnessing any illegal activity to contact the police.</p>
