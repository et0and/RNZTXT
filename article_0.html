            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau says her council will work collaboratively with the government, after its decision to appoint a Crown Observer.</p>
        
            <p>Local government minister Simeon Brown announced his plans this afternoon, citing concern around the impact of council decisions on rates.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau says it's been a tough couple of years, but the council is committed to delivering the best long term plan it can.</p>
        
            <p>She says there has been a lot of media attention and political theatre around the decision, but the council needs assistance, not punching down.</p>
        
            <p>The council now has 10 days to respond to the minister, who says he will take its view into account before he appoints an observer.</p>
