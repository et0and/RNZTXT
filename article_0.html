            <p>The New Zealand government says the Cook Islands has failed to properly consult it on proposed agreements its Prime Minister Mark Brown will be signing in China this week.</p>
        
            <p>Brown has now left for China without further consultation, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement this afternoon a spokesperson for foreign affairs minister Winston Peters said they could confirm that Brown and Peters spoke over the phone on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>During that conversation Peters impressed upon Brown what further information New Zealand required to assuage our concerns about the lack of consultation regarding the proposed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Cook Islands and China.</p>
        
            <p>"The Deputy Prime Minister, in the phone call and in writing within hours of the call, repeated to the Prime Minister a months-old request that the government of the Cooks Islands share with New Zealand the contents of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) and other agreements that Prime Minister Brown intends to sign in China, in line with the requirement for consultation in the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration between New Zealand and the Cook Islands," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said they understood as of Sunday afternoon Brown has departed the Cook Islands for China via Auckland without any further consultation and the time for consultation "has now passed".</p>
        
            <p>"We therefore view the Cook Islands as having failed to properly consult New Zealand with respect to any agreements it plans to sign this coming week in China.</p>
        
            <p>"This lack of consultation is a matter of significant concern to the New Zealand government. We look forward to continuing discussions with the government of the Cooks Islands on this important matter in the coming days and weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson also said New Zealand deeply values its relationship with the government and people of the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>"Cook Islanders are treasured members of the New Zealand family. The Deputy Prime Minister will continue to defend and protect the interests of Cook Islanders, in the context of New Zealand protecting the security and prosperity of all New Zealand citizens and of the Realm of New Zealand."</p>
