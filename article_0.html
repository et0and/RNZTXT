            <p>Former Green MP Golriz Ghahraman has pleaded guilty to shoplifting charges in Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman's first appearance has been brought forward to today, after being delayed twice before and pushed to 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>Police have laid four shoplifting charges against the 43-year-old former politician.</p>
        
            <p>The charges accuse Ghahraman of shoplifting in four separate incidents at stores in Auckland and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>On 23 December, charged with stealing $2060 worth of goods from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby.</p>
        
            <p>On 22 December, accused of stealing a navy cardigan valued at $389 from Standard Issue in Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>On 21 December, charged with stealing $7223 of items from Scotties Boutique in Ponsonby.</p>
        
            <p>On 22 October, accused of stealing $695 worth of clothing from Wellington's Cre8iveworx store.</p>
        
            <p>The charges carry a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years if convicted.</p>
        
            <p>Ghahraman resigned as an MP after the shoplifting allegations came to light.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement in January, she said stress relating to her work had led her to "act in ways that are completely out of character. I am not trying to excuse my actions, but I do want to explain them".</p>
        
            <p>"The mental health professional I see says my recent behaviour is consistent with recent events giving rise to extreme stress response, and relating to previously unrecognised trauma," she said.</p>
