            <p>A community recycling centre is looking for the owners of decades worth of family photos, left in an old sewing machine box.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of weeks ago, a woman dropped a sewing machine case off at the Waiōrea Community Recycling Centre in Western Springs in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Staff member Christine Wang told Checkpoint that workers opened the case to unexpectedly find a huge trove of family photos.</p>
        
            <p>"It was something we'd never expect to find in a sewing machine box."</p>
        
            <p>She said the range of photos was "massive, starting from the early 1900s to the early 2000s".</p>
        
            <p>The images included wedding and baby photos from throughout the decades.</p>

The name 'McDonald' was on some of the photos.

            <p>Wang said the old sewing machine case also contained an envelope with an address on it.</p>
        
            <p>"There is also clothing patterns in there as well as some film that is yet to be developed."</p>
        
            <p>A couple dressed in army uniforms featured in many of the photos, as well as a "wide range of family members which could be [extended] family members".</p>

            <p>Staff had posted the photos on social media and found names on some of the photos, which had led members of the community to find some leads, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We found the surname McDonald."</p>
        
            <p>A lot of people came through the recycling centre on their way to Auckland Zoo or MOTAT, she said.</p>
        
            <p>
The most recent photos date from the early 2000s.

            <p>"The sewing machine arrived during a time were everything was on so we didn't have time to open it in front of the customer," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We held on to them hoping they'd realise their mistake and come back and reclaim the photos but that didn't happen unfortunately."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with more information should get in touch with the centre over social media, she said.</p>
