            <p>Wellington Water is recommending the city's council spend $2.5 billion over a decade to fix its leaky water network.</p>
        
            <p>That's the maximum that would be needed, with spending starting lower and increasing in later years.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water chief Tonia Haskell told Morning Report it was up to Wellington City Council to decide how much it could actually afford to spend.</p>
        
            <p>One councillor has suggested the council could cut staff to free up funds, while the mayor said she was open to putting other plans on hold to find the money.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water had said it would cost $1b a year for 10 years to fix the regions water woes.</p>
        
            <p>But Haskell said there was a limit on what could be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was restrained by contractor availability, staff capacity, and an acceptable level of disruption in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to dig up roads, we have to interrupt private properties, there's a maximum amount that the city would be able to sustain."</p>
        
            <p>The $2.5b was how much Wellington Water believed it could deliver in the city over the next 10 years, Haskell said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to build capability ... it does take awhile to do that, as I say we have been doing that steadily for the past few years."</p>
        
            <p>A review into the efficiency of the agency is due out later this week.</p>
        
            <p>Despite some reports it will be critical of Wellington Water, Haskell said she welcomed its release.</p>
        
            <p>"We can always learn and do things better.</p>
        
            <p>"There does need to be investment in our systems and our processes and people, which is also lacking, to kick us up a notch."</p>
