            <p>The government has announced it will set itself a Budget allowance than the previous government did, with no new borrowing, but will reveal the exact amount in the Budget.</p>
        
            <p>The Treasury is expecting growth to be $42.8 billion lower in the coming years than was estimated in the Half-Year Update (HYEFU) in December, with core tax revenue tracking about $4b lower by the 2027/28 year compared to that estimate.</p>
        
            <p>The HYEFU had also estimated a 2026/27 return to an operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) surplus, but that $4b lower revenue figure pushed the $3.4b surplus estimated for the 2027/28 year down to a $600m deficit instead.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said her Budget Policy Statement, released on Wednesday, puts the government on a more sustainable track, while delivering "urgently needed tax relief to hard working New Zealanders".</p>
        
            <p>The statement sets out the government's priorities for the Budget due out in May, including:</p>
        
            <p>Willis said real GDP showed the economy was performing worse than was advertised in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said tax cuts would be funded entirely through reprioritised funding, savings, and new revenue, which "means we won't have to borrow extra to provide tax relief and we won't be adding to inflationary pressures".</p>
        
            <p>"Our first Budget will deliver."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was the most responsible thing the government could do for low- and middle-income New Zealanders, who had seen no decrease to the tax they paid since 2010.</p>
