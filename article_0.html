            <p>Four young people remain on the roof of a South Auckland youth justice facility after a group climbed up on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the Korowai Manaaki facility in Wiri shortly before 6pm after eight youths climbed onto the roof.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki acting deputy chief executive of youth justice services and residential care Iain Chapman said overnight and and on Tuesday morning, four of the young people had come down, with four remaining on the roof.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to monitor the situation, and we can confirm there are no concerns for public safety and the young people are still within the facility," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"An operational review will be undertaken to determine the circumstances that led to the incident."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Chapman said many of the young people in custody in youth justice facilities had committed serious offences motivated by a range of factors, including peer pressure, notoriety and adrenaline.</p>
        
            <p>"It is likely they participate in serious incidents once in custody for similar reasons."</p>
