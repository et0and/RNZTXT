            <p>The vigil for the slain police officer has taken place on the steps of the Christ Church Cathedral in Nelson's Trafalgar Square tonight, with thousands of people crowding the streets, and a large group of police officers paying tribute to their fallen colleague.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was killed after she and another officer, Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsey, were struck by a vehicle in Nelson's Buxton Square in the early hours of New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsey remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>

            <p>A 32-year-old man was due to appear in the Nelson District Court on Friday facing eight charges, including murder and attempted murder.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, organiser Shelley Bishop said more than 1000 people were expected to attend the vigil at 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>She did not know Fleming, but felt compelled to act when she heard of the officer's death.</p>
        
            <p>"I actually cried, I've never met her, but I cried."</p>

            <p>Bishop realised the whole community was grieving as she read more about Fleming and what a "treasure" she was to many locals.</p>
        
            <p>"I put up a post on Facebook about her passing away and the outpouring of grief was immense, and I thought, 'we need to show our support', so basically within 10 minutes I came up with that idea," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Locals had been donating candles and crafting blue ribbons for the vigil, which would involve performances from a bagpiper, as well as a local talent singing 'Amazing Grace'.</p>

            <p>The council had been organising traffic management and the police were invited to have a representative speak if they wanted, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>Those who could not attend were encouraged to put blue ribbons on their letterboxes as a show of support.</p>

            <p>Bishop hoped the vigil would bring the community together, and perhaps ease the "glum" feeling in the town.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just quite surreal, it's just so sad, one police officer ... the ripple effect has literally affected the entire region as well as New Zealand," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming was the first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty, Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>She was remembered as a "very much loved" leader who served for 38 years, and as a daughter, mother and wife who was long involved in community sport.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack described the support from across the motu as phenomenal.</p>
        
            <p>"There has been an outpouring of grief for the loss of Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming in this terrible incident.</p>
        
            <p>"It just is so clear that she touched a lot of lives, that there were many people in the community who she had worked with.</p>
        
            <p>"Her death will have ripple effects throughout the community for some time."</p>
        
            <p>It was vital the community had opportunities to grieve including at the vigil today, she said.</p>

            <p>"I think these types of events are really, really important and I know that people coming tonight will want it to be an event that honours Lyn's memory and shows her family, shows her colleagues that the people of Nelson are supportive of them, especially as they go through their grieving process, which I imagine will be very, very tough."</p>
        
            <p>People were leaving balloons on their letterbox if they couldn't attend the vigil as a way of acknowledging the loss in the community, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been a terrible start to the year for us in Nelson. But I do also know that we have a strong community."</p>
        
            <p>She hoped today's candlelight vigil would be a simple way for people to stand together, grieve, show their support and help them to heal in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
