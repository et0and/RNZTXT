            <p>The Chiefs have gained a measure of revenge for last year's grand final defeat to the Blues, winning a physical encounter 25-14 at Eden Park. The result was sealed with All Black Damian McKenzie crossing for two second half tries, built on some excellent work by his forwards.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues failed to score a point in the second half and were effectively shut down by a committed Chiefs defensive plan, as well as the injection of a number of All Blacks off the bench. McKenzie's much-talked about shift to fullback worked perfectly, with his pace through the line crucial for the two tries.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, it was the Blues who seemed happy to tackle and kick their way through the game, managing two very well-worked tries in the first half. Dalton Papali'i got over after an attacking lineout, then provided a key steal to set up AJ Lam's try in the corner.</p>
        
            <p>But, other than a Mark Tele'a effort that was ruled out by the TMO in the second half, that was as good as it got for a strangely disjointed Blues side, who couldn't get their abrasive style from last year going.</p>
        
            <p>Leroy Carter scored an excellent try in the 66th minute to put the Chiefs ahead, the All Blacks Sevens rep having a very productive game on debut. Cortez Ratima's contribution off the bench was immense, kicking an important 50/22 and marshalling his forwards well.</p>
        
            <p>The end result silenced the 25,200-strong crowd who had put up with constant showers throughout the game.</p>
        
            <p>The Blues take on the Highlanders next weekend in Dunedin, while the Chiefs head home to Hamilton to face the resurgent Crusaders.</p>
