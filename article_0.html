            <p>NZ First leader Winston Peters briefly returned to the Cordis Hotel in Auckland for his second meeting of the day with National Party leader Christopher Luxon.</p>
        
            <p>Peters is continuing to keep silent on the course of negotiations. He left the Cordis after only half an hour of a second meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going as fast as we possibly can," he said. "I know everybody's impatient, but we've just got to get this finished."</p>
        
            <p>He did say that he wanted things to finish "ASAP" and that Parliament could "theoretically" start up sooner than the end of November.</p>
        
            <p>He could not say whether today would be his final meeting with Luxon or not.</p>
        
            <p>National, NZ First and ACT have gathered for another day of talks to form the next government.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon is holding individual meetings with New Zealand First and ACT over the weekend and says the discussions are in the final stages.</p>

            <p>Earlier, Luxon said he was having a one-on-one meeting this morning with Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll just keep working our way through it. The topic of conversation gets narrower and we're getting close. We're talking about just closing off a few issues on policy and making sure we really understand what we're all signing up for.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important, as I said, we started this process looking at all three parties' manifestos, a lot of detail, gone through line item by line item and we've got a couple of issues to close out and that's what we're working through today."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said there will either be one or two deals made - suggesting it will be a single deal among National, New Zealand First and ACT, or two separate deals that the two parties would have with National.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said yesterday that a deal was "very close", while Peters said it would still take "a few more hours".</p>
        
            <p>- more to come</p>
