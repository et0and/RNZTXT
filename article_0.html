        <h2>Watch live: Willis faces questions after Social Investment speech</h2>
        <p>
The minister has delivered a speech on how she plans to replace the government's Social Wellbeing Board.
</p>
        
            <p>The minister for social investment Nicola Willis has set out her vision for the Social Investment Agency, which has replaced the former government's Social Wellbeing Board.</p>
        
            <p>The idea of social investment is to use data and evidence to determine where to invest in early intervention approaches, thereby saving money in the long run.</p>
        
            <p>The agency would co-invest and collate contracts with non-government organisations, Willis said in a speech to a social investment hui in Lower Hutt on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to be able to invest for the long-term, acting early, rather than waiting for the inevitable crisis, so that we can look ahead to getting dividends in terms of better lives for many years to come. Investing now so we can save later," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>In her speech to the hui, Willis said attendees should not pat themselves on the back for trying to help people or saying they did their best when it was too late. Instead, she told them to help the government understand the perspectives and realities of those receiving government-funded services.</p>

            <p>"Many outstanding New Zealanders have emerged from extremely challenging circumstances. They prove that there is reason for optimism, and that it is possible to break the cycle and chart your own life course. Social investment is about building a system that enables more of that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The agency will be tasked with finding who most needs support, where to find them, and what approaches could be taken to make a difference. It would also analyse what has worked and what has not, and who may be best-placed to deliver specific interventions.</p>
        
            <p>This year, $49 million operating and $1.5m capital funding was set aside in the Budget for setting up the agency and the fund, but exactly how this will be allocated is still to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>The agency will manage a fund, which will begin investing in 2025. It has already begun developing 'prototype' investment outcomes contracts.</p>
        
            <p>"This will provide a blueprint from which we can overhaul the way government commissions social services," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>Former police commissioner Andrew Coster started as chief executive of the agency earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Introducing Willis, Coster said he had spent his career at the "bottom of the cliff of social failure."</p>
        
            <p>"Now in this role, I think we have a greater opportunity to make a difference in the lives of New Zealanders. We can do this by shifting the system," he said.</p>
