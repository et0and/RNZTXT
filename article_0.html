            <p>In a confusing media conference at Parliament, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Corrections Minister Mark Mitchell on Monday repeatedly provided incorrect information about their planned prison spend-up.</p>
        
            <p>It raised more questions than it gave answers, - with Luxon and Mitchell at times contradicting one another.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ on Tuesday, Mitchell said "I muddied the waters a bit" while Luxon said Mitchell had 'got it mixed up in the moment' but had clarified immediately after. Luxon said Mitchell was doing a good job in his roles.</p>
