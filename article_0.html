            <p>More roads were closed overnight, motorists are stranded and snow is forecast for highways as a cold snap sweeps over much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>About 50 people had an unexpected stay at Arthurs Pass village last night, with State Highway 73 closed either side due to heavy snow.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, people in Pahiatua in Tararua District will be continuing to clean up after some homes in the town were flooded on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are clearing rocks and trees on SH2 on the Remutaka Hill this morning.</p>

            <p>In inland Canterbury, some people were picked up and taken to Arthurs Pass village after their vehicles got stuck on the pass, while others made it there, but couldn't drive any further.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteer Chris Stewart said residents will help people reach their cars this morning, and it looks as if they should be safe to continue their journeys today.</p>
        
            <p>One woman who had an unexpected stay in the village overnight said she was grateful to be put up by some kind locals.</p>
        
            <p>She was on her way home to Rangiora after visiting her daughter on the West Coast, and got caught out when the snow hit far earlier than she thought.</p>
