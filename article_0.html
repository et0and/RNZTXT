        <h2>The 4.75% home loan rate you (probably) can't get</h2>
        <p>
It appears only a few borrowers are eligible for the discounted rate.

            <p>ANZ is leading the market for advertised home loan rates at the moment, with a 4.99 percent two-year offer.</p>
        
            <p>But rumours of an even better rate, of 4.75 percent, have had some borrowers wondering whether they could negotiate a bit harder.</p>
        
            <p>But it appears that rate is only available to staff at ANZ.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said, as many other companies did, it offered discounts on some products and services as part of its staff benefits package.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, ANZ staff are eligible for discounted home loan rates.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't publicly discuss detail of staff remuneration packages, but there is currently a discounted two-year fixed rate available to ANZ customers as part of our staff benefits package."</p>
        
            <p>Squirrel chief executive David Cunningham said ANZ's 4.99 percent rate was the best in the market and only just launched, so he would be surprised to hear about more discounting.</p>
        
            <p>But he said a staff discount was common for banks, and 0.2 percent was standard.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate by 50 basis points this week and more, 25bp, cuts are expected this year.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac chief economist Kelly Eckhold said he expected short-term mortgage and floating rates should have further to drop as those OCR reductions came through.</p>
        
            <p>"But longer-term interest rates already fully reflect the OCR moving to the 3 to 3.25 percent area so it's hard to see much further movement in the absence of competitive impacts on bank margins which I have no insight on."</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Kiwibank said it was cutting its home loan special rates to 5.19 percent for one and two years.</p>
