        <h2>Govt prioritising potholes over patients, cancer battler says</h2>
        <p>
"If I am on a hearse driving to the crematorium, at least there won't be any potholes on the road," Richard, who has bowel cancer, says. Audio

            <p>A cancer patient says the prime minister will never know the reality of those relying on life-extending or life-saving cancer drugs.</p>
        
            <p>The government promised to fund 13 new cancer drugs at the election, but its promise was not fulfilled on Budget Day.</p>
        
            <p>Richard - who has bowel cancer - is now paying out nearly $50,000 of his own money to pay for a life-extending drug - one of those the pime mnister had promised to fund.</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint the coalition government had prioritised potholes over patients</p>
        
            <p>"If I am on a hearse driving to the crematorium, at least there won't be any potholes on the road."</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland man said he had been forced to battle the bank to self-fund a targeted drug called Cetuximab, alongside state-funded chemotherapy.</p>
        
            <p>Cetuximab is not currently funded by drug agency Pharmac, but Richard's oncologist told him the combination might give him a 50 percent chance of surviving five years.</p>
        
            <p>"They suggested that if I were to self-fund the targeted drug, which ironically is part of the National Party's list of potentially funded drugs, then that would improve my life expectancy."</p>
        
            <p>Cetuximab must be administered in a private hospital on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the cost per fortnight being about $8500.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital demands each bill be paid in advance before they are willing to administer the next round of therapy, as it is specifically mixed to each individual patient.</p>
        
            <p>"The total cost over the six cycles of treatment would be around $50,000 as I have no medical insurance," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you get a cancer diagnosis and are told you might have to spend $50,000, your brain says: 'Well actually, is my life worth $50,000?'.</p>
        
            <p>"I could have a big funeral for that or I could leave that money for my children."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said last week his government would spend the $280 million on the 13 drugs it promised during the election campaign. He said an announcement would be made 'very shortly'.</p>
        
            <p>"I know how people are feeling, I know how frustrated they feel about it, I know what cancer sufferers are going through,"</p>
        
            <p>But Richard told Checkpoint: "He will only know how people are feeling when he has a timeline on his life."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was in a vulnerable state of mind.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't outraged, I was disappointed, sad and emotional."</p>
        
            <p>Richard said after beginning the treatment and two cycles, he ran out of readily available funds but had a term deposit with the ANZ Bank maturing the following week.</p>
        
            <p>"I approached the Queen St branch of the ANZ to see whether I could break my term deposit seven days early, in order to pay the outstanding drug bill and enable me to continue to receive my next round of drug therapy.</p>
        
            <p>"I really wanted to have a private conversation with someone, rather than entertain those behind me in the queue with my cancer details."</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint the young teller initially hinted the bank might look compassionately at the predicament he was in.</p>
        
            <p>"After punching a few keys into her terminal, however, she said there would be a break penalty," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This would mean I would lose a couple of thousand dollars, money I really needed."</p>
        
            <p>Richard said he was not offered the chance to speak to anyone else from the ANZ customer services team.</p>
        
            <p>"I expected more from the ANZ and its staff, especially as according to their website they support the Cancer Society and Dai Henwood is even their 'Cancer Ambassador'."</p>
        
            <p>He said he respectfully filled out a survey, giving the lowest scores on the scale.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd think if someone scores you the lowest possible score and details their cancer background in the score, then surely someone gets back to me, well they never did," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Richard said the private hospital that was infusing his treatment later agreed to delay sending him the bill, allowing his term deposit to mature at the set date.</p>
        
            <p>"From this experience it would seem that we have now moved from "Green Washing" to "Cancer Washing" whereby a company and indeed a new government, can use the vulnerability of cancer sufferers as part of a wider feelgood marketing or election campaign, but which in reality means very little," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is painful seeing young people who might've had the chance to extend their lives."</p>
        
            <p>Richard has been an ANZ customer for 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ responded in a statement: "We sympathise with the difficult situation this customer was facing when trying to access their term deposit, and we're sorry for any additional stress caused."</p>
        
            <p>The bank said it worked hard to support customers experiencing financial pressure, including those applying to access funds through the financial hardship process.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ said there was a formal process it needs to follow for all hardship applications - it said customers who need early access to their money after investing in a term deposit can request an early withdrawal by giving 31 days notice.</p>
        
            <p>It said in this case it appears some parts of the formal process were not followed as it would hope.</p>
        
            <p>"We apologise again and we encourage the customer to contact us if they'd like to discuss this further."</p>
