            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking after a meeting of the government's top ministers.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a draft version of the government's controversial Treaty Principles Bill was considered by Cabinet on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The final version will be considered again by Cabinet before it is introduced to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been under pressure from MƒÅori to reject the Bill, and was encouraged by opposition parties at Koroneihana to throw the policy out entirely.</p>
        
            <p>More than 400 Christian leaders - including senior leaders of the Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist denominations in Aotearoa - also signed an open letter calling on MPs to vote down the bill.</p>
