            <p>Bluebridge's Connemara ferry is understood to have hit a wharf in Picton while berthing.</p>
        
            <p>It was in the Queen Charlotte Sound on Tuesday while waiting for the wharf to be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Picton Harbourmaster Jake Oliver confirmed he had been made aware that a Bluebridge ferry had "made contact" with the wharf and was currently being fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a man told RNZ his partner was on board the ferry, which had headed back into the Queen Charlotte Sound after trying to dock.</p>

            <p>He said the fender chain appeared to have broken when the ferry tried to dock.</p>
        
            <p>Another person who said they were onboard at the time posted on social media that the ship had backed into the wharf.</p>
        
            <p>Marine tracking websites also showed the Connemara in the Queen Charlotte Sound.</p>
        
            <p>In September, the Connemara lost power during a late night sailing and had to be towed back to Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest in a series of disruptions, delays and issues with the country's ferries.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a strong wind watch for both Marlborough and Wellington, with a chance of northwest winds approaching a severe gale in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>The warning was in place in Marlborough from 1pm to 9pm, and from 2pm to midnight in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted both the Port and Bluebridge for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
