            <p>Five people are dead, including a nine-year-old girl who got lost inside a storm drain in Brisbane's south, as severe storms lash much of Australia's east coast.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland police said the girl was found dead following an extensive search on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger onboard a capsized boat off Brisbane's coast also died, as police divers search for two other missing passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a woman has died at a regional Victorian campground after it was hit by flash flooding.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as a man in Victoria's east and a woman on the Gold Coast both died after being struck by falling trees in the past 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>A nine-year-old girl is among those dead after severe storms ripped through parts of south-east Queensland on Monday and Tuesday, leaving more than 110,000 people without power.</p>
        
            <p>The girl was reported missing on Tuesday afternoon, believed to be lost inside a flooded drain in the south Brisbane suburb of Rochdale.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland police later released a statement saying she had been found and added her family were requesting privacy.</p>
        
            <p>Police also located a body after a 12-metre boat capsized between Manly and Green Island, off Brisbane's coast.</p>
        
            <p>Following a search for three missing passengers, police found one person dead in the water about 6:15pm.</p>
        
            <p>The two other people are still missing.</p>

            <p>Police said the search was suspended just before midnight and would continue Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The boat was believed to be carrying 11 passengers, and eight others were taken to hospital in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Queensland Ambulance Services (QAS) said the eight rescued men, aged in their 50s and 60s, were in the water for around an hour before help arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Manly State School, a primary school in Brisbane's Bayside, sustained some major damage, with the roof of the school hall blown off.</p>
        
            <p>A 59-year-old woman died on Monday night in the suburb of Helensvale, on the Gold Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the woman was struck by a tree about 9.30pm as the state's south-east was hit with intense rain, large hail and fierce winds.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services also remain searching for two people missing in floodwaters north of Queensland's Sunshine Coast.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood three people were in a large drain that washes out into the Mary River in Gympie when the area was inundated with water.</p>

            <p>Police and swift water rescue are searching for two women, both in their 40s, who remain unaccounted for.</p>
        
            <p>State-owned power utility Energex confirmed 98,367 people were still without power late Tuesday night, with nearly 1100 powerlines brought down in the past 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>By Tuesday evening the SES had responded to more than 1,000 calls for help around the Gold Coast, Scenic Rim and Logan, according to Queensland Fire and Emergency (QFES).</p>
        
            <p>QFES crews have been called to more than 600 incidents in those areas.</p>
        
            <p>In Brisbane, police said multiple roads in South Brisbane are being impacted by flash flooding, as Brisbane City recorded 85mm of rainfall in two hours.</p>
        
            <p>Brisbane City Council has also issued warnings over rising water levels in the Norman River in East Brisbane and the Stable Swamp Creek, near Rocklea.</p>
        
            <p>Brisbane Airport said multiple flights have been delayed or will be potentially cancelled due to the severe weather.</p>

            <p>A woman has died after a campground in regional Victoria was hit by flash flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency workers were called to the Buchan campground in east Gippsland, where the woman was found dead at about 6.45pm (local time) on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were told a number of vehicles in the campground area were underwater and a number of people were safely retrieved from a nearby bridge," Victorian police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a woman and her dog are lucky to be alive after they were rescued from the Werribee River, in Melbourne's south-west on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old woman was swept away by fast-flowing water about 1.30pm after she tried to retrieve her dog from the river.</p>
        
            <p>A passer-by raised the alarm after seeing the woman holding on to a tree.</p>
        
            <p>The Search and Rescue Squad and Water Police rescued the woman and her dog.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria's State Emergency Service said it responded to more than 1000 calls for help over a 72-hour period with the state's west being hit the hardest.</p>
        
            <p>Among those affected was the regional Victorian town of Wedderburn where businesses and homes were inundated with water.</p>
        
            <p>The central Victorian town of Elmore has also had warnings issued after reports of a faulty storage tank at the local water treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are warned not to use their local tap water for drinking, food preparation or preparing baby formula.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are also being told not to use tap water to wash themselves, to clean dishes and clothing, and not to give it to pets.</p>
        
            <p>The storage tank has reportedly been drained and the local water authority is organising bottled water delivery for the town's 800 residents.</p>
        
            <p>Local water authority Coliban Water said it could be several days before the water is restored and safe to drink.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the fault is currently being investigated.</p>
        
            <p>Several alerts remain in place across the state with residents urged to check the Vic Emergency website throughout the day for updates.</p>
        
            <p>In New South Wales, there is currently a severe thunderstorm warning, with damaging winds and large hail stones predicted for Sydney, Greater Newcastle and Central Coast areas.</p>
        
            <p>NSW State Emergency Service (SES) said it had responded to 473 calls for help since Christmas Day, including six flood rescues in the state's south-east.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers responded to 492 incidents on Christmas Eve, mostly in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the calls were from south-eastern parts of the state, where flash flooding impacted parts of the Illawarra, Goulburn and Eurobodalla.</p>
        
            <p>SES spokesperson Emily Barton said some parts of the south coast experienced intense rainfall of up to 156 millimetres.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Grenfell in the state's central west was impacted by hail storms, with the SES receiving 41 calls for assistance.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 volunteers were deployed to assist over the Christmas period.</p>
        
            <p>NSW SES Assistant Commissioner Sean Kearns said further storms are forecast for Boxing Day, shifting towards the east.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been prepared and we are ready for further rainfall today," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A watch and act alert for flooding has been issued for Hedley, Welshpool, Toora and Port Franklin as well.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile in Adelaide, the state recorded its coldest Christmas day in 17 years with a maximum of 19.7 C.</p>
        
            <p>An upper trough moving across the state's south-east around Christmas Eve has also brought some unseasonable hail to the Murray Mallee region.</p>
        
            <p>38mm of rain fell in Lameroo and 2mm in Pinnaroo while on Christmas Day and overnight, Macclesfield in the Adelaide Hills had 24mm of rain - the highest in the state.</p>
