            <p>A man who killed a Ministry of Health worker in a hit-and-run near Te Papa has been sentenced to four years and four months in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Jason Tuitama, 24, was sentenced at the Wellington High Court on Friday. He was granted discounts for a number of factors, including entering a guilty plea.</p>
        
            <p>He pled guilty to manslaughter and three other charges in March.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Andru Isac said during sentencing that Tuitama had slowed for a speed camera and a police checkpoint, but not pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>Along with a history of driving disqualification, he said that suggested a pattern of behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>His victim, Casidhe Maguire, was survived by her family and two-year-old son.</p>
        
            <p>Tuitama also pleaded guilty to reckless driving causing injury, failing to stop after a crash and driving while exceeding more than 400 milligrams of alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Tuitama recorded a breath test of 993 micrograms, almost four times the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>Maguire died in Wellington Regional Hospital in July last year after being taken to the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement from the Ministry of Health, it described her as a "really special person" and a valued team member who had many good friends.</p>
        
            <p>In the 28-year-old's obituary, her whanau gave their thanks to the staff in Wellington's ICU.</p>
