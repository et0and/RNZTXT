        <h2>Hamas accepts 11th hour truce, but Israel says no deal</h2>
        <p>
It comes as the Israeli military told residents to evacuate parts of Rafah, which has been sheltering more than a million displaced people.

            <p>An Israeli official says no ceasefire has been agreed in Gaza, after Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators.</p>
        
            <p>The Israeli official said the proposal that Hamas had accepted was a "softened" version of an Egyptian proposal, which included "far-reaching" conclusions that Israel could not accept.</p>
        
            <p>"This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal," said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Hamas said in a brief statement that its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that the group accepted their ceasefire proposal. The statement gave no details of the accord.</p>
        
            <p>There has been no successful agreement on a ceasefire in Gaza since a week-long pause in the fighting in November.</p>
        
            <p>The Hamas announcement of an agreement came hours after Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of Rafah, the city on Gaza's southern edge that has served as the last sanctuary for around half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents.</p>
