        <h2>Watch live: Reserve Bank officials front over OCR cut</h2>
        <p>
The cut brings the cash rate to its lowest level since November 2022.
</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank has cut the official cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to a two year low of 4.25 percent, as expected, saying a second consecutive super sized cut was justified by slowing inflation and weaker economy.</p>
        
            <p>The 50-basis-point cut brings the OCR to its lowest level since November 2022.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a 50-point cut to 4.75 percent in October.</p>
        
            <p>"Annual consumer price inflation has declined and is now close to the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band. Inflation expectations are also close to target and core inflation is converging to the midpoint," the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>It said the speed and size of future rate cuts would be determined by economic data.</p>
        
            <p>An indicative forecast in the monetary statement suggested a slower rate of cuts next year with the cash rate falling to around 3.5 percent by the end of next year.</p>
        
            <p>Economists had overwhelmingly forecast the big cut as the economy remained weak, households and businesses kept tight control on spending and investment, and the unemployment rate kept rising.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ acknowledged the weak state of the economy, but said there were signs an improvement was coming now that inflation was back in its 1-3 percent target band.</p>
        
            <p>"Economic growth is expected to recover during 2025, as lower interest rates encourage investment and other spending."</p>
        
            <p>The MPC said external risks from geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty could stoke economic and inflation volatility in the medium term.</p>
        
            <p>Three retail banks - the Co-operative, Kiwibank and ASB - were quick to cut their floating home and business lending rates.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Finance Minister Nicola Willis are scheduled to speak about the OCR about 2.30pm. You can watch via the livestream at the top of this story.</p>
