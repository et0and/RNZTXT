The broadcasting minister insists she is not ducking for cover, despite refusing all radio and TV interviews since the news of Newshub's impending closure.

            <p>Broadcasting Minister Melissa Lee insists she is not ducking for cover, despite refusing all radio and TV interviews since the announcement of Newshub's impending closure.</p>
        
            <p>Lee was widely criticised for her initial response on Wednesday, with commentators and opposition MPs describing her as glib or "missing in action".</p>
        
            <p>On her way into a National caucus meeting on Tuesday morning, Lee stopped for questions, with colleague Paul Goldsmith standing by her side.</p>
        
            <p>"I have actually fronted up. I haven't been hiding," she told reporters. "I have done a couple of interviews."</p>
        
            <p>Since the announcement, Lee has taken questions from reporters at Parliament on three occasions, including this morning. She also spoke to The Spinoff's Duncan Greive on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Lee was grilled by Labour MP Reuben Davidson in Parliament's regular Question Time on Thursday, and was likely to face further scrutiny there this week.</p>
        
            <p>She has, however, refused seemingly all requests for one-on-one broadcast interviews with multiple outlets, including RNZ.</p>

            <p>Asked Tuesday morning whether she would appear on RNZ's Morning Report or Checkpoint news programmes, Lee laughed and said she would check her diary. A spokesperson for the minister later texted to say her diary was committed on Tuesday afternoon and so she would be "unable to appear" on Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking on Tuesday morning, Lee struck a more sympathetic tone and suggested her initial response was because she was rattled.</p>
        
            <p>"It came as a shock. I'm a former journalist, I know what that's like," Lee said.</p>
        
            <p>"The media industry has been impacted by a huge drop in revenue [and] changes in the way that people view media or consume content, and it is a huge issue."</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Lee briefed her Cabinet colleagues on the state of the media sector, but has played down the likelihood of any urgent action or intervention to keep Newshub afloat.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition has yet to decide whether it would support a proposal to make social media giants pay for news under the Fair Digital Media Bargaining Bill introduced by the last Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>While in opposition, Lee was highly critical of the legislation, describing it as a "shakedown". The legislation is currently before select committee.</p>
        
            <p>Asked whether she had since changed her mind, Lee told reporters she would let the process play out before coming to a decision.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people feel that is going to support the industry ... I do not feel that it is my place to actually rush it or interfere in it or intervene in any way.</p>
        
            <p>"What has happened will probably impact on the way that the select committee views the bill ... once that is actually done, I will look at it and actually consider everything that has happened."</p>

            <p>National did not campaign on any broadcasting policy in the lead up to last year's election.</p>
        
            <p>Labour's broadcasting spokesperson Willie Jackson told reporters the minister had demonstrated terrible judgement and was clearly "running scared".</p>
        
            <p>"It's almost unbelievable that a senior minister has not done anything substantial," he said. "Newshub is collapsing and the minister goes missing. I've never seen anything like it."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said the government obviously could not underwrite Newshub, but should at least try brokering a deal to rescue it.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's just time to give up and it's certainly not time to disappear, as this minister has."</p>
