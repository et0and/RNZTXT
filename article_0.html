            <p>Commerce Minister Andrew Bayly has apologised for his conduct after a complaint that he repeatedly called a worker "a loser" and swore at him while on a business visit.</p>
        
            <p>The business employee formally complained after the visit, saying Bayly told him to "f*** off" and repeatedly called him a loser, making an 'L' with his fingers on his forehead.</p>
        
            <p>In a written complaint, released by the minister on Friday afternoon, the employee said he had been left feeling "degraded, embarrassed and deeply disrespected" during the visit in early October.</p>
        
            <p>In an accompanying statement, Bayly said his comments were intended in "a light-hearted manner" but he accepted they caused unintentional offence.</p>
        
            <p>"I obviously got this completely wrong, and I have unreservedly apologised to the person concerned ... I take responsibility for the situation, and I am sorry.</p>
        
            <p>"I regret my actions. They fall well short of the behaviour expected of a minister, and what I expect of myself. I have also apologised to the prime minister, and given him my assurance it will not happen again."</p>
        
            <p>In a separate statement, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was disappointed in Bayly's conduct but continued to hold confidence in him.</p>
        
            <p>"He fell well short of the professional standards of behaviour I expect from ministers. He has apologised, both to the person concerned and to me, and has given me his assurances that it won't happen again."</p>
