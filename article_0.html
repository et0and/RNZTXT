            <p>Recycling rules are about to change through much of the motu from Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The rules come as part of a new initiative to standardise the recycling service across the country by 2027. The strategy also saw the introduction of food scrap bins.</p>
        
            <p>Four councils, unable to meet the deadline, have until 2027 including Clutha, Hurunui, and Westland District Councils. They will add glass to their collection, while Gore District Council needs to add paper and plastic.</p>
        
            <p>Eight other councils do not have a kerbside collection at all - and the new government has not yet decided whether those councils will be required to provide kerbside recycling by 2027, the ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>The main points of the standardisation for all district and city councils mean, from 1 February:</p>
        
            <p>About 16 percent of materials in recycling bins cannot be recycled, which contaminates a bin and makes it unrecyclable.</p>
        
            <p>Plastic bags should not go into the recycling bin - they get caught in the sorting machine.</p>
        
            <p>Plastic bags and soft plastics can be put in special recycling bins at participating stores. Otherwise put them in your rubbish bin.</p>

            <p>Plastics 1, 2 and 5 are used in the majority of the plastic packaging we put in our recycling bins.</p>
        
            <p>Waste Solutions general manager Parul Sood said these plastics were more easily turned into other products than packaging made out of plastics 3, 4, 6, and 7, which were lower in quality.</p>
        
            <p>"This means there are limited markets for them anywhere in the world. It is important to reduce our dependence on plastics and to reuse them rather than recycling right away."</p>
        
            <p>Here are some examples of what these containers with numbers might include.</p>
        
            <p>Number 1: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</p>
        
            <p>Number 2: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) </p>
        
            <p>Number 5: Polypropylene (PP) </p>
        
            <p>Here are some examples of what the plastics no longer accepted by recycling may include. These should either go in your rubbish bins or contact your council for more ways. Council websites also have more information about disposal methods for non-recyclable items.</p>
        
            <p>Number 3: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) </p>
        
            <p>Number 4: Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) </p>
        
            <p>Number 6: Polystyrene (PS/EPS) </p>
        
            <p>Number 7: Other plastics (a mix of different plastics, including BPA, polycarbonate, acrylic, nylon, polylactic fibres and fibreglass.)</p>
