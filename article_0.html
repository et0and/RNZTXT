            <p>Hunger-striking inmate Dean Wickliffe will be released from prison after appearing before the Parole Board on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 77-year-old was taken to hospital on Monday after having refused food since 10 March, claiming he was beaten by multiple guards at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to prison for breaking his parole conditions, because he was living in his car and not at an approved address.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared before the New Zealand Parole Board today after his recall hearing date was moved forward from 3 April, following requests from his lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Sam Vincent confirmed to RNZ that Wickliffe has been granted parole and his hunger strike was now over after 16 days.</p>
        
            <p>He is set to be released on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>MORE TO COME...</p>
