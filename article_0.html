            <p>A Christchurch man who lost 55 relatives in three Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, says his remaining family will never leave, despite a US proposal to remove them.</p>
        
            <p>US President Donald Trump doubled down on his plan on Friday after it was rejected by Palestinians and leaders around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Yasser Abdulaal, who has lived in Ōtautahi for five years, said his two sisters lost their homes in the 15-month-long war.</p>

            <p>Abdulaal said they and their husbands - all teachers - could have left at the start of the bombing but refused to abandon their land - and they would not be leaving now.</p>
        
            <p>"After the ceasefire and with Trump's statements, they are definitely not going to leave Gaza, regardless of what he says and what [the US] does. It's their land."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand should recognise Palestine as a state and sanction Israel in accordance with international law.</p>
        
            <p>It should also call for more funding for international aid to Gaza, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand voted for a two-state solution and we have been asking the government to enforce that. Many countries during the genocide already recognise Palestine as a state but our government sees it as 'not the right time'.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is the right time, and New Zealand should recognise Palestine immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Abdulaal said he reached a moment during the war where he couldn't bring himself to call his sisters.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know what to say, remotely, from New Zealand. It's a really hard time for everyone, they've been in tents for more than eight months, both [my sisters'] houses have gone, they are completely rubble. They are still in tents despite the ceasefire because they have no other place to go to.</p>
        
            <p>But he has talked to the pair since the ceasefire began.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my sisters can't even go and see her house as there's still Israeli tanks in that area [the Philadelphia corridor]. But we know from footage - as she says - the height of my house now is half a metre, it was two levels but now it's half a metre."</p>
        
            <p>"It's mixed emotions. The killing and bloodshed has stopped, but I have lost 55 [relatives] in the airstrikes, most of them women and children.</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't even had a proper funeral... it's really hard, people are just trying to get food for their kids, those basic human rights for people which they don't have.</p>
        
            <p>"They are happy with the ceasefire, and we hope it will be a permanent ceasefire, but we have also lost lots of people... [the rest] have lost their houses, their jobs, everything.</p>

            <p>"When I close my eyes and I think about losing 55 people, and that's just the ones we know about. It's horrific, I can't believe it... they're all relatives: cousins, uncles, extended family."</p>
        
            <p>Trump's proposal was a "dangerous statement and outrageous", Abdulaal said, likening it to "a reward to Netanyahu and the Israeli government who have been bombing everything in Gaza, killing everyone, committing genocide".</p>
        
            <p>"[President Trump] says he wants to drive the people out of Gaza, meaning he wants to ethnically cleanse the people from Gaza, which is another war crime," said Abdulaal.</p>
        
            <p>"This is our land and we are rooted to this land and we'll never leave it."</p>
