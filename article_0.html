            <p>The boat skipper who helped rescue a man who had been stranded at sea for nearly 24 hours says it was a case of right place, right time.</p>
        
            <p>Police in the Coromandel are praising a trio of boaties after a dramatic ocean rescue Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They said Will Fransen was on a solo fishing trip on Tuesday when a suspected marlin pulled him overboard about 55 kilometres off the coast of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>He drifted in the water overnight, unable to catch his idling boat or reach the nearby Aldermen Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Three fishermen found Fransen the next day after spotting the reflection of the sun off his watch.</p>
        
            <p>The boat's skipper, Max White, said he and his friends were investigating the shine more closely when they realised it was a person in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably from about 200m out we saw an arm waving," White said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like 'I think it's a human'."</p>
        
            <p>He said the trio were in disbelief when they found Fransen.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something you expect.</p>
        
            <p>"Being 10 miles off the back of Mayor [Island], the last thing you think is you're going to see a human bobbing up and down in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"We're thankful that Will made communication and could wave around, and that it wasn't the worst case situation."</p>
        
            <p>White said they made space for Fransen, bringing him on board and giving him water, before alerting the authorities and making their way to Whangamatā Marina.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a situation of right place and right time," said White.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of those ones that could have gone either way, but we're just glad that we're on the right side of the ledger."</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Will Hamilton said the outcome could have been very different.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty significant amount of time in the water," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If circumstances were even, very slightly different, I think we'd be dealing with a very sad and tragic outcome."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton said there were lessons to be learned from the ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>"It really sends a message that, if you are going fishing, life jackets even if they aren't required, but also personal locator beacons, floatation devices, that sort of thing is really going to contribute to your safety and survival in circumstances such as this."</p>
        
            <p>Police said it was an absolute miracle Fransen was still alive and asked people to report any sightings of his boat.</p>
