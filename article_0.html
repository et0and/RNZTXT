            <p>There is no threat of a tsunami following a 6.8 magnitude earthquake off the lower South Island, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) says.</p>
        
            <p>The quake was initially recorded as a 7.0 but was downgraded by NEMA.</p>
        
            <p>NEMA said there was no threat to land and people did not need to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>However, NEMA warned people should avoid beaches and marine areas at the bottom of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Strong currents and surges can injure and drown people. There is a danger to swimmers, surfers, people fishing, and anyone in or near the water close to shore."</p>
