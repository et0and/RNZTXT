        <h2>Why can’t the All Blacks close out test matches?</h2>
        <p>
Bledisloe I gave us the now very familiar story of this All Black side, writes Jamie Wall. How can they fix it? Video
</p>
        
            <p>Analysis - A win's a win. That was the overriding emotion from the huge contingent of All Black fans filing out of Accor Stadium as the sun went down over Sydney last night, because they'd just watched a very familiar pattern of behaviour from the team.</p>
        
            <p>The one key difference was that unlike in South Africa, the late game scoring slump that the All Blacks are still suffering from didn't ultimately cost them. But it did make for a 31-28 score line in a test that certainly didn't deserve such a close finish.</p>
        
            <p>Really though, any analysis of this one can simply be done by copying and pasting what has happened previously:</p>
        
            <p>So…yeah. While the Bledisloe is safe, not many questions have been answered about the progression of the team.</p>
        
            <p>But we did learn a little bit. Beauden Barrett's late withdrawal meant that a hasty back three arrangement had to be found, with Will Jordan taking his place at fullback. It ended up being a blessing rather than a hinderance as Jordan put in easily his best performance in the 15 jersey at test level, getting on the scoresheet in only the second minute of play.</p>
        
            <p>On the flip side, it seems like it doesn't matter what sort of game is being played, the All Blacks are gradually losing their heads as well as their ability to score. Ofa Tu'ungafasi and Tyrel Lomax were binned in the 67th and 73rd minutes respectively in South Africa, then in Sydney Anton Lienert-Brown and Caleb Clarke did a tribute act to them by getting marched in the 64th and 71st.</p>

            <p>It was exactly what the Wallabies needed as they came home with a wet sail, which begs the question as to why nothing is being learned. It's also frustrating because the season started very positively in this area, with the only yellow card in the England series being a case of bad luck.</p>
        
            <p>One very positive thing that also should get a mention is goal kicking, because Damian McKenzie's effort in Cape Town involved a couple of key misses. He was flawless at Accor, landing two sideline conversions that were essentially the difference between winning and losing the test.</p>
        
            <p>But it also shouldn't have mattered because McKenzie also bombed the clearest cut of the many scoring opportunities squandered by the All Blacks. His extravagant attempt to get the ball to an unmarked Tamaiti Williams (who deserves a special mention for his perfect positioning on the play) went badly wrong, immediately increased the volume from his detractors and provided another negative narrative.</p>
        
            <p>The other big takeaway was that the Wallabies, despite having a new coaching regime, played exactly the way everyone would've expected them to. That's not a slight at all, Joe Schmidt's side attacked with bravery after getting rocked by three early All Black tries, and probably would have won had the game gone another five minutes.</p>
        
            <p>But the fact that the All Blacks knew that was all coming and still let them back into the game was probably the most concerning part. For all their heart, the Wallabies aren't the Springboks and should have been put away by the hour mark.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Scott Robertson was quick to praise his side's defence in the dying stages, which is fair given they were only playing with 13 men, but that sentiment somewhat ignored the fact that everything about that situation seemed self-inflicted.</p>
        
            <p>So now Robertson, his team, the media and the public will start again next week on trying to definitively shape the 2024 All Black story. Here's hoping by Sunday, there'll be something new to add.</p>
