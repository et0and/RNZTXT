            <p>The mother of the three missing Marokopa children believes the exchange between a pig hunter and her daughter last week was a cry for help.</p>
        
            <p>A video captured by the pig hunters north of Awamarino in Waikato last Thursday showed a man followed by three children in wet-weather gear carrying camouflaged backpacks and wearing masks.</p>
        
            <p>The group could be seen 20 to 30 metres away from the hunters, trekking through rough, overgrown terrain before disappearing behind a hill.</p>

            <p>Police described the sighting as "credible" and started patrols that night but a full search wasn't started until the following day. They searched for three days with air support, but found nothing of significance.</p>
        
            <p>The children's mother, known as Cat, speaking exclusively to Mata Reports presenter Mihingarangi Forbes, says she believes the short interaction between a 16-year-old pig hunter and a child she believes to be her daughter, Jayda, was her calling out for help.</p>
        
            <p>The pig hunter reported that after his group ran across three children and a man carrying a gun, one of the children said "Who knows we're here?"</p>
        
            <p>Cat said this was Jayda raising attention while knowing she had to be careful of her dad's reaction. Cat told Mata Reports Jayda was asking: "Does anyone know we are here, is anyone coming for us".</p>

            <p>She said that while she did not hear the tone of her voice she thought Jayda was "putting it out there and she's asking a question, she's trying to say something without saying something".</p>
        
            <p>She added that Jayda would be worried about repercussions from her father, Tom Phillips.</p>

            <p>Describing how she felt about the situation with Jayda, the oldest of the three missing children but middle child of Cat's five children, she said: "She's amazing, she's my beautiful big girl".</p>
        
            <p>Cat is worried she's grown up too fast but is also proud of her. "She's so strong and she'll be the mother; she's taking care of my other two babies. She is taking care of them and keeping them safe the only way she can in this situation."</p>
        
            <p>She has no doubt it is her children she can see in the pig hunters' video and it was "good" to see them after almost three years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the best news anyone could hope for."</p>
        
            <p>She received a text from police to alert her to the latest sighting, but she was left in the dark on how they were responding to it.</p>
        
            <p>Cat believes police should have got officers to the scene within an hour as well as putting up a helicopter and using sniffer dogs.</p>
        
            <p>She believes the system has "failed miserably" in how it has responded to the disappearance of her children.</p>
        
            <p>"I had faith in our system and I feel like such a fool now. It's failed my children ...I feel like they're being treated like they're irrelevant, like they're nobody, like they don't matter but they do... They deserve so much more."</p>
        
            <p>This included the chance to have proper healthcare, have friends and go to the beach instead of being isolated.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was dumbfounded by the support her ex-partner was receiving.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody can comprehend and I wouldn't wish this situation on anybody, not even on my worst enemy. It's wrong."</p>
        
            <p>Until the encounter last week, Phillips and his three children Jayda, now 11, Maverick, nine, and Ember, eight, have not been seen together since 12 December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Cat also says she was the first person to spot Tom Phillips at a Bunnings store in August 2023.</p>
        
            <p>She recognised her former partner as she walked past a ute in the Hamilton Bunnings carpark.</p>
        
            <p>Cat says Phillips drove off and she gave chase before losing him when he cut in front of a bus.</p>
        
            <p>Cat says during winter she feared for how her children would survive in wet freezing conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just wrong on so many levels."</p>
        
            <p>In June she made an emotional appeal asking people to help find the children so they could be returned to her.</p>

            <p>It followed the police's launch of an $80,000 reward for information that would help discover their whereabouts. The offer has run out without providing the critical breakthrough.</p>
        
            <p>At the time police also released a video of Cat in which she said: "They are just innocent children. They do not deserve to be treated this way.</p>
        
            <p>"They do not deserve the life that is being provided to them right now."</p>
        
            <p>She also criticised her estranged husband, accusing him of child neglect, endangerment, abandonment and abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"None of this is okay. My babies deserve better."</p>
        
            <p>Police said at the time that the reward had resulted in more than 100 pieces of new information via phone calls, emails and personal approaches to them.</p>
