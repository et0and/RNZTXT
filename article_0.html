            <p>Two Lower Hutt children have been hospitalised with a "multitude of broken bones", with police suspecting they were hurt deliberately "over a long period of time".</p>
        
            <p>The two children are aged four and five. One had "brain bleeds and severe internal injuries", police said.</p>
        
            <p>The suspected abuse was uncovered two weeks ago, when one of the children was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Hospital staff alerted police.</p>
        
            <p>"A medical assessment of the child and their sibling revealed further injuries believed to have been sustained in previous incidents," police said on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Their injuries were so extensive one required surgery, and it has taken weeks to understand the full extent of damage to their bodies."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the children's family had recently moved to Stokes Valley and had been in their new home just two nights when they were hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>"These injuries do not just happen; it's likely someone knows something or has seen something and that's why we need the community's help."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was urged to contact police on 105, citing file number 240308/4647, or call Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
