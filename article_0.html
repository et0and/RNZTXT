        <h2>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown launches re-election campaign</h2>

The 78-year-old had served as mayor of the supercity since October 2022.

            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown has launched his re-election campaign on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 78-year-old had served as mayor of the supercity since October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He made the announcement at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron on Auckland's waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>"I have delivered on most of the policies I set out to achieve, which ensure real results for our city. I've made tough calls, tackled the big issues, and done the job well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's more to do, and I have the experience to get it done. That's why I will be standing for re-election as mayor of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't stand for any political party, and my focus remains firmly on the work at hand - fixing Auckland, not running an election campaign."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said his priority is to ensure that ratepayers get a fair deal and that every dollar spent by Auckland Council delivers value to our communities.</p>
        
            <p>He said he has driven a culture change within Auckland Council, and has brought a sharper focus on efficiency, and accountability.</p>

            <p>"I will have more to say about my goals and ambitions for the second term as the year unfolds, but for now, my commitment remains the same - delivering for Aucklanders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This city has a brilliant future, and it's a job I want to keep doing."</p>
        
            <p>"Let's finish the job together."</p>
        
            <p>Kerrin Leoni was the only Auckland councillor to put her name forward for the city's top job so far and would be running as an independent candidate.</p>
        
            <p>It was also speculated Brown's own deputy Desley Simpson could challenge him for the job after the domain name, "DesleyforMayor.co.nz'' was registered by Desley Simpson's son in December.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ last month she had "not yet made a decision about what I intend to do this year".</p>
