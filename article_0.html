            <p>Firefighters are responding to multiple scrub fires that are threatening homes in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>A number of spot fires along a railway line between Aylesbury and Darfield west of Christchurch were first reported at about 4.30pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of houses are under threat, especially in the Kirwee area," Fire and Emergency NZ said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are assisting with road closures and the public is asked to stay away from the area."</p>
        
            <p>One of the blazes is believed to have started by sparks from a train travelling toward Darfield.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the fires are not contained, with crews spread across multiple blazes.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management is in place along State Highway 73's West Coast Road near Kirwee with a diversion in place at the intersection with Courtenay Road.</p>
        
            <p>Three helicopters have been fighting the fires, alongside 17 ground crews, including pumps, tankers, smoke chasers and a Command Unit.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are in attendance from Kirwee, Darfield, West Melton, Hororata, Dunsandel, Springfield, Wigram, Canterbury High Country and the Christchurch Command unit.</p>
