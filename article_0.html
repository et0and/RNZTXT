            <p>Students in Onehunga High School uniforms can be seen fighting a group of youths out of uniform, one of whom was armed with a machete.</p>
        
            <p>In a video being widely shared online, a person can be heard yelling at the armed person to put the "knife" down, while others run away from the fight.</p>
        
            <p>At one point, a student can be seen trying to hold back those involved in the skirmish.</p>
        
            <p>Police said enquiries were ongoing to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident on Thursday, and who was involved.</p>
        
            <p>They said officers were called to reports of a group of young people involved in an altercation on Pleasant Street about 3.20pm, but the group had dispersed by the time they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Onehunga High School has been approached for comment.</p>
