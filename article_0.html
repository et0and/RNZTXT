            <p>Whangārei Hospital's emergency department is in "Code Black" - meaning it is unable to accept more patients - after it hit more than 150 percent capacity.</p>
        
            <p>A Health NZ spokesperson said it was not uncommon for the ED to go into Code Black, but it would continue to take patients who needed emergency care.</p>
        
            <p>Staff have told RNZ there have been more than 80 arrivals since midnight, including 21 within one hour.</p>
        
            <p>"I have never seen this before," one said.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon the ED was at 156 percent capacity.</p>
        
            <p>The pressure was partly due to the hospital having to pick up the slack left by smaller Northland hospitals, which were also struggling demand and staff shortages.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Islands Hospital at Kawakawa has been forced to downgrade services this weekend due to a doctor shortage.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands up to nine patients from Bay of Islands were transferred to Whangārei yesterday, and a medical registrar had been asked to take calls for Dargaville patients, too.</p>
        
            <p>Heath Minister Shane Reti has declined to comment.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
