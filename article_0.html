        <h2>'We, as Māori, have had enough': Ngāpuhi takes stand against Section 7AA repeal</h2>
        <p>
A state care survivor from the iwi says it's dangerous and unsafe to be Māori in their own land, as they oppose the legislation's removal.
</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 people including from Aotearoa's largest iwi, Ngāpuhi, gathered outside Parliament in Wellington on Monday to oppose the repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act.</p>
        
            <p>It came as a select committee met to hear submissions on the removal of the legislation, which legally binds Oranga Tamariki to improve and report on outcomes for Māori in care.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the iwi members travelled to the capital city from Northland, almost the entire length of North Island, to oppose the legislation, which is part of the National and ACT coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>One of those in attendance was Maraea Rihari, a survivor of state care, from Ngāpuhi.</p>

            <p>Rihari told RNZ the removal of section 7AA would have intergenerational consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"We, as Māori, have had enough of that. We've been pawns to whatever law or policy that has been brought in by successive governments," Rihari said.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, it's really dangerous and unsafe for us to be Māori, here in our own land."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi, who addressed the crowd on the steps of Parliament, said New Zealanders should not be surprised if more iwi made their way to Wellington to protest.</p>
        
            <p>"This is about ensuring the voices of Ngāpuhi are well and truly heard and that this house will no longer have a free run and a free hit."</p>

            <p>Waititi said the removal of section 7AA was tantamount to a "free punch" and eventually Māori would start "punching back."</p>

            <p>Despite Ngāpuhi already having a working relationship with Oranga Tamariki, there was still no mechanism to connect kids back to their whānau once they were out of care, Pomare said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a double pain and hurt that they carry, because when it's time for them to come home they have no idea about who they are," Pomare said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been on them for decades. This kaupapa is not new."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, inside Parliament, former children's minister and NZ First MP Tracey Martin cautioned a select committee that 7AA provided the best chance of turning Oranga Tamariki from a crisis response service to a child protection agency</p>
        
            <p>"We do not have a child protection service in this country. We have child crisis service," Martin said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a nation, we wait until there is damage done to a child either emotionally, physically or spiritually before we take any action."</p>
        
            <p>Section 7AA was the key to making the change to become a country which supported child protection, Martin said.</p>
        
            <p>Representing the National Iwi Chairs Forum, Rahui Papa implored MPs to heed the lessons of the recent Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, and stop further transgressions and mamae.</p>
        
            <p>"With the scrapping of section 7AA, we believe more harm will come to our mokopuna. It has the potential for further royal commission [inquiries] well, well into the future," Papa said.</p>

            <p>Labour MP Willow Jean Prime, herself from Ngāpuhi, stood on Parliament's steps to welcome her people.</p>
        
            <p>Prime said those who came today would be remembered by their mokopuna for taking a stand.</p>
        
            <p>"[Today] they fought for their mokopuna and they will continue to fight for their mokopuna. I am sure of that."</p>
        
            <p>Submissions on Oranga Tamariki (Repeal of Section 7AA) Amendment Bill closed last month.</p>
