            <p>A strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake has been recorded in Tonga, and a tsunami warning has been issued for places within 300km of the epicentre, including the capital, Nuku'alofa.</p>
        
            <p>The quake struck 90km southeast of Pangai, which is in the Ha'apai Group of islands, about 1.20am on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The United States Tsunami Warning System said hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake were possible within 300km of the epicentre along the coasts of Tonga.</p>
        
            <p>It is advising that initial waves may start arriving in Holeva and the Tongan capital Nuku'alofa any time from now.</p>
        
            <p>The warning centre said the time between wave crests can vary from five minutes to an hour, and the hazard may persist for many hours or longer after the initial wave.</p>
        
            <p>It is advising anyone in the threat zone to follow instructions from their local authorities.</p>
