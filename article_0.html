            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ says it is still unable to release its review into how it responded to the fatal Loafers Lodge fire in Wellington 18 months ago.</p>
        
            <p>The trial date for the man accused of murdering five people in the fire has been pushed back to 2025.</p>
        
            <p>He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said its operational review had been completed, as well as a post-incident analysis.</p>
        
            <p>But neither could be released while they might prejudice the right to a fair trial, or interfere with a police investigation, it said.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the fire in May 2023, senior firefighters and communications centre staff said they did not have all the resources they needed, which Fire and Emergency leadership disputed.</p>
        
            <p>One of two long-ladder fire trucks in Wellington had broken down and was unable to attend the blaze.</p>
