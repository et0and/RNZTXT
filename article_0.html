            <p>The purchase of a $750 suitcase by Invercargill City Council for the sole purpose of bringing gifts home from Japan has drawn criticism from elected members.</p>
        
            <p>This week, council staff presented a list of 'sensitive expenditures' to the finance and projects committee for the period September to December 2023 - totalling $59,867.</p>
        
            <p>The report included bills from a July 2023 trip to sister city Kumagaya, Japan, which had not been processed until a later date.</p>
        
            <p>A $749.41 item titled "purchase additional suitcase for additional gifts" caught the attention of mana whenua representative Pania Coote who asked for more information.</p>
        
            <p>"The suitcase was quite expensive. Or was that more than one suitcase?" Coote asked.</p>
        
            <p>A short discussion followed, with Coote's question remaining unanswered.</p>
        
            <p>Council group manager finance and assurance Patricia Christie has since clarified the expenditure was for a single hard-shell case used to transport a bamboo bowl and porcelain plate back to New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>Both items were gifted by the City of Kumagaya and the Kumagaya Friendship Association, and required a "high degree of protection" due to their delicate nature, Christie said.</p>
        
            <p>"The purchase of the suitcase was done so in the presence of councillor Barry Stewart, and was approved by Mayor Nobby Clark."</p>

            <p>Councillor Ria Bond told Local Democracy Reporting more information on the expense was provided after the meeting, but maintained it was an "exorbitant" price for a suitcase.</p>
        
            <p>"When people in our city, they can't even put food on their plates. That's excessive," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In November, the council revealed it spent more than $36,000 on the trip to Kumagaya.</p>
        
            <p>The travelling party included Mayor Nobby Clark, Deputy Mayor Tom Campbell, four councillors, one staff member and an interpreter.</p>
        
            <p>Prior to the trip, Campbell said he would pay his own way, and followed through on his promise.</p>
        
            <p>Also included in the council's sensitive expenditure list for September to December 2023 were bills for catering workshops and meetings totalling just over $7000.</p>
        
            <p>Some of those items pertained to purchases that occurred outside of the four-month time period.</p>
        
            <p>The gifts from Japan were not currently on display at the council but would likely be so in the near future, Christie said.</p>
