            <p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it launched dozens of drones and missiles at Israel late on Saturday, an attack that may trigger a major escalation between the regional archenemies, with the US pledging to back Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military said more than 100 drones, which Iraqi security sources said were seen flying over the country from Iran, would take hours to reach their targets. Israeli Channel 12 said some had been shot down over Syria or Jordan.</p>
        
            <p>Iran's state news agency cited a source saying its military had also launched a first wave of ballistic missiles against Israel.</p>
        
            <p>Iran has vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on 1 April that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders and said its strike was a punishment for "Israeli crimes". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden, who on Friday warned Iran against attacking Israel after saying such a scenario appeared imminent, has pledged to stand with Israel against Iran, the White House said.</p>
        
            <p>A retired Israeli general, Amos Yadlin, told the country's Channel 12 news that the Iranian drones were equipped with 20 kg of explosives each.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military said sirens would sound in any threatened areas and that its defences were poised to deal with them.</p>
        
            <p>Israel and neighbouring Jordan, which lies between Iraq and Israel, said they were closing their airspace on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>The Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, now in its seventh month, has driven up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Saturday, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported that a Guards helicopter had boarded and taken into Iranian waters the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries.</p>
        
            <p>MSC, which operates the Aries, confirmed that Iran had seized the ship and said it was working "with the relevant authorities" for its safe return and the wellbeing of its 25 crew.</p>
        
            <p>MSC leases the Aries from Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime, Zodiac said in a statement, adding that MSC is responsible for all the vessel's activities. Zodiac is partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Iran of piracy.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Israel called off school trips and other youth activities planned for the coming days, the beginning of the Passover festival, and placed the armed forces on full alert .</p>
        
            <p>Announcing the measures in a televised briefing, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said dozens of combat planes were airborne as part of the state of readiness.</p>
        
            <p>Video on Iranian news channels purporting to show the seizure of the Aries included a figure abseiling from a helicopter onto a ship. Reuters was able to verify that the ship in the video was the MSC Aries but not the date it was recorded.</p>

            <p>Dutch foreign minister Hanke Bruins Slot told her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a phone call that Iran should not attack Israel and should take actions to "de-escalate", she said on social media platform X.</p>
        
            <p>"During the conversation I also expressed my great concerns about the ship that was hijacked in the Strait of Hormuz and that these types of actions must stop", she added.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes amid rising regional tensions since the start of Israel's campaign in Gaza in October, with Israel or its ally the United States clashing repeatedly with Iranian-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.</p>
        
            <p>Iran has threatened to retaliate for suspected Israeli airstrikes on its consulate in Syria's capital Damascus on 1 April that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers, including two senior commanders.</p>
        
            <p>US President Joe Biden said on Friday he expected Iran to attack Israel "sooner, rather than later" and warned Tehran not to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Israel's military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said "Iran will bear consequences for choosing to escalate this situation any further", in response to reports of the seizure of MSC Aries.</p>
        
            <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Tehran of piracy.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday the naval head of the Revolutionary Guards, Alireza Tangsiri, said it could close the Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and the United Arab Emirates, if deemed necessary.</p>
        
            <p>He said Iran viewed as a threat Israel's presence in the UAE, with which Israel established diplomatic relations in 2020 as part of the "Abraham Accords" mediated by the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Analyst Hasan Alhasan of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said if the seizure of the MSC Aries was in retaliation for Israel's strike on Iran's Damascus consulate, it showed a desire to save face without a wider escalation.</p>
        
            <p>"Iran may be trying to play on fears that it could obstruct shipping through the strait, a passageway of greater significance to global oil and gas supplies than the Red Sea," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If Iran were to limit itself to seising commercial vessels linked to Israel then it would minimise the risk of an all-out conflict but damage its own credibility," he added.</p>
        
            <p>Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group has disrupted global trade with attacks on shipping in the Red Sea for months, saying it is aiming at vessels linked to Israel in retaliation for Israel's campaign in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against Houthi targets in response to the attacks on shipping.</p>
