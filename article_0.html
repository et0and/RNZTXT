            <p>With just days to go until voters in the United States elect either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump as their next president, we looked back at some of the key moments in this year's election campaign, and what we can expect next.</p>
        
            <p>After assassination attempts, name calling, and accusations aplenty, one could be forgiven for forgetting that just a few months ago president Joe Biden was actually the Democratic candidate.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look back at a whirlwind last few months (all dates are in NZT):</p>
        
            <p>With no real competition, the current president officially got enough delegates to clinch his party's nomination in March.</p>
        
            <p>Former President Trump beat back competition from Nikki Haley and others to win a third try as the presidency as Republican nominee.</p>
        
            <p>President Joe Biden's performance in the CNN debate sparked a fresh round of calls that he was too old to run and should stand aside.</p>
        
            <p>Biden's faltering performance continues as he introduces Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensk as "President Putin" at NATO. Pressure continues to mount for him to stand aside.</p>
        
            <p>An attempted assassination attempt on former US president Donald Trump's leaves him with blood splattered on his face after he was hit in the ear. One audience member was killed.</p>
        
            <p>Trump makes a triumphant entrance during the first night of the Republican National Convention with a rectangle white bandage on his ear, and supporters started wearing them in solidarity.</p>
        
            <p>Trump selects Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate.</p>
        
            <p>Biden tests positive for Covid-19 and goes into isolation.</p>
        
            <p>Trump accepts his party's presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention.</p>
        
            <p>Biden announces he is abandoning his reelection campaign and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, as the Democratic candidate.</p>
        
            <p>Harris passes the threshold to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in a vote of party delegates.</p>
        
            <p>Harris selects Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate.</p>
        
            <p>Harris accepts the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        
            <p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr abandons his campaign and endorses Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Harris and Trump take part in a fiery television debate, hosted by ABC News, their only one of the campaign.</p>
        
            <p>A man is arrested for an assassination attempt on Trump while he was golfing on his course in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
        
            <p>Walz and Vance take part in a vice presidential debate.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at what is next:</p>
        
            <p>The first Tuesday (US time) of November is Election Day. Here is a breakdown of poll closing times.</p>
        
            <p>The deadlines vary by state to certify the official vote tallies. Delaware is first on 8 November. Pennsylvania and Rhode Island do not have specified deadlines for certification.</p>
        
            <p>If there is no clear winner projected by 12 November, federal agencies are required to brief Harris and Trump's campaign teams on each agency's most pressing work and the key roles that need filling.</p>
        
            <p>Unless the date changes, Donald Trump will have to report to a courtroom in Lower Manhattan for sentencing after his guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial.</p>
        
            <p>Once the states have certified their results, each state's executive - the governor in most cases - signs "certificates of ascertainment" formally allocating that state's electors to the winning candidate.</p>
        
            <p>In every state, the electors will meet and cast votes for President and Vice President.</p>
        
            <p>They must arrive in Washington, DC by the fourth Thursday in December, which this year falls on Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>Every two years, the newly elected House and Senate convene on 4 January.</p>
        
            <p>The sitting Vice President-as president of the Senate-has a ceremonial duty to oversee the final step of the Electoral College process during a joint session of the House and Senate. In 2021, this process which had been routine for more than 200 years turned violent after Trump supporters rioted at the US Capitol.</p>
        
            <p>The President-elect will take the Oath of Office on the steps of the US Capitol.</p>
