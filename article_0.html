            <p>MetService is forecasting most of the country to have at least one clear morning for those who are keen to take part in a bit of pre-dawn stargazing this Matariki weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Stormy conditions were brought to the East Coast of the North Island earlier this week, and there will still be rain over the area on Thursday and Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Thursday into Friday, [there will be] areas of cloud down south and on the western coast [of the South Island]," meteorologist John Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"This cloud which has been plaguing the eastern side [of the North Island] over the last few days, but we are looking at some clearer skies across the western side of the North Island and across many parts of the eastern side of the South Island."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson, Wellington, Whanganui, Taranaki, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, and Northland were set to have clear skies heading into Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be some pockets of early morning mist and fog through some of those more inland valleys [in central North Island], something to consider first thing on Friday morning," Law said.</p>
        
            <p>The east coast of the North Island could expect those clouds to start to break up during the day, for some drier and brighter weather.</p>
        
            <p>However, Saturday morning will offer clearer skies, which will present a good chance to spot Matariki rising in the east.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato could expect a chilly 5 degrees Celsius start to Friday, while Bay of Plenty could expect 11C. In the South Island, parts of Central Otago and Southland could drop to 0C, while Canterbury could expect about 3C on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said, generally, the weather would remain on the mostly settled side over the long weekend.</p>
        
            <p>It said there would be heavy rain and blustery northerly winds starting in Fiordland during the second half of Sunday, which will move up the South Island and then across the North Island next week.</p>
