            <p>Joseph Parker has beaten American Deontay Wilder by unanimous decision in Saudi Arabia this morning, in a major upset in the heavyweight division.</p>
        
            <p>In arguably the biggest win of Parker's career, the Kiwi boxer dominated Wilder throughout the bout to take the win 118-111, 118-110, and 120-108.</p>
        
            <p>After the match, Parker said he had trained very hard for this moment, paying tribute to the Tyson Fury camp, who got him prepared for the fight.</p>
        
            <p>"Strategy was to be really fit, stay calm, stay relaxed.</p>
        
            <p>"Merry Christmas to us!"</p>
        
            <p>He said inactivity may have played a big part for Wilder, but for him it was a great finish to the year.</p>
