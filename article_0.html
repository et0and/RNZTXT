        <h2>‘Couldn’t quite put the pressure on’ – Robertson reflects on shock All Black loss</h2>
        <p>
Scott Robertson lamented his side's lack of finishing quality in their defeat at the hands of Argentina.
</p>
        
            <p>The morning after his first loss as All Black coach, Scott Robertson acknowledged that a lack of finishing quality was what cost them in their 38-30 loss to Argentina at Sky Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>"A bit of both, really," was his answer to whether the All Blacks didn't visit the Pumas' 22 enough or didn't do enough when they got there.</p>
        
            <p>"Not executing when we get there. I think I mentioned the first couple of games we created a lot but not finished a lot. Test football, those moments that you win and don't win, they swing on you pretty quickly. It's important that you take those opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>Another major concern was the fact that despite holding three quarters of possession for the final 10 minutes of the game, the All Blacks could not leave their own half.</p>

            <p>"It was a balance between holding the ball and getting field position," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We gave a couple of technical penalties away, especially at the lineouts. We let them off, let them back up the field again."</p>
        
            <p>As the two sides prepare to face each other again next weekend at Eden Park, there will surely be a close eye cast on just what Robertson does with a few key positions.</p>
        
            <p>Damian McKenzie showed flashes of brilliance, but didn't take control and played his part in the bumbling sequence that led to the Pumas being awarded a five metre scrum that set up the winning try.</p>
        
            <p>However, Robertson suggested the number 10 jersey would stay on McKenzie's back for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>"Damian's got some hell of a moments, hasn't he? That chip kick, his short passing game was really good. He'll grow as a game manager … you've got to back him."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson described the experience for Ardie Savea, who captained the side for the first time in his hometown, as "a tough one".</p>
        
            <p>"He does his talking with his actions, he doesn't talk much. We felt it like everybody else, especially Ardie, so we'll get around him."</p>
        
            <p>The one bit of good news, aside from the fact that really the All Blacks couldn't have picked a better weekend to lose a test, given the Olympic success overnight, is that there were no injury concerns.</p>
        
            <p>How Robertson uses his squad this week, especially in the forwards where the need for some hard hitting ball carriers was evident, will be interesting.</p>
