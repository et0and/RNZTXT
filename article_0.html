            <p>Bob Carr has confirmed to RNZ his lawyers have written to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, informing him they intend to launch legal action against him.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Peters' office to confirm he has received the letter.</p>
        
            <p>In an interview on RNZ's Morning Report on Thursday, Peters criticised the former Australian senator.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ removed the comments from the interview online after Carr, who was Australia's foreign minister from 2012 to 2013, told RNZ he considered the remarks to be "entirely defamatory" and would commence legal action.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
