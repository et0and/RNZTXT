            <p>Government and environmental agencies in Samoa are on alert after a New Zealand Navy ship caught fire and sank off the south coast of Upolu.</p>
        
            <p>The HMNZS Manawanui - a specialist dive and hydrographic vessel - was conducting a reef survey when it hit the reef on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Seventy-five crew and passengers were taken off the vessel by liferafts and other boats which came to the rescue.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa fire commissioner Tanuvasa Petone said the ship caught fire and sank on Sunday morning after a successful rescue. Three on board needed hospital treatment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all on land. They are safe and sound apart from just a few individuals thatâ€¦ have some minor injuries, and so we treated them at the site and transferred to them to the hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Petone said the conditions were "quite rough and windy".</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force will reveal more information on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>HMNZS Manawanui, the navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, regularly conducts tasks across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, the government said the ship would cost $103 million to buy and convert. It was completed in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com's ship tracker earlier showed the vessel was 'aground' near the village of Siumu, on the southern side of Upolu, at 10.45pm Saturday.</p>

            <p>Maritime component commander Commodore Shane Arndell said the grounding occurred while conducting a reef survey.</p>
        
            <p>The 75 crew and passengers were at first evacuated onto life rafts, before being taken ashore by rescuers.</p>
        
            <p>"They are being supported in Samoa or on supporting vessels," Arndell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand Defence Force worked closely with Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ) which coordinated rescue efforts. Several vessels responded and assisted in rescuing crew and passengers. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-8A Poseidon was also deployed."</p>

            <p>HMNZS Manawanui departed Auckland's Devonport naval base for the Pacific on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Defence Force website, the ship has a core crew of 39. It has been in service since November 2019 and has a top speed of 14 knots (26km/h).</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, it was used in a seven-week operation to conduct underwater surveys and help to dispose of submerged World War II bombs in Niue, Fiji and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of our crew hail from Pacific nations and so for them our deployments to the Pacific are a way for them to give something back to their communities," Commanding Officer Yvonne Gray said at the time.</p>
