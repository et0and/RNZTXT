            <p>A New Zealand Defence Force ship has run aground off the Samoan island of Upolu.</p>
        
            <p>HMNZS Manawanui, the Navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, regularly conducts tasks across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Marinetraffic.com's ship tracker showed the vessel was 'aground' near the village of Siumu, on the southern side of Upolu, at 10.45pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It had departed Auckland's Devonport naval base for the Pacific on 29 September.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Defence Force website, the ship has a capacity of 66 and a core crew of 39.</p>
        
            <p>It has been in service since November 2019 and has a top speed of 14 knots (26km/h).</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, it was used in a seven-week operation to conduct underwater surveys and help to dispose of submerged World War II bombs in Niue, Fiji and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of our crew hail from Pacific nations and so for them our deployments to the Pacific are a way for them to give something back to their communities," Commanding Officer Yvonne Gray said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force has been contacted for comment.</p>
