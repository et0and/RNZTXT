        <h2>'Best ever' New Zealand beat Britain to defend America's Cup</h2>
        <p>
The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating the British by 37 seconds.

            <p>The jubilant crew of Emirates Team New Zealand sprayed each other with champagne after completing a commanding 7-2 victory over Ineos Britannia on Saturday to defend the America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating their British opponents by 37 seconds in the ninth race off Barcelona to end the best-of-13 series.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand raced into a 4-0 lead in the 37th edition of the competition before Britain fought back with two victories on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>However, the defenders responded with three points in a row to clinch a third straight victory after their successes in 2017 and 2021, the country's fifth triumph in the competition.</p>
        
            <p>"What an amazing feeling, it's been a tough battle all week, but an amazing scoreline and I'm proud of the way the team kept battling today," said Kiwi helmsman Peter Burling.</p>

            <p>"It's still just sinking in... what an awesome day, Barcelona's just been absolutely amazing, what an amazing feeling."</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis' AC75 foiling boat, named Taihoro - a MƒÅori language word meaning 'to move swiftly as the sea between both sky and earth' - was towed back to harbour with a flotilla escort as celebrations began in earnest.</p>
        
            <p>They raised a huge flag thanking host city Barcelona, with hundreds of fans scrambling for a sight of the victors coming back in to the port.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand are the first nation to lift the trophy in three consecutive editions since the United States in 1987, 1988 and 1992.</p>
        
            <p>The second generation of AC75 foiling boats has reduced the differences between the teams, but New Zealand consistently read the wind conditions better.</p>

            <p>Burling was the youngest helmsman to win the 'Auld Mug', winning it in 2017 at 26, and then skippering the team to a superb title defence four years later before triumphing this year.</p>
        
            <p>"They're all incredibly special, they've all got their highs and their lows," said Burling of his trio of victories. "Today's still sinking in."</p>
        
            <p>The ninth race was delayed by 40 minutes because of light wind conditions but eventually began with Ineos knowing they needed to win five straight races to lift the trophy.</p>

            <p>The British boat crossed the start line a knot faster than their opponents and the teams exchanged the lead until New Zealand pulled ahead by 200 metres at the first gate.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwis extended their lead to 22 seconds by the second mark but Ineos continued to fight relentlessly and cut the gap significantly in the third and fourth legs.</p>
        
            <p>The right side of the course offered higher pressure and New Zealand did a good job of defending it, denying Britain a way back in.</p>
        
            <p>"A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team, and in my view they are the best team ever in the America's Cup," said Ineos skipper Ben Ainslie.</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day the better team won."</p>

            <p>However, helmsman Dylan Fletcher insisted the Kiwis will be looking over their shoulder next time around.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew it was always going to be hard to beat them but I think that they'll be scared of how much we progressed through the America's Cup," Fletcher told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"We showed the bigger progression and we're going to beat them next time around."</p>
        
            <p>Ainslie and Ineos, bankrolled by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, needed a miracle but it was not forthcoming.</p>
        
            <p>Britain reached the America's Cup for the first time in 60 years but have still never won the competition which started 173 years ago with a race around the Isle of Wight.</p>

            <p>Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position.</p>
        
            <p>"We're determined to keep going until we get the job done... we set this thing up 10 years ago to win the Cup, and I'm not a quitter," he told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>"Age is just a number... I'm committed to the team, really, whatever my role is, it's how I can serve the team best.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, I don't know next time if I'm going to go on the water or not, but I'm committed to the team moving forward and getting the job done and winning the Cup."</p>
