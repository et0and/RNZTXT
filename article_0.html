            <p>Kiwi pole vaulter Eliza McCartney says it's a "dream come true" for her to be competing at the Paris Olympics at the same time as her partner.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was important she did not get too "emotionally invested" in how Lukas Walton-Keim was faring in his kite-foiling event, 800km away in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel really good about how we are going to be able to stay in touch and support each other without having to get too emotionally invested in what the other person is going through because that's a really really hard thing.</p>
        
            <p>"We weren't really sure how we were going to go about it to be honest but I feel good about what we're doing. I think we're going to be able to support each other really well despite him being far away and both of us needing to be focused on our own thing."</p>
        
            <p>Walton-Keim was named to compete at the Paris Olympics after he appealed his initial non-nomination at the Sports Tribunal which then ordered Yahting New Zealand to revisit its selection process.</p>
        
            <p>Qualifying for the pole vaulting starts tonight and McCartney says she will have total respect for everyone in the field as she seeks to advance to the medal rounds.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight New Zealanders Luuka Jones and Finn Butcher both qualified emphatically for their quarterfinals of the Canoe Slalom Cross.</p>
        
            <p>They will look to make further progress in racing from 1.30am NZT on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>In sailing the mixed multihull team of Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson were the pick of the Kiwi sailors overnight. They finished the day in second place overall with scores of 2, 2 and 3. They trail Italy by 10 and lead by 6 from the rest of the strong fleet.</p>
