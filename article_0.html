        <h2>'Massive boom': Neighbours get out hoses as fire erupts from home</h2>
        <p>
"I helped pull the hoses out in my sandals," says a neighbour who saw black smoke spewing out of the garage next door.

            <p>The neighbour of a man who escaped a house fire in Christchurch this morning recalls hearing a "large boom" at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services, including five fire crews, responded to the blaze in a two-storey home in Bishopdale's Clotilda Place on Tuesday morning, finding the house in flames when firefighters arrived, about 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Simonne Hamman, who lives two sections down, said her kitchen window looks directly onto the man's property.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just cooking a late breakfast and then I heard this massive boom," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then I look out the window and this massive fire just erupts from his garage and billows of black smoke in to the air."</p>
        
            <p>"So I just yelled to my family: 'Fire!' Poor things thought the fire was in our house."</p>

            <p>Hamman then ran down the driveway and called emergency services, who had already been alerted.</p>
        
            <p>When the first fire crew arrived at the scene, they needed help to "get the hoses out".</p>
        
            <p>"I helped pull the hoses out in my sandals.</p>
        
            <p>"They needed help so they could connect it to the fire hydrant.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just the two of them who just happened to be driving past."</p>
        
            <p>The man who was "hard of hearing" managed to escape his home that was engulfed in flames, Hamman said.</p>
        
            <p>"He didn't hear the explosion and wasn't aware that the fire was going on until his neighbours alerted him.</p>
        
            <p>"They got him out okay and he had a friend with him and managed to get his dog out.</p>
        
            <p>"He's got a peacock, I haven't seen the peacock come out yet, but I'm sure the peacock is fine.</p>
        
            <p>Upset and shaken, the man tried to "hurry" firefighting efforts up.</p>
        
            <p>"They have their processes and have to do things methodically.</p>
        
            <p>"The police came to calm him down."</p>

            <p>Another three firefighting crews then converged on the cul-de-sac.</p>
        
            <p>The man did not require any medical attention.</p>
        
            <p>By early Tuesday afternoon, one Fire and Emergency crew and two fire investigators were at the scene.</p>
