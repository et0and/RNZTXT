        <h2>Watch live: All Blacks assistant coach Leon MacDonald suddenly quits</h2>
        <p>
"As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working," head coach Scott Robertson says.

            <p>All Blacks assistant coach Leon MacDonald has quit after a falling out over tactics with head coach Scott Robertson.</p>
        
            <p>In statement New Zealand Rugby said discussions between Robertson and MacDonald on their working approach had been taking place for several weeks, with the pair agreeing to mutually part ways.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon and I have been having some honest conversations with each other for a little while now. As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working. Leon and I both care deeply about the All Blacks and we believe we've made a decision that's best for this team," Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand Rugby statement announced the shock change, just five tests and less than two months into the start of the new coaching regime.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said it "wasn't working" between the two and that discussions between them had been taking place for several weeks, ending with pair mutually agreeing to part ways.</p>
        
            <p>The full stories continues below the blog: </p>
        
            <p>The departure of former fullback MacDonald comes on the eve of the team's departure for two Rugby Championship tests against the Springboks in South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>His absence will be absorbed into the existing coaching team for the remainer of the season, with assistant coach Scott Hansen and contact skills coach Tamati Ellison to take on additional responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said he and MacDonald had "differing views" which they couldn't overcome.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon and I have been having some honest conversations with each other for a little while now," he said.</p>

            <p>"As coaches we have differing views and both agreed it wasn't working. Leon and I both care deeply about the All Blacks and we believe we've made a decision that's best for this team.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a huge amount of respect and appreciation for Leon in the group and the work he's put in to get us to this point in our journey. As a team we have acknowledged that contribution and our focus now needs to be on South Africa, it's going to be two tough test matches over there."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Rugby head of professional rugby and performance Chris Lendrum said: "You've got two great coaches who have been having some robust but constructive discussions on the approach to drive the All Blacks over a period of time now. Ultimately, they have made a brave decision that they believe is best for the team," Lendrum said.</p>
        
            <p>"Leon is a highly regarded coach and has made a huge contribution to rugby across a number of teams in New Zealand, and we'd love to have him back in our system in the future. For now, I'd like to thank him on behalf of NZR and wish him all the very best."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson, 49, and MacDonald, 46, are former All Blacks team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>MacDonald was an assistant for the Crusaders in 2017 when Robertson first began his successful reign as head coach of the Super Rugby side, but left the team soon afterwards and become head coach of the Blues in 2019.</p>
