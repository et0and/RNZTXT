            <p>The Prime Minister is refusing to talk about the Treaty Principles Bill, saying ACT leader David Seymour will have more to say on the bill soon.</p>
        
            <p>Christopher Luxon was asked a series of questions at his weekly post-Cabinet conference about updates or further detail about the Treaty Principles Bill, given Cabinet considered it today.</p>
        
            <p>He said he would not be drawn on Cabinet discussions - but his coalition colleague Seymour will have more to say "shortly".</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a draft version of the government's controversial Treaty Principles Bill was considered by Cabinet on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The final version will be considered again by Cabinet before it is introduced to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon has been under pressure from MƒÅori to reject the Bill, and was encouraged by opposition parties at Koroneihana to throw the policy out entirely.</p>
        
            <p>More than 400 Christian leaders - including senior leaders of the Catholic, Anglican, and Methodist denominations in Aotearoa - also signed an open letter calling on MPs to vote down the bill.</p>
        
            <p>Read back on updates from today's post-Cabinet conference below:</p>
