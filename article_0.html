            <p>Tropical Cyclone Alfred has crossed the islands off the coast of Queensland as a Category 1 system, bringing with it destructive winds and heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>An emergency alert was issued for Moreton Island just before 6pm on Friday night, telling residents to take shelter immediately as the impact of the storm was being felt.</p>
        
            <p>The cyclone is continuing to track northwest and is expected to cross north of Brisbane later on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The islands, and exposed coastal areas along the northern Gold Coast saw destructive wind gusts of up to 125km/h.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services have already responded to over 300 calls in southeastern Queensland, and flooding in New South Wales has already resulted in 4252 incidents and a number of rescues.</p>
        
            <p>About 202,700 homes were without power across the state's southeast as of 1am Queensland time.</p>
        
            <p>Rescuers continue to search for one man who was washed into floodwaters in NSW on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services said they received a call about a four-wheel drive that had been washed off a bridge and into fast-running water while driving across Wild Cattle Creek, about 23 kilometres northeast of Dorrigo.</p>

            <p>The male driver was able to get out of the car and secure himself to a tree branch about 30 metres from the river bank, where officers from Coffs/Clarence police district were able to speak with him.</p>
        
            <p>However, shortly after 3pm, the man was swept from the tree and went underneath the water, and has not been seen since.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuation orders stretching over dozens of communities in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales have been issued.</p>
        
            <p>The BOM has warned up to 800mm of rain could fall throughout the system, although the threat of storm surges has begun to ease.</p>
        
            <p>Storm surges have already caused significant damage to parts of the coast, with the cyclone producing winds in excess of 100 kilometres an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Gold Coast locals said parts of their famous coastline had already been completely washed away.</p>
