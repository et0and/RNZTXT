            <p>Health New Zealand says it is on track to spend $2 billion on construction and other capital projects this financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Last financial year it had aimed to spend $1.8b by March 2024, but spent only half that, partly due to projects being stuck in planning or design stages.</p>
        
            <p>"More ... major capital projects are entering their construction phases this year," it told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"This is where more money is spent, compared with the initial phases of a project."</p>
        
            <p>That shift brought an increase in total expenditure and better cash flow certainty, head of infrastructure planning and investment Aaron Matthews said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge that any delays on major projects may affect actual spend."</p>
        
            <p>This has been the case on its current largest build, the New Dunedin Hospital project.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet ministers announced an overspend at Dunedin where plans are now being revised, which they said might upset the budgets on several major regional hospital builds in the wings - Whangārei, Nelson, Tauranga and Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>At Taranaki Hospital, its $403 million stage two build featuring a big new east wing building was given a negative red rating for risks in January, in a report that said "Stage 2 awaits further investigation and a change request to confirm cost pressures", after costs went up another $27m.</p>
        
            <p>In Nelson, Labour MPs have been hosting public meetings about the hospital rebuild's future.</p>
        
            <p>Detailed business planning was first brought forward on Nelson, but has now been pushed back to 2025.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time as forecasting the bigger capital spend, Health NZ Te Whatu Ora is trying to make $2b in operational savings, to claw back a huge deficit.</p>
        
            <p>Matthews said the agency had strengthened its systems for reporting, financial tracking, and cash flow projections for capital projects.</p>
        
            <p>However, it has been talking about how it has made big improvements for over a year.</p>
        
            <p>It said in a January internal report - just before a big deficit was revealed - that it had developed a full operational and capital plan.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Health Minister Shane Reti said he had "high expectations" the agency would do better now it could provide "coordinated national oversight".</p>
        
            <p>He told it that before asking the government for more money, it should first consider reducing the size of projects, postponing them or using "internal funds", in a letter of expectations for infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The country's first health infrastructure investment plan will feed into Budget 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said data and digital projects had to be in the mix.</p>
        
            <p>However, hundreds of millions of dollars have been cut from these projects recently.</p>
