            <p>Hīkoi mo te Tiriti participants have turned out in force on foot and horseback in central Rotorua today.</p>
        
            <p>At least a dozen people on horseback led kaihaka and the hīkoi convoy through Pukaki Street as it made its way to Te Puia car park.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the co-leader of Te Pāti Māori Rawiri Waititi responded to calls from NZ First deputy leader Shane Jones that members of Te Pāti Māori should be jailed for performing the haka in Parliament yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Waititi told hīkoi participants the haka is a natural debating tool in te ao Māori and his party will continue using those tools unapologetically in and outside parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"We use every tool available to us to use in the debates in that House and one of those Māori tools we take from our keke, which is haka, which is waiata ... those are natural debating tools on the marae."</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi will travel to Hastings this evening where convoys from the east coast are expected to meet them.</p>
