            <p>New Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will be taking questions from the media with Erica Stanford, the new Minister of Education.</p>
        
            <p>The pair will front at Manurewa Intermediate School in Auckland shortly after 11am.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a rough first week for the new coalition government, overshadowed by the behaviour of Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, condemnation of its ditching of smokefree efforts, a surprise tax windfall for landlords despite planned cost-cutting and accusations it has kowtowed to conspiracy theorists.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
