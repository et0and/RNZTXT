            <p>US president Joe Biden is speaking after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.</p>
        
            <p>Trump had just begun a campaign speech in Butler, Pennsylvania when shots rang out, hitting the former president's right ear and streaking his face with blood. Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who they say fired from the roof of a building 140m from the stage where Trump was speaking.</p>
        
            <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says he has been speaking to the families of two people who were shot and injured at a rally for former US president Donald Trump, and are still being treated.</p>
        
            <p>Shapiro paid tribute to volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, who he said was killed at the rally on Saturday (Sunday NZT time) after he "dived on his family" to protect them.</p>
        
            <p>Shapiro said he was releasing the information after speaking to Comperatore's wife.</p>
