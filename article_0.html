            <p>Incoming prime minister Christopher Luxon says it is "highly unlikely" he will attend APEC in San Francisco this week.</p>
        
            <p>But someone from the caretaker government would be attending the summit</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report progress was being made as coalition talks with ACT and New Zealand First entered the second week after confirmation of the final election result.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be nice to go, but the must-do is actually forming a strong and stable government, that is really my job.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be opportunities for me to build bilateral relationships and also to signal to the business community around the world that we're open for business again in New Zealand, but ... that's a 'nice to do', the 'must do' is actually forming a government."</p>
        
            <p>Labour leader Chris Hipkins and his government ministers have been re-sworn into their roles as caretakers and Luxon said it would be up to Hipkins who represented New Zealand at APEC.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a decision for the government and there'll be someone from the caretaker government representing."</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
