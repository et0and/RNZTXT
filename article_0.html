            <p>Graduates who have missed out on nursing jobs are now looking at heading overseas even though that's not what they want, a union member says.</p>
        
            <p>She is in a group representing nursing students who say health agency Te Whatu Ora has failed in its most basic duty to plan for the future nursing workforce.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Te Whatu Ora offered just 844 of 1619 graduate nurses jobs on Wednesday, which is only 50 percent of the cohort.</p>
        
            <p>Student nurse and NZ Nurses Organisation student unit co-chair Bianca Anderson told Morning Report it was hard to comprehend.</p>
        
            <p>"It's three years of hard work and hard clinical placements and then no job at the end of it so everyone's devastated and wondering what comes next."</p>
        
            <p>She said there was understaffing in some areas which student nurses had observed during their placements.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely a need for nurses and I've had patients say to me how essential we are and how much they value us.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's just due to the government's cost cutting."</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said those who had been unsuccessful in securing jobs were now looking at heading overseas, even though many did not want to.</p>
        
            <p>They chose nursing so they could serve their local communities, and it was especially tough for Māori and Pasifika nurses.</p>
        
            <p>"Going overseas is a big life change for some people, especially for students who have families. It's not looking great 'cos otherwise you can't get a job as a nurse so you're stuck."</p>
        
            <p>Nurses studied fulltime and had to squeeze in part-time jobs to support themselves, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>For students like her contemplating finding jobs in a year's time there was now a lot of uncertainty and she had heard of some who were considering dropping out.</p>
        
            <p>Her message to Te Whatu Ora was to consider both the graduates and the patients.</p>
        
            <p>"Working hard to try and provide for our communities - at the end of it if we don't get a job it's utterly devastating and puts people off going into nursing which is a highly essential part of the healthcare system."</p>
        
            <p>National chief nurse for Health NZ Nadine Gray said "homegrown nurses" were a vital part of the health system.</p>
        
            <p>Other health providers would have the opportunity from today to offer jobs to the remaining 770 "left in the talent pool", she told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Incentives of up to $20,000 were being offered to primary, community and aged care to hire more graduate nurses.</p>
        
            <p>Gray said for many nurses their preference was to work in a hospital rather than in aged care but Health NZ wanted them to consider working in all parts of the health system.</p>
        
            <p>Those not offered jobs yesterday would not necessarily head to Australia, because in its cities there were no longer many vacancies due to a flood of nurses arriving from all over the world in recent times, Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked if there had been a failure in planning, she replied it had been "an extraordinary year" with thousands of foreign nurses arriving in Aotearoa in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration settings had been changed to allow this, however, there was also constant turnover in the health system and she was confident the graduate nurses would find work.</p>
        
            <p>"We're supporting nurses, we're committed to that over the coming months to get them into jobs, not just in hospitals and specialist services but right across the health system."</p>
        
            <p>Around 3000 nurses were hired last year meaning Health NZ now employed 35,000.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got the lowest turnover we've had in a very long time."</p>
