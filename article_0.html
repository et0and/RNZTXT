            <p>A "huge" police presence is in the small Bay of Plenty community of Matapihi as Mongrel Mob gang members gather for the tangi of one of their own.</p>
        
            <p>According to local reporter for Aukaha News, Ripeka Timutimu, the community has responded to the influx of police with mixed views - but the majority are angry, and say there was not enough consultation about how big the operation was going to be.</p>
        
            <p>The tangi comes just a week after a new law was introduced, banning gang members from wearing patches and gang insignia in public.</p>
        
            <p>Those breaking the law will be arrested, have their patches seized, and face prosecution. Being a member of a gang can now also be an aggravating factor in sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>In the first 24 hours of the ban a gang chapter president's patch was seized and on Sunday night a shirt was seized from a man who took a person to hospital after crash.</p>

            <p>Detective Inspector Craig Rawlinson said it was important to provide family and friends the space to pay their respects but it would not stop police enforcing the law.</p>
        
            <p>"No unlawful activity will be accepted, including breaches of the new Gangs Act, which came into effect last week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will maintain an increased presence, monitoring movements of gang members and associates, and will be ready to respond if required."</p>
        
            <p>A number of arrests had already been made, including three gang members wearing patches on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said extra police staff and resources had been called in to the area to monitor gang members and associates travelling for the funeral of the prominent Mongrel Mob figure.</p>

            <p>The Eagle helicopter was also circling above the area.</p>
        
            <p>Timutimu told Midday Report about 70 police officers were seen in Matapihi on Thursday morning, including vans and regular police cars.</p>
        
            <p>A local marae where those attending the tangi went was on a one-way road and police had set up a checkpoint about three kilometres from it.</p>
        
            <p>All vehicles going to the marae had to pass the checkpoint in order to get there, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Timutimu said she witnessed vehicles being pink and green stickered.</p>

            <p>She saw one man with a Mongrel Mob back tattoo get arrested but she could not see anyone wearing gang insignia, apart from when she was on the privately-owned marae.</p>
        
            <p>But from the community, Timutimu said there had been an "outpouring of anger".</p>
        
            <p>The first checkpoint police had set up was outside a cemetery, causing a local kuia to yell at police and tell them to move.</p>
        
            <p>"How disrespectful is that?" she said.</p>
        
            <p>Police agreed with the woman, Timutimu said, and moved the checkpoint about 300 metres down the road.</p>

            <p>Timutimu said the Mongrel Mob gang did not have a pad in the area and it was not common to see them in the area.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the three arrests, a 32-year-old patched member of East Side was arrested on shoplifting charges.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, a 30-year-old driver was arrested and had his vehicle seized for alleged dangerous driving.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had been running checkpoints across Bay of Plenty and watched as a convoy drove the dead gang member through Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>"Three motorbikes were seized after allegedly being used to disrupt traffic and block roads across Tauranga."</p>
        
            <p>The three men arrested for wearing gang insignia were due in Tauranga District Court on 2 December.</p>
