            <p>A jury has ruled in favour of former All Whites goalkeeper Jake Gleeson, awarding him NZ$35.7m in damages after he brought a medical malpractice lawsuit against his ex-team doctor, ESPN reports.</p>
        
            <p>Gleeson's football career came to a halt in 2018 after a back surgery to treat stress fractures in both of his legs went wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Both of the footballer's legs became infected, and it was alleged that the plates inserted into his legs hadn't been properly sterilised.</p>
        
            <p>Gleeson - who played for the All Whites from 2011 to 2014 - had since undergone 14 surgeries that eventually ended his career.</p>
        
            <p>ESPN reported that he was now unable to walk without pain.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, he had been playing in the United States' Major League Soccer league for the Portland Timbers.</p>

            <p>He was under the supervision of their doctor Richard H. Edelson, whom he sued for medial malpractice nearly five years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The verdict came in after the recent three-week long trial.</p>
        
            <p>ESPN also reported Gleeson had settled claims with another doctor, Dr Jonathan Greenleaf, as well as the facility where the surgery was performed, Oregon Outpatient Surgery Centre.</p>
        
            <p>The Timbers were never named in the suit.</p>
        
            <p>Edelson's defence argued that the sterilisation technique used - Immediate-Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS) - was sufficient, and that infection was a common risk of surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The defence maintained the doctor was not at fault for the complications, but have not said whether they were planning to appeal the decision.</p>
        
            <p>Gleeson said to ESPN over a Zoom call, after the verdict, that the last few years had been "very hard".</p>
        
            <p>"This has been something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, not that I have too many of those.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a lot of physical pain. It's been a lot of emotional pain, and those have come in different stages. I would say that this has been something that's quite consumed my life for the last six and a half years since that initial surgery.</p>
        
            <p>"I left the training field one day, not knowing that that would be the last time I would ever be a professional soccer player."</p>
        
            <p>Gleeson said he now wanted to advocate for doctor guidelines and policies.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't matter if you're an MLS player, it doesn't matter if you're an NFL player, it doesn't matter if you work a desk job. When you sign that consent form, you're signing that they're going to do everything in their power to keep you safe. This doctor did not do that."</p>
        
            <p>John Pollino, Edelson's attorney, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by ESPN.</p>
