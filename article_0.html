            <p>The grandmother of a man allegedly assaulted in an IDEA Services-run mental health facility, where the district court had ordered him to stay, has issued a call for accountability.</p>
        
            <p>Anne Hunt says her grandson Daniel, who was sent to the unit in Kenepuru, Porirua, when he was found unfit to stand trial on criminal charges, is the victim of bullying, which is affecting his well-being.</p>
        
            <p>Police have laid charges after one incident last month left Daniel - RNZ has agreed not to use his surname - requiring hospital treatment for a bruised and bloodied face.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking from her Foxton home, Anne Hunt said she was worried about Daniel's safety.</p>
        
            <p>"He has been bullied there, first by one of the other clients, but then on 25 November he was attacked by a certain person and he sent me photos of the black eye he got," Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>Weeks later, there was another incident.</p>
        
            <p>"On 10 January he sent me another photo with no explanation. The next morning I discovered that he had been taken to hospital for observation overnight and the police have charged a person for attacking him."</p>
        
            <p>
Daniel - RNZ is not using his surname - suffered these injuries in the 10 January incident.

            <p>Hunt said though she was not concerned with what happened to the fellow resident prosecuted over the attack on Daniel.</p>
        
            <p>Rather, she wanted accountability from IDEA Services for what happened, and wanted a guarantee her grandson, and others, were safe.</p>
        
            <p>IDEA Services is part of the IHC group and is government funded.</p>
        
            <p>"When I visited him two days later, they were huge black eyes. His eyes were bloodshot. His face was puffy. He also had injuries to his back," Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>"He had to stay in that same facility, trapped in that same facility. Basically, they isolated him to make sure he wasn't attacked again."</p>
        
            <p>Keeping Daniel away from social contact would have a detrimental effect on him, Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>Daniel has autism and an intellectual disability, and was last year ordered to the facility by the district court after being found unfit to plead to weapons charges.</p>
        
            <p>He is allowed out when accompanied by his family or when accompanied by a staff member, when his case manager approves, but otherwise must stay there until it is ruled he is well enough to leave.</p>
        
            <p>Human rights lawyer Tony Ellis said there were ways Hunt could complain about Daniel's treatment - she had already contacted the health and disability commissioner.</p>
        
            <p>Such facilities were monitored to ensure New Zealand was meeting its anti-torture obligations.</p>
        
            <p>"Every form of detention has got somebody who can go and inspect the facility and make sure it's behaving properly, and not torturing or ill-treating people," Ellis said.</p>
        
            <p>The chief ombudsman visited the Kenepuru facility four times between 2015 and 2023. Police have confirmed they were called there on 10 January and that a man is facing charges.</p>
        
            <p>IDEA Services chief operating officer Joan Cowan said it could not comment on specific people or incidents due to privacy obligations, but it was confident it provided good support to people in its care, and staff, and incidents were thoroughly investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"Occasionally incidents occur, and our priority is ensuring safety, which sometimes means separating individuals from each other for a period of time - perhaps in another part of the property, with company and support.</p>
        
            <p>"There are many other things we do to provide support."</p>
        
            <p>Megan Elizabeth, the engagement and insight manager at advocacy group Changing Minds, said she hoped a parliamentary bill at select committee stage, about compulsory care, would result in transformation for people at their most vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>"Events like these are examples of how the current system is failing. The current system has been in place now for 30-odd years. It is absolutely time for us to change and think how we can be looking after people better.</p>
        
            <p>"Regardless of the reason someone is in an inpatient setting, they do have that right."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Hunt can do nothing but wait for news about Daniel.</p>
        
            <p>An author who wrote about the closure of the nearby Kimberley Centre more than two decades ago, she wondered if present-day units were the best places for people such as her grandson, and said she was staggered the assaults weren't mentioned at a recent review of his progress.</p>
        
            <p>"He could have post-traumatic stress syndrome, which is not unusual for situations like that, yet he is trapped in the same facility where he has been bullied and he has been assaulted."</p>
        
            <p>The man accused of assaulting Daniel appears in court next week and faces a hearing assessing if he's fit to plead.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
