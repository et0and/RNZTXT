            <p>Much of the country is in for another scorcher on Wednesday, with MetService issuing heat alerts for the lower North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The alerts affect Wellington City, Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt, with the latter expected to be the warmest location, with a maximum temperature of 29 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>MetService issues such alerts when temperatures are set to reach levels that are unusually hot for that location.</p>
        
            <p>According to MetService meteorologist John Law, much of the country will experience an "incredibly warm" and muggy feel overnight into Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A high pressure will bring dry weather, although some showers can be expected in inland areas of the North Island, such as Taupō and Taumaranui.</p>
        
            <p>Law said some showers may be heavy - although it was the "exception, not the rule".</p>

            <p>Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Taranaki and Wellington had "plenty of dry weather and sunshine" in store.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton was expected to reach a high of 28 degrees, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, places such as Otago and Banks Peninsula could see cloud and some rain developing through the afternoon, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The temperature in Auckland is not forecast to drop below 17°C for the next ten days. While the daytime highs are only a few degrees above average for the time of year it's a steady run of warm days and muggy nights. pic.twitter.com/kSxQMiTMFn</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Auckland should prepare for a stream of sunny days.</p>
        
            <p>According to Metservice's forecast, the temperature in the city will not drop below 17 degrees for the next 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>While the daytime highs are only a few degrees above average for the time of year, Aucklanders can expect a steady run of warm days and muggy nights.</p>
