            <p>Wind gusts have reached more than 140km/h in exposed parts of Canterbury and some flights in and out of Wellington have been affected as a cold snap brings heavy rain and gales to many parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport spokesperson Phil Rennie said a number of flights had also been cancelled at Wellington Airport due to bad weather at other destination airports.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has placed much of the upper South Island and lower North Island under heavy rain, strong wind or thunderstorm warnings.</p>
        
            <p>Follow the RNZ liveblog:</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told RNZ the strongest gusts so far had been recorded at Aoraki Mount Cook, while the heaviest rainfall had been seen in Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty to even 40mm of rain in one hour - and that is mostly at the top of the South Island, especially in more mountainous areas. So quite a lot of rain to fall in such a short space of time."</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said conditions were now easing in the South Island, but they were set to intensify through the central North Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService earlier said a trough would bring unsettled weather to western parts of both islands, followed by heavy showers and thunderstorms across southern and central New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>☔️⏳That band of heavier rain is at the top of the South Island and reaches the lower North Island in the next few hours⚡️It could even bring a rumble of thunder and heavier bursts of rain as it passes throughKeep an eye on the Rain Radar at https://t.co/prKU7NLNY1 pic.twitter.com/8b33LXH4zd</p>
        
            <p>Orange heavy rain warnings remain in place for the Tararua Range and for Mount Taranaki, and a severe thunderstorm watch is in force for Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō, Hawke's Bay, Taranaki, Taihape, Wanganui, Manawatū, Tararua, Kapiti-Horowhenua, Wairarapa, Wellington and Marlborough until 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a road snowfall warning for the Crown Range Road overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Many other parts of the country are also subject to strong wind and weather watches until tonight.</p>
        
            <p>For the most up to date changes, please check the MetService warnings page.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, gravel and silt which was washed onto Ballarat Street in Queenstown this morning, causing part of the street to be temporarily closed, had now been cleared.</p>

            <p>A post on X by Waka Kotahi earlier showed water flooding across the street in the centre of the town.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Lakes District Council told RNZ the debris was from an existing road works site on the street and the small affected section of the street had now re-opened.</p>
        
            <p>A review was due to be completed shortly to see what measures could be taken to prevent it from happening again, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>The debris had not affected travel on State Highway 6A - Stanley Street - nor the road works where the debris originated from, it said.</p>
        
            <p>
The debris which caused access to the carparks off Ballarat Street in central Queenstown to be cut off on the morning of 4 March, 2024, has been cleared and access has been restored.
