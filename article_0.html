            <p>Football Ferns head coach Jitka Klimkov치 will miss the upcoming June international friendlies due to what NZ Football has described as an 'employment matter'.</p>
        
            <p>The Ferns are scheduled to play against Japan in Spain next month. On Sunday NZ Football released a statement saying Klimkov치 "has opted to take a leave of absence from the role for this tour while an investigation is concluded into an employment related matter".</p>
        
            <p>Assistant coach Michael Mayne will act as head coach for the two games on Saturday 1 June NZT and 4 June at Estadio Nueva Condomina in Murcia, Spain. They are drawn to face reigning champions Canada, Colombia and hosts France at this year's Olympics in Paris.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Football stated it would not be making any further comment on the matter until the investigation was concluded.</p>
        
            <p>Klimkov치 has been in charge of the Football Ferns since 2021, overseeing 39 matches for 11 wins, seven draws and 21 defeats.</p>
        
            <p>The side won their opening FIFA Women's World Cup match last year in front of a sold out Eden Park, but failed to progress to the knock out stage after a loss to The Philippines and a draw with Switzerland.</p>
