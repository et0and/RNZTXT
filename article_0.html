            <p>Live - Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins is speaking at the party's annual conference in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>He is scheduled to speak from 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>In his opening comments to this weekend's conference which is taking place a year after Labour's election defeat, Hipkins called on his party to change, in order to win the next election.</p>
        
            <p>Hipkins said he understood "Kiwis did vote for change last year" and that the party now needed "to change as well".</p>
        
            <p>In order to win the party needed to reconnect with a broader range of New Zealanders by talking about the issues that mattered to them and the issues that Labour believed should matter to them, he said.</p>
