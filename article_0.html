            <p>Ex-Green MP Darleen Tana has failed in her High Court bid challenging the Green Party's investigation into her actions.</p>
        
            <p>Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick says the party welcomes the ruling and will now consider its next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"As we have just received today's judgment, we will take the appropriate time to take advice and consider next steps. We will have more to say in due course."</p>
        
            <p>Tana resigned from the Green Party in March after an inquiry into migrant exploitation, but wants to remain in Parliament as an independent MP.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation found that Tana "likely" knew about allegations of worker exploitation at her husband's business and did not disclose them to the party.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
