            <p>Winston Peters - in the role of Acting Prime Minister - has responded with insults and accusations after opposition MPs attempted to use his previous statements against him.</p>
        
            <p>With Christopher Luxon in Australia to attend his daughter's graduation Peters was asked by Green co-leader Marama Davidson a common question in the House, of whether he - speaking for Luxon - stood by his government's statements and policies.</p>
        
            <p>He came out firing.</p>
        
            <p>"With regard to evidence and information at the time of those statements, yes. But of course when new information or evidence emerges we acknowledge that don't just carry on like a bigoted, lefty shill," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson questioned whether he agreed with Peters' own quote from 2018 defending the ban on exploration for oil and gas that it "makes sense, and introducing the ban was a change that New Zealanders wanted".</p>
        
            <p>Peters said the new government "has its settings on the future".</p>
        
            <p>"Examine the time and the place when that statement was made. There was a ban on at the time - does that member not forge- (sic) not remember that?"</p>
        
            <p>Davidson questioned whether the government's position to reverse the ban was not a contradiction to the Climate Change Minister's call at the COP28 global climate conference to phase out fossil fuels. Peters said that's what the people at the conference were "wrestling with right now".</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
