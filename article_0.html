            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is speaking from Christchurch on the five-year anniversary of the terror attacks against the city's mosques.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury's Muslim community were expected to commemorate the events, with the date this year falling on a Friday - the day of the mandatory Jumu'ah prayer targeted by the gunman.</p>
        
            <p>The attacks in 2019 left 51 worshippers at Masjid Annur and the Linwood Islamic Centre dead or motally wounded.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon met with Muslim leaders on Tuesday, after they sought assurances any changes to gun laws would not put their safety at risk.</p>
