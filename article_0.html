            <p>The late Green Party MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins has been remembered as "larger than life" at a service in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The 49-year-old husband and father-of-two died on 21 February after collapsing during a charity even in Auckland's central city.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā's unexpected death came as a shock to many, with his aiga - including wife Fia and daughters Kaperiela and Asalemo - saying he was "the anchor of our tight-knit family".</p>
        
            <p>Politicians and members of the public including school students are among those attending Fa'anānā's funeral at Due Drop Event Centre in Manukau from 1pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the guests are dressed in traditional Pacific clothing, and a gospel choir sang as the crowd filled the room.</p>

            <p>To start the service, poet Karlo Mila read a poem that finished: "You become the ancestor we always knew you were."</p>
        
            <p>Family spokesman Taito Eddie Tuiavii then gave a formal greeting in Samoan, paying tribute to Fa'anānā and his villages.</p>
        
            <p>He described Fa'anānā as "larger than life".</p>
        
            <p>It was an "indescribable feeling" to mourn the loss of "our champion", Tuiavii said.</p>
        
            <p>"His death spanned social, political, cultural, religious, ethnic and geographical boundaries."</p>

            <p>Reverend Unasa Uesifili Unasa said a prayer, asking God: "Give us clarity of mind and singleness of heart."</p>
        
            <p>The crowd was then asked to stand to sing a praise song, accompanied by guitars.</p>
        
            <p>Those without good singing voices were told: "Be like Efeso, pick whatever key you want and go for gold."</p>
        
            <p>Among the people at the funeral are Green Party co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Labour leader Chris Hipkins, and National's Gerry Brownlee, Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown, Te Pāti Māori co-leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi.</p>
