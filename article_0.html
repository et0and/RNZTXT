        <h2>Bluff-grown red seaweed cuts methane emissions from cattle</h2>
        <p>
Red seaweed reduces methane emissions in beef and dairy cattle with no adverse effects, scientists say.

            <p>Whole Asparagopsis seaweed contains bromoform, an active ingredient which can act as an inhibitor for methane production.</p>
        
            <p>"It can reduce the methane that cattle produce by up to 90 percent," production scientist at CH4 Global's seaweed growing facility at the Ocean Beach Aquaculture Hub, Brent Jackson, said.</p>
        
            <p>The seaweed grew in dozens of huge aerated vessels at the site, the former home to the Bluff Freezing Works.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially we started growing it offshore but with land-based farming, it's controlled conditions, easy to scale, consistent and reliable."</p>

            <p>Once harvested, the seaweed was frozen, freeze-dried and shipped to another CH4 facility in South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll do some more formulation where they'll add molasses, which gives it a little bit of flavour and it helps retain the bromoform. They'll also blend and dilute it to get the bromoform concentration they want."</p>
        
            <p>Jackson said cattle only required about 50 grams a day of the supplement.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was also easy to use to, farmers just mixed the purple powder-like product in with the feed.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment it's targeted at feed lot cattle. The feeding regime of dairy cows is slightly different. So it'll be maybe one or two doses a day when they come in to milk."</p>

            <p>"Inside the gut you have bacteria which convert fatty acids, or the by-products from the fatty acids into methane and this (supplement) inhibits that process, so that there's no methane produced," Jackson explained.</p>
        
            <p>He said the methane inhibition process also reduced the amount of energy spent by the cow.</p>
        
            <p>"Which is great for farmers, it means their cattle's feed efficiency goes up, they don't have to feed the cattle as much and they get less methane."</p>

            <p>CH4 Global was already selling its Methane Tamer product to cattle farmers in Australia, but Jackson said in New Zealand there was a road block.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, we're restricted by legislation because Asparagopsis, or the bromoform in Asparagopsis, is classed as a veterinary medicine."</p>
        
            <p>The seaweed would need to get re-classified as a supplement for cattle feed and until that happened, farmers wouldn't be able to access the natural methane-reducing product in New Zealand.</p>

            <p>The Nevada-based company - founded in 2018 - was banking on this changing in the near future.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have a lot of people in government who are really interested in getting this moving and getting it into the market here," Jackson said.</p>
        
            <p>For the production scientist, it was more than just growing seaweed commercially in Bluff.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was easier to forget how impactful the work could be.</p>
        
            <p>"'When you think about the climate and how much methane is produced by cattle, even if you just give this to a fraction of the 1.5 billion cattle in the world, it's going to have a huge impact."</p>
