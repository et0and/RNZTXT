            <p>Michael Hill Jeweller says it has confidence in its security measures, despite two more of its stores suffering smash-and-grab raids this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>In the latest in a string of robberies at the chain store's branches over the past two years, robbers struck its Bayfair shop in Mt Maunganui yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>And police today arrested a young person after an armed robbery at the Michael Hill store in Silverdale Mall on the Hibiscus Coast around 11.20am.</p>
        
            <p>"The offender was armed with a hammer, and left the store after the fog cannon was activated," police said in a statement on the Silverdale incident.</p>
        
            <p>He left the scene, and headed to the Northern Motorway before being stopped north of the Lonely Track Road Overbridge.</p>
        
            <p>"A youth has been taken into custody and charges are being considered," police said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Michael Hill Jeweller said today's attack in Silverdale was an attempted smash-and-grab, but the offender was unable to penetrate the armoured glass displays. Fog cannons were also activated.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Hill chief executive Daniel Bracken said in a statement "security and safeguarding measures remain integral" for the chain.</p>
        
            <p>"We have continued to review our security measures to ensure we are doing everything we can to protect our team and customers."</p>
        
            <p>With "continued offending in New Zealand", the company been rolling out a raft of new security measures, including smash-proof glass, extra fog cannons, alarm screamers and personal alarms for staff.</p>
        
            <p>DNA spray technology was also being used to protect staff and customers.</p>
        
            <p>Bracken said it was "incredibly disturbing" to see the robberies continue and they would prioritise the installation of assault glass across all stores.</p>
        
            <p>Other robberies of Michael Hill stores in the past two years include:</p>
