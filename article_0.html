            <p>Trees are down and there are widespread power outages after a tornado in Northland's Mangawhai.</p>
        
            <p>Videos posted to social media showed several trees down across roads, with emergency services working to clear them.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower's outage map showed three "widespread" outages covering Mangawhai, Mangawhai Heads and Langs Beach.</p>
        
            <p>The power went out just before 3am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a widespread outage affecting all of our network due to a TORNADO damaging property and power lines in the wider Mangawhai Area," Northpower's website said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently assessing the situation and will update the information when we can.</p>
        
            <p>"Please treat all lines and equipment as LIVE at all times."</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known how extensive the damage is, but one local reported that there were multiple houses on one street that had lost their rooves.</p>
