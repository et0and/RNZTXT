            <p>The Public Service Commission will conduct an independent inquiry after allegations Te Pāti Māori misused data during the 2023 election campaign.</p>
        
            <p>A group of former workers at Manurewa Marae said private data from census forms was photocopied and entered into a database they believe was then used to target voters in the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori MP Takutai Tarsh Kemp was the marae's chief executive before stepping down after she narrowly won the Tāmaki Makaurau seat.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has asked the Commission to investigate the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>"The review will be established by the powers provided by the Public Service Act 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be further announcements this week on the terms of reference, the timing for the inquiry, as well as the independent reviewer who will lead the process."</p>
        
            <p>The police, Stats NZ and the Privacy Commissioner were also looking into the allegations.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come...</p>
