            <p>Convicted killer Lauren Dickason is being sentenced nearly a year after she was found guilty of murdering her three children.</p>
        
            <p>A jury found Dickason guilty in August of the murders of her three young daughters at their Timaru home on 16 September 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Six-year-old Lian√® and 2-year-old twins Karla and Maya were found dead after their mother smothered them, one by one, in their beds.</p>
        
            <p>Dickason had pleaded not guilty on all three counts, her defence lawyers arguing cases of insanity and infanticide.</p>
        
            <p>The killings occurred less than three weeks after the family had arrived in New Zealand from South Africa.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old has been remanded at Christchurch's Hillmorton Hospital for several months, where she has undergone psychiatric testing as instructed by the court.</p>
        
            <p>Sentencing was originally scheduled for December, but had been pushed back multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>The delays centered around questions about where she would ultimately serve her sentence, under the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act.</p>
        
            <p>Psychiatrists' reports had been prepared to advise on whether Dickason should be detained as a "special patient" at a mental health facility, or serve a custodial sentence in prison.</p>
