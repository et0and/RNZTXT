        <h2>Live: State of emergency as homes flood, roads shut across Dunedin</h2>
        <p>
Evacuated residents have spent the night at shelters as the region braces for a further 70-100mm of rain.
</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency has been declared in Dunedin and a rain warning for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha is not due to end until 9pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 people were evacuated from homes overnight and evacuation shelters have been opened.</p>
        
            <p>At least 18 roads were closed across the city due to flooding and slips, with further closures announced in Clutha District.</p>
        
            <p>Another 70 to 100 millimetres is forecast to fall, meaning the region will have received more than two months' worth of rain over three days.</p>
