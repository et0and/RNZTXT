            <p>Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly has resigned his ministerial positions after what he says was an "animated discussion" that ended with him putting a hand on a staffer.</p>
        
            <p>Bayly says he took the discussion "too far", and described his behaviour as "overbearing" and "inappropriate".</p>
        
            <p>"I am deeply sorry," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios. Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."</p>
        
            <p>It follows a seperate incident in October, where Bayly apologised after repeatedly calling a worker a loser during a site visit for his former small business portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>"Concerns have been raised with me about a recent incident in which my behaviour towards a staff member was overbearing and for that, I am deeply sorry.</p>
        
            <p>"As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios. Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate.</p>
        
            <p>"I have apologised to the staff member and regret placing them in an uncomfortable position.</p>
        
            <p>"There are times when you have to hold yourself to account and today is one of those days. I have made the personal choice to resign as a Minister and have offered my resignation to the Prime Minister, which he has accepted.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to extend my gratitude to all the officials and staff who have worked diligently alongside me to progress a wide suite of changes across all my ministerial portfolios.</p>
        
            <p>"I am incredibly proud of the work we have achieved together, and I look forward to continuing to serve the people of Port Waikato and being involved in the work of Parliament."</p>
