The area was once a pā of Te Āti Awa but the traditional name was misspelt during colonial settlement.

One origin of the name is that a certain area on the beach was known for burying the 'pito' or umbilical cords in the 'one' or the sandy part of the beach. (Pictured is Petone Beach)

            <p>The New Zealand Geographic Board is today considering a name change for the Lower Hutt suburb Petone to Pito One.</p>
        
            <p>The area was once a pā of local iwi Te Āti Awa but the traditional name was misspelt during colonial settlement.</p>
        
            <p>One origin of the name is that a certain area on the beach was known for burying the 'pito' or umbilical cords in the 'one' or the sandy part of the beach. Hence the name 'Pito-One'.</p>
        
            <p>Another is that it translates to the 'pito' or end point of the 'one', the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Hutt City Council voted to support a change back to the traditional name and sent an application to the New Zealand Geographic Board.</p>
        
            <p>The board, Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa, is New Zealand's place naming authority.</p>
        
            <p>Board secretary Wendy Shaw said the board would consider the proposal and decide whether it would go out for public consultation.</p>
        
            <p>The board would announce any proposal, including any decision to move to public consultation, in a month's time to allow time to notify key stakeholders, she said.</p>
