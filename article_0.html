            <p>Trees are down and there are widespread power outages after a tornado in Northland's Mangawhai.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John transported two patients from Mangawhai in a serious condition. One was transported to Auckland Hospital by helicopter, while the other was transported to North Shore hospital by road.</p>
        
            <p>Four ambulances were also dispatched.</p>
        
            <p>Videos posted to social media showed several trees down across roads, with emergency services working to clear them.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower's outage map showed three "widespread" outages covering Mangawhai, Mangawhai Heads and Langs Beach.</p>

            <p>It had sent "several" brigades into the area, where they found "roofs lifted from homes, fallen trees and downed powerlines".</p>

            <p>"We are now working through all the calls for help with property damage and making systematic checks of homes in the wider area."</p>
        
            <p>A specialist drone team had also been called in.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known how extensive the damage is, but one local reported that there were multiple houses on one street that had lost their roofs.</p>
        
            <p>"People in the area should make safety their first priority and wait until daylight to assess damage to their property," said response coordinator Graeme Quensell.</p>
        
            <p>"They should treat all power lines as live, and please avoid driving in the area so as not to hold up emergency services."</p>
