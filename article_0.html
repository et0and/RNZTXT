            <p>Negotiations to form a government have concluded, a statement from the leaders of all three parties says.</p>
        
            <p>The actual announcement of the details, and the signing, will be on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The statement - attributed to National's Christopher Luxon, ACT's David Seymour and NZ First's Winston Peters - was short.</p>
        
            <p>"Negotiations to form a government that will deliver for all New Zealanders have concluded," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The parties are now going through their respective party processes for final sign-off and we expect that process to be completed this evening.</p>
        
            <p>"Subject to agreement by all parties, a signing ceremony will take place tomorrow at Parliament."</p>

            <p>Speaking to media from the tiles at Parliament on Thursday afternoon, Luxon said: "I'm very pleased to announce that we're in a position where we've concluded our negotiations with the respective parties, those agreements are now before the parties for ratification which we hope to have this evening, at which point I'll talk again to the governor-general and formally confirm that we're able to form a government".</p>
        
            <p>"Then tomorrow morning we'll have a formal signing ceremony, also a formal announcement, and we hope to then push on in the afternoon and be able to announce our Cabinet and also ministerial responsibilities with a view that we would move over the weekend and have a swearing in on Monday so that we can get the show moving and also get this country moving forward."</p>
        
            <p>He says the deputy prime minister will be revealed tomorrow once the deal has been ratified.</p>
        
            <p>Peters this afternoon rubbished the idea of co-deputies, a prospect which both Luxon and Seymour earlier declined to rule out.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never had a co-deputy prime minister ever," Peters told reporters this afternoon. "Why would we [be] starting?"</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said when the agreements were seen tomorrow "you'll understand how comprehensive they are, we've covered a tremendous amount of material in terms of policy and ways of working."</p>
        
            <p>"You'll be able to see exactly what we've delivered, and I think you'll see it's incredibly comprehensive but importantly also it gives us a really defined work programme for the next three years, so there's a lot of specificity there, that's very deliberate so that we all are aligned in what we're shooting for and what we're trying to achieve."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was "massive alignment" from the three parties around their goals.</p>
        
            <p>There were a few final issues to close out this morning, he said, but he would not get into that detail.</p>
        
            <p>The final impasse was broken "earlier this morning", and it was hoped the full cabinet will be made public tomorrow afternoon, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just making sure that actually I had committed to the caucus that I wanted them to understand the nature of what we had signed up for in they agreements, I had been empowered to do that. I had kept them in the loop at a very high level.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say over the process it's been a really good process, because inevitably you can talk transactionally about the tasks and the policies and the ideas but you actually get a sense of where each individual's coming from and what's motivating them and what's important to them.</p>
        
            <p>"So we've actually got to know each other very well as the three leaders which I think is a very important part of the process."</p>
        
            <p>He said the three-way coalition was "historic", and getting it right was the reason they had spent so much time.</p>
        
            <p>"Establish relationship first, agree a policy programme, agree process mechanisms for any disputes or disagreements that may arise, and then make sure we can get the right people in the right place."</p>

            <p>The leaders of all three parties are now all in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>National's Christopher Luxon and ACT's David Seymour flew into the capital last night.</p>
        
            <p>Peters arrived in Wellington earlier this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking outside Treasury on the Terrace, he was asked whether a deal has been reached.</p>
        
            <p>"Well if that was the case, I would have told you", was his reply.</p>
        
            <p>Before any deal between the three parties can be finalised, it first has to go to their respective boards and caucuses for sign off.</p>
        
            <p>Peters did however, confirm that his party is no longer negotiating.</p>
        
            <p>"No - well think about it, you're not going to nail me down, this is not my first rodeo, right", he told reporters.</p>

            <p>Also speaking this afternoon, Seymour said he was "feeling very good about the future of the government".</p>
        
            <p>"We've come through a long, and I know many people would say too long a process, but it's come together to create a very good deal and with some 'i's' and 't's' I think we'll be in a position to form that government.</p>
        
            <p>"But obviously I'm not in a position to say the exact details of that or what any outstanding tasks or issues might be."</p>
