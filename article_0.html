        <h2>Hundreds of people are applying for roles, how do you stand out?</h2>
        <p>
Job application numbers are at record levels, and recruiters say they are sometimes dealing with hundreds of applicants. So what can you do to stand out? RNZ asked the experts.

It was important to tailor your CV for the role, personalise your cover letter and proof read them, Lee Marshall said.

            <p>Job application numbers are at record levels, and recruiters say they are dealing with hundreds of applicants for some roles.</p>
        
            <p>So what can you do to stand out in a crowded employment market? RNZ asked the experts.</p>
        
            <p>Shannon Barlow, managing director of Frog Recruitment, said people needed to be selective in what they applied for. "Recruitment agencies and a lot of businesses use applicant tracking systems so can see your application history. If you're applying for anything and everything they might overlook your application, even if you have relevant experience for the job. A bit like the boy who cried wolf, but rather the candidate who cried good fit."</p>
        
            <p>Lee Marshall, managing partner at Hunter Campbell, agreed. He said people should only apply for roles they were suitable for. "We see people apply for roles they are not qualified and not suitable for and it really damages their personal brand. We can look on our system and see people who have applied for 30, 40, 50 roles in the last couple of months. I think that will count against somebody."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said people should contact former managers and colleagues who had gone to work elsewhere, to see if they could connect them to new opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"Organisations will run external recruitment strategies but they will also have an internal referral system … that will carry a lot of weight."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would also be a good idea to ensure that your online presence was updated and professional, including your LinkedIn profile and any profiles on recruitment sites, such as LinkedIn.</p>
        
            <p>Barlow said people should include achievements in their CV that showed their strengths. "Make it easy to see the value you could bring."</p>
        
            <p>She said that could include highlighting involvement in projects and activities outside your job description. "Chances are the organisation is trying to do more with less people, so highlight your special skills and contributions to show how you help the organisation work towards broader goals. It might be things like involvement in a system implementation, employee focus group or even restarting the social club."</p>
        
            <p>She said it could be a good idea to reorder the job responsibilities listed in your work history and provide examples to match the key tasks in the advertised role, to make it clear that you were a good fit for a particular role.</p>
        
            <p>Marshall agreed people should tailor their CV for a role, and personalise their cover letter. It was also important to proof read. "There should be zero mistakes in your CV and cover letter."</p>
        
            <p>"Be very clear about what it is your are looking for and why, not just the job and the salary but what is the company culture you want to work in and how do your personal values align with the values of the organisation."</p>
        
            <p>Hayley Pickard, of Fortitude Group, said people should be honest with their interview answers. "Remember interviews aren't a test, it's for the employer to gauge your experience, skill set, and for them to see where you would fit in within the team and how you can add value to the role. If you don't fully understand the question, you can ask them to repeat the question or if they can clarify what they mean."</p>
        
            <p>Pickard said even when people had applied for tens or hundreds of roles, they would need to take the time to reread a job ad before they went into a job interview, and research the company. "Winging doesn't tend to work and we can clearly see when a client is unprepared and flying by the seat of their pants."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said people should prepare well for an interview and have some thoughtful questions ready to ask. "There's nothing worse than getting to the end and saying 'is there anything you want to know' and they say 'not really'."</p>
        
            <p>She urged people to arrive for an interview five or ten minutes early, dressed for the role, and to offer to take things like a coffee cup through to the kitchen afterwards. "Manners cost nothing but go a long way."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said people should look at the opportunities that might be available for them within their current organisation before they looked elsewhere, particularly with the job market so difficult for candidates.</p>
        
            <p>"Make absolutely certain that you are ready for a move and want a move… make sure you're having conversations with your line manager. Certainly don't resign without anything else to go to."</p>
        
            <p>He said the job market was likely to improve over the next six to 12 months, although there could be a surge of candidates looking for new roles at the start of next year. He said he had recently been in London talking to people planning to return to New Zealand, and some of that activity might flow through towards the start of next year.</p>
        
            <p>But he said people who could hold on until confidence picked up again and hiring activity improved might have better prospects.</p>
        
            <p>"A consideration is definitely to sit tight and wait for it to pass."</p>
