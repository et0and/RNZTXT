            <p>Two local men are reportedly being questioned after a 3.5 tonne methamphetamine bust in Fiji, as police probe the origins and destination of the drugs.</p>
        
            <p>The drugs were found in a small, unfinished home in a quiet community near the nation's main international airport. It has been called one of the country's biggest ever drug busts.</p>
        
            <p>Police are also looking into claims the drugs were bound for Australia, with the home affairs minister saying "a whole lot of people" were involved.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Federal Police (AFP) declined to comment if they had any involvement in the raid, or if they were in contact with their Fijian counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a Fiji Police Force operation," AFP said in reply to questions from RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Fiji police commissioner Juki Fong Chew did not provide further details.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ Pacific police were "in the initial stage of investigations", saying questions about the origin and destination would be answered "as we proceed along".</p>

            <p>However, assistant commissioner for crime Mesake Waqa told local radio broadcaster fijivillage.com police were looking at "information received that the large drug consignment was destined for Australia".</p>
        
            <p>He added police were "not ruling out the allegation that some police and customs officers may be involved in the drug operation".</p>
        
            <p>Waka on Tuesday said an investigation was also looking into whether prominent figures and some people linked to pharmaceutical companies were connected to the shipment.</p>
        
            <p>The drugs, in nearly 800 medium size-containers and wrapped in brown tape, were found at "an incomplete corrugated iron home in a quiet neighbourhood in Voivoi, Legalega in Nadi", The Fiji Times reported.</p>
        
            <p>A community elder and retired school teacher, Abhiram, told the newspaper: "This is a peaceful, crime-free neighbourhood, nothing of this sort happens here."</p>

            <p>Home Affairs Minister Pio Tikoduadua has said strengthening Fiji's border security was now a top priority.</p>
        
            <p>"How do you stay ahead so that you don't get surprised?" Tikoduadua said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's normal that things pass through, but why does three tonnes pass through? That is big. How did it ever get to Nadi?" he said to local journalists.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a whole lot of people that are handling that, and that's the extent of this network."</p>
