            <p>Sailors Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie are set to contest a medal race in the 49er FX skiff in Marseille.</p>
        
            <p>It is New Zealand's latest chance for a medal after Kiwi rowers took out three on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>Women's double sculls team Brooke Francis and Lucy Spoors won gold in their event, while the men's coxless four team took silver. In the women's coxless four finals, New Zealand's Davina Waddy, Phoebe Spoors, and sisters Kerri Williams and Jackie Gowler took bronze.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand copped a gold medal in women's sevens rugby and a silver in the men's triathlon.</p>
