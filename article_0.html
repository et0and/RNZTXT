            <p>US President Donald Trump has blamed diversity policies that were introduced under Barack Obama and Joe Biden for poor safety standards after a deadly crash in which a military helicopter collided with a passenger plane over Washington.</p>
        
            <p>"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first," Trump said on Thursday US time. "They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent."</p>

            <p>CNN reported that without evidence, Trump appeared to blame a diversity push by the US Federal Aviation Authority for the crash:</p>
        
            <p>"I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office. And here's one: the FAA diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing," CNN reported Trump said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce, said they want them in, and they want them - they can be air traffic controllers. I don't think so. This was January 14, so that was a week before I entered office.</p>
        
            <p>"They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA program."</p>
        
            <p>Trump officials have indicated he plans to sign orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and to proclaim that the US government recognises only two sexes.</p>
