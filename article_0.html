        <h2>Take a hike - Ten of Aotearoa's best walks</h2>
        <p>
There's still a lot of summer ahead of us to get out and enjoy the bush. RNZ talks to New Zealand's outdoor enthusiasts for advice on the best walks across the motu.

            <p>Editor and publisher of Wilderness Magazine Alistair Hall said the Omanawanui track is an escape, a world away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Auckland city.</p>
        
            <p>"The views found along the sinuous trail - of Manukau Harbour and the Tasman Sea - are exquisite and rival those you expect to find in a national park," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The walk takes about 2.5 hours each way and is in excellent condition because of upgrades in recent years, making it suitable for most ages.</p>
        
            <p>It is exposed to the elements, so Hall recommended plenty of water, sun protection, wind, and rainproof gear be carried.</p>
        
            <p>Former Victoria University Tramping Club president, and lifetime tramping enthusiast Anita Radcliffe said she adored Rangituhi Hill, tucked behind industrial Porirua.</p>

            <p>It is only about two kilometres to the lookout and two more to the summit, but Radcliffe said it felt like a real achievement as you walk through the extraordinarily lush bush, full of nīkau and supplejack.</p>

            <p>"You see all walks of life hauling themselves up the stairs, everyone is out giving it their best and cheering each other on," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It transports you away from your worries and makes you feel like you're deep in the bush. It even has a small waterfall and glowworms at night. A small walk but it packs a punch."</p>

            <p>Backcountry Trust Manager Rob Brown said the 10-12 day odyssey around Stewart Island was one of the best longer tramping trips in the country if you were looking for a real outdoor quest.</p>

            <p>"The challenging walk offers a spectacular mix of windswept beaches, forest and coastal scenery that never disappoints," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was also an "almost certain chance to see Kiwi in the wild," and visit huts in perfectly idyllic locations.</p>

            <p>"By the time you get to East Ruggedy Hut, you feel a long way from anywhere," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>Ric Cullinane, chief executive of Herenga ā Nuku Aotearoa, the Outdoor Access Commission, has explored walks worldwide. But his favourite is outside his front door, along Paekākāriki Beach.</p>

            <p>"It's never the same beach," Ric said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's spectacular. The colours, sea, the jetsam, are always changing."</p>

            <p>He usually walks along the beach every evening with his three Labradors.</p>
        
            <p>The beach walk links up to the south with the towering and wildly popular Escarpment Track. To the north, it links with a plethora of tracks through Queen Elizabeth Park. During the summer, Te Araroa walkers make their way along this long ribbon of walkways.</p>

            <p>One of NZ Mountain Safety Council chief executive Mike Daisley's favourite walks is the Trig Track on Kāpiti Island, which climbs to the island's highest point, Tuteremoana at 521m.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"I love this track because you get to experience the magic of Kāpiti Island," Daisley said.</p>
        
            <p>The island is a predator-free sanctuary with regenerating native forests.</p>
        
            <p>"You're likely to hear noisy kākā overhead, encounter curious weka and, if you're lucky, spot a takehē," he said.</p>
        
            <p>You will need to pre-book a Kāpiti Island Nature Tour for your boat trip to the island and attain a Department of Conservation permit. He recommended using Plan My Walk, the NZ Mountain Safety Council's free app and website for planning your next outdoor adventure.</p>
        
            <p>Wilderness Magazine deputy editor Leigh Hopkinsin's favourite bush walk is up the Fox River to the Ballroom Overhang, on the South Island's wild West Coast.</p>

            <p>The Ballroom is a massive limestone overhang that forms a natural shelter. It is on the Inland Pack Track, but you can do it as a return trip, 6km each way or camp for the night.</p>
        
            <p>"I love this walk because the river allows you easy access to these incredible places that would be challenging to get to otherwise," she said.</p>

            <p>If you time it right, you can finish with a swim, a coffee and Pad Thai at the laid-back Fox River Market, held at the river mouth every Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>One of the Federated Mountain Club president's favourite "on-track" walks is the loop around Otukota, Colenso and Ironbark hut in the Ruahine Forest Park.</p>

            <p>The area holds a special place in president Megan Dimozantos' heart as FMC has worked to ensure access via Mokai station remains unobstructed for everyone to enjoy.</p>
        
            <p>"It features a plethora of excellent huts that Backcountry Trust volunteers have lovingly restored and cared for," she said.</p>

            <p>The area is also well-trapped by Ruahine Whiō Protectors. Dimozantos saw two Whiō whānau on her last trip there.</p>
        
            <p>"The area is just such a beautiful reminder of just how special our wild places are," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Neil Mythen, this writer's father, has spent over 40 years tramping around Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>He said the "untouched lush native forest full of majestic trees" of the Whirinaki Track is an unbeatable bush walk.</p>
        
            <p>He said the area filled with rimu, matai, kahikatea, miro and totara, all hundreds of years old, is a magical place.</p>
        
            <p>"It will take your breath away as you meander along the track, where you could imagine a dinosaur appearing around the next corner."</p>
        
            <p>Unbelievable as it may seem, in the late '70s and early '80s, this forest was set to be selectively logged by the then NZ Forest Service, Mythen said.</p>
        
            <p>A campaign was started to save the forest, which captured the public's imagination and was basically the forerunner of the Green movement.</p>
        
            <p>The forest was saved and a new government department was formed to look after our native forests... the Department of Conservation.</p>
        
            <p>Alpine adventure company, Mountain Journey's owner Rob Frost set his sights on Mt Fox.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a steep and difficult track which "doesn't muck around," climbing 1200m over a distance of less than 4km.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>But it is worth the hustle he said, offering unparalleled views of the Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe, the highest section of the Southern Alps / Ka Tiritiri o te Moana, as well as both north and south along the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>There is plenty of variety, too: it starts in lowland podocarp-hardwood forest draped with mosses, and climbs through tree ferns, dracophyllum forest, subalpine shrubs, to finally reach alpine tarns amongst the tussock.</p>
        
            <p>"Allow a day, and plan to use your hands for the steep bits," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Just a couple of hours' drive into the back of Hanmer Springs, you will find yourself at sapphire blue Lake Tennyson.</p>
        
            <p>Looking over the lake is Mt Princess, where nestled under its peak is a glorious tarn, named Princess Bath.</p>
        
            <p>There is no set route up to the tarn, but you can follow the ridgeline eventually arriving for a cool dip to wash off the summer's heat.</p>
