            <p>The lead detective in the Grace Millane case says the defence's rough sex defence was a "cop out".</p>
        
            <p>The British backpacker was strangled to death by Jesse Kempson in 2018, after a Tinder date in Auckland on the eve of her 22nd birthday.</p>
        
            <p>A new feature-length film, The Lie, looks into the case and examines the rough sex defence used at Kempson's trial.</p>
        
            <p>Kempson claimed he accidentally killed Millane after she asked him to choke her during intercourse.</p>
        
            <p>He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison, and later convicted of sexual attacks on two other women.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Scott Beard told Saturday Morning he did not agree with the rough sex defence, which had since been banned in the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>It revictimised not just Millane but also her family, including her mother Gillian who sat through every day of the trial, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Gillian was beside me crying and sobbing," he told Saturday Morning host Susie Ferguson.</p>
        
            <p>"She was determined to stay, but it was so tough for her."</p>

            <p>Gillian previously told the BBC that hearing the rough sex defence in court was "horrendous".</p>
        
            <p>"I felt like Grace was on trial and she couldn't defend herself. As a parent, I didn't want to listen to that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't ask for your own death. It is ludicrous this can be used as a defence."</p>
        
            <p>Beard told Saturday Morning a law change in 2021 around what lawyers could ask victims of sexual violence went "a little way" towards banning the rough sex defence.</p>
        
            <p>However, that law change was not applicable to murder cases.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't strangle someone for five to 10 minutes and say that was rough sex. You feel them going limp. You'll know. And I'm sorry, it's murder."</p>
        
            <p>Beard said it was up to parliamentarians, not him, to ban the defence, but if asked, he would support a law change.</p>

            <p>The documentary's director, Helena Coan, said the rough sex defence was "abhorrent".</p>
        
            <p>It was the "ultimate lie" referred to in the film's title, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is the most offensive use of the justice system.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it is a very clever and manipulative way of harping on that same tune - she asked for it."</p>
        
            <p>The defence's legal team said in court that Kempson was "just doing what [Millane] wanted him to do, or what she asked him to do", Coan said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the fact that that's allowed is disgusting."</p>
        
            <p>The way Millane was portrayed in court spoke to a wider issue around violence against women, Coan said.</p>
        
            <p>There was still a tendency to blame the victim, rather than looking at the aspects of society that contributed to women's murders.</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to make the film in a "sensitive and compassionate way but also an honest way", she said, and centre women's stories.</p>
        
            <p>That included the stories of other women who dated Kempson.</p>
        
            <p>Coan also liaised with Gillian, through Beard, before making the film, and received her blessing.</p>
        
            <p>"If she had turned around and said 'don't make it' I would never have done it."</p>
        
            <p>The film will be released in cinemas on 25 April.</p>
