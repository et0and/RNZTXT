            <p>"She has fought like a trooper for 42 hours alone after falling at a waterfall and getting some quite bad injuries...</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] thankfully nothing that can't be fixed. One day at a time."</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked the Upper Hutt community for the way they rallied around search staff and the family.</p>
        
            <p>Rescue co-ordinator Penny Clash said it was the best outcome after a mammoth effort to find Maia.</p>
        
            <p>"The Totara Park team, the people, the community have just rallied together and it just shows what an awesome community Totara Park is.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a close-knit community and this really showed it."</p>
