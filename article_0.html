            <p>Carterton Mayor Ron Mark confirmed to RNZ that police and ambulances were called to the town's Main Street to attend to a person in a vehicle with a gunshot wound who has subsequently died.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two people have been taken into custody and charges are being considered.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was reported in Carterton near Pembroke Street as well as in Featherston near Daniell Street around 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>There is not believed to be any risk to the wider community, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Mark said that it seemed that the incident was targeted and did not pose a threat to the wider community.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very confident that the police will resolve this quite quickly."</p>
        
            <p>He said the community wanted to know what was going on which he believed was understandable.</p>
        
            <p>"Sirens, ambulances, police cars racing, road blocks, helicopters tend to cause a little bit of concern."</p>
        
            <p>Mark told RNZ it would appear that the person was brought into Carterton in a vehicle "in the state that they were in".</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 2 through Featherston and Carterton is closed and State Highway 2 at Kaitoke is down to one lane.</p>
