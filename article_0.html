            <p>Police said the suspects opened fire as they drove away, leading officers on a cross-county pursuit that reached speeds of nearly 180km/h before their arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm furious," mayor Will O'Neill told local media. "I'm horrified. I'm mourning the loss of someone who died inside of our city because of crime ... This is a tragedy and I'm furious.</p>
        
            <p>"These are thugs and every community is now dealing with this," O'Neill said. "We have to do better as a society because we cannot tolerate this."</p>
        
            <p>"This doesn't happen in Newport Beach," he told KCAL-9 News.</p>
        
            <p>The Newport Beach Fire Department said first responders found the woman dead in a parking lot just outside of the shopping centre.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses described seeing a dead body and a crowd panicked by gunshots.</p>

            <p>"When I walked up, it was just a dead body laying on the ground," shopper Rachel West told CBS News.</p>
        
            <p>"All of a sudden 20-30 people came running around the corner screaming, 'There's gunshots, there's gunshots', and you could tell by the look on their face this wasn't a drill," witness Case Burnett said.</p>
        
            <p>According to cbsnews.com, witnesses said they heard three to four gunshots before people sought cover. Residents were asked to avoid the area while police carried out investigations.</p>
        
            <p>"I expected to go and fix my sunglasses," shopper Rachel West said. "I didn't know that there was going to be a crime scene and dead body when I got here."</p>
        
            <p>A witness posted about the dramatic incident on X.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone was just shot somewhere between the Starbucks and Whole Foods at Fashion Island mall here in Newport Beach, California. Three men in a Camry was trying to rob a woman. A Samaritan came to help her and they shot at him three times. They didn't hit him."</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Steven Oberon told the Los Angeles Times that the woman's husband was believed to be uninjured.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald has sought comment on the incident from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
