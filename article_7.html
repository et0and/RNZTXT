            <p>Southern councils have joined forces on a proposal which could result in an injection of support from the government.</p>
        
            <p>In November, the government sent invitations to all councils for an opportunity to apply for regional deals - a collaboration between the two parties which would unlock funds and boost infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>The deals would be long-term commitments requiring funding from both central and local government.</p>
        
            <p>This week, regional development agency Great South confirmed it was putting together a "light touch" proposal for government, which is due at the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Chami Abeysinghe said the proposal would draw on Great South's Beyond 2025 long-term plan for Southland, which detailed issues such as housing, energy, workforce and roading.</p>
        
            <p>Abeysinghe was positive about the regional deals initiative, saying it had worked well overseas.</p>
        
            <p>If the government is happy to be bold and really support the regions, then I think it could work really well."</p>
        
            <p>Great South will represent four Southland councils in its proposal - Invercargill City Council, Southland District Council, Gore District Council and Environment Southland.</p>
        
            <p>The government has said regional deals would address the country's infrastructure deficit, with upgrades to areas such as housing and roads.</p>
        
            <p>It aimed to have the first deal finalised by the end of 2025 with three deals in place by late 2026.</p>
