            <p>Rocket Lab has made a deal with a European company aiming to give Ukraine more satellite support in the war with Russia.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand-US company was selected by Airbus Constellation Satellites to supply solar panels for 100 OneWeb Low Earth Orbit satellites for Eutelsat Group, according to a report from Business Insider.</p>
        
            <p>The panels will be manufactured at Rocket Lab's space solar production facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
        
            <p>The French-British satellite operator controls the OneWeb Low Earth Orbit satellites, the only low-earth orbit constellation other than Elon Musk's vastly larger - and much cheaper to access - Starlink network.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters recently reported that sources revealed the US might use Starlink as leverage in the peace talks with Russia. Elon Musk has denied this.</p>
        
            <p>Eutelsat said it was working with European authorities to increase their satellite service in Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Starlink has provided communications links for both military and civilian operations, like hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>A New Zealand attache was among the military officials that took part in talks in Paris this week on the subject of Ukraine, but so far has not joined a coalition of about 15 countries pledging support for the embattled nation.</p>
        
            <p>According to the company's website, in 2021, Rocket Lab provided solar array panels for the first fleet of 450 Airbus OneWeb satellites.</p>
