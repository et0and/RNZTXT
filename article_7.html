            <p>The Serious Fraud Office has filed bribery and corruption charges against three people, over the awarding of lucrative public sector construction contracts.</p>
        
            <p>The charges were laid against a former project manager and two associates, the SFO said in a statement</p>
        
            <p>The three people face charges including corruption of an official, corrupt use of official information and obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>A hearing was held in Auckland District Court today and interim name suppression was granted to the three defendants. A name suppression application will be heard on 15 February.</p>
        
            <p>The SFO claims the first defendant took advantage of official information while working as a public official while employed at the former Regional Facilities Auckland and at the-then Counties Manukau District Health Board.</p>
        
            <p>The information was allegedly used for the awarding of contracts to companies and included bribes.</p>
        
            <p>The SFO also claims all three defendants had personal relationships which they disguised from the public bodies.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed two companies received around $3.5 million in public funds.</p>
        
            <p>"The SFO would like to acknowledge RFA (now part of TƒÅtaki Auckland Unlimited) for bringing this matter to the SFO's attention following their own internal investigation, and both RFA and CMDHB (now Te Whatu Ora Counties Manukau) for their assistance," the statement said.</p>
