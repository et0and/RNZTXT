            <p>The number of people applying for jobs rose for a second consecutive month in November as the number of jobs on offer continues to shrink.</p>
        
            <p>Employment firm Seek said applications per job ad rose 4 percent in October and were now at the highest level recorded by it.</p>
        
            <p>Job ads fell by 5 percent month-on-month, and were 28 percent lower than the same time a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Retail and consumer products recorded a downward trend in hiring.</p>
        
            <p>Retail ads retreated 12 percent in November, while hospitality and tourism fell 9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Seek country manager Rob Clark said hirers were spoilt for choice with strong levels of competition among applicants.</p>
        
            <p>"Retail and consumer products, and hospitality and tourism, were the lead contributors to the decline in November," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"While it is expected that hiring within these industries would slow down at the end of the year, retail and consumer products in particular has been recording a downward trend in hiring for the past three months."</p>
        
            <p>Cities continued to lead the downturn in the labour market with ad volumes falling to a greater degree in the metro areas compared to the smaller regions.</p>
        
            <p>Job ads fell by 7 percent in Wellington in November, while listings in Auckland dropped 6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The monthly decline was not across the board, however, as ManawatÅ«, Southland and Gisborne recorded small increases in job ad volumes month-on-month.</p>
        
            <p>"When compared to the same time last year, Gisborne is the only region where job ads have increased, up 9 percent from November 2022," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All other regions have declined after the great job boom of 2022."</p>
        
            <p>The sharp annual decrease in listings experienced in Wellington was 32 percent, closely followed by Auckland down 31 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Job ads were 29 percent lower in Waikato compared to the same time a year ago, and down 25 percent in Canterbury compared to last November.</p>
        
            <p>"Candidates will have to work harder to stand out amongst the strong level of competition," Clark said.</p>
