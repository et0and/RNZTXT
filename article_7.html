            <p>A tourism operator says a drop in cruise passengers could have a significant impact on his bottom line this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Cruise Association predicts a 20 percent decrease in visitor numbers over the incoming cruise season, driven by increases to port costs and the international visitors levy.</p>
        
            <p>Gavin Oliver, the managing director of Waiheke Island-based EcoZip Adventures, said it was a big concern.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some of the worst economic conditions the country's seen in a while, certainly from the perspective of business owners. It has been very tough out there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're only at about 80 percent of pre-Covid arrivals at the moment, so the tourism sector is recovering more slowly than I think everybody originally forecast, so anything that sees a decrease like these cruise numbers ... It has an economic impact."</p>
        
            <p>Oliver estimated cruise passengers formed roughly 11 percent of his customer base, meaning a 20 percent decrease would translate to a roughly 2 or 3 percent dip in revenue.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged it did not sound like much, but said it made a huge difference.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's notable] particularly in a market which is already very tough. If you're in a buoyant market a 2 or 3 percent reduction is not enormous," he said,</p>
        
            <p>"But when you're coming off the back of borders being closed ... Most tourism businesses are still trying to rebuild their balance sheets, they're still trying to recover ... So a 2 or 3 percent decrease on the bottom line is massive."</p>
        
            <p>And those losses would flow into other parts of the economy, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If a tourism business is down, so are the people that supply that business. Whether they service their vehicles, print their brochures or provide the lunches their clients eat."</p>
        
            <p>Oliver feared New Zealand was becoming too expensive to visit.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost of people crossing the border into New Zealand is going up, increases in port charges, there's compliance costs that cruise ships have to deal with," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"All these things impact how attractive New Zealand is as a destination."</p>
