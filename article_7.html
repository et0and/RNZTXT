Importing natural gas looks like a viable option to make up for declining local production, a power company says.

            <p>Importing natural gas looks like a viable option to make up for declining local gas production and help secure power supplies, a power company says.</p>
        
            <p>Meridian Energy is looking at importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) coming in through land-based terminals as one solution.</p>
        
            <p>At an investor briefing, Meridian Energy chief executive Neal Barclay said it was planning for renewable energy and decarbonisation of the economy to meet climate change goals.</p>
        
            <p>"The gas sector, in particular, has been challenging. We've had significant curtailment of investment over a number of years largely driven by government policy settings back in 2018 and most of the investment that's gone into the sector hasn't delivered the results we would like."</p>
        
            <p>The electricity system would need gas for some time to provide the necessary back up of fuel to meet current and rising electricity demand, Barclay said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need that flexible, dispatchable demand and supply, and gas must remain part of the sector for some time to come."</p>
        
            <p>Gas has been used to quickly fire up power stations, known as peakers, to provide electricity when demand rises and/or supplies from hydro, wind and other renewable sources dip. The peakers have helped to reduce the need to burn coal at the Huntly power station.</p>
        
            <p>Barclays said indications were that importing LNG was a commercially viable option to supplement dwindling local gas output, but the government was making it clear that the private sector and market had to solve the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of the solution it's looking more and more compelling [that] LNG import could be a way through this."</p>
        
            <p>The options currently being floated are land-based import terminals at either Port Taranaki or Marsden Point in Northland on the site of the old oil refinery.</p>
        
            <p>It has also been suggested that imported gas could be put into the current network through links to an existing offshore field.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of the various options range between $200 million and $700m.</p>
        
            <p>In 2009, power companies Genesis and Contact deferred plans for the possible import of gas through Port Taranaki as not necessary given a lift in local production.</p>
