            <p>The Climate Venture Capital Fund is finding plenty of investment opportunities on both sides of the Tasman, with nearly $2.5 million invested in its first full year of operations.</p>
        
            <p>The fund was focused on investment in early-state New Zealand and Australian companies that deliver high climate impacts, alongside high growth and returns associated with high risk investment funds.</p>
        
            <p>It also targeted investments in companies that would collectively reduce emissions by at least one million tonnes (CO2 equivalent) for every $50m of investment over the life of the fund.</p>
        
            <p>Fund partner Rohan MacMahon said that ambition would be easily achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly satisfying to look back on this first year and see that we have delivered on what was promised," fund partner Rohan MacMahon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there is strong interest among investors in emissions reduction technology.</p>
        
            <p>"And we've seen that there are more opportunities to invest than we can possibly support."</p>
        
            <p>The company had so far invested in four companies, including Australia's thermal energy storage firm, MGA Thermal; New Zealand's low emissions powdered cleaning and personal care products, Cleanery; green ammonia business Liquium; and zinc recycling business, Zincovery.</p>
        
            <p>MacMahon said the fund was targeting the same level of investment in the current year ending in March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>While the fund targeted wholesale investment, he said it was also seeing institutional investor interest, which would potentially allow retail investors to take part in future investment rounds.</p>
