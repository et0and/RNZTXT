            <p>New Zealand medical software company Orion Health is to be taken over by a Canadian health technology company HEALWELL AI for about NZ$175 million.</p>
        
            <p>Orion was a pioneer local health technology company, which developed software for managing patient records in the 1990s and listed on the NZX in 2014.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Brad Porter said the deal would drive future growth.</p>
        
            <p>"There is so much potential with our combined capabilities to meet unmet health needs in ways that could be game-changing for the health of entire communities. When we link up data and insights with AI-assisted action we will see data saving lives on a scale not seen before."</p>
        
            <p>HEALWELL chair Hamed Shahbazi called the acquisition of Orion a "game changer".</p>
        
            <p>"Orion Health brings significant large enterprise customers, recurring revenues, strong operating margins and free cashflow conversion to HEALWELL while providing a significant new channel for the distribution of its best-in-class AI products and services."</p>
        
            <p>HEALWELL said it intended to divest the non-core Orion assets, with the takeover set to be finalised by April next year.</p>
        
            <p>It said Orion Health was expected to have revenue of more than NZ$122m next year with operating earnings of $24m.</p>
        
            <p>Orion listed on the NZX in late 2014 in a blaze of publicity and optimism, with a debut share price 14 percent above the issue price making it instantly a billion dollar company.</p>
        
            <p>Like most technology companies it burnt through cash and posted hefty losses in its early years as it looked to develop products and markets.</p>
        
            <p>However, its $6 a shareprice plunged to $1 as the losses mounted and it needed to restructure, cut costs and staff.</p>
        
            <p>By 2018 it found a white knight in the form of a British company to give it a cash injection, but at the cost of losing its best performing operations.</p>
        
            <p>Founder Ian McCrae took the firm private in 2019, in part because of the high costs of being listed and also the [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/464112/orion-develops-health-data-exchange-for-saudi-arabia</p>
