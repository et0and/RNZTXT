        <h2>Wellington's Fear Factory scares up its final frights</h2>
        <p>
Fear Factory says a drop in visitor numbers and a Covid-19 hangover both played a part in the closure of its Wellington branch.

            <p>Fear Factory says a drop in visitor numbers and a Covid-19 hangover both played a part in the closure of its Wellington branch.</p>
        
            <p>It opened in the capital the year before Covid struck and the nautical nightmare maze has since chartered a rocky course.</p>
        
            <p>"We opened in September of 2019, so we had seven months of trading before lockdown and to be honest I think that's when it all, the hardship started," said Director and General Manager Matthew Smith.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a really rough road for me and my family."</p>

            <p>The tourist attraction has branches in Wellington and Queenstown, but only the capital city one is closing.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said a real dip in tourism in the past year pushed the Wellington business over the line.</p>
        
            <p>"This was supposed to be the flagship store that took us to Sydney or Melbourne," he said. "We were hoping to leapfrog off the back of it being the capital city."</p>

            <p>Smith said he did not think they had misread the market, rather that tourism in Wellington had been impacted a lot harder than tourism in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>Celebrities like musician Ed Sheeran and The Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus have popped in for a scare, and it features in a segment of Wellington Paranormal.</p>

            <p>Karen O'Leary, who acted in the hit comedy, said it was a shame the business was closing down.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a real loss."</p>
        
            <p>O'Leary said Fear Factory offered something different for both locals and out of towners to do.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sad for those guys. They're lovely guys."</p>
        
            <p>O'Leary said going there while working on Wellington Paranormal had been a fun experience.</p>
        
            <p>She said however being the shortest, they put her at the front, and that ignited her fight or flight response.</p>

            <p>"I worked out thanks to Fear Factory that I'm definitively fight, because whenever people came to scare me, I just wanted to kinda kick them or hit them or hurt them or should swear words at them.</p>
        
            <p>Her colleague Mike Minogue was in hysterics behind her, she said.</p>
        
            <p>For Wellingtonians looking for a scare when Fear Factory is gone, O'Leary's suggestions include visiting cemeteries, doing something you're afraid of, or ... visiting the Beehive.</p>

            <p>Wellingtonians Paul, Laina and Elias who were visiting Fear Factory said they would miss it as it always gave them a good scare.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow local Jess said it seemed like one fun place after another was closing in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got quite a few colleagues who are thinking about moving to Melbourne just because Wellington feels pretty sad and not a lot of cultural or fun things are available."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Smith is figuring out what comes next.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the most important thing for me and my partner is just to take five. We're just going to ... let the dust settle and then we'll rethink."</p>
        
            <p>Fear Factory's last day is on Sunday.</p>
