            <p>Dairy company Synlait Milk has posted a modest first half profit as a cash injection, debt reduction, cost cutting and improved sales put it on the road to recovery.</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury based company made a profit of $4.8 million compared to the previous year's $96.2m loss, which included significant one off losses.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait needed an emergency loan and financial rescue package from its two largest shareholders to survive last year as it struggled with falling sales, a dispute with its biggest customer, and a debt mountain.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the position Synlait was in 12 months ago, this return to profitability is a considerable commercial achievement," acting chief executive Tim Carter said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's result was delivered through a focus on getting the fundamentals of our operational performance right, seizing opportunities to deliver for customers, and continued cost control."</p>
        
            <p>Synlait makes baby formula for A2 Milk for local and Chinese consumers, as well as a range of consumer dairy products through its Dairy Works subsidiary.</p>
        
            <p>Revenue rose 16 percent to $917m, while its debt was reduced 29 percent to $392m.</p>
        
            <p>The chairperson George Adams, credited with leading the rescue efforts, said the company has turned a financial and business corner.</p>
        
            <p>"While we still have a lot of work to do, we know we are heading in the right direction. The focus now is to consistently deliver - every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year."</p>
        
            <p>However, the company was expecting to make slower progress on restoring its finances as it balanced various factors ahead of a refinancing of its bank facilities.</p>
        
            <p>The company said many of its suppliers who had threatened to quit the company have changed their mind, and only a few had confirmed their exit, while new potential suppliers were looking to sign up.</p>
