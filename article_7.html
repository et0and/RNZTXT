            <p>The founder of the world's largest crypto exchange has been sentenced to four months in prison for allowing criminals to launder money on his platform.</p>
        
            <p>Changpeng Zhao resigned from Binance in November and pleaded guilty to violating US money laundering laws.</p>
        
            <p>Binance was ordered to pay a $US4.3 billion ($NZ7.3b) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors had sought a three-year sentence for the former Binance boss.</p>
        
            <p>At a sentencing hearing on Tuesday in Seattle, Judge Richard Jones said Zhao put "Binance's growth and profits over compliance with US laws and regulations", according to the Verge.</p>
        
            <p>US officials said in November that Binance and Zhao's "wilful violations" of its laws had threatened the US financial system and national security.</p>
        
            <p>"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit," said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p>
        
            <p>"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform."</p>
        
            <p>Commonly called "CZ", Zhao has a $US33b fortune, according to Forbes magazine.</p>
        
            <p>Nigerian authorities are currently investigating the company, registered in the Cayman Islands, as well.</p>
        
            <p>Tigran Gambarayan, who is in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance, denied money laundering charges in a Nigerian court in early April.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, detained in Nigeria alongside Gambarayan in February, escaped custody in March.</p>
        
            <p>Zhao's sentencing comes shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud committed at his rival crypto platform, FTX.</p>
        
            <p>Widely known as the "crypto king", Bankman-Fried was found to have stolen billions from customers ahead of the firm's failure.</p>
        
            <p>The Justice Department said its investigation into Binance also found the exchange made it easy for criminals to move money.</p>
