            <p>Tourism operators say they do not want new technology to jeopardise the manaakitanga they offer visitors.</p>
        
            <p>The industry has been facing a rapid rise in new technology that offers opportunities as well as challenges. And businesses do not want to risk getting left behind.</p>
        
            <p>Some have started to embrace robot room service, virtual reality and AI.</p>
        
            <p>But for smaller operators, it could be a daunting step into the unknown.</p>
        
            <p>The George hotels manager Simon Ruri said person-to-person contact was what the industry was built on.</p>
        
            <p>"There is concern that we may lose some of that. There is certainly room to integrate it, but I think what we stand strong to is our hospitality - both importing and exporting that.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think it is quite scary in terms of what it means for us in the future."</p>
        
            <p>But new technology brought with it an exciting and possibly generational change, Ruri said.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were opportunities to use AI without impacting manaakitanga.</p>
        
            <p>There were some big decisions to make and research was vital before buying in, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While it's a big investment, do you invest in that for the future or do you invest in it now, and what does that look like?</p>
        
            <p>"Because we have to take care of what we're looking after now versus what the future looks like or could look like, so I guess that's the hardest part."</p>
        
            <p>Tongariro National Trout Centre chief executive Bevin Severinsen said it was about how the tourism industry adapted and managed the new technology.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess if you go back 30-40 years when banks were talking about phasing out chequebooks and going over to cards that you poke into a machine on the sidewalk and punch a secret number in and then all of a sudden you get access to your bank account.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember the rhetoric back then was like 'what a crazy idea. How can this technology possibly take off?'"</p>
        
            <p>Businesses like his have plenty of questions about new technology as he found out at a recent tourism summit.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of it is around the idea of how do you control this? How do we ensure that this doesn't take over our business? How do we keep that face-to-face contact with our customer base?"</p>
        
            <p>Severinsen noticed there was less engagement in similar photos of children and families catching rainbow trout on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, it had been dabbling with AI-generated posts and images to pique interest.</p>
        
            <p>"You get new engagement from people that you haven't seen on your socials before and it's the imagery that sort of spikes something in their mind."</p>
        
            <p>Technology could also help to bring iwi history, environmental knowledge and customs to life, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Julie Wolbers runs Ribbonwood Retreat, a bed and breakfast in Franz Josef, and said she'd never go contactless for her business.</p>
        
            <p>"What sets us apart though is when a guest leaves us saying that they arrived as strangers and left as friends. So we don't want - well we don't think AI can really take that away from us."</p>
        
            <p>She uses AI to help with emails and marketing, and she has been considering how else it could make a difference for her business.</p>
        
            <p>"It helps me with the syntax, spelling and they're tasks that I would rather not be spending time on."</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Industry Aotearoa chief executive Rebecca Ingram said technology could help businesses spend more time on the important stuff - like customers - by taking over tasks.</p>
        
            <p>"The way I see tourism businesses using it now - and I would expect that to continue - is to enable their people to be doing what they do best so that AI can support them with some of the things that are a little bit less sexy or interesting behind-the-scenes."</p>
        
            <p>Tourism businesses said change was coming, but it did not have to come at the cost of their hospitality.</p>
