            <p>One of New Zealand's biggest wine brands is celebrating its 90th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>The Selaks brand began in 1934 when Croatian immigrant Marino Selak first sold wine made from the 300 grape vines growing in his West Auckland market garden.</p>
        
            <p>Marino was the great-uncle of Michael Selak, who said the family only started making wine so they could drink it with friends.</p>
        
            <p>"It sort of grew from there. People said 'well this isn't bad compared to what we can buy elsewhere - can you make some more for us', so they started selling to friends and friends," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The company now sells more than one million litres of wine a year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's one of the largest wineries in New Zealand now, with grape holdings and size of production. It's a value brand so I think people that buy the brand know what they are going to get.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand wine now is completely different to ... 90 years ago, but it's heading in the right direction," Selak said.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Back when the brand started, the family was selling mainly sherry and port.</p>

            <p>However, Selaks winemaker Kate Curd said consumers were demanding very different wine varieties now.</p>
        
            <p>"So now we are seeing a lot more of a change over past several years. Ros√© is becoming more popular and with the 'no and low' programme people are wanting a zero percent alcohol, they're wanting that alternative," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Her career in winemaking stemmed from a desire to be outdoors, but also a passion for the lab.</p>

            <p>"I've always really enjoyed science and chemistry and that kind of thing."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>That went a long way when creating no- or low-alcoholic wines, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no easy task. It's really missing bits so you're trying to find alternatives [to] fill out that palate ... and make those wines still taste appealing," she said.</p>
