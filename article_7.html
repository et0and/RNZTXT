            <p>The 'Kia Kaha Te Reo Māori' clothing line is back in stores after the first release became the fastest selling apparel line The Warehouse has ever had.</p>
        
            <p>The line, which includes shirts, hoodies and bucket hats all featuring the iconic hei tiki logo, sold out in minutes last year ahead of Te Wiki o te Reo Māori and were already moving like proverbial hotcakes after being made available in store and online at The Warehouse on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It's part of a partnership between The Warehouse and Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori (the Māori Language Commission).</p>
        
            <p>Māori development lead at The Warehouse Troy Rawhiti-Connell told Midday Report that they brought the kākāhu (clothing) back as quickly as possible after the success of the first edition last September, which sold out by the first afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a massive indicator of how passionate people were of all stripes in terms of showing their pride for te reo Māori and I'm fairly certain that it was the fastest selling apparel product that The Warehouse had ever had."</p>
        
            <p>Sales of the range went live in all The Warehouse stores and online Friday morning and Rawhiti-Connell said sales have already been brisk.</p>
        
            <p>"Even with limited edition but more stock than last time it looks like we're tracking as fast if not faster than last time. So that message that te Warewhare and Te Taura Whiri put out there in terms of kia tere, to be quick, people are paying attention to that - they are going quick."</p>

            <p>Tumu Whakahaere or chief executive of Te Taura Whiri Ngahiwi Apanui-Barr expected that the clothing would be snapped up fast again this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We were thrilled to see the Kia Kaha gear go flying out the door last year. It just proved what we know, New Zealanders are proud to show their love for te reo and they want more opportunities to do so," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rawhiti-Connell said Te Taura Whiri collect royalties on the money raised from the sale of the Kia Kaha Te Reo Māori clothing.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody knows that the Māori Language Commission's kaupapa protection and development of te reo Māori - that is their activity and we are a licensee to Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori so they collect royalty on what we sell."</p>
