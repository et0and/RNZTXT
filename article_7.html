            <p>The insurer Tower is quitting the commercial rural sector in a bid to focus on personal and small business insurance.</p>
        
            <p>The company's commercial rural book generated premium income of about $9 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to the share market, chief executive Blair Turnbull said Tower has been focused on simplifying and improving the efficiency of its business over the past three years.</p>
        
            <p>Tower said from February next year, the company would refer its commercial farm customers to Aon as their Tower policies expired.</p>
        
            <p>However, the insurer would continue to insure lifestyle blocks despite the change in strategy.</p>
        
            <p>"This change will help smooth the path to decommissioning our last legacy technology system in New Zealand. We look forward to developing a new digital offering for our lifestyle block customers in the coming year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Tower said the Aon agreement would provide "good value for Tower's shareholders and provides commercial rural customers with access to specialised insurance solutions with AonAgri".</p>
        
            <p>Tower would continue to progress any open claims lodged within the policy term until its completion.</p>
        
            <p>The company said it did not need regulatory approval for the changes.</p>
