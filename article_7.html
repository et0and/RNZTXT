            <p>Demand and enquiries for businesses are at record levels, driven by increased immigration and former corporate workers and government consultants.</p>
        
            <p>Business brokerage ABC Business Sales said enquiries were nearly 50 percent higher than a year ago, with the company seeing about 500 non-disclosure agreements signed per week.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a strong 2023, where the company saw a record 17,000 confidentiality agreements signed.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Chris Small said so-called "corporate refugees" and former, recently unemployed government consultants were fuelling demand.</p>
        
            <p>He said "corporate refugees" were ex-corporate workers looking for a lifestyle change.</p>
        
            <p>"They're part of what we call the 'buy yourself a job' market," Small said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very real and growing market which includes those such as the ex-corporates and consultants who for various reasons, are now unemployed and are thinking seriously about taking control of their future work destiny by buying their own business."</p>
        
            <p>Small said those workers came from high income jobs and had cash available to invest.</p>
        
            <p>The average price for buying a small business fell 5 percent last year, as buyers exercised caution due to the economic environment.</p>
        
            <p>"At that point ... buyers were a little bit nervous about interest rates and also we had the election in October, there was just a fair bit of uncertainty."</p>
        
            <p>But based on recent trends, ABC forecast a 5 to 7 percent annual increase in prices in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It said key drivers were ongoing strong immigration, an expected surge in mergers and acquisitions activity following the election, and increased investor confidence as interest rates are exected to fall.</p>
