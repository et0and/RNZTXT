            <p>Mickey, Donald, Goofy and the gang will sail into New Plymouth this summer for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>In a surprise addition to the region's cruise schedule, Port Taranaki has announced Disney-themed cruise ship Disney Wonder will visit on Sunday, 19 January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>General manager commercial Ross Dingle said the 11-deck, 294m vessel, which accommodates 2400 passengers and 945 crew, will arrive from Sydney at 10.15am and head back in the same direction at 5.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Disney Wonder is one of the signature vessels sailing in Australasia, and there was a lot of hype around her first visit to New Zealand last November, so having her now come to Taranaki is fantastic and very exciting for the region," Dingle said.</p>
        
            <p>It would be the equal-largest cruise ship to visit Taranaki, alongside Queen Elizabeth and Island Princess, which both visited last season.</p>
        
            <p>Dingle said a change of schedule had prompted the visit.</p>
        
            <p>"Disney Wonder was looking for a New Zealand port as an alternative stop following a change of schedule to its Disney Magic at Sea cruise.</p>
        
            <p>As a port of first and last call, and the only deep-water port on the west coast of New Zealand, Port Taranaki was uniquely positioned to quickly accommodate vessels coming from Australia, Dingle said.</p>
        
            <p>"We put forward our interest and were able to provide the berthage and services the vessel required, so we're thrilled to be able to make this happen."</p>
        
            <p>Port Taranaki partnered with regional development agency Te Puna Umaga Venture Taranaki to develop the Taranaki Cruise Strategy, which aimed to sustainably grow cruise visits to the region.</p>
        
            <p>The addition of Disney Wonder would bring the number of cruise ship visits this season to six, and boost the number of potential cruise visitors to more than 5300.</p>
        
            <p>Venture Taranaki GM destination Brylee Flutey said Disney Wonder's visit was fantastic for the region.</p>
        
            <p>"Welcoming more than 2000 extra visitors to Taranaki this summer will provide a real boost for our local economy, with local tourism, hospitality, and retail businesses in particular set to leverage this exciting new schedule addition.</p>
        
            <p>"The passengers will have spent two or three days at sea since departing Sydney, and will be keen to get off the vessel, stretch their legs and explore all Taranaki has to offer."</p>
        
            <p>The Disney Magic at Sea cruises were generally two to seven nights, and family-oriented with a focus on the entertainment onboard.</p>
        
            <p>They include Broadway-style shows, such as Frozen, Disney Dreams, and Golden Mickeys, held at the Walt Disney Theatre, themed restaurants, fireworks at sea, Disney-themed parties, several pools, waterslides and splash zones, a massive outdoor LED screen on the ship's funnel that screens movies and shows, and the chance to meet Disney characters.</p>
        
            <p>For Disney-fatigued adults there were also adult-only nightclubs and bars, and an upscale restaurant.</p>
        
            <p>Other cruise ships visiting Port Taranaki this season are Scenic Eclipse II (29 November), Silver Nova (15 December and 28 January), Azamara Pursuit (25 January) and Amadea (19 February).</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a new study has revealed the 2023-24 Taranaki cruise season delivered an economic impact of more than $2 million to the region.</p>
        
            <p>The Value of Cruise Tourism Economic Assessment was the first detailed analysis of the sector's impact on regional economies.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki welcomed seven cruise ships during the 2023-24 season, which brought 6669 passengers and 1736 crew to the region.</p>
        
            <p>According to the report, they generated $2.2m in additional economic activity, with passengers spending an average of $116 per day and crew $47.50 on local goods and services.</p>
        
            <p>The creation of 15 jobs was also credited to the cruise sector in 2023-24.</p>
