        <p>
Before regulation operators had significantly cheaper prices for calls and short messages on their own network.

            <p>The Commerce Commission is considering deregulating fees telcos can charge customers on one mobile network to make phone calls and send texts to customers on another network.</p>
        
            <p>Telecommunications Commissioner Tristan Gilbertson said the Mobile Termination Access Services (MTAS) may no longer be necessary to promote competition, given advances in digital communication which offered a wide range of options for communications, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and others.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen a significant shift in the competitive landscape," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This means a formal investigation is warranted, but a recommendation to deregulate will be made only if we find regulation is no longer necessary to promote competition for the benefit of Kiwi consumers."</p>
        
            <p>The latest investigation followed the commission's call for feedback in November.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent MTAS review was completed in September 2020 when the Commission concluded reasonable grounds for deregulation did not exist.</p>
        
            <p>Before MTAS was regulated, operators had significantly cheaper prices for calls and short messages on their own network compared with those going to a customer on a different network.</p>
        
            <p>In June 2010, the commission said the higher prices hindered competition and regulated pricing followed.</p>
