            <p>The construction industry is losing confidence, amid rising concern about the lack of a clear pipeline of government work in the immediate future.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 Construction Industry Survey - commissioned by Civil Contractors - found just one in five contractors have confidence in the outlook, which compared with a third last year.</p>
        
            <p>A third expected to see revenue growth this year, compared with 47 percent in 2023, 52 percent in 2022 and 55 percent in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Contractors chief executive Alan Pollard said the industry was facing a severe lack of work, which was affecting 64 percent of businesses, compared with 29 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"There has to be change, and we've certainly told the relevant government ministers that there is a crisis unfolding right now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pollard said other challenges facing the industry was a lack of a clear work pipeline, cost increases and supply chain issues.</p>
        
            <p>"We strongly support (the government's) medium to long term vision. It's certainly what New Zealand needs."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said the industry needed support now to reduce red tape and get working.</p>
        
            <p>The survey found difficulties with local and central government procurement guidelines and work consent conditions affected 57 percent of businesses, up from 36 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Rising compliance costs, such as temporary traffic management and health and safety protocols affected 71 percent of businesses, while 64 percent reported project cost overruns.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, we need assistance with contracts coming to market. We can't be in the same place in 12 months' time," Pollard said.</p>
        
            <p>"Already at the moment, contractors are restructuring, they are shedding staff, and they're parking up equipment that is surplus to requirements."</p>
        
            <p>The survey indicated just 39 percent of businesses expected staff growth in 2024, which was a decline from 54 percent in 2023 and 63 percent in 2022, with 12 percent of businesses expecting to cut staff numbers this year.</p>
