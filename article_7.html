            <p>Westpac is lowering its home loan interest rates for the second time this month.</p>
        
            <p>The bank says it now has the lowest rates for three and four year terms of the five major banks.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac's special fixed home loan rate for a one year term is now 6.85 percent with no change to its six month term.</p>
        
            <p>Its standard rate for one year is 7.45 percent and 7.09 for two years.</p>
        
            <p>The bank is also decreasing a range of term deposit rates by between 0.1 and 0.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac NZ spokesperson Sarah Hearn said wholesale rates had fallen and the bank was passing that on to its customers.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be welcome news for customers due to re-fix their home loans in the near future," she said in a statement.</p>
