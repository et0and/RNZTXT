            <p>Hundreds of Canterbury meatworkers are anxiously waiting to find out if their jobs are safe.</p>
        
            <p>Staff employed at at Alliance Group's Smithfield meatworks in Timaru have been called to a surprise meeting at 11am Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The company will not say what it is about.</p>
        
            <p>Timaru mayor Nigel Bowen said the plant employed more than 600 people at peak season and workers were going into the meeting with a lot of questions.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of concern for those workers that are affected," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been rumours for some time now around possible changes, potential closure, so I guess one thing that is positive is that affected parties will have that confirmed in one way or another."</p>
        
            <p>Bowen said a closure would be significant for the region, given the large number of staff and supporting trades it would affect.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been talking, certainly, with agencies, Chamber of Commerce, economic development, and certainly there'll be as much support as possible wrapped around anyone if there is any closure of sorts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The community's already starting to work together on what support could be offered if necessary, and what other work opportunities there are for people to go to,</p>
        
            <p>"We'll try our best to look out for everyone involved."</p>
        
            <p>Alliance is the country's only entirely farmer-owned red meat co-operative.</p>
        
            <p>It is owned by about 4500 farmer shareholders and exports to more than 65 countries.</p>
        
            <p>Alliance Group chief executive Willie Wiese said the company had requested Smithfield employees attend the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was inappropriate to comment further.</p>
