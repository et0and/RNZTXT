            <p>Challenging conditions for Bluff oyster harvesters have seen some operators pull up anchor early for the season.</p>
        
            <p>While the industry is notoriously cyclical, this season, which usually runs until the end of August, has been especially bad, operators say.</p>
        
            <p>The weather, a bad year for an endemic virus and other environmental factors have hit the fishery hard, Graeme Wright of Barnes Oysters and operations manager of the Bluff Oyster Management Company said.</p>
        
            <p>Out of the four months Barnes has been running boats, it has only fished 42 percent of those days because of the weather, Wright told RNZ's Nine to Noon. </p>
        
            <p>"We've had some extended periods of up to 10 days in a row when the boats haven't been able to leave the wharf. So, the weather has been a major player."</p>
        
            <p>The parasite Bonamia exitiosa, endemic in the fishery, has caused an increased level of mortality this season, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're talking up to 20 percent mortality rates. So, that and the weather and for whatever reason overall the quality is not as good as we would normally expect to see."</p>
        
            <p>Other fisheries in the area are also seeing a decline in quality, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Things like mutton birds have had really poor quality, blue cod is battling a bit, snapper hasn't been good quality. So, there's some environmental stuff that's happening out there we're just having to live with."</p>
        
            <p>The prevalence of Bonamia had doubled this year, Wright said.</p>
        
            <p>While a lack of nutrition of nutrition has impacted the wider fishery in the Foveaux Strait, Oysters are particularly vulnerable, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Fish can swim away if they don't like the environment, they can move somewhere else, oysters can't obviously move themselves."</p>
        
            <p>And bad weather can also make it difficult for oysters to feed.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got to have the conditions, no big storm events continually covering them over and making it difficult for them to feed."</p>
        
            <p>The season ends 31 August, and Barnes intends to fish through, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly, with the major delays with the weather all being equal we will stick around until the end of August this year."</p>
