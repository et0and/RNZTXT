            <p>Popular Wellington cafe Olive is being sold after 20 years and is set to be revamped by new business owners from the Thistle Inn in Thorndon.</p>
        
            <p>It comes in a string of closures across the capital including bakery Myrtle and Burmese restaurant Mabel's.</p>
        
            <p>Olive is owned by its head chef Jamie Morgan and brothers Ferdi and Carlo Petegna who also own Fratelli on Blair Street.</p>
        
            <p>The cafe has previously turned away former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her husband Clark Gayford because it was at capacity in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Thistle Inn owner Richard Walsh confirmed to RNZ it has bought the cafe but wouldn't say what the plans for the future of it were.</p>
        
            <p>Ferdi Petegna said - after ten years running the cafe - they are keen to step back from the pressure of the business and focus on family.</p>
        
            <p>"Just thanking Wellington really and thanking all the customers. It's about the customers and the staff and we've had a heap of staff over 10 years that are always messaging us. And a lot of them want to come back and do cameo shifts over the next six weeks for fun which is pretty awesome," Petegna said.</p>
        
            <p>Ferdi Petegna said Thistle Inn owner Richard Walsh will revamp the location but has not told them his plans for the business.</p>
        
            <p>He said the decision will may shock Wellingtonians.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that we have told already are like 'aw no' but they also know us and they understand that we have made Olive into more of a restaurant compared to what it used to be and next people can do whatever they want and they're going to come and try it and give it a go.</p>
        
            <p>"When we took over, we got a lot of flack from the regulars at the time from changing it from a cafe to a restaurant but it paid off in the end. People just get used to it, you change your cliental slightly. The Olive we are now is definitely not what it was 10 years ago at all, it's quite different," Petegna said.</p>
        
            <p>The cafe will close at the end of January.</p>
        
            <p>The Thorndon pub is the oldest bar in Wellington and was established in 1840.</p>
