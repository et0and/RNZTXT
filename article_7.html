            <p>Big businesses are helping small firms develop their digital services with a comprehensive service aimed at future proofing their operations.</p>
        
            <p>The Digital Boost Alliance, led by The Warehouse Group, with support from Spark, Ricoh, and Google, established a service to help small businesses set up their technology to enable their business to run efficiently and to grow as technology advances.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that digital acceleration is a key driver of economic and social progress, and we are committed to empowering our customers and communities with the skills and tools they need to succeed in the digital age," Ricoh New Zealand general manager Roly Smoldon said.</p>
        
            <p>Google NZ country director Caroline Rainsford said the service helped businesses build the confidence they needed to invest in digital services.</p>
        
            <p>"We listened closely to small businesses, and they told us the struggle is real when it comes to finding the right tech. They want to make sure their hard-earned money goes towards tools that truly work for them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>TUANZ chief executive Craig Young said the alliance aimed to leverage its collective expertise to drive digital transformation and support the growth and success of New Zealand Inc.</p>
        
            <p>"With members from both the private and public sectors, the Digital Boost Alliance is a community of passionate New Zealand organisations working together to motivate and inspire businesses, communities and individuals to lift their use and knowledge of digital technology," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Through their commitment to providing free, discounted, or subsidised digital offers, the alliance aims to drive digital acceleration in Aotearoa to keep New Zealand moving forward."</p>
