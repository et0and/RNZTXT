            <p>The last week of January is prime job-hunting time, and Trade Me says a softer labour market is not putting applicants off.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me Jobs data shows the coming week is consistently the busiest time on the site, with up to 245,000 views on job ads per day.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me Jobs head Nicole Williams says people returning to work from a holiday "get into a bit of a slump" and wonder whether are better options.</p>
        
            <p>That led to an increase of 50 percent or more in applications for jobs between December and January, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something we see every year."</p>
        
            <p>She said the trend was evident across the board, and particularly in retail and hospitality.</p>
        
            <p>The tougher labour market, with rising unemployment, had not changed the picture this year, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"On-site traffic was up 4.2 percent in the first two weeks of January compared to this time last year."</p>
        
            <p>She said Trade Me Jobs had worked with a number of brands to offer fixed-term opportunities to get job hunters excited.</p>
        
            <p>It is advertising for Kathmandu "overseas enthusiasts" who want to travel for three months full-time; a "whopperologist" at Burger King to ensure burgers meet the standard; and a "chief good boy" and "personal talent manager" to be the face of pet food brand Animals Like Us.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said the ads were representational of lots of roles on Trade Me. "There's such a range of jobs that there is always a few interesting ones."</p>
        
            <p>Williams was hopeful the labour market would improve this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Job listings bounced back in January. They're somewhat lower than this time last year but healthier than they were through the last two quarters of last year."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, recruiter Robert Half said a pay increase was the primary objective this year for about a third of New Zealand workers it surveyed.</p>
        
            <p>Flexible work hours were also sought-after, as well more benefits, a promotion and more recognition.</p>
