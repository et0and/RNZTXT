            <p>Most people will have heard talk about the median wage and some might even be able to put their finger on it - if you're not one of them, it's in the vicinity of $1250 a week.</p>
        
            <p>But that figure is based on incomes for the entire workforce, including school leavers, apprentices, new graduates, experienced professionals, and the semi-retired, to name just a few.</p>
        
            <p>So, what are the numbers relevant to your demographic and how does your income stack up?</p>
        
            <p>Here's what the Stats NZ data shows.</p>
        
            <p>Getting a part-time job is a rite of passage for a lot of New Zealand teens and can be a lucrative way to spend a few hours after school or at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 15 to 19 had a median weekly income of $390 and median hourly rate of $23 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>While that is shy of the adult minimum wage ($23.15), it is quite a bit better than than the starting out and training minimum wages ($18.52), both of which can apply to teens (whether that is fair is an issue for another day).</p>
        
            <p>Your earnings should pick up once your teens and education (or most of it) are behind you.</p>
        
            <p>Workers aged 20 to 24 have a median hourly rate of $26 (in line with the current living wage) and median weekly income of $1008. That works out to $52,416 a year.</p>
        
            <p>Those in their late twenties earn a median weekly income of $1247 at a rate of $30 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Incomes continue to climb as workers hit their early thirties and rack up some experience.</p>
        
            <p>The median weekly income for those aged 30-34 is $1360 ($70,720 a year) at a median hourly rate of $33.56.</p>
        
            <p>Things are not vastly different for workers in their late thirties, with the median hourly rate of $36.23 and weekly earnings of $1440.</p>
        
            <p>Although you will probably start to notice a few physical changes in your forties (can I interest you in a few more grey hairs, wrinkles, aches and pains?), there is little change in median incomes across this decade.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 40 to 44 earn a median weekly income of $1400, while those in their late forties are only marginally better off at $1419 per week.</p>
        
            <p>Things start to slide in the final full decade before retirement, with the median weekly income falling to $1396 in the first half and to $1343 ($69,836 a year) in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the median hourly rate falls by $1 from $34 to $33 between 50 and 59.</p>
        
            <p>The end is in sight! But as workers count down to putting their feet up, incomes are also on a downward slide.</p>
        
            <p>The median weekly income for those aged 60 to 64 is $1280 at an hourly rate of $34.14.</p>
        
            <p>Post-pension age, median weekly income from salary and wages falls to $959, while the median hourly rate is $30.</p>
