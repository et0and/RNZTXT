            <p>AI is infiltrating every part of our lives, and that includes Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>That is not to say Santa is replacing his elves with robots, but it certainly is changing some people's holiday habits. Particularly when it comes to shopping for presents.</p>
        
            <p>Simon McCallum is a senior lecturer of AI and computer science at Victoria University. He has heard of some consumers turning to the technology to make buying gifts easier.</p>
        
            <p>"AI can help open up your mind to other options that you hadn't considered, because it's another voice," he said.</p>
        
            <p>One way to do it is by providing the AI with information about the person you are buying for and asking for recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>I tried it out for the Morning Report Secret Santa.</p>
        
            <p>I typed in that I needed to buy for a radio producer with a few other details, and both Chat GPT and Perplexity AI suggested a variety of self-care products, stationery and sleep aids to help with the shiftwork.</p>
        
            <p>They were useful suggestions, but lacking personality even when I tried adding more details.</p>
        
            <p>According to McCallum, that is because I was not careful with how I used it.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything that has happened in the chat so far is part of the input. So, once it has recommended candles and you continue with that chat, it will think that candles are a good idea and it will keep talking about candles," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>But even for expert AI users, getting AI to choose your gifts is not the same as selecting them yourself, and it won't be something everyone supports.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there are still a fairly large number of people who value personal effort. They don't want to have someone else suggest a present, they want to show that they care about the person because they have spent time thinking about it themselves."</p>
        
            <p>McCallum also warned that it will not be long until this use for AI becomes commercialised.</p>
        
            <p>"We might soon see companies buying product placements in AI. So when you ask the AI for recommendations, it won't give you just any recommendations, it will give you product recommendations from people who have paid to give you those specific ones."</p>
        
            <p>However, it is not just gifts that AI can assist with. There are a myriad of uses that can make the festive season easier.</p>
        
            <p>Need a quick and easy Christmas card? Ask AI to generate one.</p>
        
            <p>Are you expecting guests with a variety of dietary requirements? Ask AI to help you plan a menu.</p>
        
            <p>Do you have a long drive with children looming? Simon McCallum has some ideas for you</p>
        
            <p>"I use the Chat CPT app on my phone, and I get my kids to play I Spy with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very smart. You take a photograph, and it will try and guess what you're thinking of, so you can play endless I Spy with it."</p>
