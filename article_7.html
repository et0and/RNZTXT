            <p>Changing taste and cheaper prices for buyers and better value for developers are driving the townhouse building boom.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic's latest report shows 39,600 townhouses have been built across the country since 2016, with more than half in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It said that accounts for 45 percent of all new dwelling consents recently, compared to just 6 percent in 2012.</p>
        
            <p>Chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said it was hard to tell if potential buyers wanted townhouses or if that was what developers are choosing to build - or if it was a bit of both.</p>
        
            <p>"Society's tastes have been changing a little bit, people wanting perhaps smaller dwellings without having to worry about maintaining a big section, so that's been part of it.</p>
        
            <p>"But also the economics have stood up from a development point of view, particularly as part of the unitary plan in Auckland if you can get a big section with an older house on it, you knock that house down and you put up three or four townhouses, which you can derive more value.</p>
        
            <p>"And of course, they do come at that cheaper price so easier to tap into for people who are a bit cash-strapped."</p>
        
            <p>He said more townhouses on the market was a good thing.</p>
        
            <p>"It intensifies our land, they can be built closer to existing infrastructure, roading, water, all of that, but also things like public transport. It seems to make a lot of sense and hopefully the government's supply policy changes will continue to encourage that type of dwelling."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said despite the housing market slowdown, townhouses were still a high share of construction and stock on the market.</p>
