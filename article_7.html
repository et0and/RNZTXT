        <h2>Call for government to include ethnicity when tackling pay gap</h2>
        <p>
For every $1 a Pākehā man earns, a Pacific woman gets 75c. That's not good enough, experts say.

            <p>The Human Rights Commission is calling on the government to include ethnicity when tackling pay gaps.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, acting Minister for Women Louise Upston announced plans for a voluntary system for businesses to report gender pay gaps.</p>
        
            <p>Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Saunoamaali'i Karanina Sumeo said it was vital to think about more than gender when having such conversations, or people would be left behind.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not enough to talk about the gender pay gap alone. We must include ethnicity in all pay transparency conversations."</p>
        
            <p>She says a recent inquiry found that without intervention, the Pacific pay gap would take 110 years to close.</p>
        
            <p>The same inquiry found that that for every $1 a Pākehā man earned, a Pākehā woman earned 89c, an Asian man and a Māori man got 86c, an Asian woman received 83c, a Pacific man and a Māori woman both earned 81c and a Pacific woman got 75c.</p>
        
            <p>"For a Pacific woman the pay gap amounted to $488,310 over a working life."</p>
        
            <p>For many, those pay gaps had huge impacts on poverty, the ability to feed children and to live a life with dignity, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"For Māori and Pacific people there is a transference of generational inequity. Many vulnerable ethnic and migrant groups receive a significantly lower median wage than non-migrants. And ultimately, we need that conversation to include disabled people."</p>
        
            <p>Upston announced a voluntary rather than mandated system for businesses to report pay inequity, unlike legislation pitched by the previous Labour government.</p>
        
            <p>Pay equity expert Lyn Brieseman said mandatory reporting had been introduced in other countries and had proven to be a successful way of reducing gender pay gaps nationally, but a voluntary system was a start.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea of a voluntary reporting framework is to normalise pay gap reporting so others will be comfortable following the trend.</p>
        
            <p>"Putting a 'spotlight' on an issue is a way of focussing attention on that issue so something is done about it."</p>
        
            <p>Sumeo said that although the gender pay gap tool was a good step forward, there was more to be done.</p>
        
            <p>"If mandated reporting is off the table for now, we are calling on government and businesses to be courageous and continue that important conversation."</p>
        
            <p>Upston said the government hoped to address ethnic pay gaps in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"While this tool is being developed to assess gender pay gaps, we hope that as we learn more over time ethnic pay gaps can be measured in a similar way. Due to data collection issues, measuring ethnic pay gaps has proven difficult in overseas jurisdictions."</p>
        
            <p>She said Cabinet had not made any decisions about progressing with the previous government's work on a mandatory pay gap reporting system.</p>
        
            <p>"The coalition government is committed to addressing inequity in the workplace, but we also do not want to overburden businesses with unnecessary costs and regulations."</p>
