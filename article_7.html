            <p>Contact Energy isn't giving up on its Southland wind farm project with plans to appeal the declined consent application and reapply under the government's new fast-track process.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, an expert panel turned down the company's application for a 55-turbine, 330-megawatt wind farm near Wyndham, citing environmental concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Contact's previous application was made under the now defunct Covid-19 fast-track consenting process.</p>
        
            <p>The company - which reacted furiously to the panel's decision - said it would now reapply for consent under the government's controversial new fast-track consenting legislation, passed at the end of last year.</p>
        
            <p>In announcing its intention to appeal, the energy company's chief executive Mike Fuge said the Southland wind farm would be "crucial" for New Zealand's energy security.</p>
        
            <p>"The panel's decision is flawed, with significant legal errors identified," Fuge said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will lodge an appeal with the High Court, outlining the specific areas of law where the decision is incorrect.</p>
        
            <p>"Natural gas supplies from offshore fields continue to decline faster than expected, and demand for electricity is growing," he continued.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a pressing long-term need to increase electricity supply."</p>
        
            <p>Contact noted the Department of Conservation, Ngāi Tahu, and local and regional councils approved of the conditions Contact put forward for the project.</p>
        
            <p>Fuge said it was Contact's view that there was a "real need" for the Southland wind farm.</p>
        
            <p>"This has guided our decision to re-apply for consent under the updated Fast-Track Approvals Act 2024," he said.</p>
