            <p>Two long-running Wellington restaurants will be closing this month.</p>
        
            <p>Vietnamese restaurant Mekong Cafe on Vivian Street - known as Wellington's original noodle house - will shut after 35 years while Daisy's will be leaving Tinakori Road after eight years.</p>
        
            <p>Daisy's owners say it has been challenging ever since the first Covid lockdown five years ago and it had taken a toll on them.</p>
        
            <p>It had been "a hell of a ride", however, they felt it was the right time to step away this year with their lease coming to an end.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been proud to have celebrated amazing growers, suppliers and producers over the years, as well as a bunch of incredibly talented team members, all while representing our little corner of this city.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been a privilege to be part of so many people's special occasions, as much as it has been to be a casual place to drop in for locals, we thank you so much for your support."</p>
        
            <p>The owners of Mekong said in a social media post they were grateful to all their customers.</p>
        
            <p>"The connections are so much more than the business itself. We will say goodbye for now."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's eating and drinking scene has significantly changed over the past few years, with many high-end eateries and well known establishments forced to shut their doors.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>The shift to working from home during the pandemic has decreased foot traffic in the city, at a time when restaurateurs have been grappling with rising rates and rent.</p>
        
            <p>Increased construction work in the central city has also been cited as a factor.</p>
