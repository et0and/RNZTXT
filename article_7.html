            <p>Property investors looking for a way to spread the risk on their portfolio may be turning in increasing numbers to short-term rentals, one investor group suggests.</p>
        
            <p>Data from analytics firm AirDNA shows travelling New Zealanders are returning to the site, post-Covid.</p>
        
            <p>There were 73,513 properties listed on the site in 2024, just down on the 77,457 of 2019. In the intervening years, the number had dropped as low as 56,000.</p>
        
            <p>The average daily rate being charged in December was $290.47, up from $195.74 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>There is some variation across the country - AirDNA said Auckland only had occupancy of 55.7 percent across its 7954 properties available in December. Occupancy had been as high as 75 percent previously.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch had occupancy of 65.7 percent across is 2989 properties, and Wellington 59.3 percent across 3495.</p>
        
            <p>But Auckland was commanding the highest daily rate at an average of just more than $290.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Property Investors Association general manager Sarina Gibbon said it had been notable in recent times that more of her members were considering buying properties to rent on Airbnb.</p>
        
            <p>"There are fewer obligations on landlords... I'm seeing it especially from established landlords with reasonably sized portfolios who see this as a high-cashflow higher-risk game with the trade-off of less obligation to the tenant."</p>
        
            <p>She said the market seemed to be dominated by professional property managers who specialised in short-term rentals, so it would not necessarily mean more work for the property owners.</p>
        
            <p>But they might need to prepare for more vacancies, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Ed McKnight, an economist at Opes Partners, said the yield on an Airbnb property could be up to 10 percent or even slightly more, compared to a typical rental yield of 3.9 percent nation-wide in the residential market, according to Corelogic.</p>
        
            <p>He compared annual revenue from Airbnb from AirDNA data to the average Corelogic house value.</p>
        
            <p>He said people thinking about buying a property to Airbnb might assume they should focus on areas like Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>But it was not generating the highest yield.</p>
        
            <p>"The average Airbnb income appear to be around $130,000 a year. The average property in Queenstown costs just over $1.6 million, which implies a 7.96 percent gross yield.</p>
        
            <p>"But it appears that MacKenzie District might have overlooked opportunities. The average Airbnb income is $74,700 against an average house value of $692,710. That implies a gross yield of 10.78 percent."</p>
        
            <p>He said Westland was second place to Mackenzie when it came to Airbnb yield, with annual revenue of $47,900 and an average house price of $457,692.</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu was third and Rotorua fourth.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the table were places like Western Bay of Plenty and Upper Hutt, with yields of less than 3.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps properties in Waimakariri and Upper Hutt tend to be made available for only part of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was well down the list, too, with a yield of just under 4.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>McKnight said that could be in part due to the type of property that was being let.</p>
        
            <p>"The average property value in Auckland is high. But, the average Airbnb might be an inner city apartment, that is cheaper. So the average property in a city is often not the average Airbnb in a city.</p>
        
            <p>"The yield values are more an indication of where to spot opportunities first, rather than a definitive 'invest here, don't invest there'."</p>
        
            <p>AirDNA director of economics Bram Gallagher said demand had built again after the Covid slump but it was expected that March would bring a seasonal decline before the school holidays helped a recovery in April.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had been a clear trend of people moving to booking larger houses, particularly for holidays with family groups.</p>
        
            <p>Covid had prompted a significant drop in the popularity of shared houses or shared rooms.</p>
