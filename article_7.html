            <p>The country's top executives are cautiously optimistic about a turnaround in the economy, although the global outlook remains a particular concern.</p>
        
            <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) annual chief executive survey found 59 percent expected the domestic economy to grow over the coming year, a slight improvement from last year.</p>
        
            <p>Just under 40 percent were "very or extremely confident" about their company's revenue prospects.</p>
        
            <p>PwC New Zealand chief executive Andrew Holmes said global economic factors were the biggest worry, followed by cyber risks and technological disruption.</p>
        
            <p>"If you think about things well outside of New Zealand's control, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, that does have a global impact on the global economy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The recent announcements or flagging of tariffs globally - that certainly does have an impact on the global economy."</p>
        
            <p>Holmes said the potential impact of tariffs on New Zealand was yet to be determined.</p>
        
            <p>But on a more positive note, the report showed concerns about inflation had eased.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pleasing to see that's come off, so I think that provides confidence that we're at a reasonable level, and we got our settings right," Holmes said.</p>
        
            <p>He said low inflation provided a "platform for growth".</p>
        
            <p>PwC said almost a quarter of New Zealand CEOs believed if their companies continued on their current trajectory, they may not remain economically viable within the next decade.</p>
        
            <p>The concern was more pronounced in the Asia Pacific, with 45 percent expressing similar worries.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel it's a massive opportunity, actually. As we enter a more tech-enabled world, New Zealand's distance becomes less of an inhibitor," Holmes said.</p>
        
            <p>On climate action, more than three-quarters of CEOs had initiated climate-related investments, which was lower than Asia-Pacific counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>Cost appeared to be a common challenge, with New Zealand CEOs reporting increased costs related to climate investments more frequently than their counterparts across the world.</p>
        
            <p>Artificial intelligence featured heavily in the report, with most CEOs having some form of trust in having AI embedded into key processes in their companies.</p>
        
            <p>The PwC report canvassed the views from 4710 CEOs across 109 countries and territories from 1 October through to 8 November, with 101 New Zealand CEOs taking part.</p>
