            <p>Widespread public sector layoffs have seen job applications more than double in March and April this year compared to 2023, a recruitment agency says.</p>
        
            <p>International recruitment firm Robert Walters' data showed a 112 percent increase in applications for jobs it is recruiting for compared to the same time last year - and a 179 percent jump in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>That was because there were not enough jobs to go around in the capital and people were having to seek work elsewhere, its Wellington senior director Bridget Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>The company's Australian offices had also seen a "substantial surge" in applications from New Zealanders intending to cross the ditch or work remotely.</p>
        
            <p>"If the trend of job cuts persists, we may face a future where there is a severe shortage of skilled workers to fill public sector roles in Wellington," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is undoubtedly a disconcerting prospect."</p>
        
            <p>Robert Walters could not say how many applications it received in March and April, as it is confidential information.</p>

            <p>RNZ understands proposed job cuts at ACC and Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency will be announced on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>More than 4000 jobs have been slashed so far across the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis directed ministries and agencies to reduce expenditure by either 6.5 percent or 7.5 percent to help reduce annual public service spending by $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>But cuts are also being made beyond the core public sector, at Crown entities such as WorkSafe and Callaghan Innovation, and Crown research institute NIWA, for example.</p>
