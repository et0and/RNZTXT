            <p>Amazon is to axe hundreds of staff across its subsidiaries Twitch, Prime Video and MGM studios.</p>
        
            <p>More than 500 Twitch employees - a third of the streamer's workforce - will be laid off, according to a note from chief executive Dan Clancy.</p>
        
            <p>Amazon said several hundred employees at Prime Video and film studio MGM will also lose their jobs this week.</p>
        
            <p>The tech giant laid off more than 27,000 staff members in 2023 despite bumper profits.</p>
        
            <p>Twitch was initially set up for gamers to watch and share video gameplay online. It was bought by Amazon in 2014 for US$970m (NZ$1.56b).</p>
        
            <p>In an email to employees, Clancy said he was taking the "painful step to reduce our headcount" to "build a more sustainable business".</p>
        
            <p>He added that the company paid out US$1bn (NZ$1.6b) to streamers in 2023, but had "conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Amazon made US$9.9b (NZ$15.9b) profit in July to September, according to its most recent earnings report. That was up from US$2.9b (NZ$4.6b) in the same period in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In an email sent to staff at Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, senior vice president of the department Mike Hopkins wrote: "We've identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investments and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact."</p>
        
            <p>Hopkins added that it was a "difficult decision to make".</p>
        
            <p>The email indicated that job losses affect staff in the US and around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Amazon bought the hundred-year-old MGM Studios for $8.45bn in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In December, it announced it would start putting adverts on Prime Video from 5 February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The reductions at Amazon are the latest in a long series of job cuts in the tech sector, which had expanded rapidly as people increasingly turned to digital services during the pandemic, before contracting as that enthusiasm waned.</p>
        
            <p>According to US career consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the tech sector cut 168,032 jobs in 2023 - up 73 percent compared to 2022.</p>
