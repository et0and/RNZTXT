            <p>Households and businesses are being advised to keep a close eye on costs until the middle of next year, when economic conditions are expected to improve.</p>
        
            <p>'It's probably another 12 months before it will feel like the worst of the downturn is behind us," Infometrics chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan said.</p>
        
            <p>He said households and businesses were likely to see lower interest rates, less contractionary fiscal policy and an improving world economy between mid-2025 and 2027, with annual economic growth returning to 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>But until then, Kiernan said economic pressures would continue to suck more money out of household budgets, while recent job losses would undermine income security.</p>
        
            <p>Record high net migration made per-capita results look even worse, with household spending recording its biggest decline per person since 1992, excluding the 2020 lockdown, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Kiernan said migration numbers should ease following recent government policy changes, though the number of New Zealand-citizen departures settling at a higher level - attracted by a perception of better opportunities in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"The economy is being hit harder than expected a few months ago, with hopes of a soft landing disappearing in a flurry of housing market stress and rising unemployment," Kiernan said.</p>
        
            <p>"The resilience displayed by households during much of 2023 has been sorely tested by mortgage rates of over 7 percent and there is little sign from the Reserve Bank of any relief this year."</p>
        
            <p>Infometrics forecast annual inflation to drop below 3 percent by early 2025, which would give the Reserve Bank confidence to begin cutting the official cash rate in November from 5.5 percent to a neutral rate of 4 percent by the end of 2025.</p>
