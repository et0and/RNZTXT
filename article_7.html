            <p>A woman who lost $200,000 in an investment in a growth fund has been given $80,000 compensation because her financial adviser did not have the records to prove it was what she had asked for.</p>
        
            <p>The woman's case was heard by Financial Services Complaints Ltd, a disputes resolution scheme that deals with complaints that cannot be resolved between financial services providers and their customers directly.</p>
        
            <p>It said she had $900,000 to invest and went to a financial adviser her brother used.</p>
        
            <p>She had never owned shares before but her brother had done well.</p>
        
            <p>In June 2021, she asked her adviser to invest $500,000 in growth funds. She invested 70 percent of the rest of the money in a growth fund and 30 percent in a more conservative fund.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2021, she asked her advisers to put the full $900,000 into growth funds. But markets were volatile and the value of the funds dropped. When she asked her adviser to get her out of the investments, she had lost $200,000.</p>
        
            <p>She complained she should not have had all her money in growth funds because these are more suited to long-term investment. She said that did not suit her because she had health issues and wanted $400,000 to be able to buy herself a home.</p>
        
            <p>She said her adviser had not talked to her about investing long-term.</p>
        
            <p>The adviser said they knew about her health issues but she had not told them she wanted to buy a house, or that her investing horizon was short term.</p>
        
            <p>They said her decision to invest fully in growth funds was contrary to their advice and was because she saw how well her brother had done.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said it was hard to establish the facts because the adviser did not keen adequate records of what the client said or what she was advised.</p>
        
            <p>"We found some evidence that the adviser knew, before they gave advice to [the client] that she had it in mind to buy property.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the instructions to invest in growth funds came from [the client], we also found some evidence that [her] instructions may have been prompted by some suggestions or pressure from the adviser. For example, we could see that, behind-the-scenes, the adviser was putting together information to show [her] how much she could make if she invested all her money in growth funds.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't clear that the adviser had included an assessment of risk in that information.</p>
        
            <p>"We also thought that, if [the client] had decided to invest in a way that was contrary to the adviser's advice, the adviser should have carefully documented it."</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said it worked with the woman and adviser to find an agreed settlement. The adviser paid $80,000, which was about put the client at about what she would have lost if she had invested all of her money in more conservative funds.</p>
        
            <p>FSCL said it was a reminder for financial advisers to be mindful of their record-keeping requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"Where a client has complained to FSCL but the adviser's record-keeping has been inadequate, FSCL may place more weight on the recollections of the client - whose finances and goals are being discussed - rather than the adviser - who frequently has similar discussions with a range of clients."</p>
