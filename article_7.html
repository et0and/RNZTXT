            <p>Fletcher Building has reported a full year loss of $227 million, with revenue little changed from the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The building company's underlying profit was at the low end of expectations at $509m but still down 35 percent on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the 12 months ended June compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>Acting chief executive Nick Traber said the result reflected slowing demand, inflation and competitive pressures.</p>
        
            <p>He said market volumes fell over the year, with New Zealand down 25 percent and Australia down 15 percent on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect the year ahead to remain challenging, with macro-economic pressures likely to persist through the year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point, we are planning for FY25 market volumes in our materials and distribution businesses to be 10 percent to 15 percent lower year-on-year compared to FY24, however we remain vigilant to further market weakness."</p>
        
            <p>He said the loss was primarily due to a $117m non-cash impairment and write-down in the carrying value of its Higgins business, and $180m in additional provisions required to complete legacy construction projects announced earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"After factoring in the Tradelink discontinued operations, we recorded a net loss after tax of $227m, compared to net earnings of $235 million in FY23."</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher's return on funds employed before significant items was 10 percent, compared with 17 percent the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Traber said the residential and development division was performing well with strong profit margins and a return on capital of 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"We think it is the right time to explore capital partnership options for residential and development, to invest in and drive the next phase of the business's success.</p>
        
            <p>"Consequently, we have engaged Jarden to explore options with both local and international investors."</p>
        
            <p>Traber said the company's subsidiary Iplex remained focused on resolving plumbing matters in Perth, with legal action pending.</p>
        
            <p>"Constructive negotiations continue and Iplex is intent on trying to reach an agreement in principle with the government and key parties in the near term," he said.</p>
