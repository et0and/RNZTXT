            <p>The auditor-general is urging the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to strengthen its monitoring of food importers following findings from a new report.</p>
        
            <p>The report, released today by the Auditor-General's Office, looked at how well the ministry monitored importers of high-risk food products, such as .rnz.co.nz/news/national/493002/another-tahini-recall-underway-due-to-salmonella-scare tahini, frozen berries, fresh cheese and fermented meat.</p>
        
            <p>Figures between June 2022 and July 2023 show that 39 people contracted Hepatitis A - half of whom were hospitalised - in cases attributed to consuming imported frozen berries.</p>
        
            <p>MPI figures showed that 27 out of 60 consumer-level recalls in 2022 were for imported food.</p>
        
            <p>The report found that MPI was not routinely checking food safety compliance by importers of high-risk foods.</p>
        
            <p>"In my view, the ministry does not have a clear understanding of the effectiveness of the food import system. This is because the ministry has not been consistently monitoring whether importers are assessing the safety and suitability of specified high-risk foods before they arrive in the country," Auditor-General John Ryan said in a media release.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry also does not collect all the information it needs to assess the effectiveness of the requirements for importing food."</p>
        
            <p>The auditor-general said more improvements were needed so that MPI could respond to a food import market that was subject to changing trends and risks.</p>
        
            <p>The report recommended MPI be more proactive in identifying non-compliance for companies importing high-risk foods, improve the education of importers around compliance, and regularly review the requirements for importing.</p>
        
            <p>It acknowledged that MPI was aware of some of the issues and had made improvements since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the ministry has also begun public consultation on two proposed levies - including a food importer levy to support increased monitoring.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety (NZFS) - a directorate under MPI - said it valued the report and welcomed its findings.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was consulting with food operators on changes that would secure funding to enable strengthening of the imported and domestic food system.</p>
        
            <p>"We broadly agree with the OAG's recommendations for more monitoring for non-compliance; more education and support for importers so they understand the requirements for importing food; and gathering of information required to keep rules fit for purpose and to effectively manage food safety risks.</p>
        
            <p>"Our current consultation with food business is focused on dealing with these issues and making improvements," NZFS deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>In early 2024, there were more than 3700 registered food importers across New Zealand, importing food from more than 200 countries.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, imported food in New Zealand was valued at $8.5 billion, and 7.4 percent of imported food by value were considered to present a higher risk to consumers.</p>
