            <p>Telecommunications companies are yet to get on top of problems with customer billing, with little change in the number of complaints from year to year.</p>
        
            <p>The Telecommunications Dispute Resolution (TDR) said it received 1925 complaints from consumers in the six months ended December 2023, which was four more than the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>This is addition to the 1770 complaints received in the first half of 2023 involving phone or internet issue.</p>
        
            <p>TDR board chairperson Barry Jordan said: "Complaint and dispute enquiry volumes are remaining consistently high - these levels seem to be the new normal.</p>
        
            <p>"In these last six months' alone TDR saw almost as many complaints as we did during the whole of 2020/21."</p>
        
            <p>Technology Users Association chief executive Craig Young said the industry was not doing enough to address the issues raised time and again by consumers.</p>
        
            <p>"Really disappointed that the numbers continue to stay as high as they are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The top three complaint categories involved billing (50.7 percent), customer service (15.6 percent), and faults (12.8 percent).</p>
        
            <p>The main related issues within each of the categories were disputed charges (36.2 percent), failure to action a request (9.3 percent) and delays with service restoration (6 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Jordan said it focused on an early resolution approach.</p>
        
            <p>"It continues to make a big difference with 97 percent of complaints being sorted in our first stage of our involvement."</p>
