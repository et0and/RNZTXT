        <h2>BNZ cuts rates for first-home buyers</h2>
        <p>
Rates for people with small deposits are now better than what was available to those with 20 percent earlier this year, a broker says.

            <p>BNZ will no longer charge first-home buyers and other low-equity borrowers a higher interest rate.</p>
        
            <p>The bank said on Tuesday that as well as cutting home loan rates - its one-year rate is now 6.55 percent - it was moving to a single set of home loan fixed interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, it offered "standard" and" "classic" rates - classic rates were available to people who had less than 20 percent equity in their properties. BNZ said the classic rate had interest rates that were 60 basis points higher.</p>
        
            <p>Now, borrowers with less than 20 percent equity will be able to access standard rates, although they will still be charged a low-equity premium.</p>
        
            <p>This premium ranges 150bps for borrowers with deposit of less than 5 percent through to 35bps with those between 15 percent and 20 percent.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ executive customer products and services Karna Luke said the changes would make a real difference.</p>
        
            <p>"The simpler home loan rates mean that all customers will be able to access our best home loan rates, even if they don't have 20 percent equity. For example, a first-home buyer borrowing $500,000 with a 15 percent deposit on a 30-year term would save $78 per fortnight based on the current one-year fixed rate advertised on the BNZ website. Over a one-year fixed term, this amounts to savings of more than $2000."</p>
        
            <p>The new pricing takes effect from Tuesday for new customers and existing customers when they refix.</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage broker Jeremy Andrews, from Key Mortgages, said the move made sense.</p>
        
            <p>"With rates dropping and house prices having come down, we're seeing renewed interest - with most clients now expecting sale prices to be rising in near future. As house prices increase, this further reduces the risk to the bank for low-deposit lending so why not encourage this by offering more competitive rates in line with several other lenders in the market?</p>
        
            <p>"Another anomaly of BNZ compared to other banks was if choosing the 'classic rate' over 'standard rates' there were more penalties for increasing your repayments during a fixed term. All banks have slightly different options on this but it's great to see BNZ offering more flexibility here - BNZ's standard rates allow you to make up to 5 percent extra principle repayments per annum from the refix date, via either lump payments and/or increasing repayments."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were more options now for people with small deposits.</p>
        
            <p>"This change from BNZ helps affordability here too - in many first-home buyer scenarios now with 5 percent to 10 percent deposit, we are now negotiating even sharper interest rates than compared to those buying early this year with the typical sweet spot of 20 percent."</p>
        
            <p>He said the "classic" rates offered Fly Buys but that was not much of an incentive when the rates were higher.</p>
