        <h2>ASB bounces back with net profit rising to $763m</h2>
        <p>
The bank's profit dip last year proved to be temporary as borrowing demand increased, and it paid less for deposits.

            <p>The country's number three bank has come through the recession with an increased half-year profit on improved lending and margins.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended December 2024 compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>The bank's profit dip last year proved to be temporary as borrowing demand increased, and it paid less for deposits which improved its income and margins.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Vittoria Shortt said the result was a reflection of the improving broad economy, which had been in recession for part of the second half of last year.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has been through the most difficult economic cycle in a generation, and we need to be patient with what looks like a gradual recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"With lower interest rates and inflation providing some relief, and export incomes looking up for a number of sectors, our focus remains on supporting customers and providing capital for the next phase of economic growth."</p>
        
            <p>Overall lending rose 4 percent to $112 billion, with housing loans up 5 percent, and rural and business lending up 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Shortt expected households to gain from lower rates as they refixed mortgages through the year.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 45 percent of our fixed home loan customers are expected to roll onto a lower rate by the end of June, and 70 percent by Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Banks have been competing for market share in the housing market, with ASB cutting its rates three times in a month, reflecting the fall and expectation of more falls in wholesale rates.</p>
        
            <p>ASB's cost of doing business, however, rose as it spent more on upgrading systems for open banking and strengthening its defences against scams.</p>
        
            <p>"Our open banking infrastructure is in place and to encourage early-stage uptake we're providing it free to third-party providers for the first 12 months," Shortt said.</p>
        
            <p>Legislation to protect consumer data in open banking is currently going through Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was 16 percent rise in scams and fraud, but customer losses had been reduced with $29 million of suspicious transactions stopped and more than 100 fake ASB websites taken down.</p>
