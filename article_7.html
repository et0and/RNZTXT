            <p>ASB is the latest major lender to cut its mortgage rates as banks respond to falling short-term wholesale interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>The bank is cutting its 6-month, 1-year and 18-month rates by 20 basis points each, with the 1-year term at a market leading rate of 5.59 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It came after Westpac cut its 6-month rate on Thursday to 5.99 percent, with both banks matching the BNZ's move from late last year - which came after the Reserve Bank's 50 basis point official cash rate (OCR) cut in November.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to help customers looking to refix, or Kiwi looking to buy, get off to a strong start in 2025. Today's rate changes reflect the recent fall in short-term wholesale rates," ASB general manager product, Emma-Jayne Liddy said.</p>
        
            <p>"With more than two-thirds of our mortgage customers opting for a term of 18-months or less, we expect these changes to be popular."</p>
        
            <p>Financial markets forecast the Reserve Bank to cut the OCR by a further 50 basis points next month, from the current rate of 4.25 percent.</p>
