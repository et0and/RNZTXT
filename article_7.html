            <p>Rental prices have fallen for the first time since 2022, figures from Trade Me show .</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me's latest Rental Price Index revealed a slight decrease in rents, with the national median dropping $5 month-on-month to $645 a week.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me's property sales director Gavin Lloyd said it was the first monthly fall since September 2022.</p>
        
            <p>And he said rents may yet fall further.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that with the number of Kiwis leaving the country, there is less demand for rentals, particularly among young professionals.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, we might see further drops in rental prices as we move further into the winter months, especially given that the latest inflation figures are falling faster than expected."</p>
        
            <p>However, rents in Northland, Auckland and Wellington were unchanged, with Auckland once again the most expensive region with a median price of $690.</p>
