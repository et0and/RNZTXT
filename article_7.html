            <p>Casino operator SkyCity Entertainment has warned shareholders of a $94.3 million writedown on its Adelaide casino.</p>
        
            <p>The company said the non-cash charge reflected the costs of the move to electronic gambling cards.</p>
        
            <p>It said it had updated cost assumptions about making it mandatory for all players to use e-cards, rather than cash, at its Adelaide casino in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Another driver behind the writedown was the additional legal and compliance costs that came with host responsibility programmes for staff.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity said it was committed to implementing mandatory e-cards across all casinos to better monitor customer play and manage risk.</p>
        
            <p>It also expected to record a one-off tax charge of $129.6m in its financial statements for the year ended June.</p>
        
            <p>This comes after the government removed the ability to depreciate commercial buildings.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity said the charges would not impact underlying earnings or profit for the financial year ended June.</p>
        
            <p>It will report its earnings on 22 August.</p>
