            <p>New Zealand's game development industry is growing more than 10 times faster than the global average, and on track to reach $1 billion annual export revenue in the next few years, an industry report says.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Game Developers Association (NZGDA) inaugural report indicates the game development sector grew 26 percent on the year earlier, which exceeded the global forecast of 2.1 percent growth.</p>
        
            <p>"Our sector continues to be one of New Zealand's most promising industries, driving the country's economic recovery through the exceptional talent of our developers," NZGDA executive director Joy Keene said.</p>
        
            <p>NZGDA chair Carl Leducq said government support played a critical role in the support of the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"With the right investments and policy support, we're on track to push toward $1 billion in annual export revenue in the coming years," he said.</p>
