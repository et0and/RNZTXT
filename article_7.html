            <p>Low and stable inflation is in sight, but interest rates will need to be managed to dampen the last pockets of high price pressures, the Reserve Bank governor says.</p>
        
            <p>In a speech to a US think tank in Washington on Thursday morning, Orr ran through the central bank's response to the Covid outbreak and how it affected monetary policy.</p>
        
            <p>The pandemic required extraordinary measures, which stoked inflation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Orr said risks remained and there was still much uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>But as inflation pressures and expectations stabilised interest rates would continue to be lowered, which would lift the economy, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The consumer price index hit a 3.5 year low earlier this month.</p>
