            <p>The housing market is slowly gaining momentum, with new figures showing average property values have increased by more than 2 percent over the past three months.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic's national House Price Index (HPI) shows a 1 percent rise in property values in December, on top of 0.7 percent gain in November and a 0.4 percent increase in October.</p>
        
            <p>The increased momentum was due to interest rates peaking, a supportive labour market and a change in sentiment following the election, CoreLogic NZ chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>December's increase was the strongest monthly gain in almost two years, since January 2022, bringing the average house value to $924,489.</p>
        
            <p>"While pressures are turning around, there are still restraints as well, we have still got stretched affordability, there's still high mortgage rates even despite some of the small falls.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it is going to be a straight line or a hugely strong recovery. I think 2024 could still be a little bit subdued but for now, there is that upward momentum."</p>
        
            <p>The gains were widespread across the main centres, with Tauranga, Auckland, and Christchurch all registering increases of more than 1 percent in December.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown was the one region that bucked the trend as it defied the downturn, with values now almost 6 percent higher than a year ago, and average prices sitting at a new peak of about $1.77 million.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been the most resilient of the well-known areas and there is just still strong demand there from wealthy buyers, whether that is local or out of town, and also with tourism coming back - seeing that strong desire for people to live and work there, which puts pressure on the housing stock."</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, Gisborne showed a 2.5 percent monthly fall despite a 0.4 percent rise since September, with Napier also down in December.</p>
        
            <p>"There are always certain markets from month to month that see small falls even amongst a rising trend so there is no real surprises there, the general momentum is certainly up."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said 2024 was likely to be "a bit patchy" with an underwhelming upturn compared to what had been seen in the past.</p>
        
            <p>While property prices had fallen from the peak, he said house prices were still about 25 percent more expensive than they had been pre-Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"Affordability is still a challenge, especially with mortgage rates where they are, even despite those small falls, it is still challenging for people."</p>
        
            <p>National property values remain 3.3 percent below this time last year, and 11.4 percent lower than the peak from two years ago.</p>
