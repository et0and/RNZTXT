        <h2>Café brewing second chances</h2>
        <p>
Trade School Kitchen opened in August 2018, with the intention of supporting women who had undergone barista training whilst in Arohata Prison upon their release.
</p>
        
            <p>In a world where second chances can be hard to come by, a café in Lower Hutt is offering hope, opportunity and a fresh start to those in need.</p>
        
            <p>Nic and Hannah Drew-Crawshaw run Trade School Kitchen right in the heart of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>Trade School Industries - the charitable trust behind Trade School Kitchen - was set up by Matt Lamason and Lauren Tennent with the aim of creating employment opportunities for people who had been in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Lamason and Tennent, and later Trade School Industries, had run 10 eight-week barista training courses at Arohata Prison every year between 2013 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The café opened in August 2018, with the intention of supporting women who had undergone the training whilst in Arohata Prison upon their release.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea, initially, was to make sure that people who had been in prison or in the criminal justice system in another way had a landing place where they could come and have a first really positive work experience... and then, as they sort of grew in confidence and proved themselves, that would give them the freedom to go and seek work in other places," Nic Drew-Crawshaw told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Drew-Crawshaw took over in September 2019, and since then, had expanded it to include anyone engaged in the justice system, as well as people struggling with their mental well-being, untrained or unemployed youth.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, Trade School Industries started a barista training course for participants in Youth Inspire's 'Licence to Work' programme too.</p>

            <p>"People who have got caught up in the prison system are just like other people," Drew-Crawshaw said.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't wake up in the morning and want to be bad people; they wake up and want to be good people, and they want to make a good contribution. And so, what we're about is trying to support people to make their best contribution."</p>
        
            <p>A former employee, who did not want to be named, said she had been told about the course by her probation officer.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw it as a chance to do something productive, so I jumped at the opportunity and gave it my best effort to learn as much as I could," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Trade School Kitchen later offered her a full-time position as a café assistant.</p>
        
            <p>"They looked beyond my convictions and gave me a chance, which is something rare, and I'm very grateful for that.</p>
        
            <p>"My past doesn't define me, but it does show a hard time in my life, and not many people are willing to see past that.</p>
        
            <p>"To show my gratitude, I worked hard, took every opportunity to learn, and over time, I was able to share what I had learned with new staff who joined the café.</p>
        
            <p>"The job, Trade School Kitchen gave me, helped break down barriers to employment and led me to other opportunities I may not have had without their support."</p>
        
            <p>In December 2021, the contract Trade School Kitchen had with Arohata Prison ended, and the course later ceased in February 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The former employee said it was "unfortunate".</p>
        
            <p>"It was a stepping stone for people like me who had few options and provided an opportunity for learning and potential employment.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people do not realise the importance of not only being given a second chance, but the impact it can have on someone's life, helping them rebuild confidence, regain purpose and open doors to opportunities that would otherwise remain closed."</p>

            <p>Arohata Prison general manager Jacky Howcutt told RNZ it had engaged with Trade School Kitchen about a proposal to resume the course.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said it was not feasible due to the cost as well as low demand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's critical that we make considered choices about what rehabilitation and reintegration support will achieve the best possible results to reduce re-offending, and reflects the current needs of the prison population," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Towards the end of the contract, there was low demand for the programme due to a smaller number of women in Arohata Prison meeting the requirements of the programme, and a smaller number of women in the community living close enough to the shop to complete the programme, alongside showing interest in becoming a barista.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate this was disappointing for Trade School Kitchen and acknowledge the time and commitment they put in during their contract with us."</p>

            <p>Sam, who did not wish to share his last name, had worked at Trade School Kitchen since the beginning of 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He began washing dishes before becoming a chef at the café. "They don't want me to do coffee yet," he laughed.</p>
        
            <p>Sam had been in prison in both Australia and New Zealand before coming to work at Trade School Kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the culture I came from," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Got over there, got in trouble, came back here, got in trouble a little more."</p>
        
            <p>Sam said he had since fallen in love with hospitality, and while he had a passion for making food, he said his favourite part was making the customers smile.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me feel happy... I feel proud that I do great work for them."</p>

            <p>Trade School Kitchen manager Kirk Hodgson had moved to Lower Hutt to work at the café.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole mission and importance of what we do is real central for me," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The mission is why I do it.</p>
        
            <p>"... I wouldn't be doing hospo still if it wasn't for the mission."</p>

            <p>Hodgson began working at Trade School Kitchen in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>"The people I've got to work with have really impacted me and hopefully, in turn, [I have] been able to impact others.</p>
        
            <p>"I think as much as, hopefully, I've been able to help anyone else, they've certainly helped me to grow.</p>
        
            <p>"Watching people sort of flourish with work and opportunities, and dignity and encouragement, that's [what] makes me keep coming back each day."</p>
