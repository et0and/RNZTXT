            <p>The closure of a Tauranga supermarket is concerning locals who say it will particularly impact elderly in their community.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths New Zealand is planning to close the Greerton store in the village centre sometime in mid-November.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson told RNZ the Greerton store has served customers well for many years, but locals shopping preferences had changed.</p>
        
            <p>"As we look to the future, with our current lease term expiring in December, we believe it makes sense to consolidate our customer offer in the area."</p>
        
            <p>However, on the streets of Greerton, locals spoken to by RNZ said it will be a big loss.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very surprised it is happening, because there isn't going to be anything for the older people who don't have cars, like me," said one older resident.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths New Zealand said it had recently upgraded the nearby Fraser Cove store.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking forward to continuing to serve our local customers there and at our other stores in the area."</p>
        
            <p>However, the older resident said that a lot of people go to the store on their mobility scooters as they do not drive.</p>
        
            <p>"Where are they going to go?" she asked.</p>
        
            <p>The Fraser Cove store is around three kilometres away from Greerton. A bus service does run between the two locations, but it would be an approximate 45-minute walk one-way for those without a private vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Grey Power Tauranga and Western Bay of Plenty president Jennifer Custins said people moved to Greerton specifically because they would be near to services. She got upset by businesses assuming people can just hop online if they lose a local service.</p>
        
            <p>"I've already read a comment that people should just be able to do online shopping," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said for many people, going to the shops is not just about the purchases.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people don't seem to realise that to go out and somebody goes 'oh hello' - it has a physical as well as emotional effect, a positive effect on people - because they've sort of been recognised, affirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"That, you know, has far reaching effects and they've been taken away. It's devastating really for people in Greerton," Custins said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ spoke to another local shopper who agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of people that depend on this. Why are they even doing that?" she said.</p>
        
            <p>She also pointed out that some people do not have cars, or travel by mobility scooter and other options are too far away.</p>
