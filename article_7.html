            <p>The number of properties listed for sale in December was the lowest since Realestate.co.nz data began.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Vanessa Williams said although December was usually a slower month, the end to 2024 was "exceptionally lukewarm".</p>
        
            <p>The national average asking price was the lowest since April 2021, at $842,476.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said, historically, December listings numbers were about 30 percent lower than November but that had grown to 50 percent in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, it was a drop of 60 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The property market always cools in December, but the end of 2024 was record-breakingly quiet."</p>

Listings in Auckland during December were even lower than during the pandemic.

            <p>She real estate salespeople had told her that everyone had ended the year tired and many had opted to push new listings into the new year.</p>
        
            <p>"Ten days into January we're already off to a good start with a hive of activity. It's typical if we have a really slow end of November, December."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland recorded an all-time low for new listings in any month over the last 17 years, including during Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>The number of properties for sale was down 13.3 percent month-on-month. That meant the number for buyers to choose from dropped below 30,000 for the first time since August 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But compared to a year earlier, the number of homes for sale was up 18.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said having more than 29,000 homes for sale still gave people a lot of options to choose from and that was likely to stop prices rising for the menatime.</p>
        
            <p>Prices had been roughly stable for two years, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I still think there are a few people to come to market who have suppressed their desire to transact."</p>
        
            <p>Eleven of the 19 regions the site tracks recorded an average price drop year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest were in Central Otago, down 17.3 percent to $1.325 million, the central North Island, down 11 percent to $708,350 and Bay of Plenty down 10.9 percent to $823,926.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, Southland bucked the trend with a 15.3 percent year-on-year increase to $549,211 - a record-high for December.</p>
