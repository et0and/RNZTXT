            <p>TVNZ argues it did not breach its collective agreement when it cancelled several programmes earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the broadcaster appeared in the Employment Court in Auckland to appeal a ruling by the Employment Relations Authority that it failed to consult with staff before announcing redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>Union E tū said a clause in its contract with TVNZ specified employees needed to be involved in workplace changing decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"[Our interpretation is that] when there is an issue that's going to require workplace change the parties sit together to find a solution which is then put to TVNZ management," E tū lawyer Simon Mitchell KC said.</p>
        
            <p>"[They] attempt to reach agreement and make recommendations - not decision-making but recommendations - that TVNZ is required to take as far as possible."</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ lawyer Paul Wicks KC said the broadcaster's dire financial situation required labour savings of $10 million.</p>
        
            <p>"Financial results signalled to TVNZ that it needed to consider redundancies and other cost saving measures," Wicks said.</p>
        
            <p>"TVNZ's total cost exceeded revenue in the 2023 financial year, and projections were worse for 2024."</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, TVNZ leadership were told that the company needed to find $10m in labour savings.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said it was unfair staff were not made aware of the job cuts until March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"What is very clear is that rather than sit down with staff and make that information known... TVNZ at that point went behind closed doors, shut the union out of the process... until staff were advised of the proposals on the 8th of March."</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
