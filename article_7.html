The fund has significantly outperformed one of its benchmarks, 90-day Treasury Bills, a measure of the cost to the government of paying into the fund.

            <p>The Superannuation Fund has turned 20 and is claiming the country is $40 billion better off as a result.</p>
        
            <p>It was set up in 2003 by then finance minister Michael Cullen as a way of funding future costs of providing pensions to a growing number of ageing New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>In that time it has become one of the best performing sovereign wealth funds in the world, with a long term perspective on investment, riding out the highs and lows of markets, and broadening its scope to beyond stocks and bonds to include large infrastructure projects.</p>
        
            <p>Outgoing chief executive Matt Whineray said it has done its job well.</p>
        
            <p>"As a long-term, growth-focused investor, many of our targets and performance expectations are based on 20-year rolling averages, so we've always looked forward to being able to report against that yardstick."</p>
        
            <p>It has significantly outperformed one of its benchmarks, 90-day Treasury Bills, a measure of the cost to the government of paying into the fund.</p>
        
            <p>The fund returned 9.5 percent a year on average, compared to the Treasury Bills' 3.42 percent, and now stood at $64.4b.</p>
        
            <p>"Since 2003, actual fund returns have outperformed the Treasury Bill benchmark by an annual average of 6.11 percent - in dollar terms, Aotearoa is more than $40b better off as a result of the fund."</p>
        
            <p>Government contributions, which were suspended between 2009 and 2017 because of the Canterbury earthquakes and the global financial crisis, were worth about $15.7b, but Whineray said the fund would have been billions of dollars larger had they been paid over the full 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>He said the fund was essentially inter-generation wealth transfer, and would start paying some of the national superannuation costs from the mid-2030s, but the peak would be in the 2050s and as it paid out it would still be earning from investments.</p>
        
            <p>The fund has matured in its investing approach with about half the assets managed in-house and the rest with external managers, while it has expanded its investment scope to encompass ethical investing and to look at long-term infrastructure projects.</p>
