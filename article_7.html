        <p>
The number of vessels calling in to the northern city is going from zero last year to four next season - and possibly as many as 30 by 2044. Audio

            <p>Whangārei is hoping to cash in on the cruise ship boom with the number of vessels calling in to the northern city going from zero last year to four next season - and possibly as many as 30 by 2044.</p>
        
            <p>Cruise ship spending in the city is expected to be just under $1 million in the upcoming season, with more than 3000 passengers and crew due ashore.</p>
        
            <p>That number could rise to 45,000 by 2044, according to an economic impact report prepared for the Whangārei District Council.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei mayor Vince Cocurullo told Midday Report the city had been seen in the past as a mere stop-off.</p>
        
            <p>"Now it's actually a destination point for people. They can see the Hundertwasser Art Centre, they can see the arts and cultural environment, and Whangārei's always had a really big emphasis on tourism and trying to get people in to see how the district runs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo said three ships visited in the inaugural season earlier this year, with four more scheduled in early 2025.</p>

            <p>He said the ships berthed at Northport, the country's largest natural deepwater seaport, about 35km from Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>From there passengers were bussed to Whangārei city or taken on excursions around the district, with some making their own way north to the Bay of Islands and reboarding the ship there.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo said the first cruise ship visits early this year went "really, really well".</p>
        
            <p>The economic impact report found they brought $420,000 into the district from passenger spending and ship restocking.</p>
        
            <p>That was expected to more than double this coming season.</p>
        
            <p>"You're looking at roughly 1500 people per ship, so even if each person spends $30 - and normally they don't, they usually spend $100-150 each - that's a huge boost to the economy."</p>
        
            <p>The report predicted the number of ships would increase to 30 by 2044.</p>
        
            <p>Even then, however, Whangārei's cruise ship industry will pale next to the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2023-24 season, 92 cruise ships anchored in the Bay of Islands, carrying a total of 158,000 passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Those numbers are expected to dip to 70 ships and 130,000 passengers, bringing in around $20 million, in the 2024-25 season.</p>
        
            <p>The Hundertwasser Arts Centre, which opened at Whangārei Town Basin in 2022, was cited as one of the reasons cruise ship companies finally agreed to add the city to their itineraries early this year.</p>
