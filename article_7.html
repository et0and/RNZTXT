            <p>Car dealer Turners has filled a gap in its after-sales product line-up with a deal to buy half of digital vehicle repair platform My Auto Shop.</p>
        
            <p>The value of the investment was not disclosed, but involved TradeMe and the My Auto Shop founders selling down part of their stakes, as well as a capital injection by Turners.</p>
        
            <p>"Vehicle servicing and repairs is a $3-billion business in NZ and has been a gap in the Turners offering," Turners chief executive Todd Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>"The investment was a great opportunity for Turners to broaden its relationship with customers."</p>
        
            <p>My Auto Shop was a vehicle repair platform with more than 300 Motor Trade Association-approved repairers as well as a mobile repair offering from a fleet of My Auto Shop-branded mobile mechanics.</p>
        
            <p>Hunter said My Auto Shop services would be offered to Turners' more than 200,000 customers across Turners Cars, Autosure Insurance and Oxford Finance.</p>
        
            <p>He said one part of the business connected customers to MTA repairers and the other was a fleet of Auto Shop-branded mobile mechanics, which would be expanded and operated by Turners.</p>
        
            <p>"We are into this as of today. We're executing our plan," Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>Turners chair Grant Baker said the investment fitted in with plans to consolidate and scale across the auto business sector.</p>
        
            <p>"My Auto Shop's vision of making vehicle repairs easier is already well established, the business has demonstrated it can deliver, and partnering with Turners will unlock substantial growth upside."</p>
        
            <p>My Auto Shop was founded in January 2020 by Andy Bowie, a former general manager of Uber and Uber Eats, and Richard Wafer, the former COO for My Food Bag.</p>
