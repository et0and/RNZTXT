            <p>The fintech sector has grown four times faster than the rest of the tech industry over the past decade, with further gains expected with the long-awaited introduction of open banking.</p>
        
            <p>The Technology Investment Network's second annual Fintech Report indicates the sector earned export revenues of $2.64 billion in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>More than half of the sector's 8857 staff were hired from overseas outpacing local recruitment by 3:1.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the rapid growth, the sector was yet to realise the gains offered by open banking, which had been held back by the lack of consumer data right legislation in New Zealand, despite being identified as a priority in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"The fintech sector will be relieved to see the Customer and Product Data Bill take its first legislative steps," report author Alex Dickson said.</p>
        
            <p>The bill to support consumer data rights was still winding its way through the parliamentary legislative process.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Andrew Bayly said open banking would improve productivity and competition.</p>
        
            <p>"Open banking represents a paradigm shift, unlocking the potential for personalised financial services tailored to individual needs," Bayly said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only will consumers benefit, but small and medium enterprises will gain access to new products and services that will increase productivity and enable them to grow their businesses."</p>
