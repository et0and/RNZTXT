            <p>ASB has closed its doors to many preapproval applications from mortgage advisers until next year.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as mortgage advisers complain that the time it is taking for their applications to be processed has blown out.</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage adviser Glen McLeod, from Edge Mortgages, said there were not enough staff to process broker applications.</p>
        
            <p>"The banks need to start increasing their number of personnel dealing with adviser work to ensure panel parity," he said.</p>
        
            <p>ASB said last week it would not accept preapprovals from mortgage advisers with clients who were not already ASB customers until 10 January next year.</p>
        
            <p>It told advisers this was about balancing its staff's leave, and growing its team's capacity to deal with incoming application volumes.</p>
        
            <p>Its overall aim was to improve its response times, ASB said.</p>
        
            <p>By 10 January it expected its turnaround times to be five to seven business days, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Advisers had complained that it could take as many as three weeks for an application to be dealt with by some banks at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>ASB told mortgage advisers it would continue to accept preapproval applications with loan-to-value ratios (LVRs) of up to 80 percent from existing bank customers.</p>
        
            <p>It was also open to applications from other borrowers who had good levels of equity and a "live deal" with a sale and purchase agreement conditional on finance.</p>
        
            <p>Banks generally take a tougher line with preapprovals because they can make it harder to manage the LVR restriction "speed limits".</p>
