            <p>Insurers have fully settled 87 percent of all private insurance claims from the Auckland Anniversary weekend and Cyclone Gabrielle weather events, with $2.7 billion paid out so far.</p>
        
            <p>The Insurance Council said the two events were separately the two largest insurance weather events in New Zealand's history.</p>
        
            <p>"Really good progress has been made on settling claims. Insurers are committed to finalising the remaining claims with their customers," council chief executive Tim Grafton said.</p>
        
            <p>Insurers have settled 99,798 of 115,353 claims, accounting for about 75 percent of the total value of damage, estimated at $3.6b.</p>
        
            <p>"We know some homeowners are waiting to settle until more is known about their local council voluntary buyout offer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message to homeowners is that your insurance claim needs to be completed before starting the property purchase process.</p>
        
            <p>"As people will not be financially advantaged or disadvantaged by waiting, we encourage people to continue to work with their insurer to finalise their claim."</p>
        
            <p>The number of claims settled by value included residential homes at 84 percent, contents 95 percent and motor vehicles 99 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, the council said business interruption claims were taking longer to settle, as payments were normally spread over time, with 75 percent by number and 57 percent by value.</p>
