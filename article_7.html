            <p>Batches of Woolworths branded fruit mince pies have been recalled because they may contain metal wire.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said some fine wire might have gone in the Summer Berry Mince Pies due to a manufacturing problem.</p>
        
            <p>"Two consumer complaints have been received but fortunately no injuries have occurred," Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>"As is our usual practice, NZFS will be working with Woolworths to understand how the contamination occurred and prevent its recurrence."</p>
        
            <p>The recall affects two batches of mince pies sold at Woolworths, Countdown, SuperValue and FreshChoice stores nationwide:</p>
        
            <p>The batches under recall have already been removed from store shelves and have not been exported.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who has bought any of these mince pies, should not eat them, NZFS said. They can be returned to the place of purchase for a refund.</p>
