        <h2>NZ could double its debt to build more, economist says</h2>
        <p>
New Zealand should not be afraid of borrowing and spending more to keep up with infrastructure needs, a senior economist says. Audio

            <p>New Zealand should not be afraid of borrowing and spending more money because the government books are one of the tidiest the world, a senior economist says.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr told Morning Report high net migration was great, but infrastructure was not keeping up.</p>
        
            <p>He could not say if booming migration might impact the Reserve Bank's calculations on inflation.</p>
        
            <p>"It looks like the benefit to the labour supply is outweighing the demand side impact."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was great that there were more workers, who were young and filling vacant roles, and that was "putting downward pressure on wages".</p>
        
            <p>"But we have seen rents rise, rents are up about 4.5 percent."</p>
        
            <p>That was a result of a shortage of dwellings, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a push-pull effect happening on inflation."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand had an average migration gain of 50,000 a year between 2013 and 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr said a lot more needed to be done to support the inflows of migrants.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought 40 [thousand] was a big number, here we are at 130 [thousand].</p>
        
            <p>"We're not keeping up. We're not maintaining the infrastructure that we have, and we're certainly not building infrastructure that we need for the popular growth that we've got."</p>

            <p>The government should give up its 30 percent debt limits, Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"These debt limits, this fear of taking on money to do what we need is not needed, it's unnecessary, it's unhelpful.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a government balance sheet which is very tidy, very strong - one of the strongest in the world."</p>
        
            <p>He said New Zealand was among 10 countries worldwide that had a AAA rating, and the UK and US were not part of it.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the ability to double our debt according to Standard and Poor's without getting a downgrade, so we can leverage up, we can get money at reasonable rates."</p>
        
            <p>It was wrong to blame the finances, instead, execution was the problem, he said.</p>
        
            <p>An independent infrastructure body could be a start, he said, with funding that had a long-term objective - "one that's not mucked around by election cycles".</p>
        
            <p>There also shouldn't be concerns about whether immigration would decline, Kerr said.</p>
        
            <p>"All it took was opening the borders and people came back in droves. If anything, New Zealand's brand has improved over Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"People want to come here. And you got to think about where they're coming from - Asia, China, the Philippines, India. This is a massive upgrade."</p>
        
            <p>Migrant arrivals and departures have hit record levels in the past year, but the monthly gain is slowing, latest figures show.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said there was a net gain of 5300 migrants in January - the lowest since October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The annual gain was nearly 134,000 compared to December's annual gain of 139,000.</p>
        
            <p>Australia was the main destination for New Zealanders leaving, which included significant numbers of Chinese, Indian and British citizens.</p>
        
            <p>The government has signalled aspects of its immigration policy are set for a reset and are actively under review.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, Infometrics principal economist Brad Olsen said the monthly drop in migrant numbers was more likely to be a plateau as opposed to the beginning of a sharp drop.</p>
        
            <p>Those arriving were being added to the workforce "but at the same time, those people also require services at a time when the economy is still stretched and inflation is still high".</p>
        
            <p>Olsen said the increased numbers were also adding to pressure on existing rental housing stock - particularly in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, ASB senior economist Mark Smith earlier said permanent and long-term immigration was expected to cool over the next few years as the slowing economy "reduces the attractiveness of New Zealand as a place to live and work".</p>
        
            <p>He said it was also likely that some newly arrived immigrants would leave in a year or two.</p>
