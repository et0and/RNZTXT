            <p>Buy-now-pay-later service Laybuy has been placed into receivership.</p>
        
            <p>Founder Gary Rohloff said the economic downturn had been more drawn-out than expected and had hurt the business.</p>
        
            <p>"I am absolutely heartbroken at today's decision to request the appointment of receivers to the Laybuy Group," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a devastating time for the Laybuy team, and I will be doing everything I can to support them as we go through this process."</p>
        
            <p>He said the business had been working "incredibly" hard to execute a plan to achieve profitability after years of rapid growth.</p>
        
            <p>"While we have been making good progress over the last two years, the economic downturn has been longer than we expected, and this had had a significant impact on the retail sector in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, we have see reduced consumer spending, higher credit losses, and increased fraudulent activity. This alongside increased financing costs created a perfect storm that was difficult to recover from."</p>
        
            <p>He said the business had tried "everything" including an attempted sale, but this had fallen over at the last hurdle.</p>
        
            <p>"This left the board with no option but to make the gut-wrenching decision to voluntarily request the appointment of Deloitte as receivers.</p>
        
            <p>This is a difficult time for our team and I am devastated."</p>
        
            <p>He said his priority was to work with receivers to ensure the best outcome for staff, creditors, suppliers and merchants</p>
        
            <p>Customers could continue to make their payments as normal.</p>
        
            <p>The company listed in the Australian stock exchange in 2020 and shares traded as high as A$2.30.</p>
        
            <p>But they had dropped to A0.6c before a decision was made last year to delist.</p>
