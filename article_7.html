            <p>Mobile network operators will be required to make it easier for consumers to compare coverage between providers, and to exit without penalty if they run into problems.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission's changes require providers to produce standard coverage maps so consumers can compare options, which must be easy to find on their websites.</p>
        
            <p>The maps must be accessible within two clicks from the providers home page.</p>
        
            <p>Telecommunications commissioner Tristan Gilbertson said too many consumers were not getting the coverage they expected.</p>
        
            <p>Mobile network operators were expected to work together to standardise their maps within 12 months, with regular progress reports.</p>
        
            <p>The maps would need to include coverage descriptors, such as excellent, good, fair and no coverage, as well as signal strength thresholds for each coverage level.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, each individual mobile provider would need to deliver what they promise.</p>
        
            <p>If not, consumers will be able to exit their contract with the provider.</p>
        
            <p>"One NZ and 2degrees already offer this in the form of a 'network guarantee' for their new customers and we'd like to see this offered across the board by all providers," Gilbertson said.</p>
        
            <p>"That will enable consumers to choose and switch more confidently, knowing they can leave without cost if the promised coverage isn't there."</p>
