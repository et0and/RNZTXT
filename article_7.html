            <p>Iconic Auckland retailer Smith and Caughey's is now considering a plan to downsize significantly, rather than closing the doors for good.</p>
        
            <p>The 144-year-old department store announced in May that it would permanently shut in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>But in a statement today, chairperson Tony Caughey said another option for the future of the business had been identified, and that was to scale back.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would mean closing the Broadway Newmarket store early in 2025 and making the Queen Street store smaller, with a focus on popular goods and online shopping.</p>
        
            <p>There would also be job cuts. The company currently employs about 240 staff.</p>
        
            <p>The business is consulting further with staff on the second option, with an outcome expected by the end of next week.</p>
