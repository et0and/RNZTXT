            <p>There has been a surge in flight bookings since many New Zealanders returned to work, Flight Centre says.</p>
        
            <p>Data from the travel retailer shows bookings are up 25 percent since last Monday compared to the prior week, and up 20 percent compared to the average week in December.</p>
        
            <p>Flight Centre New Zealand general manager Heidi Walker said it was typical at this time of the year to start dreaming of the next holiday.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming back to reality after time off with friends and family can be hard. A good way to get over this is to have another holiday to look forward to later in the year. We're seeing plenty of customers already take action by booking a trip with us," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"London is our most booked destination outside of New Zealand and Australia, with travellers often</p>
        
            <p>flying to London as a first stop before heading to Europe. While the UK and Europe are mostly popular for couples and solo travellers, Los Angeles has become a popular destination for families.</p>
        
            <p>"Closer to home, usual favourites such as Fiji and Rarotonga are also popular mid-year and especially so over the school holiday breaks."</p>
        
            <p>Some ticket prices were getting close to those pre-pandemic, she said.</p>
