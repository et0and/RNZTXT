            <p>Tourism providers in the Bay of Plenty are prepping for their busiest cruise season since the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Port of Tauranga expects 113 cruise ships to call into port this summer, the second-highest number since 2018, when 116 visited.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Bay of Plenty general manager Oscar Nathan said seeing increased numbers of tourists was good for the region.</p>
        
            <p>"Any time that you're getting that number of passengers visiting into the region and that option of visitation and spend, particularly from an international perspectiveâ€¦ it's great."</p>
        
            <p>He said their focus was on moving tourists around the region, making the most of free attractions and shopping.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan said the Covid-19 pandemic had increased resilience in the sector.</p>
        
            <p>"It put some resilience in the industry, and unfortunately there were operators that didn't make it through, like any business, any sector through Covid," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"With those that have and those that have subsequently had one season, I think the industry's very resilient actually."</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Business Chamber chief executive Matt Cowley said businesses were excited for the return of cruise ship passengers this year.</p>
        
            <p>"For some it means an incredible amount of their core business is back, especially since Covid. Last year our cruise season was a partial cruise season because it was the first since our borders opened up again, post-Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of excitement and anticipation."</p>

            <p>He expected businesses to be well-staffed over summer.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen an easing of that labour shortage. It is starting to balance out, and [university] students are coming back home to make the most of working in hospitality and helping these tourism operators as well."</p>
        
            <p>Cowley said having domestic and international tourists visiting over summer would benefit the local economy.</p>
        
            <p>"That really long summer provides a good balance with domestic tourists and international tourists. While they overlap, they kind of go for different activities so it provides a bit of balance across the economy."</p>
