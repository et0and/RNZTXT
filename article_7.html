            <p>The idea that wearing jandals while driving will mean you can't claim on insurance if you crash is a common misconception, the Insurance and Financial Services Ombudsman says.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Stevens said it was important that people checked their insurances were in order before summer, particularly if they were planning to travel.</p>
        
            <p>But she said the jandal myth was a common one.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people think that wearing jandals while driving will invalidate any insurance claim. But that's not necessarily the case - insurers will decline your claim if you've been driving recklessly, but not just because you're wearing jandals," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are, however, other tips we can categorically say will save you insurance pain."</p>
        
            <p>It was important that people checked their car was roadworthy, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you have a current warrant of fitness, issues like low tyre tread could invalidate your car insurance in the event of an accident. Give your car a thorough once-over or visit your mechanic for a pre-trip check."</p>
        
            <p>In one case the Insurance and Financial Services Ombudsman (IFSO) scheme dealt with, a man lost control of his Subaru in wet weather and crashed it.</p>
        
            <p>He made a claim and the assessor said his car was a total loss.</p>
        
            <p>But after the incident, the police issued him with infringement offence notices that included a reference to operating a vehicle with a smooth tyre.</p>
        
            <p>Reports confirmed the tyre had barely any tread.</p>
        
            <p>The man's insurance claim was declined.</p>
        
            <p>Stevens said an insurer might also not cover a crash if someone was driving against the terms of their licence conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Think twice before letting someone on their restricted licence drive their friends, unsupervised, on a quick trip to get fish and chips - if an accident occurs it's unlikely insurance will cover it," Stevens said.</p>
        
            <p>People would also need to make sure they kept their belongings safe, even if they were going for a swim at the beach or heading off for a walk, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If your car is full of Christmas presents or other valuables, ensure they are hidden from view. Either don't take valuables to the beach, or ask someone to look after your things while you're swimming."</p>
        
            <p>In another case dealt with by IFSO, a man stopped at a train station in Zurich, he left his designer bag with $13,000 worth of contents on the pavement outside the station and walked a few metres away to throw his rubbish in a bin.</p>
        
            <p>His bag was stolen and he said it was unfair that his insurance claim was declined.</p>
        
            <p>The policy said leaving bags "unattended in a public place" was excluded but he said it was only for a short time.</p>
        
            <p>IFSO backed the insurer.</p>
        
            <p>Stevens said sometimes theft of belongings from vehicles or campgrounds might not be covered by contents policies, especially if things were left in campervans.</p>
        
            <p>People should check what coverage they had, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Insurers should also be notified if someone was away from home for more than 60 days.</p>
        
            <p>Stevens said her office often saw cases where consumers were caught out by these things and it could cause a lot of disappointment and stress.</p>
