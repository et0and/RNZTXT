            <p>Wellington's Wētā FX has scored two nominations at the British Film Academy Awards (BAFTAs) for their work on Better Man and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.</p>
        
            <p>Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man, directed by Michael Gracey (The Greatest Showman), depicts the British pop star as a CGI chimpanzee.</p>
        
            <p>Wētā FX's Luke Millar, David Clayton, and Keith Herft received a nod in the Best Special Visual Effects category for bringing to life actor Jonno Davies' movements as a chimpanzee which had Williams' mannerisms and voice.</p>
        
            <p>The team also digitally recreated 226 different costumes and 50 different hairstyles from the singer's life.</p>
