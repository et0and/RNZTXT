            <p>Auckland Airport is preparing for its busiest days of the festive season for both international and domestic travellers next week.</p>
        
            <p>The busiest day for all travel is set to be 22 December, with nearly 18,000 travellers departing internationally.</p>
        
            <p>"With international connections restored, we're really looking forward to sharing a Kiwi summer with international guests to Aotearoa New Zealand," airport customer officer Scott Tasker said.</p>
        
            <p>For domestic departures, the other busiest days will be 15 and 21 December, while for international, 23rd December and 7 January are also expected to be busy.</p>
        
            <p>To cope with the influx, the airport has 72 new employees boosting its frontline operation and more staff working around the terminal.</p>
        
            <p>"Airports are complex systems and things aren't 100 percent perfect 100 percent of the time, but we know the vast majority of travellers are going to have a smooth experience travelling through the airport over the holidays," Tasker said.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers arriving into New Zealand can fill out an electronic NZ Travel Declaration prior to their arrival, and travellers with nothing to declare can go straight through an express lane for biosecurity screening.</p>
        
            <p>Tasker has asked travellers to be patient and respectful to airport workers throughout the Christmas season.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all working hard to get people where they need to be and above all, we hope everyone has a wonderful summer break ahead."</p>
        
            <p>The busy period also marks the return of travel to 93 percent of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
