            <p>New Zealand's top 200 earning tech firms saw revenue rise 12 percent in the 2023 financial year, on the back of strong demand in North American and European markets.</p>
        
            <p>The Technology Investment Network's TIN200 companies report indicated the top 200 tech sector companies generated $17.1 billion in revenue, an extra $1.8b, in the year ended June.</p>
        
            <p>"Tech is New Zealand's second-largest source of offshore cash after dairy. And it's only growing in size - it's doubled since 2013," TIN report author Alex Dickson said.</p>
        
            <p>"That means there's a critical mass of large, profitable firms with global reach and the wherewithal to develop new innovative products and services."</p>
        
            <p>More than three-quarters (76 percent) of total revenue was earned in overseas markets, with total sales up 13 percent to $13b.</p>
        
            <p>North America was the biggest growth market for firms, with 19 percent growth, followed by Europe (up 12) and and Australia (up 10.5 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Fintech surpassed healthtech to become NZ's highest-grossing tech sub-sector for the first time, with revenue growth of 23 percent to $2.8b.</p>
        
            <p>Healthtech's revenue growth was little changed with a gain of 0.4 percent to $2.6b.</p>
        
            <p>Appliances rose 14 percent to $2b, and IT serve rose 3.6 percent to $1.8b.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past decade, the median revenue for a top 200 tech firm has increased from $13.6m to $26.9m, while the average staff count has climbed from 199 to 319," Dickson said.</p>
        
            <p>While total staff numbers for the Top 200 rose 3.1 percent in the 2022 calendar year, New Zealand-based jobs fell by 193, while overseas-based jobs rose by 2127.</p>
        
            <p>"There is insatiable demand for tech skills and capital to support this growth - and these are two areas where New Zealand could come unstuck. Tightness in the job market continues to drive up tech wages, which are now pushing $100k for the average worker, well above the national average," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The average tech salary across the total workforce rose 8.5 percent to $99,740.</p>
        
            <p>R&D spending across the 200 firms exceeded 10 percent of total revenue for the third year in a row to $1.7b.</p>
        
            <p>Dickson said the growth had been achieved over a number of difficult years.</p>
        
            <p>"What's really laudable is when you consider that all this success has taken place against a backdrop of economic and geopolitical flux.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite Covid, despite trade tensions and successive economic shocks, local NZ tech is truly flourishing and flowering."</p>
