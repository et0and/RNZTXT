        <h2>Comvita cuts 67 jobs, but could rebound in 2026</h2>
        <p>
Honey producer Comvita's bitter financial losses have been sweetened by the maintaining of market share across a number of Asian markets, in the face of "seismic" changes to the global honey industry.

            <p>Honey producer Comvita's bitter financial losses have been sweetened by the maintaining of market share across a number of Asian markets, in the face of "seismic" changes to the global honey industry.</p>
        
            <p>The NZX-listed company is reporting a net loss after tax of $6.5 million for the six months to the end of December, which included one-off restructure costs.</p>
        
            <p>In a presentation to investors on Tuesday, the company spoke of a "radically simplified organisation", with the restructure reducing overall headcount by 67, scaling back senior leaders by four and cutting two board directors.</p>
        
            <p>It also closed its European and European Union subsidiaries in place of a distributor model.</p>
        
            <p>The restructure followed reports of accounting regularities in December, with the company recently admitting to overstating its after-tax profits by $4m for the 2023 and 2024 financial years.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Brett Hewlett labelled the situation as a "smelly fish", which prompted an independent accounting review.</p>
        
            <p>"We deeply regret having to report this as part of our restructure and review process," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of sales and accounts receivable balances were seen to be incorrect and needed to be adjusted.</p>
        
            <p>"I can reassure... we have taken measures to correct, tighten controls, restructure the organisation, we've changed reporting lines, we've refreshed and re-vamped our procedures and policies to make sure they're fully compliant of what you would expect from Comvita."</p>

            <p>The company was still in discussion with its banking syndicate as its current financial performance didn't enable the business to achieve confidence from the syndicate, Hewlett said.</p>
        
            <p>However there was cause for optimism into 2026 at least, Hewlett said, namely its strong position as premium honey brand leader in Singapore, China, Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a depressed consumer sentiment towards spending in China at present, where other honey producers were also sending their honey cheap and discounted, affecting demand even further.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing frugality of willingness to spend by Chinese consumers taking place and that seems to continue, but it seems to have also plateaued and levelled out.</p>
        
            <p>"The economic outlook for china does remain soft, but we still remain very positive on the long term prospects."</p>
        
            <p>The company also re-gained lost ground with its North American market with a major customer win confirmed in January, Hewlett said.</p>
        
            <p>Losing a major North American customer led to the company reporting a full-year loss in August of $77.4m, also attributable to the abrupt drop-off in demand from China.</p>
        
            <p>Hewlett said honey production has seen a "seismic change" over the years, due to the glut of honey in global markets which was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Rapidly growing honey production faced "an absolute collapse" in 2020, when production volumes fell 24 percent to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"This surplus of production that was recognised hasn't been absorbed by the steady growth and demand in market and has created a surplus or a glut that's been referred to in the industry."</p>
        
            <p>But he said Comvita continued to reduce its inventory and planned a rebound in 2026 thanks to its premium position and brand.</p>
