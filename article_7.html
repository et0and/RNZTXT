            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has created a mayoral business group to provide advice on council projects and spark new ideas for the future of the city.</p>
        
            <p>Small business owners have reported to RNZ a slow down in business due to the cost of living with many fearing the government public sector job cuts will cut further into profits.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said the group that pulls together local leaders in sectors such as retail, hospitality, tech, property development and the creative sector, met for the first time Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The council has a number of transitional programmes underway like the Courtenay Place upgrade and the Civic Square redevelopment, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The city was also facing external challenges like public sector cuts and the rising cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to me that our local businesses have an active role in shaping and delivering the transformation of our city.</p>
        
            <p>"They will give feedback directly to me on a range of upcoming council projects and have the opportunity to put new ideas on the table to deal with our city's challenges."</p>
        
            <p>Representatives on the group are:</p>
