            <p>A family cherry orchard in Hawke's Bay is ripping out all of its trees due to damage from Cyclone Gabrielle and successive wet seasons.</p>

            <p>For 16 years Hugh and Linda Findlay have been selling their delicious cherries from a shed at Cherry Gold Orchard near Napier. It's been a labour of love for their entire family, and daughter Sarah Findlay told RNZ about the many hours spent working there.</p>
        
            <p>"It was always a big family thing. Christmas was always taken over by cherries every year and all of us would pick. The cherries were massive, 20 grams for one cherry. They were amazing, so tasty.</p>
        
            <p>"This year will be the first year we don't have them and it'll be very weird... no panic at Christmas and everyone checking the weather forecast every five minutes," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a tough decision for the family, but after extensive flooding during Cyclone Gabrielle they tried to save the trees and have spent 19 months hoping they would bounce back.</p>
        
            <p>But as time went on, it became clearer that the 3000 cherry trees were dying.</p>
        
            <p>"These were the ones the cyclone destroyed - the water came right through and tore off all the netting, so that one was a goner basically from last year.</p>

            <p>"Trees were also dying from all the water they were sitting in from cyclone and wet summers before as well," said Sarah.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Since day one, local orchardist Laurie Hook has been working alongside the family. He said it can be a challenging crop.</p>

            <p>"They are easy to grow but weather is the big issue, and if you get some good fine weather through flowering and harvest you can get some good years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Which lately has not been the case, so contractors have been removing all the trees.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>"There was too much damage. They don't look healthy and they've suffered so much. There are no feeder roots, it's all died and it needs that to feed the plant," said Hook.</p>

            <p>And although the beloved cherry orchard is gone, the family's memories of it will live on in Sarah's wedding photos and special moments with her daughter.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so cool, I'm going to miss that. Maddy and I used to come here and run and walk through it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was peaceful, it was nice," said Sarah.</p>
