            <p>Infrastructure investor Infratil plans to raise $1.15 billion to fund further investment in CDC's data centres and other growth across its global portfolio.</p>
        
            <p>Infratil chief executive Jason Boyes said Trans-Tasman data centre developer and operator CDC has been one of the company's most successful investments, with its 48 percent stake currently independently valued at $4.42b or about 10 times what it first invested in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>The equity raising included a fully underwritten placement of about $1b new Infratil shares and a retail offer of $150 million with discretion to accept oversubscriptions.</p>
        
            <p>The company was placed in a trading halt today, which was expected to be lifted tomorrow, when the placement was expected to be completed.</p>
        
            <p>The funding would help CDC to grow more quickly, Boyes said.</p>
        
            <p>CDC recently announced plans to build a 500-megawatt facility at Sydney's Marsden Park Industrial Precinct.</p>
        
            <p>"Demand continues to accelerate on the back of cloud adoption and significant investments in generative AI," Boyes said.</p>
        
            <p>"This rapid increase in demand has seen CDC enter advanced negotiations with customers for over 400MW of capacity at multiple sites across the CDC footprint, with this capacity expected to come online over the next four to five years.</p>
        
            <p>"The NZ$1.15b we are raising today will not only support the CDC team to address this growth, but also strengthens our ability to expand our renewables, digital and healthcare platforms."</p>
        
            <p>CDC chief executive Greg Boorer said the company was seeing a long pipeline of customer demand to support AI-related work.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last 18 months we have signed contracts for 200MW+ of capacity and we continue to see higher demand in the Australian and New Zealand markets."</p>
        
            <p>The proceeds of the equity raising - combined with cash on hand, and undrawn available debt facilities - would give Infratil about $1.81b of liquidity.</p>
        
            <p>The new shares would be placed at $10.15 a piece and represented a discount of 6.8 percent to the last NZX close price on 14 June.</p>
        
            <p>Interests associated with Infratil's manager, Morrison, and related parties have pre-committed to subscribe for $63.27 million of new shares, which equalled the pro rata share offer to investors.</p>
