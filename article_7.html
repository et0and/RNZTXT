            <p>Employment confidence has fallen sharply as employees see reduced job prospects and a likely rise in unemployment.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac McDermott Miller Employment Confidence Index fell 13 points to 91.4 in the June quarter survey, showing a drop back into pessimism, to the lowest level since the first Covid-lockdown in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Jobs were seen as increasingly hard to come by, which Westpac said signalled a further rise in the unemployment rate in the months ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Perceptions about pay growth and job security also fell.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest decline across the survey's various measures was in households' perceptions of current job opportunities, falling 24 points.</p>
        
            <p>"This measure is of particular interest to us as it has had a close correspondence with the unemployment rate over time," Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said a rise in unemployment was expected due to the high interest rates imposed by the Reserve Bank to tame high inflation.</p>
        
            <p>The latest data from Stats NZ showed the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent in the March quarter, rising from the historic lows seen between 2021 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't seen a significant rise in layoffs to date, perhaps due to employers looking to hold on to workers. But that may change as the economy's slowdown progresses," he said.</p>
        
            <p>McDermott Miller market research director Imogen Rendall said confidence had fallen amongst employees in both the public and private sectors.</p>
        
            <p>"Both private and public sector employees have taken a particularly pessimistic view on the current availability of jobs, together with future job opportunities in a year's time," Rendall said.</p>
        
            <p>"Private sector employees are also indicating a real concern regarding their future job security. It will be interesting to see how this plays out over the months to come," she said.</p>
