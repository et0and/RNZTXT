            <p>Rocket Lab is stepping in to fill the vacuum that more than a dozen students find themselves in after their space camp dreams came crashing down.</p>
        
            <p>It is offering the students a tour of its rocket factory and mission control in Auckland after a company organising to send the students to a US space camp collapsed.</p>
        
            <p>Actura charged up to $13,000 for children from 25 New Zealand schools to attend a two-week CASE Space School Program at the Nasa headquarters in Houston, Texas. But parents were left dumbfounded after an email saying the trip would not go ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab has now offered to help.</p>
        
            <p>It had about a dozen rockets being worked on at any given time at its Mount Wellington factory, spokesperson Morgan Connaughton told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>There are also about 500 rocket scientists and engineers, and a big mission control.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not quite Houston, but maybe it's even better because it's at home," Connaughton said.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab was talking to partners to help students from outside of Auckland get to the facility, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we can, we'd like to get everyone up here.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love to run our own space camps. The trouble is, we've got our hands full with just core business at the moment: launching rockets and building spacecraft."</p>

            <p>She had not heard of Actura, but said space camps were not a novel idea and many companies organised trips to Nasa.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Lab's offer comes as many others in the community are also reaching out to help the "heartbroken" students.</p>
        
            <p>Mike Renata's daughter, an intermediate student, was all set to leave in three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"We started the payments last year in April, we had our last one in January," Renata told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"From January to now, they sent our flight itineraries, what the kids are going to be doing and we had a Zoom [call] with them at the end of May, and they hyped the kids up and we were all excited, And then just out of nowhere, we get that email."</p>
        
            <p>"We got an email saying that they're going to liquidation."</p>
        
            <p>The email came past midnight, but Renata was awake and as soon as he tried replied he said he "got a bounce back email saying, 'email shut down'".</p>
        
            <p>He said the parents had "no idea" what was going on with Actura, and they felt "left out of the loop".</p>
        
            <p>The company had done such camps with schools in Australia and New Zealand before, he said, so they thought it was "legit".</p>
        
            <p>The students were "heartbroken", Renata said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the girls put a lot of time and effort into this. For our family, we had to do a lot of fundraising and a lot of events. So there's a lot of time spent, a lot of community involvement.</p>
        
            <p>"She [my daughter] is absolutely gutted."</p>
        
            <p>He said his daughter had always been fascinated by space and planets, so when the opportunity arose, he jumped on it.</p>
        
            <p>But not before long "it all came crashing down", Renata said.</p>
