        <h2>US citrus growers warn NZ about disease infestation</h2>
        <p>
The growers championed disease prevention ahead of Citrus New Zealand's conference on Wednesday.

            <p>American citrus growers are warning New Zealand growers that a plant disease infestation can be a "catastrophe" as it was for them in Florida - and disease prevention is key.</p>
        
            <p>Nate and Anne Jameson were recounting their experiences with citrus greening disease in Tai RƒÅwhiti at industry group Citrus New Zealand's conference on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Jamesons grew a range of citrus fruit and have run a large indoor citrus operation Brite Leaf Nursery for about 26 years at Lake Panasoffkee near Tampa in central Florida - selling to both commercial and backyard customers.</p>
        
            <p>But the pair's nursery has been hit by citrus greening disease in recent years, a bacterial disease transmitted by Asian and African citrus psyllids.</p>
        
            <p>The United States Department of Agriculture said the untreatable citrus greening disease was first detected in Florida in 2005.</p>
        
            <p>The citrus psyllids feed on the stem of the citrus plant, infecting the tree with bacteria which goes underground into the root system and multiplies - killing infected trees within a few years of infection.</p>
        
            <p>Leaves became yellow, asymmetrical and mottled on infected trees, and fruit was often irregularly shaped, smaller, harder and bitter-tasting - and there was no cure for the plant disease.</p>
        
            <p>It spread across the state, killing trees and devastating orchards, reducing Florida's citrus production by 75 percent - then spreading west to Louisiana, Texas and California.</p>
        
            <p>Nate Jameson said the destructive disease was likely imported into the US state, but local authorities were too slow to respond and it spread very rapidly.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the mistake that we made in Florida is we were not aggressive enough in trying to prevent disease from entering the country," Jameson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We sat on our laurels; we got used to the idea that we haven't had a problem, so why should we deal with the problem?</p>
        
            <p>"I think one of the messages I would like for growers in New Zealand to understand is it prevention is cheaper than reaction."</p>
        
            <p>Jameson said it was very difficult to convince both Governments and grower organisations to spend money on plant disease prevention measures - like keeping the insect at bay through netting and widescale weeding - for a problem that had not yet eventuated.</p>
        
            <p>"I admit that's a huge challenge," Jameson said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, the citrus industry in Florida was an US$8 billion industry. It's now less than about US$2 billion and shrinking fast.</p>
        
            <p>"In 1989, the state of Florida had about 863,000 acres of citrus. Today in Florida, we're down to about 200,000 acres of citrus."</p>
        
            <p>Jameson said Florida lost the majority of its orange and citrus production, many packing sheds shut down and employees left the area as work dropped off.</p>
        
            <p>He said the incursion had a "significant" financial impact on their family-owned business.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is if you get the right combination of insects and disease, you have the recipe for a potential - I want to be careful how I say it - catastrophe, which is what we have in Florida."</p>
        
            <p>Nate Jameson commended New Zealand's strong biosecurity measures, like the fruit boxes at airport borders, which he said did not exist in Florida.</p>
        
            <p>He and Anna Jameson were now investigating other more viable crops when they return home.</p>
        
            <p>Citrus New Zealand said there were no cases of citrus greening disease in New Zealand.</p>
