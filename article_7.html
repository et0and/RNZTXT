            <p>One New Zealand has trespassed a customer and banned them from its network for life after an assault on two staff members in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The incident unfolded at a retail store on 11 October, when a customer was reportedly asked to provide their Apple ID.</p>
        
            <p>Addressing customers on LinkedIn, chief executive Jason Paris said the customer would be trespassed and disconnected from the One New Zealand network, and never be allowed back.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a decision that we take lightly, but although we love our customers, the health and safety of our teams is always our number one priority.</p>
        
            <p>"So as we head into a stressful Christmas period, please remember to give the people that are trying to help you across any industry, your respect - not your aggression."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they were called at 2.30pm on Friday after two employees at a Riccarton store were assaulted by a youth.</p>
        
            <p>"There do not appear to have been serious injuries to the two victims, however they were understandably shaken by the incident."</p>
        
            <p>Police had identified the youth believed to have been involved and said they were following positive lines of enquiry to locate them.</p>
        
            <p>The move came five months after One New Zealand closed its Britomart store in central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The store closed its Queen Street shop in May, despite still paying rent.</p>
        
            <p>Paris told Checkpoint at the time physical and verbal abuse of staff was a regular occurrence, as was theft.</p>
        
            <p>Some offenders had been bringing knives into stores to steal display devices, cut off their security tags and walk out the door.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone will come in - mostly they have a balaclava over their heads, but sometimes now they're pretty brazen."</p>
        
            <p>Staff were also being abused after asking customers for photo ID - a measure One NZ was taking to avoid identity fraud and scams, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just unacceptable; it's happening too often and so we made the call to shut it down and prioritise our team's well-being."</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young said stores had seen an increase in aggression and violence towards staff, which was "really distressing" for shop workers.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, businesses were trespassing people from their shops or refusing to provide a service.</p>
        
            <p>In September, Young was appointed to the government's new advisory group on retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>Every employer had to comply with laws to provide a safe working environment for their staff, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She reiterated Paris's request for customers to "be courteous to each other".</p>
        
            <p>"If they do have any concerns, take a breath and count to 10. When people get stressed, they say or do things they might regret later, so think about your actions, and the effect they have on others."</p>
        
            <p>Retailers were having to face multiple incidences of unpleasant or illegal behaviour from customers every day, Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really difficult for staff in retail to manage that on an ongoing basis - they've just come to work to do their job."</p>
        
            <p>The closure of One NZ's downtown Auckland store showed just how serious the issue was, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are a very large retailer, and you're in the biggest street in the biggest city in New Zealand, if you close your store you're giving a competitive advantage to your competitors to provide a service to potential customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Businesses don't do that lightly and it just shows you the extent of aggressive behaviour and how staff are feeling about that."</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ applauded One NZ's leadership in taking action against violent customers, she said.</p>
