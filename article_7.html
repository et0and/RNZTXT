            <p>ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence fell 4 points to 93.2 in March over February.</p>
        
            <p>Anything under 100 points indicated pessimism.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said consumers' perception about their finances fell 9 points to a negative-21 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Only 16 percent expected to be better off this time next year, which was down 5 points.</p>
        
            <p>And more bad news for retailers, with a net 16 percent of consumers thinking it was a bad time to buy a major household item.</p>
        
            <p>Zollner said people with mortgages were now meaningfully keener to spend than those without, which was very unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"Retailers will be hoping that that indicates some pent-up demand. However, a significant improvement is needed before the 'good time to buy' indicator will be pointing to good times for the retail sector," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Zollner said household inflation expectations also rose last month, despite a drop in petrol prices.</p>
        
            <p>"Retailers are telling us things are less dire, and our card spending data concurs, but it's clearly still tough times out there.</p>
        
            <p>"Until the labour market and housing market turn definitively higher, consumers are likely to remain in a cautious mood".</p>
