            <p>For many of us, the idea of turning 65 means picking up a SuperGold Card, having more time in the garden, and generally enjoying a slower pace of life.</p>
        
            <p>But not so for Oamaru man Marcus Brown, who - after a career in management and on the eve of retirement - decided he wanted to become a builder.</p>
        
            <p>Now 66, Marcus has just finished his apprenticeship and graduated as a qualified builder.</p>
        
            <p>Before going into the building industry, he had been working for a cycle tour company, however it fell apart due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Brown told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"I started working for a pal of mine in town, Brett Stuart. He and his wife Fiona own Crosscut Construction and I was doing a bit of hammer handling," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"One day I had a bit of a rush of blood to the head and said 'would you put me through an apprenticeship, please?'"</p>
        
            <p>He asked to do an apprenticeship so both he and Stuart would commit to the process, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At least I knew I was going to be doing something for two or three years, which was the stability I think I was possibly looking for."</p>
        
            <p>As he worked in management for most of his life, his work had not been physically demanding, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always been reasonably fit, so I haven't worn myself out, so I was obviously saving myself for this, for later life."</p>
        
            <p>The hardest part of the job was being at the bottom of the heap, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The hardest part was taking instruction from young fellas, in other words, the tea boy and below.</p>
        
            <p>"But anyone who knows me, I've thrown myself into that with great gusto. I always try to make the best cup of tea and sweep the floors the best and smartest."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he had learnt humility from his younger workmates and how their way of life differed to his.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in a different world now, but what I do appreciate is that a bit of a hand they give me now and again.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't let me get too overpowered with some of the big stuff and so we work together as a team, which is obviously really important."</p>
        
            <p>He was able to share knowledge he had picked up through his life with his workmates, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've picked up a few tricks as I've gone through life and if I can give some them some pointers without being a bit of an old fuddy-duddy then I'm really happy to to share some some knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>"We have some great chats at smoko, I'm really privileged to work with some fabulous boys."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he would not want to be doing anything else.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super privileged to be able to do it and to be still giving it a crack."</p>
        
            <p>His advice for anyone looking for a career change was to seize the day, he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"My advice to anyone is, it's all about the top two inches, your head is the most important part. If you're physically fit enough and you're keen to give something a go, then you just gotta give it a whirl," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once you drop into that soft, cosy chair, it gets a bit difficult to get out of it."</p>
        
            <p>He said he hoped to be building for a while as he enjoyed working for the company and with his team.</p>
