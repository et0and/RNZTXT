            <p>Apple on Thursday reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business. But China sales missed analysts' targets.</p>
        
            <p>Apple shares were down 1.7 percent in after-hours trading.</p>
        
            <p>The 2 percent rise in overall fiscal first-quarter sales for the company ended four straight quarters of sales declines on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We did feel good about the plus 6 percent (revenue growth) for iPhone," Apple chief executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. "We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China. The iPhone is doing well in those markets."</p>
        
            <p>He added: "China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed."</p>
        
            <p>For its fiscal first quarter ended 30 December, Apple reported sales of US$119.58 billion and profit of US$2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of US$117.91 billion and US$2.10 per share, according to data from LSEG.</p>
        
            <p>Sales of iPhones hit US$69.70 billion, growing 6 percent to beat analyst expectations of US$67.82 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
        
            <p>"The overall strength of iPhone 15 sales clearly reflected more pent-up demand for smartphones than expected, but the big miss in China is concerning as it could be the start of a longer downward trend there," said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at TECHnalysis Research.</p>
        
            <p>Microsoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights. Apple's stock has dropped more than 3 percent in 2024, compared with the S&P 500's 2 percent increase.</p>
        
            <p>Apple has said it is researching generative AI but has instead focused on its Vision Pro headset, which analysts do not expect to bring meaningful revenue for several years.</p>
        
            <p>In the shorter term, analysts are increasingly worrying about sales of Apple's signature device in China, whose economy is navigating the burst of a real estate bubble. The iPhone also faces increasing competition in China and has fallen out of favor in government offices.</p>
        
            <p>Apple said sales in China were US$20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of US$23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
        
            <p>Cook told Reuters that, when accounting for currency exchange rates, iPhone sales in mainland China were down "mid-single digits" in the quarter but said the company's installed base of iPhones in China is at an all-time high.</p>
        
            <p>Counterpoint Research reported China iPhone unit shipments fell during the quarter, with Chinese consumers looking to novel folding phones and homegrown rival Huawei, which re-entered the market with a flagship phone powered by a Chinese-made chip.</p>
        
            <p>In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit US$10.16 billion, above analyst estimates of US$9.75 billion, according to LSEG data. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to Apple's longtime rival Samsung Electronics.</p>
        
            <p>Investors will be listening closely for the Cupertino, California-based company's forecast for the fiscal second quarter on a conference call at 5pm EST (2200 GMT).</p>
        
            <p>The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11 percent to US$23.12 billion in sales. The results were slightly below analyst expectations of US$23.35 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
        
            <p>But Apple's App Store faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.</p>
        
            <p>Apple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to US$7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations of US$7.73 billion, according to LSEG data. Sales of iPads were down 25 percent to US$7.02 billion, missing expectations of US$7.33 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
        
            <p>Apple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to US$11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand. The results were just above expectations of US$11.56 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
        
            <p>Several Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.</p>
