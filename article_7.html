            <p>Buy-now-pay-later provider Laybuy announced it was appointing receivers on Monday, putting an end to a long battle to make the business profitable.</p>
        
            <p>Founder Gary Rohloff said he was devastated by the decision but had "tried everything" to make it work.</p>
        
            <p>Here's what you need to know.</p>
        
            <p>Laybuy is one of a number of buy now, paylater (BNPL) providers which allow shoppers to spread the cost of their purchases over a number of weeks, interest-free.</p>
        
            <p>The sector started to take off before the pandemic, and has a number of high-profile players such as Afterpay.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, the companies recorded significant valuations because investors expected huge growth from them, even though the profits were minimal. Laybuy has never reported a profit, although last year Rohloff told media one was imminent.</p>
        
            <p>Greg Smith, head of retail at Devon Funds Management, said the sector had "gone bananas" during Covid and given the providers another boost.</p>
        
            <p>"We had people spending like it was going out of fashion, interest rates were near zero, money wasn't a problem."</p>
        
            <p>Rohloff said on Monday the current economic downturn had lasted longer than expected, hitting Laybuy hard.</p>
        
            <p>Consumers were spending less, they were falling behind on their repayments more, there was more fraud, and the cost of finance was higher.</p>

            <p>Investors also turned their attention to the profits these "hypergrowth" companies were actually delivering, and that pushed down the valuations of BNPL providers.</p>
        
            <p>Although its shares traded as high as A$2.30 soon after it listed, by the time Laybuy said it was delisting from the ASX, they were changing hands for just 6c.</p>
        
            <p>Afterpay was bought by Block, after its shares also fell.</p>
        
            <p>Other providers such as Oxipay (which became Humm) and OpenPay have also closed. Smith said Zip's share price was down 85 to 90 percent from the peak.</p>
        
            <p>The government has also introduced more regulation for the sector.</p>
        
            <p>"This is probably a reflection of how things have changed," Smith said. "The economy has got a lot tougher, interest rates have gone up, cost-of-living pressure is on. Consumers have gone from being very free with their spending to battening down the hatches, and that's all a bit of a crunch in the sector."</p>
        
            <p>There was also increasing online competition from operators such as Temu, he said, and BNPL companies needed to reinvent themselves to remain viable.</p>
        
            <p>"The model did very well at the time, but needs to change with the times."</p>
        
            <p>Receivers Deloitte said Laybuy was not accepting new transactions, but customers should continue to make their repayments as normal.</p>
        
            <p>"No action is required to be made by consumers at this stage. The receivers are working with the directors to explore options as to whether a sale of the business can be achieved so that Laybuy can recommence enabling new transactions."</p>
        
            <p>Rohloff said the company had been close to a sale, which fell at the final hurdle.</p>
        
            <p>Deloitte said some businesses could be owed money, and the receivers were working to "gain greater clarity of the situation and key matters going forward".</p>
