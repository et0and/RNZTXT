            <p>Charities say they are struggling to find volunteers as people prioritise paid employment in the current financial crisis.</p>
        
            <p>A report by Volunteering New Zealand, which surveyed 420 organisations and 1500 volunteers, also noted a move towards casual volunteering of just a few hours a week.</p>
        
            <p>The State of Volunteering in Aotearoa New Zealand 2024 report also found a quarter of volunteers performed up to five hours a month, while only seven percent did 20 hours or more.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteering New Zealand chief executive Michelle Kitney said organisations were reporting a lack of volunteers as a concern, but an even bigger issue was not having enough time or resources to support their volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>"That's in the context of wider funding security issues and concerns in relation to future funding for their volunteer programmes."</p>
        
            <p>The survey was conducted in February, before swingeing budget cuts and job losses in the public sector and elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>Kitney said that, "on the flip side", it was still great to see more people chipping in.</p>
        
            <p>"We really want to celebrate that. The benefits of volunteering [are] huge."</p>
        
            <p>Kitney said urban centres had the highest proportion of new volunteers, of less than a year, but they also had a higher turnover rates than in the regions, where some volunteers had been helping the same organisation for as long as 15 years.</p>
