        <h2>Why your next pay could be a little smaller</h2>
        <p>
It's part of a raft of changes that came in on 1 April.

            <p>An increase in the ACC levy is likely to mean a small reduction in employees' pay in the next pay period.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, the levy increased from $1.60 per $100 to $1.67.</p>
        
            <p>That means someone who earns $2000 a week before tax would have their levy increase from $32 to $33.40.</p>
        
            <p>The amount has risen steadily over the years, from $1.39 per $100 in the year to 31 March 2022.</p>
        
            <p>It will rise to $1.75 next year and $1.83 the year after.</p>
        
            <p>John Cuthbertson, of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, said it should make a small difference to most people.</p>
        
            <p>"From April 1, the ACC levies have changed. ACC recently did a review of its various accounts and found it had shortfalls in most of them. As part of that review, it proposed to increase levies over a period of time. There's been a small increase."</p>
        
            <p>He said the amount would be deducted alongside PAYE and anything else taken from an employee's wages, such as KiwiSaver contributions.</p>
        
            <p>"The other change is there has been a slight increase in the income threshold for the earner's levy. Previous it cut off at $142,283 now it's $152,790. The reality is that [people will have a slight decrease in their pay packet due to the ACC increase. Other than that they shouldn't notice any other changes unless their employer has been generous and given them a pay rise."</p>
        
            <p>The minimum wage also increased from 1 April, to $23.50.</p>
        
            <p>Employer superannuation contribution tax thresholds have adjusted, which potentially means a lower tax bill on KiwiSaver contributions made by the employer but this does not affect a person's take-home pay.</p>
