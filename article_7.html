            <p>Tauranga business owners say sales have dropped because of a new road layout and one fears she'll have to shut her store.</p>
        
            <p>Lisa Parker owns Liquorland on Harington St in Tauranga's city centre. In March, the lower end of the street became one-way because of nearby construction and, the city council said, to increase safety and streamline traffic.</p>
        
            <p>There were also changes to other roads in the CBD as part of a two-year trial, while construction of the $306 million civic precinct Te Manawataki o Te Papa and other private developments were ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Parker presented a petition, signed by nearly 150 people, at a Tauranga City Council meeting on Tuesday calling for lower Harington St to return to two-way traffic.</p>
        
            <p>She said sales at her store had dropped by over a third since the road became one-way.</p>
        
            <p>"The business is no longer viable yet I have two years left on my lease with the added costs of rates, insurance, et cetera for the building."</p>
        
            <p>The decline in sales was directly linked to the street becoming one-way, said Parker.</p>
        
            <p>There was a "considerable backlash" from customers about the changes and they vented their anger to staff daily, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Parker said she had permission from the franchisor to close in February next year but would still have $200,000 in lease obligations.</p>

            <p>If the street were to return to two-way it would mean a lot to her customers, enable her to remain open and her staff could keep their jobs, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Mohammad Rahman bought Cafe on The Strand 18 months ago and told Local Democracy Reporting his sales were down 20 percent to 30 percent since the road changes.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest impact was the bus stop, which removed the parking directly in front of his cafe on the corner of Harington St and The Strand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rahman said customers complained about the lack of parking and the cost.</p>
        
            <p>New development in the city would improve things but right now his business needed to survive, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm losing business at the moment and I have to survive. It's really hard for me.</p>
        
            <p>"What the council is doing might be better in the future but at the moment I'm struggling."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at the meeting, Parker said another issue her business faced was people drinking at the recently installed bus stop in front of her store despite it being a liquor ban area.</p>
        
            <p>The bus stop had seats and tree shade so could be a place for people to hang out, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Customers and I are staggered the council would consider putting a bus stop outside a liquor store.</p>
        
            <p>"That's asking for trouble and we get that trouble."</p>
        
            <p>Staff picked up empty bottles and cans from outside the store and bus stop daily despite the liquor ban.</p>
        
            <p>Parker said buses also parked across the driveway at times, which further deterred customers, and the issues created by the bus stop meant her liquor licence may not be renewed.</p>
        
            <p>Parker received an email from the police in June saying the amenity and good order of the CBD was decreasing so renewal of her liquor licence could be in jeopardy.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only is my business in jeopardy because of lack of traffic and reduced sales, now I face the fact that my licence will not be renewed.</p>
        
            <p>"We link that purely to the change in the road and the demographic that's changed as a result."</p>
        
            <p>Store staff refused to sell to customers they saw drinking at the bus stop, Parker said.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate and do not take lightly our privilege and responsibilities to sell alcohol."</p>
        
            <p>The store was open from 10am to 7pm, except on Friday and Saturday when it closed at 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>The store should open earlier and close later for financial reasons but Parker said she kept those hours for the safety of her staff and the community.</p>
        
            <p>Parker was told about the street changes in February and raised her concerns with the council, but these were "dismissed", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Jen Scoular said it was important people were heard during the consultation process.</p>

            <p>Harington St highlighted a situation where there was work underway to make the CBD the heartbeat of Tauranga, but the businesses already there needed to keep operating, said Scoular.</p>
        
            <p>She asked if changes could be made to return lower Harington St to two-way.</p>
        
            <p>General manager infrastructure Nic Johansson said it was possible and staff were looking at options that would be presented to the council in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Mah√© Drysdale requested staff provide a report to the council about returning lower Harington St to two-way at its 9 December meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Parker said after the meeting she was grateful the council had agreed to look at options for Harington St sooner.</p>
        
            <p>If it returned to two-way and the public responded it might be in time to save her business, Parker said.</p>
        
            <p>Downtown Tauranga manager Genevieve Whitson agreed the bus stop was negatively impacting Liquorland because it took up a lot of space and limited access to the store when traffic backed up.</p>
        
            <p>Feedback from CBD businesses was the one-way traffic system was an adjustment, but for the most part, they were now used to it, Whitson said.</p>
        
            <p>Downtown Tauranga supported the transformation of the city centre but did not support the speed and pace at which the one-way traffic system was implemented, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The businesses needed more time to digest the changes and give feedback, which could have alleviated some of the challenges that arose on lower Harington St, Whitson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We really hope that the council involves businesses in the process when this pilot scheme is reviewed to ensure we get the best outcome for all parties involved."</p>
