            <p>Auckland business confidence is negative though improved slightly, according to the latest survey of members by the Auckland Business Chamber.</p>
        
            <p>The February survey found 44 percent of businesses reporting negative sentiment, compared with 45 percent in previous survey in November.</p>
        
            <p>"Business confidence has improved slightly, with fewer businesses reporting negative sentiment," Auckland Business Chamber chief executive Simon Bridges said.</p>
        
            <p>"While inflation concerns are lower than August's peak of 43 percent, cost pressures remain a significant issue."</p>
        
            <p>About three quarters of businesses (76%) expected costs to rise over the next 12 months, with 60 percent having raised prices or planning to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking ahead, global uncertainties persist, with trade and geopolitical risks continuing to affect businesses. Alongside these, domestic economic performance will continue to shape business conditions well into 2025," he said.</p>
