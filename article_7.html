        <h2>Christchurch company in talks with US military over rocket-powered plane</h2>
        <p>
Mk-II Aurora has received approval to fly at unlimited speeds - and it's hoped it will go supersonic soon. Audio

            <p>A Christchurch-based aerospace company says it has had initial talks with the United States military and NASA about using its rocket-powered space plane.</p>
        
            <p>Dawn Aerospace has now received approval from the Civil Aviation Authority to fly its rocket-powered space plane, Mk-II Aurora, at unlimited speeds at up to 80,000 feet.</p>
        
            <p>Co-founder and chief executive Stefan Powell said it was a significant step that the team had been working towards since 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first privately funded aircraft of its kind to break the sound barrier [if successful]," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Eventually the aircraft would be able to take payloads to space for clients and it hoped to offer a range of services, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's lots of interesting microgravity experiments you can do in biomedical and material sciences. High-speed flight research is also increasingly interesting - ramjet and scramjet research is becoming more and more of a big deal. And there's lots of other Earth observation and being able to look at the world below you like a satellite does but on demand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>It could also be used for defence capabilities and Dawn had been in contact with the US military, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Naturally, there is some interest in this sort of vehicle, especially in terms of simulating rocket trajectories - like specifically for defence capabilities for being able to detect high-speed rockets. This is a great technology to be able to test radars and those sorts of things on the ground."</p>
        
            <p>No contracts had been signed yet for the aircraft, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dawn also did not have any input on the US Defence Secretary's report to Congress on allies' rapid space launch capabilities last year, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>The company would need to get another certification from the Civil Aviation Authority before it could accept clients and fly their payloads, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>It hoped to receive one by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>Once it had that authorisation, each of its possible international and domestic clients would have to go through a rigorous approval process, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dawn was also looking forward to using the TƒÅwhaki National Aerospace Centre at Kaitorete Spit, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic, it's perfectly positioned right next to the ocean, close to Christchurch where we're based ... It's forward thinking on how to attract other [aerospace] businesses to New Zealand and we're very excited to use that facility."</p>
        
            <p>Powell urged the government to continue the momentum.</p>
        
            <p>"I would love to see the New Zealand Space Agency be able to follow in the European Space Agency and NASA's lead and keep increasing [its involvement]."</p>
        
            <p>The next step for Mk-II Aurora was three-month flight testing campaign from now until September, with the aim of reaching supersonic speeds and two flights per day, he said.</p>
