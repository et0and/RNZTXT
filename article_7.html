        <h2>Crawling back out of recession: Economy likely grew in the final quarter</h2>
        <p>
The economy likely crawled back out of recession at the end of last year, after suffering one of its worst six-month periods in more than 30 years.

            <p>The economy likely crawled back out of recession at the end of last year, after suffering one of its worst six-month periods in more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>Major bank economists expected gross domestic product (GDP) - a broad measure of economic growth - to grow by about 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a 1 percent contraction in the September quarter, and 1.1 percent fall in the June quarter, which saw the economy plunge into a deep recession.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank said the muted recovery reflected ongoing weakness in the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the areas that we're seeing greenshoots in would be coming through in the retail trade and accommodation space," Kiwibank economist Sabrina Delgado said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the December quarter also saw a marked shift in consumer appetite with lower interest rates, with the rise in retail spending also likely to flow through to other areas such as arts and recreation.</p>
        
            <p>The busy tourism season would also help the transport sector, Delgado said.</p>
        
            <p>ASB economists pencilled in 0.3 percent growth, saying the economy would likely be "limping out of the deep mid-2024 slowdown".</p>
        
            <p>"This is on par with slowing population growth with the economy flatlining on a per-capita basis," its economists Wesley Tanuvasa and Mark Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>Last time Stats NZ released GDP data, it included significant revisions to historical data - and economists have warned to expect more revisions this time.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac forecast a 0.5 percent rise in GDP, which it said was "entirely due to issues that we have identified with the seasonal adjustment of the data".</p>
        
            <p>"Our sector-by-sector forecasts suggest effectively zero growth in activity over the quarter, as does our GDP nowcast model," senior economist Michael Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, [the] figures will need to be read with caution. Revisions to recent history could come into play as well," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Delgado said more volatility and revisions in the data were possible.</p>
        
            <p>"I know since Covid there's been a bit of difficulty in really calculating the seasonality of data which has led to these revisions in the past," she said.</p>
