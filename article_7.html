            <p>It comes as wholesale interest rates move lower following the Reserve Bank's official cash rate cut on 14 August.</p>
        
            <p>Some banks lowered their lending rates immediately after the OCR announcement and others followed suit.</p>
        
            <p>The BNZ's popular 18-month rate was now 5.99 percent, and the two-year rate was at 5.89 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a cut to its home loan rates on 20 August, and a move to stop charging first-home buyers and other low-equity borrowers a higher interest rate.</p>
