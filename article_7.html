            <p>A deal to put 20 hydrogen-powered trucks on the road with $6 million of taxpayer funding has been upended - just days from the first two vehicles being delivered.</p>
        
            <p>The US company Hyzon was modifying diesel trucks in Australia for the New Zealand-owned truck leasing company TR Group, but has suddenly pulled out to focus on America.</p>
        
            <p>The first two trucks were due in New Zealand in early August.</p>
        
            <p>TR Group's group general manager Brendan King said the company got no advance warning, but no money had been lost.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't get me wrong, it's frustrating. We'd prefer this wasn't happening."</p>
        
            <p>This was not a blow to hydrogen power, and the company was "actually still very committed", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Hyzon deal was first done in 2021 through the Energy Efficiency & Conservation Authority.</p>
        
            <p>The authority put in $2m, with another $4m available from the Covid Response and Recovery Fund.</p>
        
            <p>It was lauded as part of a wider plan to get a hydrogen refuelling network up and running.</p>
        
            <p>Hyzon had so far modified four trucks, which had been performing well in months of testing in Australia, King said. Two had been due on a ship on 2 August.</p>
        
            <p>"We were getting pretty excited, we were getting close."</p>
        
            <p>TR Group had not paid Hyzon, as the trucks had to prove themselves in more testing here.</p>
        
            <p>It had spent EECA's $2m to cover about 40 percent of the unmodified trucks, but would give that back if TR Group kept them as diesels, King said.</p>
        
            <p>The trucks could still go hydro: In one scenario, the administrators over the Tasman might find a buyer for Hyzon's operation there.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a right to walk away from that deal, yes. [But] not yet - we will wait and see what happens."</p>
        
            <p>TR Group also had three other options to get the trucks modified.</p>
        
            <p>One was with Rolleston company Global Bus Ventures, which was already doing its first hydro truck for TR Group. A second option was Hyundai, which TR Group got to modify a truck that just clocked up 100,000km for NZ Post, while a third was with Chinese modifiers.</p>
        
            <p>"We're committed to doing it, it's the right thing ... we'll get there," King said.</p>
        
            <p>EECA has been approached for comment.</p>
