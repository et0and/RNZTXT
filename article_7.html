        <h2>'Drain' leaves NZ's unemployment higher than Australia</h2>
        <p>
The largest group of people leaving New Zealand were between the ages of 25 and 44 which was a concern for the labour market, nfometrics says.

"There is a correlation between trans-Tasman migration and the relative labour market performances in New Zealand and Australia, Infometrics says.

            <p>Record numbers of people leaving New Zealand to work in Australia could have a negative affect on the workforce over the medium-term.</p>
        
            <p>A report by economic think tank Infometrics shows Australia's rate of unemployment was lower than New Zealand's in the first quarter of this year, which was a break from the average rate between 2014 and 2018 when Australia's rate was 0.7 percentage points higher than New Zealand's.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a definite correlation between trans-Tasman migration and the relative labour market performances in New Zealand and Australia," Infometrics director Gareth Kiernan said in the report.</p>
        
            <p>"The latest figures for the March 2024 quarter show that Australia's unemployment rate is now 0.4 percentage points below New Zealand's rate - the worst relative result, from New Zealand's perspective, since 2012.</p>
        
            <p>"It's little wonder that more people are looking for better opportunities across the Tasman."</p>
        
            <p>He said the largest group of people leaving New Zealand were between the ages of 25 and 44, which was a concern for the labour market.</p>
        
            <p>"If we take these figures alongside the age breakdown of migrants entering or leaving the country, it seems likely that much of the country is experiencing a relative drain of its workforce of 25- to 44-year-olds," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And apart from a few urban areas and tourism-intensive hotspots, those losses are not being mitigated by an inflow of similarly aged people from overseas."</p>
        
            <p>Kiernan said it was also interesting to see an increase in the number of people over 55 leaving New Zealand, following a spike up in the Covid-19 years.</p>
        
            <p>"It may well be that as conditions have changed and the world has settled down a bit, and our economy is slowing, that some of those people are heading back overseas again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was some older people coming back in their sort of late 40s and early 50s - seeing some of those people leave again - that would match up with the previous flows that we've seen."</p>
