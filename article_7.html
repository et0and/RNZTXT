        <h2>How a small change to KiwiSaver could add $100k to your balance</h2>
        <p>
Here are four ways to boost your funds.

            <p>A move to make the default contribution rate to KiwiSaver 4 percent could give a median-income earner an extra $100,000 in their accounts at retirement.</p>
        
            <p>Lifting the default rate from 3 percent of income to 4 percent, matched by a person's employer, was one of a range of suggestions made by the Retirement Commission this week to improve the savings scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioner Jane Wrightson said balances were lower for all age groups than would be expected after 18 years of the scheme, and change was needed.</p>
        
            <p>Increasing the amount you contribute can make a big difference over an investing lifetime. A 20-year-old joining the scheme earning $65,000 a year and contributing 3 percent plus an employer's 3 percent would have about $300,000 at 65, according to Sorted's calculator.</p>
        
            <p>If the rate was lifted to 4 percent plus 4 percent, they would have $400,000.</p>
        
            <p>Here are four other changes that you can make to improve your outcome:</p>
        
            <p>Getting your KiwiSaver fund type right for your own circumstances can make a significant difference to your investing outcome.</p>
        
            <p>If you have a while until you need the money, you can often afford to take a bit more risk. Growth funds tend to be more volatile than balanced or conservative options, but can deliver better returns over the long term.</p>
        
            <p>For that hypothetical 20-year-old, switching from a balanced fund to a growth fund would have given an extra $80,000 at retirement, or a total of about $380,000, even on the 3 percent plus 3 percent contribution rate.</p>
        
            <p>All KiwiSaver managers charge fees for their services, and what they cost can vary a bit. In general, active managers, which make active choices about which investments they put your money into, tend to charge a bit more than their passive counterparts.</p>
        
            <p>What is usually most helpful is to compare after-fee returns. That will give you more of a guide as to whether you are getting value for money.</p>
        
            <p>Past returns are no guarantee of the future but if you look over a longer time horizon, you may be able to see patterns of some funds generally delivering better returns.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiSaver is a significant part of most people's first home-buying plans.</p>
        
            <p>In the year to April, $129.1 million was withdrawn from KiwiSaver for first-home purchases.</p>
        
            <p>It is hard to argue with this as a financial decision - having a freehold house in retirement can make a big difference to how easy it is to get by.</p>
        
            <p>But it does make a difference to your final outcome. If that 20-year-old wanted to withdraw her savings in 13 years' time, she might have $78,000 saved for a deposit, if she had been in a growth fund (she would probably need to dial down the risk close to the time of withdrawal).</p>
        
            <p>However, that would lower her balance at 65 to $251,902.</p>
        
            <p>If you are self-employed or out of the workforce for a while, it can be easy to forget about your KiwiSaver.</p>
        
            <p>Time spent not saving can make a difference, though. If that 20-year-old paused contributions to her growth fund in 10 years' time, for 12 months, it could reduce her final balance by $10,000. If she was out for another year, it would lower her final balance to $363,367.</p>
        
            <p>A payment of just over $20 a week is required throughout the year to contribute enough to get the full $521 member tax credit from the government, which is available to people who contribute at least $1,042. That probably won't grow your balance as quickly as if you were making contributions from a salary, but it keeps you moving in the right direction in the meantime.</p>
