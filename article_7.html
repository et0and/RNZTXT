            <p>What you earn as a councillor or mayor can vary a lot, depending on where in the country you are.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has run a ruler over the numbers to determine where the best local government salaries are - and where the pay is not so good.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was top of the table. Mayor Wayne Brown is paid $296,000 a year and the lowest rate for any councillor was $107,794.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors in Stratford were paid about a quarter as much - $23,155 if they had no additional responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>Some councils listed a salary for a councillor with no additional responsibilities, as well as a minimum allowable remuneration level for councillors.</p>
        
            <p>South Wairarapa was bottom by the minimum allowable measure, at $18,855.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City's mayor was earning $200,000 and Wellington City's $183,037.</p>
        
            <p>The lowest-paid mayor or regional council chairperson was at Kaikoura District Council, earning $86,000.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayors received significantly less than mayors. Auckland's was on $162,794 and Wellington's $126,650.</p>
        
            <p>In Stratford, where the mayor was paid $107,503, the deputy earned $32,416.</p>
        
            <p>A full-time worker on the minimum wage would earn just over $48,000 a year.</p>
        
            <p>Pay rates will be updated from 1 July and Remuneration Authority chair Geoff Summers said it was in the process of completing work on that determination now.</p>
        
            <p>He said the way pay was set depended on a range of factors. A full review had been undertaken in 2018 that highlighted concerns about the lack of remuneration in some areas making it unfeasible for younger people to put themselves forward as candidates.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an enormous disparity in a vast number of variables in local government and we were starting from a base that had no real logic to it.</p>
        
            <p>"We designed a 'sizing system' that enabled us to compare each council to each other. That system has actually worked rather well in comparison with what was there before."</p>
        
            <p>He said for city and district councils, the factors that went into sizing were population, total operating expenditure, total assets and socioeconomic deprivation.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a complex weighting system applied which then establishes a list of all the councils relative to each other."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would be looked at again in the lead-up to the local government elections next year to apply the most recent data.</p>
        
            <p>"That causes some councils to move up or down in the list."</p>
        
            <p>The 2018 review noted the authority could not take account of individual performance in its pay determinations.</p>
        
            <p>It said well-performing elected local government members should not be penalised because others were not up to scratch.</p>
        
            <p>"Within councils, non-performers are often widely recognised by their peers. However, sometimes it is more difficult for the public to identify them because they may have created a high personal profile in local media, not necessarily by being positive and constructive."</p>
        
            <p>It said this could be addressed through collective work on council codes of conduct through Local Government NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Geoff Plimmer, associate professor in the school of management at Victoria University of Wellington, said the jobs were demanding and salaries needed to be sufficient to attract good people.</p>
        
            <p>"When I looked through the list, I thought they were probably quite well paid for an awful lot of people and not well paid for some."</p>
        
            <p>He said people who were on high salaries should be delivering to a high standard.</p>
        
            <p>"Holding people on high salaries to a high standard would be a good conversation to have, whether they are elected or officials."</p>
