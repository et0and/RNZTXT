            <p>The creator of an app designed for trading digital collectables, like comic books and art works, has captured a large share of a fast growing multi-billion-dollar global business.</p>
        
            <p>David Yu's win as EY NZ's Entrepreneur of the Year will take him to Monaco next year to compete with winners from 50 other countries for the world title.</p>
        
            <p>Yu's business started out in Auckland's Karangahape Road as a comic book store before becoming a global platform for digital collectable trading.</p>
        
            <p>His app VeVe has sold more than eight million collectables since its launch in 2018 and broke ground as new business category.</p>
        
            <p>Yu said the business was still at the beginning of its growth cycle with estimated global gross merchandise value of $2.4 billion.</p>
        
            <p>"We will like to think we have a good 15 percent to 20 percent of the market share. So the industry is very big, and we are just in the very forefront of this whole evolution," Yu said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Yu had been working for about 25 years to become an overnight success.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, he said, he could see there would be a demand for digital assets.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was just natural evolution that this was going to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"So from small beginnings ... the future just excites me - what's going to happen next."</p>
