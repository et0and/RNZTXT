            <p>If you were looking for the best investment returns of the past year, international assets would have been your top bet.</p>
        
            <p>New data from Morningstar shows that of its database of New Zealand-based investment funds, all but four were "world" or North America-focused.</p>
        
            <p>The others were the top-ranked fund, Vault International Bitcoin Fund, which returned 158.72 percent between the start of January and Boxing Day, Discovery Founders' Fund - an Australasian equity fund, Superlife's Australian financials fund and Pie Funds' Australasian Growth 2 fund.</p>
        
            <p>Among New Zealand stocks, Black Pearl Group was the best returning same period, recording 136.36 percent. It was followed by Being AI and Tower.</p>
        
            <p>"The international stuff has done really well," said Rupert Carlyon, founder of Koura KiwiSaver.</p>
        
            <p>He said, in comparison, it had been a tough year for most New Zealand stocks.</p>
        
            <p>"When you look down that list, the only big ones that have done well are Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and A2 - kind of. You're going a long way down before you get into the bigger companies. You'd argue for the mainstream NX50, for the standard companies in New Zealand, it's been a tough year."</p>
        
            <p>Investment funds with global exposure had done really well, he said. "Particularly US-based stuff.</p>
        
            <p>Anything with a global growth fund in it has done really well."</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a great couple of years to be an investor."</p>

            <p>He said it highlighted that, for most people, the best returns were found by investing in funds.</p>
        
            <p>A standard growth fund with 80 percent of its investments in equities and 20 percent in fixed interest might have 20 percent to 30 percent in local assets.</p>
        
            <p>That was likely to be significantly less than an individual investor going it alone.</p>
        
            <p>"When they do it alone they go with what they know or what has fallen. I know a lot of people through the pandemic said they were investing in Air New Zealand because it fell so far 'it has to bounce'.</p>
        
            <p>"They also invested in Briscoes, that went well, and Kathmandu, which didn't go so well."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand shares have fallen from almost $1.90 at the start of 2020 to about 60c.</p>
        
            <p>Carlyon said it seemed that markets were "sitting on a precipice" again this coming year.</p>
        
            <p>"My view is there's nothing to say we're in for a fall. The US economy is trucking along nicely. Trump, if he enacts half of what he talks about, will be positive on the stock market."</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not expect another year like last year when the S&P500 was up 24 percent over 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"We should have another good year for international equities and international markets."</p>
        
            <p>It was likely to still be a struggle in New Zealand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's driven by the New Zealand economy. I don't see any rapid turnaround in that market. Also when you look at the structure of the market, you've got a significant chunk of it in gentailers, Spark... it's hard to see what the catalyst is for them to do a whole lot better."</p>
        
            <p>He said investors were likely to be well served by being overweight to the US, Japan and Europe - "that's pretty cheap at the moment but there are massive structural issues."</p>
