            <p>For Auckland nail artist Tanya Barlow, other people's fingernails are a canvas where her imagination runs wild.</p>
        
            <p>While clients sometimes want a specific design on their nails, Barlow says often the "inspo" they bring is just a vibe or cultural reference which kicks off a creative collaboration.</p>
        
            <p>Yellow-orange sunset nails inspired by "Leo season vibes", red-black-and-gold nails a la In The Mood For Love and bright green nails painted with hyperrealistic brown slugs are some of her recent creations.</p>
        
            <p>The slug manicure - which Barlow saw an overseas nail artist create - was a recent "artist's choice" for an open-minded regular.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like 'You know what's gonna be make this really gross and cool? Slime trails. And she was all about it," she tells Emile Donovan.</p>

            <p>Manicures don't have to be "pretty and cute", Barlow says, although when she posted her slug nails on Instagram she did get a bit of flak.</p>
        
            <p>"People were like 'Oh my god, they're so gross'. And it's like 'Hey, people, they're amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Set on a bright green background, the slugs were sculpted in 3D gel which Barlow then painted yellowy-brown before layering dark brown over for a "sluggy texture".</p>
        
            <p>"I love looking at a complex design and reverse-engineering it. I'm like 'Okay, how did they do that? And can I do that too?"</p>
        
            <p>While Barlow's clients sometimes want a specific design painted on their nails, often they'll just present her with a word, vibe or cultural reference as "inspo".</p>
        
            <p>"Last week I had a client, her inspo was the film - one of my favourites - In the Mood For Love. How do you translate a Wong Kar-wai film onto nails? We brainstormed. We were looking at screenshots. And I was like 'Okay, we have to go very abstract'.</p>
        
            <p>"We went for a deep red base. We airbrushed some black, kind of moody bits to symbolize the nighttime stuff. And then we did a brush stroke of gold chrome, if you will, to symbolise the lighting in it.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just like, this is the I love my job so much. I feel so lucky."</p>
        
            <p>While some nail artists demand their 'inspo' photos 48 hours before an appointment, Barlow likes to be surprised on the day.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy that it is slightly masochistic. I do enjoy the surprise of a client being like 'I want this crazy thing'.</p>
        
            <p>"So much of it is interpretation and I love that so much, which is why I think I'm so passionate about the dang slugs."</p>
        
            <p>Although elaborate nail art can be time-consuming to receive - two hours plus including the removal of old polish - it doesn't get in the way of living your life, Barlow says.</p>
        
            <p>"If gymnasts can do the bloody Olympics [with artificial nails], you can do anything. You just have to adjust or relearn. Honestly, if I cut my nails off I'd have to relearn how to type. I use my knuckles a lot for things â€¦ There's nothing I can't do."</p>
