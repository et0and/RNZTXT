            <p>Another small player in New Zealand's banking market is offering a home loan rate better than the big banks.</p>
        
            <p>ICBC was offering a 5.05 percent one-year rate and cash back up to $25,000.</p>
        
            <p>The main banks were advertising either 5.19 percent, 5.25 percent or 5.29 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after SBS offered first-home buyers 4.39 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Tatterson, a mortgage adviser at Loan Market said it would apply to new approvals.</p>
        
            <p>"Cash back is normally offered at the time of settlement."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was able to access about 5.12 percent for one year from the main banks.</p>
        
            <p>But Glen McLeod, head of Link Advisory, said it was a good rate, and a decent cashback offer.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was normal for the maximum cashback to be capped at $20,000.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to see that there is some healthy competition out there for clients. The devil is always in the detail. Checking eligibility criteria is a must."</p>
