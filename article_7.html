        <h2>As it happened: CrowdStrike IT failure disrupts global internet</h2>
        <p>
Auckland Airport says travellers should allow for extra time as an expert warns the glitch will have big ramifications for the IT industry.
</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport is anticipating a busy weekend as school holidays end and the flow-on effects of a global IT outage are felt.</p>
        
            <p>More than 4000 flights have been cancelled worldwide because of the CrowdStrike glitch, with major delays seen at airports and transport hubs around the world.</p>
        
            <p>The outage - caused by an update to a piece of software run by US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike - caused Windows computers around the world to crash on Friday, cancelling flights, disrupting transactions and stopping people from accessing their online banking accounts.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland Airport spokesperson says the airport is operating as normal, but is warning travellers it could be a busy weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson says travellers should keep an eye on updates from their airlines and allow extra time at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an IT expert says the global rollout of "probably one of the worst updates we've ever seen of any software company ever" will have big ramifications for the IT industry.</p>
