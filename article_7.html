            <p>The company behind Juicy Fest has been placed into voluntary liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>1News reported Juicy Festival Limited, Timeless Events New Zealand and Timeless Events Australia Limited were placed into liquidation at 5pm, with Blacklock Rose's Ben Francis and Garry Whimp appointed as liquidators.</p>
        
            <p>Juicy Fest had cancelled the New Zealand leg of the tour in December after being declined a liquor licence in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In an email, Juicy Festival Limited said the cancellation had caused "significant and unexpected costs".</p>
        
            <p>"As you know in 2025, we had to cancel the Juicy Fest New Zealand events as a result of our liquor licence being declined in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"We tried to combat the situation by securing a new, licensed venue for Juicy Fest Auckland however, this option was taken away from us at the last minute through no fault of the venue.</p>
        
            <p>"When we were not approved for a special licence in Auckland, it quickly became a health and safety issue, and it was not as simple as running an event without alcohol."</p>
        
            <p>Juicy Festival Limited said the liquidators would be working through how to best resolve the company's financial obligations, "including funds and funds held to be refunded".</p>
        
            <p>It added it aware the ticketing provider TicketFairy had been "unfairly harassed" about the refunds.</p>
        
            <p>"Please be aware that TicketFairy is a ticketing outlet only and does not hold funds or deal with ticket refunds.</p>
        
            <p>"The liquidator will access funds and deal with refunds, so please wait to be contacted."</p>
        
            <p>Juicy Festival Limited said it was "an extremely difficult situation for all involved".</p>
        
            <p>"The last thing we want is for anyone to be negatively impacted by this and we want to assure you that we have done everything in our power to avoid this outcome.</p>
        
            <p>"We are absolutely gutted by the situation we are now in, and in are sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience this may you."</p>
