            <p>Founder David Yu started his business in Auckland's Karangahape Road as a comic book store before creating a global platform for digital collectable trading.</p>
        
            <p>The app, called VeVe, has sold more than eight million collectables - including characters and memorabilia from popular comic book franchises - since its launch in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Yu's win will take him to Monaco next year as New Zealand's representative, where he will compete against 50 other countries for the title of EY World Entrepreneur of the Year.</p>
