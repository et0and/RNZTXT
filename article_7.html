            <p>Manufacturers may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel with early indications of an increase in economic activity for the first time in two years.</p>
        
            <p>The third quarter Unleashed Manufacturing report indicates sales revenue and purchase orders saw average quarter on quarter growth of 6.2 percent, with sales revenues up 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Unleashed head of product Jarrod Adam said the growth could be early indications of a turnaround for New Zealand manufacturers.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time we have seen purchase orders rise in over a year and a half, which points to the difficult situation that many local manufacturers have been in of late."</p>
        
            <p>He said tracking purchase orders was a useful predictor of future revenue, however orders were still down 26 percent on the same quarter in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"Our expectation is that positive metrics will increase as these orders are filled and higher sales volumes normalise."</p>
        
            <p>Manufacturers supplying the building and construction industry saw average quarter on quarter sales revenue rise 7 percent, while the personal care sector saw sales revenue growth of 52 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The struggling beverage sector was also seeing a strong turnaround with average sales revenues up 10 percent quarter on quarter.</p>
