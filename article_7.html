            <p>Meta fired around two dozen employees from its Los Angeles office for misusing company meal credits for things like laundry detergent, wine glasses and acne treatment pads, a source familiar with the company confirmed to CNN.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the social media giant's corporate offices feature elaborate food services to provide employees with meals as a perk. Meta's two-year-old office near New York City's Penn Station, for example, features a cafeteria that feels like an upscale food court, with various stalls all free for staff.</p>
        
            <p>But for employees at smaller offices without food services, the company provides meal vouchers - $20 for breakfast and $25 each for lunch and dinner - so they can have food delivered to the office while on the job.</p>
        
            <p>The meal vouchers are meant for employees to eat while working at the office - sometimes long hours stretching across several meals of the day, notorious in the tech world.</p>
        
            <p>An internal investigation found that some LA-based employees used the meal funds to purchase things other than food instead, or had meals delivered to their homes, the source said.</p>
        
            <p>Meta's median total annual compensation for individual employees (other than CEO Mark Zuckerberg) is US$379,050, (about NZ$625,000) the company said in a regulatory filing earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The firings, which took place last week, were first reported by the Financial Times.</p>
        
            <p>News of the firings comes as Meta acknowledged on Thursday that it was laying off people across the company as part of a series of separate restructurings.</p>
        
            <p>"Today, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy," Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. "This includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees."</p>
        
            <p>Meta declined to share how many employees were laid off.</p>
        
            <p>The cuts took place across Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Reality Labs, which houses Meta's virtual reality and metaverse efforts.</p>
        
            <p>Among those laid off were Jane Manchun Wong, a prominent security researcher who became well known in the tech world for predicting new social media features - like a Facebook resume feature and a tool on the platform formerly known as Twitter that let users hide replies to their tweets - before she was hired by Meta in June 2023 to work on the Instagram and Threads team.</p>
        
            <p>Meta laid off more than 20,000 employees last year over multiple rounds of cuts, in an effort to reverse a year of revenue declines and stagnating user growth, which Zuckerberg termed its "year of efficiency." The company's shares (META) are up nearly 80% from this time last year</p>
