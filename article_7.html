        <h2>Former crisis negotiator's top tips for securing a deal</h2>
        <p>
Lance Burdett knows how to talk criminals down - and says when asking for a raise or buying a house, many of the same principles can be applied.

            <p>Monday marks the start of the new tax year, when many are thinking about their finances for the 12 months ahead.</p>
        
            <p>For those planning to ask for a raise, buy a new car or move house, former crisis negotiator Lance Burdett has two pieces of advice.</p>
        
            <p>"The first one is you must keep in control of yourself," he told Easter Monday host Susana Lei'ataua.</p>
        
            <p>"The way to do that is to slowly breathe out through your nose as slow as you can, and when you do that, all of a sudden you're in a calm place."</p>
        
            <p>The second piece of advice was for people to prepare what they wanted to say ahead of time, Burdett said.</p>
        
            <p>That was a rule he lived by while working as a crisis negotiator, but it applied to other difficult conversations too, he said.</p>
        
            <p>When asking for a pay rise, for example, the employee should think about what they brought to the company and their achievements and strengths.</p>
        
            <p>"Why do you deserve a pay rise? What makes you different? What makes you stand above the rest?</p>
        
            <p>"Have two or three key bullet points to keep in mind - don't drop them all at once, just slowly release them out across the conversation you're having."</p>
        
            <p>Burdett trained with the FBI and spent 13 years as a crisis negotiator with the police.</p>
        
            <p>Most famously, he was head negotiator on the Napier siege and the Paremoremo prison hostage situation.</p>
        
            <p>In crisis conversations, the rule was "two ears, one mouth" - the other person should be doing most of the talking, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, when requesting something, the opposite applied - the person asking should speak the most.</p>
        
            <p>"But remember, we don't want to get it all out at once. Slow the conversation down, slow your breathing down and make them want to ask you questions."</p>
        
            <p>When making a purchase - for example, buying a house or a car - there was usually "a bit of wiggle room" on the listed price, Burdett said.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged people to negotiate by asking questions, like "What's the best price you can do for me?"</p>
        
            <p>The hope was that both people came away from the transaction feeling as if they had achieved their aim, rather than thinking about "who's won and who's lost".</p>
        
            <p>However, Burdett had a word of warning for those looking to buy a new house this year: never lowball your first offer.</p>
        
            <p>"The worst thing you can do is to go too low - if you insult somebody, that gets their defences up. Once their defences are up, you have great trouble breaking through from there."</p>
