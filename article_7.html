            <p>Japan's transport ministry raided the headquarters of motor giant Toyota on Tuesday, as a scandal over faulty safety data escalated.</p>
        
            <p>The world's largest carmaker has apologised for providing incorrect or manipulated data for safety certification tests.</p>
        
            <p>The scandal has shaken the Japanese car industry, with rivals Honda, Mazda and Suzuki also admitting to submitting faulty data.</p>
        
            <p>Toyota sold more than 11 million passenger vehicles in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>It has said the findings do not affect the safety of vehicles already on the road.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The company has suspended the production of three car models - the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross.</p>
        
            <p>It has also been accused of using modified vehicles during safety collision tests, for vehicles that are no longer in production.</p>
        
            <p>The raids come a day after Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda apologised to customers and car enthusiasts.</p>
        
            <p>He bowed deeply and held the position for a few seconds, which is customary in Japan when companies apologise for wrongdoing.</p>
        
            <p>"We neglected the certification process and mass produced our cars without first taking the proper precautionary steps," Toyoda said.</p>

            <p>Japanese carmakers Honda, Mazda and Suzuki are also due to be inspected by the authorities over the same issue.</p>
        
            <p>Honda said it found wrongdoing on tests related to noise and engine power, but it has stressed that its vehicles are safe to drive.</p>
        
            <p>Mazda has halted the shipments of some cars and said it will bear the cost to its suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>However, the company added that it was not planning on issuing recalls.</p>
        
            <p>The findings also apply to one Suzuki car model that is no longer being produced.</p>
        
            <p>Last December, Toyota-owned carmaker Daihatsu closed all of its factories for more than a month, after admitting that it had falsified safety tests.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the cars were sold with Toyota branding.</p>
        
            <p>Daihatsu compensated more than 400 domestic suppliers during the period where its plants were idle.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the BBC.</p>
