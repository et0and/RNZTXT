        <h2>Wellington developers hint at when city will see new apartment buildings</h2>
        <p>
Current market conditions and economic viability could put projects out well over a year, it is estimated.

            <p>Wellington building developers say changes to the city's District Plan are positive but they will not make a difference anytime soon.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop signed off the plan which will act as a blueprint for building in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Changes to it included allowing six-storey apartment buildings to be built within a 15-minute walk of the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>Under the plan, the Johnsonville train line will also be deemed a rapid transit route to allow six-storey buildings near the services.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Company director Ian Cassels said building six-storey structures in the suburbs was not financially sound.</p>
        
            <p>"Economically it's not great, the first buildings will be built in the city, where the advantages are better, the wealth creation's better and life is better."</p>
        
            <p>Generally, density was positive, Cassels said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's inevitable that we intensify the city and its immediate surroundings because it's better for us as a city."</p>
        
            <p>He welcomed the reduction of character protections in the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't keep everything you've got to concentrate on what's good and stop pretending you're saving old buildings that you know you never can save, so there's a realism about it which is really, really good."</p>
        
            <p>Property development company Thames Pacific owner Stephen Sutorius was also happy with the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"It releases a lot of land so the land supply all of a sudden goes up and there's a lot more site opportunities for developers to look at, whereas previously we might have been a bit constrained."</p>
        
            <p>Sutorius said in the current market conditions it was very unlikely there would be a significant increase in developments at least in the next year.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not going to see floods of apartments built in all these areas but what it does do, [is] it just creates a bit of variance of stock."</p>
