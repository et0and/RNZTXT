            <p>Women in New Zealand are effectively working for free until the end of the year, from 2.38pm today.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the current pay gap of 8.6 percent, according to Statistics New Zealand, the average Kiwi woman is paid 333 days for the equivalent 365 days for men.</p>
        
            <p>The pay gap for Pasifika women and wāhine Māori is 15.2 and 14.3 percent respectively, which means they have been working for free since the start of November.</p>
        
            <p>Year on year, New Zealand's gender gap had decreased by 0.6 percent, moving from 9.2 percent in 2022, to 8.6 percent this year.</p>
        
            <p>However, that had only decreased the pay gap by 52 hours and 32 minutes in real terms.</p>
        
            <p>Theresa Gattung is the chairperson of Global Women, a collective of influential leaders advocating for equity and equality for women.</p>
        
            <p>She said people may think a 8 to 9 percent gap was not a big deal, compared to other countries.</p>
        
            <p>"But 8-9 percent does matter in normal life. If we were told that 9 percent of New Zealand's population had disappeared overnight, we'd think that was a problem. At the basic level of ... we bought something and it was partly defective, it wouldn't matter whether it was a bit defective. We'd still be annoyed about it.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we have to be implacable as women and say any pay gap is not on, end of story."</p>

            <p>Gattung said in the past year, more companies had committed to reporting their gender pay gap and taking action around it.</p>
        
            <p>"But as long as there's any gap, women can't stop advocating. Any gap is unacceptable."</p>
        
            <p>She said the new government should commit to seeing women paid fairly and introduce pay transparency measures, like in Australia and the UK.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a time-consuming piece of policy to put in place and why should women wait? It isn't listed in the [National-led government's] priorities for the top 100 days, but why should we wait? It's not a lot of work.</p>
        
            <p>"The year-on-year figures show positive signs that our gender pay gaps are closing. However, we can't become complacent, as the gap won't continue to close without sustained, intentional action.</p>
        
            <p>"As a country we have come a long way in recognising the latent value of a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce; however, the existence of the pay gap means more needs to be done."</p>

            <p>The newly-sworn Minister for Women Nicola Grigg said it would be a key focus area she planned to prioritise this term.</p>
        
            <p>"Much of the solution relies on rebuilding the economy and restoring the hiring confidence of businesses, which is the number one objective for the new coalition government," Grigg said.</p>
        
            <p>Global Women is today calling on all New Zealanders to reflect on the role they can play in closing the gender pay gap.</p>
        
            <p>Gattung urged New Zealanders to use this day to talk about pay equity and pay transparency.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether it's asking HR about your organisation's pay gap, to revisiting your [diversity, equity and inclusion] strategy in a leadership meeting. We need to keep challenging ourselves to do better until there is no pay gap to talk about."</p>
