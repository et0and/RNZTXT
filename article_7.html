            <p>Rich-lister Anna Mowbray and her husband, former All Black Ali Williams, are spearheading the proposal for a new stadium at Auckland's Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council held two confidential workshops last week to cover options for a future stadium at Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>The first meeting covered a proposal put forward by Mowbray and Williams via MWF NewCo for a privately funded precinct featuring a brand-new 12,500 seat stadium alongside community sport, high performance, med-tech, hospitality and live entertainment facilities.</p>
        
            <p>A second workshop on the 26th of March covered another proposal from CRS Records Limited, Eccles Entertainment and Ponsonby Rugby Club to install a permanent concert stage, improved seating and hospitality infrastructure on the existing site.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the long-running Western Springs Speedway is relocated to Waikaraka following a vote by Auckland Council last year.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed stadium would become a dedicated home ground for Auckland Football Club and was based on a 50-year term with rights of extension.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to thank the [expression of interest] applicants who presented their ideas to the Governing Body. Their efforts have led to bold, creative thinking about the future of one of Auckland's most beloved live entertainment venues," Tātaki Auckland Unlimited chief executive Nick Hill said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Unlocking the future potential of this renowned venue is crucial to helping deliver Auckland Council's goal of driving positive commercial outcomes across the council's stadium portfolio, and great experiences for all Aucklanders."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council will decide whether to proceed to consultation during the next Governing Body meeting on 1 May.</p>
