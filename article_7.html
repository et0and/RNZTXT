            <p>Hauraki District Council has designated another 26 properties in Waihi for future mining, which will allow OceanaGold to apply to expand its open cast pit.</p>
        
            <p>That is short of the 47 properties the mining company had asked to rezone, including some in residential and town centre areas.</p>
        
            <p>All 47 properties are owned by OceanaGold.</p>

            <p>OceanaGold's application to expand the Martha Mineral Zone, around the Martha Pit, drew 81 submissions after it was publicly notified in February last year.</p>
        
            <p>Some, like Ferg and Sandra Cumming, supported the expansion.</p>
        
            <p>"As residents who have lived in Waihi all our lives we fully support OceanaGold as we can see all the positive benefits to Waihi, and there are so many newbys [sic] in town who more here and do nothing but complain about the mine," they said in their submission.</p>
        
            <p>However, in her submission Shirley Milson said she was worried about the serious effect the expansion would have on the local school and town centre.</p>
        
            <p>"I certainly would be selling up if this proposed plan is approved," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hauraki District mayor Toby Adams said council followed a rigorous process, considering technical evidence, community submissions, and using an independent hearing panel.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate the panel's thorough assessment and thank all involved for their contributions. This decision reflects both expert analysis and community interests," Adams said.</p>
        
            <p>The independent hearing panel's report recommended reducing the number of properties rezoned for mining, due to concerns expressed by submitters and the potential effects of rezoning all 47 properties.</p>
        
            <p>The panel found that some of the 47 properties in the commercial and residential parts of town were "not suited to mining related activity that the rezoning would provide for".</p>
        
            <p>It recommended removing the properties in the town centre zone and some in the residential zone.</p>

            <p>Once a property is within the Martha Mineral Zone, resource consent applications can be made for surface mining.</p>
        
            <p>The council decision is able to be appealed before 16 May 2025.</p>
        
            <p>This rezoning is separate to the Waihi North Project which is up for fast tracking by the government. That is for a new underground mine at Wharekirauponga.</p>
        
            <p>Hauraki Council is still waiting to hear if the Waihi North Project has been determined to be 'complete' by the Environmental Protection Authority.</p>
