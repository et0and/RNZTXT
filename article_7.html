            <p>Meta's Facebook and Instagram were down for thousands of users around a number of countries, including in New Zealand, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after the outage started about 6.50am NZT on Thursday, there were more than 105,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Facebook and over 70,000 with Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>WhatsApp, Meta's messaging application, had been down for more than 12,000 users, according to Downdetector.com. Reports from users affected by the outage had fallen significantly by 8.30am.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on X, Meta said it was aware a technical issue was impacting some users' ability to access its apps.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience."</p>
        
            <p>Some Facebook and Instagram users posted on rival platform X that they were encountering an error that said "something went wrong" and that Meta was working to get it fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of thousands of Facebook and Instagram users were impacted globally for more than two hours early this year by an outage that was caused by a technical issue.</p>
        
            <p>The platforms faced another outage in October, when services were largely restored within an hour.</p>
