        <h2>A hard year but 'calls made over Wellington's demise overstated'</h2>
        <p>
2024 was tough, but "there's more of an energy in the city" now the new year has dawned, owners say.

            <p>After a "gruelling year" for many businesses in the capital, owners who have survived till 2025 are hopeful the worst is behind them.</p>
        
            <p>A common theme among Wellington business owners spoken to by RNZ was that 2024 was tough - with very few exceptions.</p>
        
            <p>Many people were unaware of just how tough, Business Central chief executive Simon Arcus said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a gruelling year. It was a recession that was very deep and had comparisons to some of the big recessions of the past."</p>
        
            <p>He said job cuts, businesses closing, and a general feeling of malaise all contributed to a difficult 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>The feeling of struggle was backed by the data, with cuts to the public sector and a crackdown on government-hired contractors contributing to Wellingtonians tightening their belts, Infometrics principal economist Brad Olsen said.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, spending had been volatile, with people hunting for bargains, he said.</p>
        
            <p>While spending in December was down year-on-year around the country, the decline was greater in Wellington - a 2 percent drop compared to the national decline of 0.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, Olsen said the idea of all doom and gloom in the capital had been blown out of proportion.</p>
        
            <p>"Calls made over Wellington's demise are overstated. It has been tough, but it's certainly not at economic collapse."</p>
        
            <p>An increase in spending month-on-month in the latter part of 2024 had economists forecasting a brighter future to arrive in mid-2025, Olsen said, helped by lower mortgage rates.</p>
        
            <p>For those on the business frontline, that future could not come fast enough.</p>

            <p>Rowan McIntyre, the owner of Mystic Kitchen, said running two cafes - one in the CBD, one in the suburbs - helped cushion the economic ups and downs. However, it was still a grind with ever-shifting goal posts and price increases from suppliers and landlords.</p>
        
            <p>Compared to the Tory Street cafe, the one in Strathmore was going from strength to strength, McIntyre said. However, he saw a glimmer of hope on the horizon with more people coming back into the city.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm gambling on a bit of positivity ... time will tell."</p>
        
            <p>Next door at Bizarre Bazaar - which sells independent labels and vintage clothes - owner Jess Scott said even though 2024 was "pretty bleak", a loyal customer base kept the store alive.</p>
        
            <p>"We connect with a very specific facet of the community, and [while] they might not have the same amount of spending money, they still shop at every event and share a post."</p>
        
            <p>The 'day-ones' cared about the designers they loved, and so had stayed invested in the business, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The hope was to tread water over the coming year until she could open up a second store in Japan.</p>

            <p>Unity Books owner Adrian Hardingham said although 2024 had started off much slower than he would have liked, it finished on a high with booming Christmas sales.</p>
        
            <p>He was cautiously optimistic for the year ahead, with 2025 already looking promising and some "really good fiction" being published.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria McArthur, the co-owner of Fred's Sandwiches and The Ram on Cuba Street, said her team was working hard to bring the good vibes back to the city.</p>
        
            <p>While 2024 was not an easy year by any means and things were slower at the bar, the sandwich shop remained solid, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You just put your head down and keep working ... you just focus inwards and push through."</p>
        
            <p>Things were looking up so far this year and there seemed to be a positive shift in the capital's mood, McArthur said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's more of an energy in the city. We only opened last week after a bit of a break, but we hit the ground running. We've been super busy, which has been amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians loved "new things", McArthur said, and she suspected the business was still riding the coat-tails of being relatively fresh.</p>

            <p>Also new in town was Salut Pies, which had lines out the door on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Owner Joe Player said he knew he was moving into a tough economic climate when the business shifted from Ōtaki to Wellington in August, but trusted in the pies.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a full meal for cheap and that ticks a lot of boxes for a lot of people."</p>
        
            <p>He said the popularity of the shop had been "insane" and that it was regularly running out stock mid-afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say we've tripled in the last month and we're struggling to keep going past 2pm ... and we're meant to be open until 5pm."</p>
        
            <p>The coming year would see him "head down, arse up" focusing on making the best pies he could, he said.</p>
