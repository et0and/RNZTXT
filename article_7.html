            <p>Māori contributions to the economy have far surpassed the projected goal of '$100 billion by 2030,' a new report has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>The report conducted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's (MBIE) and Te Puni Kōkiri, Te Ōhanga Māori 2023, shows Māori entities have grown from contributing $17 billion to New Zealand's GDP in 2018 to $32 billion in 2023, turning a 6.5 percent contribution to GDP into 8.9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori asset base has grown from $69 billion in 2018 to $126 billion in 2023 - an increase of 83 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Of that sum, there is $66b in assets for Māori businesses and employers, $19b in assets for self-employed Māori and $41b in assets for Māori trusts, incorporations, and other Māori collectives including post settlement entities.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, $4.2b of New Zealand's economy came from agriculture, forestry, and fishing which made it the main contributor.</p>
        
            <p>Now, administrative, support, and professional services have taken the lead contributing $5.1b in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, Māori collectives own around half of all of New Zealand's agriculture, forestry, and fishing assets and remain the highest asset-rich sector.</p>
        
            <p>Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira manages political and public interests on behalf of Ngāti Toa including political interests, treaty claims, fisheries, health and social services, and environmental kaitiakitanga.</p>
        
            <p>Tumu Whakarae (CEO) Helmut Modlik said they are not focused on making money, but on "those who need it most".</p>

            <p>Ngāti Toa invested in water infrastructure and environmental projects, with a drive to replenish the whenua and improve community health. Like many iwi, they also invest in enterprises that deliver essential services such as health, housing and education.</p>
        
            <p>"We focus on long-term benefits rather than short-term gains, ensuring that our investments contribute to the sustainable development of our community," Modlik said.</p>
        
            <p>Between Covid-19 lockdown and 2023, the iwi grew their assets from $220 million to $850 million and increased their staff from 120 to over 600.</p>
        
            <p>Pou Ōhanga (Chief Economic Development & Investment Officer) Boyd Scirkovich said they took a 'people first' approach to decision making.</p>
        
            <p>"We focused on building local capacity and ensuring that our people had the resources and support they needed to navigate the challenges of the pandemic."</p>
        
            <p>The kinds of jobs Māori are working are also changing.</p>
        
            <p>Māori workers now hold more high-skilled jobs than low-skilled jobs with 46 percent in high-skilled jobs, 14 percent in skilled jobs, and 40 percent in low-skilled jobs.</p>
        
            <p>That is compared to 2018 when 37 percent of Māori were in high-skilled jobs and 51 percent in low-skilled jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Te Matapihi, a publicly accessible online data dashboard, has been created to compare data from 2018 and 2023.</p>
