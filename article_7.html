            <p>The country's biggest one-day music festival will be a two day affair next year, organisers say.</p>
        
            <p>Electric Avenue will be held on 21 and 22 February when it returns to Christchurch's Hagley Park, to mark its ten year anniversary.</p>
        
            <p>Festival director Callam Mitchell is forecasting the event to be "the biggest party in Australasia ...Next year's festival will be the equivalent of this year's one on steroids."</p>
        
            <p>About 60,000 people are expected through the gates over two days, including 35,000 for the final day of the weekend, a Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A post was shared on the event's social media channels on Wednesday, with an image displaying the number '2'.</p>
        
            <p>The festival has become a key annual fixture during the country's summer festival calendar since its inaugural event in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>A crowd of about 35,000 converged on Hagley Park for the event's most recent edition earlier this year, with The Chemical Brothers, Six60, L.A.B., Shapeshifter and Synthony No. 2 heading up the bill.</p>
        
            <p>It also proved to be a major cash cow for the Garden City.</p>
        
            <p>Economic development agency ChristchurchNZ said the festival pumped $6.3 million of visitor spend into the city.</p>
        
            <p>The full lineup of artists is expected to be revealed in early September, including 20 international and 40 local acts across four stages.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said they are "committed" to ensuring the starting price for a two-day general admission ticket will be capped at about 30 percent higher than the average price of a ticket to this year's event, amid the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Arduous economic times have reportedly hit the live music market across the Tasman hard.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's live music industry is the subject of a parliamentary inquiry at present, following a bumpy 12 months in which several major festivals were cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>However, Electric Avenue's promoters claim the live music scene here is going from "strength to strength".</p>
        
            <p>"As our profile has grown internationally, interest has grown among the artists who now really want to perform here - hence the reason for wanting to celebrate our 10th birthday with a bang," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately Electric Avenue is an opportunity for New Zealanders to experience a world-class event but save on the international airfare and not need to camp."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch mayor Phil Mauger said it was "amazing" to have an event of this scale in the heart of central Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"When we invest in events it's to develop them to become internationally significant, so this is a prime example."</p>
