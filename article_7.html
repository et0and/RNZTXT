        <p>
The supermarket has been closed for almost three weeks to eliminate the pests after the issue was first discovered late last year.

            <p>Countdown in Dunedin South is reopening for the public after dozens of rats were spotted on-site.</p>
        
            <p>The supermarket has been closed for almost three weeks to eliminate the pests after the issue was first discovered late last year.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 22 rats captured since 10 February.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths New Zealand director of stores Jason Stockill said he was confident the situation has been addressed.</p>
        
            <p>The situation took longer than expected to be controlled, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We, along with MPI and Rentokil, are confident the situation has been addressed and while it took longer than anyone wanted, we are happy to have the store open again."</p>
        
            <p>The store was open as of 8am.</p>
        
            <p>More than 30 cars were parked in the car park of the supermarket by 8.30am, an RNZ reporter said.</p>
        
            <p>The store first became aware of the unwanted rodents in October and initially thought they were crawling into the building.</p>
        
            <p>But last week, Woolworths confirmed it had found evidence of rats nesting in the supermarket's walls.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said food compliance officers would monitor the store for a period of time.</p>
        
            <p>"So that consumers can have confidence food at the store is safe. Third-party verification under the Food Act will also take place," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In South Dunedin, customers earlier told RNZ they have mixed ideas on whether they would return to the store.</p>
        
            <p>Some said the company had lost their business for not speaking out about the infestation from the start, while others planned to return once the store reopened.</p>
