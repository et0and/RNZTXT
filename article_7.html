            <p>Owner-occupiers eyeing greener pastures are taking on the residential property market in increasing numbers, according to a new report from Corelogic.</p>
        
            <p>The report shows the share of purchases made by movers or owner-occupiers edged up to 27 percent in April from 26 percent in Q1 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the proportion of first home buyers active in the market slipped to 25 percent in April, and mortgaged multiple property owners continue to sit at about 20-21 percent of activity, a low level compared to past standards.</p>
        
            <p>Chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said movers could see opportunities in the current market.</p>
        
            <p>"If you get a sale, you might get a certain price, and if you just shop around there is plenty of choice out there," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>"You might find that you can actually put a pretty good offer on the next property and you may come out slightly better off.</p>
        
            <p>"There is evidence that market downturns are good times to move around. You might be able to get a pretty good deal on the next property in a soft market."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the pent-up demand, owner-occupiers looking to re-locate are unlikely to crowd out other groups of buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's early days for any re-emergence of movers' demand, but looking ahead, they could be a group to watch as financial conditions start to ease with mortgage rates tipped to fall in 2025," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Corelogic data also shows new listings in April were 9 percent higher than the same month last year creating more choice for buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"It wouldn't be a surprise to see listings continue to flow in the coming months, especially if the shorter Brightline Test from the 1st of July prompts some investors to sell," he said.</p>
