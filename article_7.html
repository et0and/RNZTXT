            <p>Multiple Auckland supermarkets are reducing their trading hours over safety concerns, according to the supermarket workers' union.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Woolworths Point Chevalier announced it would cut down its opening hours to 12 hours a day. Shoppers in the central suburb now have from 8am to 8pm to get their groceries.</p>
        
            <p>A Woolworths spokesperson said the company made the decision in consultation with its workers' union to reduce the potential for anti-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>FIRST Union national secretary for retail and finance Rudd Hughes said three months ago, Woolworths Onehunga decided to close earlier in the day over similar concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"In Onehunga, they changed the hours there to finish earlier. That will help but it's certainly not a silver bullet."</p>
        
            <p>Instead of reducing hours, the Onehunga store opted to open earlier in the day and shut at 8pm instead of 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>In July, the supermarket reported physical assaults at its stores had increased by 50 percent compared to the previous 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>In the same 12 months, there had been 925 acts of violence and aggression, a 9 percent increase on the year before.</p>

            <p>Hughes said staff at the Pt Chev store were facing verbal and physical abuse and being spat on.</p>
        
            <p>He said Woolworths had a risk register for retail crime and abuse of staff, rating stores on a scale of no risk to very high.</p>
        
            <p>"Pt Chev is considered high. Given the amount of antisocial behaviour and threats from customers there, I want to know what very high would have to look like."</p>
        
            <p>He said roughly 33 stores across the country were deemed very high risk.</p>
        
            <p>"This is across Auckland and the country and across socio-economic areas."</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said supermarkets also needed to increase staff to protect workers.</p>
        
            <p>"They are putting in body cams and locking trolleys. But they need to have the right number of staff.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love to see them go for an in-house security team, rather than hiring security guards. That would be a major move towards providing a safer working environment."</p>
        
            <p>He said for staff at the Pt Chevalier supermarket, reducing their working hours was voluntary, but he did have some concerns about how it would affect their work.</p>
        
            <p>"If you don't reduce your hours you're going to be put into other areas of the shop."</p>
        
            <p>He said more supermarkets across the country would likely follow suit in changing their hours.</p>
