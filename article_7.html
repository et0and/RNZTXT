            <p>Researchers estimate long covid is costing the economy $2 billion a year in lost productivity.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the Public Health Communication Centre published a briefing summarising local and international research.</p>
        
            <p>It found there had been no robust analysis of long covid prevalence or productivity loss in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"But international estimates of economic impacts are concerning.</p>
        
            <p>"Long Covid is more than a health crisis-it also imposes an important economic burden."</p>
        
            <p>Economic analysis on the effects of long covid on productivity and GDP in Australia had recently been published, Auckland University health economist Professor Paula Lorgelly said.</p>
        
            <p>"The research suggests that long covid is likely costing the Australian economy approximately A$9.6 billion, equivalent to 0.5 percent of Australia's GDP. And that's a conservative estimate."</p>
        
            <p>The economic impact in New Zealand was likely comparable, equating to $2b per year she said.</p>
        
            <p>"While this is an estimate, it's plausible that long covid significantly impacts productivity here."</p>
        
            <p>Lorgelly told Morning Report the Long Covid Registry did have corroborating information about people working less hours and doing less activities because of their health.</p>
        
            <p>Long covid symptoms included fatigue, cognitive burdens, muscle and joint pain.</p>
        
            <p>"All the things that make going to work and being productive difficult," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A conservative estimate of New Zealand's long covid Cases was 4 percent, given the early lockdown and vaccination programme, Lorgelly said.</p>
        
            <p>And people who go sick should stay home and rest, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't do what the Olympians did".</p>
        
            <p>Otago University Associate Professor Amanda Kvalsvig said more needed to be done to prevent infection and reinfection.</p>
        
            <p>That included improving air quality in schools and workplaces, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Covid-19 vaccines are proven to reduce the risk of long covid and that knowledge should be reflected in NZ's vaccine strategy. Eligibility for boosters should be expanded to younger age groups with a strong emphasis on occupations at increased risk such as teachers."</p>
        
            <p>The report also suggested more local research was needed to quantify the true cost of long covid on the New Zealand economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Without accurate data, it will be difficult for policymakers to make informed decisions about how to efficiently and equitably protect New Zealanders from the health and economic harms of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic."</p>
        
            <p>Extended sick leave policies, workplace accommodations and safety assessments, and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes were also needed, the report said.</p>
