            <p>Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr says global central banks will have to hang onto higher interest rates for longer than financial markets have been expecting.</p>
        
            <p>Orr was quizzed by business leaders at a Business Canterbury lunch on Friday - the former Employers Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        
            <p>During questioning, he described the state of the New Zealand economy as "sound and stable", and warned the biggest risks are offshore - notably the slowdown in China.</p>
        
            <p>But Orr said in the near term, the level of interest rates would be a challenge.</p>
        
            <p>"Central banks are going to hang tough for longer than markets have been pricing for quite some time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Orr referred to the "surprisingly, slightly warm" inflation numbers from the United States last week.</p>
        
            <p>"So financial markets ... they think 'OK, is this it, is this the peak? And so my game is to pick when's the next cut, when's the first cut,'" he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you've got a forward interest rate curve that was declining quite steeply towards the end of last year, it means asset prices are really pumped up," Orr said.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank's indicative forecasts from last week pointed to no rate cuts until mid-2025.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the central bank held the official cash rate at 5.5 percent, but repeated concerns about stubborn inflation pressures, and dashed hopes of early rate cuts.</p>
        
            <p>It said headline inflation remained above the 1 to 3 percent target band, limiting the Monetary Policy Committee's ability to tolerate "upside inflation surprises".</p>
        
            <p>However, the statement was described by economists as less aggressive than the November monetary policy statement.</p>
