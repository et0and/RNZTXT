            <p>The number of job ads rose last month for the first time since July - but conditions remain tough for those looking for a job.</p>
        
            <p>The Seek Employment Report shows ads rose 1 percent in November, though applications per job ad also rose 3 percent month on month.</p>
        
            <p>"While demand for workers in most industries has declined throughout the year there are some that have bucked the trend, notably banking & financial Services where ad volumes have boomed over the past two months," Seek country manager Rob Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>Growth in the industrial and construction sectors drove a large portion of the overall rise in November.</p>
        
            <p>"There were nominal month-on-month rises in Wellington, Canterbury and Auckland which solidifies a period of relative stability for these regions over the past five months, after over a year of broad decline."</p>
        
            <p>But most of the largest hiring industries declined month on month including healthcare & medical (down 7 percent) and information & communication technology (down 6 percent).</p>
        
            <p>The Seek quarterly report on advertised salaries showed there was a 3.1 percent quarterly rise in the three months ended in November, or 3.1 percent on the year.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the rate of annual growth continued to slow, average advertised salaries continue to outpace the annual inflation rate," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"Government and government-related industries were among those that grew the fastest, with education & training, government and healthcare & medical among those that outpaced inflation more than twice over."</p>
