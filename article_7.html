            <p>A new survey is pointing to improving sentiment among consumers, but shows households are not quite yet ready to open up their wallets.</p>
        
            <p>The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer consumer confidence index rose 1 point in December to 93.1, with pessimists continuing to outweigh optimists.</p>
        
            <p>It painted a similar picture to a Westpac survey earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>In more bad news for retailers, a net 25 percent of people felt it was a bad time to buy a major household item, unchanged from the previous month.</p>
        
            <p>Two-year inflation expectations fell from 4.6 percent to 3.9 percent, the lowest level in three years, which ANZ said was likely driven by a fall in petrol prices.</p>
        
            <p>"Willingness to spend remain slow, as the RBNZ [Reserve Bank] requires in order to bring inflation down, and consumers' inflation expectations finally took a renewed decent leg lower - even if it is likely largely due to fickle petrol prices," ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said.</p>
        
            <p>Households appeared to be more positive about their own outlook, with a net 25 percent expecting to be financially better off in a year's time, the best result since mid-2021.</p>
        
            <p>However, perceptions about their current financial situation remained low, despite an improvement.</p>
        
            <p>"The wide gap between the current and forward-looking questions in the survey persists. This is typical during and after periods in which the economy is weak, such as 2009-10," Zollner said.</p>
