            <p>Consumers are drinking less but many more are reaching for the top shelf when they do, says Spirits New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Spirits NZ chief executive Robert Brewer says wine and beer consumption is down in New Zealand and nearing a freefall in some overseas markets, but local spirits distillers are still chugging along.</p>
        
            <p>He said the industry was feeling the economic recession, but had been somewhat insulated from the overall drop in alcohol consumption.</p>
        
            <p>"Although consumers are drinking less and less harmfully when they do spend, they tend to buy premium which is right in the spirits industry's sweet spot."</p>
        
            <p>He said the popularity of gin and an emerging cocktail-culture meant spirit consumption was holding its own.</p>
        
            <p>The mix of alcohol available for consumption changed between 2023 and 2009, with beer dropping by 41 percent from 36 percent; wine down by 29 percent from 33 percent; and spirits, including cocktails, up 35 percent from 26 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Brewer said changing demand for premium spirits aligned with the growth in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty years ago you could have counted the truly commercial NZ distilleries on two hands," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today there are almost 200 and although some will struggle given the current trading environment I get the sense that, in true Kiwi fashion, most will come through and continue to put New Zealand on the global map as a premium spirit producer."</p>
        
            <p>Brewer said the industry was managing its challenges with a positive outlook for 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's clear that that there will there will likely be some retrenchment in the industry... but the New Zealand distillers are an innovative, creative, passionate lot."</p>
        
            <p>He said the spirit industry's export market was also expected to grow beyond current annual levels of between $40 and $50 million.</p>
