            <p>Buy Now Pay Later providers are targeting alcohol merchants and products because of sector deregulation and the weak economy, a credit risk adviser says.</p>
        
            <p>Last month the government removed some consumer protections to allow Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) schemes to set late or default fees as they see fit.</p>
        
            <p>The government argued market competition and the Fair Trading Act was enough to prevent providers exploiting consumers.</p>
        
            <p>But credit risk advisory firm Happy Prime chief executive Meurig Chapman said without ethical and responsible lending guidance these schemes have free rein on the market.</p>
        
            <p>He said this was increasing harm for people using BNPL to survive the economic downturn.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last year, increasingly, providers of buy now pay later services have been targeting merchants such as off licenses with buy now pay later product... and I think it's increasingly started to materialise with the challenges we're having in the economy around the struggle of consumers to pay for everyday transactions</p>
        
            <p>"I think that buy now pay later providers are seeing an opportunity to provide their services."</p>
        
            <p>A search for "alcohol" on the Afterpay New Zealand website returns 100 results, including liquor stores, alcohol brands and gift box shops, while Zip has three results.</p>
        
            <p>Chapman said BNPL needed to be regulated the same way as other forms of credit, to protect consumers.</p>
        
            <p>"Excluding buy now pay later from the CCCFA [the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act] allows them to have looser assessment criteria for offering those services to customers, and the unintended consequence of that could be that they would be in and do hardship.</p>
        
            <p>"Increasingly we're start to see more and more people using buy now pay later, and they're missing their repayments and are subject to fees from those providers."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ contacted Afterpay, Zip and the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment for comment.</p>
