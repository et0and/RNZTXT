            <p>Imagine virtual wine tastings from 31,000 feet, robot room service and exploring countries from the comfort of a couch.</p>
        
            <p>That's what the tourism industry is exploring with new technology emerging at a rapid pace.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of industry leaders have been discussing if they are ready - or not - at the Tourism Summit Aotearoa in Te Whanganui a Tara Wellington on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The robot revolution has already arrived at Sudima Hotels, and chief operating officer Les Morgan said they were handy helpers to have around.</p>
        
            <p>"Now with the addition of a service bot, it is possible to get a cocktail to your door without having to speak, smile or put on pants for a stranger."</p>
        
            <p>One hotel has two service robots, serving 90 percent of orders.</p>
        
            <p>"Their hours are equal to about 1.5 (full-time equivalents) or approximately $90,000 per annum in wages.</p>
        
            <p>"They require no induction, no training, no staff meals, no leave."</p>
        
            <p>Morgan said he did not want hotels to become sterile, staff-free places, but the robots had their uses and could save time.</p>
        
            <p>From next year, Sudima will introduce specialist robots to clean common areas and act as helpers for staff to transfer linen and products.</p>
        
            <p>Sky Motion uses virtual reality to help people explore places they may never have travelled to before.</p>
        
            <p>Director Soraya Sarwary described it as immersive storytelling, using 360-degree sights, surround sound, and motion pods.</p>
        
            <p>"The way that I best describe it is it feels as if you're standing in a location, rather than just watching it. Giving you the freedom to basically look wherever you want and get a good feel."</p>
        
            <p>It did not replace travel, but it gave people an immersive preview to help them decide where they'd like to visit, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It can also make travel more accessible to those who could not hop on a plane.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think anything would be able to replace that experience, so as detailed as we can go into giving people as much of a taste. You can't get a sun tan from this technology."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand is working with digital bag tags where people can link their luggage to their phones, cutting out the paper printouts and kiosks for check-in.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Greg Foran said it had acquired plenty of new technology - both on the drawing board or already here.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine a flight where virtual reality can change your perception of time, offering mindfulness, meditation and ambient lighting to aid sleep.</p>
        
            <p>"Picture yourself playing a cabin-wide game and watching a movie alongside your family while they're still at home on the couch. Virtual wine tastings set against stunning New Zealand backdrops."</p>
        
            <p>The airline is keeping an eye on supersonic and hypersonic travel, which is five times the speed of sound.</p>
        
            <p>In the shorter term - about three years away - its first commercial electric plane is expected to take flight.</p>
        
            <p>"We're investigating the role of drones as it may pertain to Air New Zealand and our role in connecting people, and then also single-seater electric planes that require no licence - other than a few hours' training - but can replace short distance car travel."</p>
