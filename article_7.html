            <p>Three of the country's top banks have cut mortgage rates again ahead of the Reserve Bank's meeting next week.</p>
        
            <p>Wholesale interest rates have fallen in recent weeks in anticipation of the central bank loosening monetary policy.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ has dropped almost all of its short term fixed housing rates.</p>
        
            <p>Longer term rates between 3 and 5 years saw the biggest drop of 40 basis points to 5.99 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Short term rates from six months to two years have fallen by between 6 and 16 basis points, while longer term deposit rates are well below 6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, ASB has lowered its fixed home rates with longer term rates all below 6 percent and the popular two year rate by 24 basis points to 6.25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Its term deposits between 9 months and 5 years have dropped by up to 30 basis points.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank has followed suit, cutting its special fixed term rates between 6 and 30 basis points with its two year rate now at 6.34 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Most of Kiwibank's term deposit rates have dropped 10 basis points but its 1 year rate is down 15 to 5.65 percent and its 2 year rate is down 20 to 5.25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ will meet on Wednesday 14 August and publish the monetary policy statement in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The official cash rate has sat tight at 5.5 percent since May 2023 but banks are predicting cuts this year, potentially in October and November.</p>
