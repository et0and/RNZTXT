        <h2>South Auckland market celebrates entrepreneurs, ‘Southside pride’ and karaoke</h2>
        <p>
A vibrant new market is transforming South Auckland, offering local Māori and Pacific entrepreneurs a fee-free platform to showcase their products, with space, gear, and power provided.

            <p>The sweet aroma of fresh cuisine fills the air, blending with the sounds of live karaoke performances in the Manukau car parks.</p>

            <p>"We're trying to create a space for our people where we can all come together and collaborate," said Waikare Komene, founder of The Roots.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a space for us to connect, collaborate, and work together. If we're all in silos and isolated, we're disconnected."</p>
        
            <p>Held on Sunday afternoon, ManniX Market features a variety of contributors - from passionate creators to experienced business owners - creating a warm atmosphere after church.</p>

            <p>Komene, known as an "architect by profession, tutu by nature," collaborates with RepFM founder Toko Manuel.</p>
        
            <p>The pair have worked closely with Eke Panuku for years, promoting events that unite South Auckland's communities.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just about Southside pride," Komene said. "Bringing all Southsiders together - it doesn't matter if you're from Ōtara, Rewa, Kura, or Māngere."</p>
        
            <p>Eke Panuku Development supports the creative collectives behind ManniX Markets, fostering long-term community growth, sustainability, and business opportunities.</p>

Vendors are supported as there is no fee charged to set up and sell food or merchandise.

            <p>RepFM also runs Passion to Profession (P2P), a 10-week course that empowers aspiring entrepreneurs. Graduates trial their products or services in the markets, gaining real-world feedback.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all about finding that passion in these guys' entrepreneurship and what they really love to do," Manuel said.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of the year, we utilise this market for them to trial everything they've worked on."</p>

            <p>Komene's goal extends beyond community unity to include sustainability.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to be the first market to be fully sustainable in terms of sorting and collecting rubbish, getting kai down to the local compost, and supporting community gardens," he explained.</p>
        
            <p>"The music, the entertainment, and the sustainability aspect - that's what makes us unique.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have kai and music, that's the winning combo. So, if you're going to sit down, have some mean kai, and listen to Southside music, what a beautiful day that is."</p>
        
            <p>While the market supports Māori and Pacific businesses, it includes all locals.</p>
        
            <p>The timing is designed to avoid clashing with other established markets in Māngere and Ōtara, offering a space where untapped talent can thrive, like a six-year-old graffiti artist who sold 18 canvases and turned his passion into a business.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what we're about, giving people a platform to shine," Manuel said.</p>

            <p>Ana Pihuru arrived at the markets with her family and was gifted a beautiful poi from a local wahine.</p>
        
            <p>"We just got here, and we were gifted this beautiful poi. We look forward to browsing and buying some stuff."</p>
        
            <p>Zhaiyne Gray and Racheal Swanell, from family-owned Grayze Food Vendor, appreciate the supportive environment for Pacific and Māori entrepreneurs.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm all about supporting our communities and bringing them up," Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>"We got approached to come here and set up alongside every other vendor," Gray said. "The organisers made it real easy. Everything's organised, so it was really easy to come in."</p>
        
            <p>Gray appreciates the relaxed atmosphere, adding that the karaoke competition makes it fun and different from the usual market scene.</p>

            <p>XMT Creations, operated by a local family, values ManniX Markets for its supportive community.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always been looked after, so we've always been there," said the founder. He is passionate about the growth of Māori and Pasifika businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"Māori and PI businesses have just grown so much in the last few years, and it's important to keep it going."</p>
