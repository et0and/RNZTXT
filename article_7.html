            <p>Shareholders are being warned to be mindful of low-ball offers amid offshore interest for listed New Zealand companies.</p>
        
            <p>Semiconductor maker Rakon was the latest to get a surprise offer, with the company assessing the bid because of shareholder pressure.</p>
        
            <p>But so far this year bids have been made and rejected for ERoad, Sky TV and Metroglass.</p>
        
            <p>Church donations tech company Pushpay was taken over, but it took a shareholder revolt to get a higher price.</p>
        
            <p>Craigs Investment Partners investment director, Mark Lister, said offshore interest could be a seen a vote of confidence in local firms, but investors should weigh up each offer carefully.</p>
        
            <p>"We do need to be mindful of some of those bids coming in at a time when investor sentiment is low, when some of these companies are undervalued," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want to give things away at the bottom of the cycle and give them away too cheaply."</p>
        
            <p>Lister said it was a "double-edged sword" as offshore interest was welcomed, but it would not be good to see companies "disappear at low prices".</p>
        
            <p>Lister said expectations that interest rates could fall in the new year was a good sign for the New Zealand share market, as the local market was more sensitive to rate changes due to the large number of companies in real estate and utilities.</p>
        
            <p>He said the NZX has underperformed for two years, but the prospect of rate cuts could mean a change in fortunes.</p>
        
            <p>"When we are at the point where OCR [Official Cash Rate] cuts are closer and on the horizon and term deposit rates start coming down, I think investors will very quickly realise that they need to make their money work a bit harder for them, [rather] than just leaving it in the bank on the sidelines."</p>
        
            <p>Lister said that could be "the catalyst" for the share market "to come into its own again".</p>
