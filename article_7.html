            <p>Some people trying to change from one mobile or broadband provider to another end up being billed twice, the Commerce Commission says.</p>
        
            <p>It was calling for changes to improve the industry's switching processes after research showed it was not working as it should.</p>
        
            <p>The commission found 30 percent of New Zealanders did not want to change provider even if they could save money because the process seemed too hard.</p>
        
            <p>"We're concerned that 50 percent of mobile switchers and 45 percent of broadband switchers ran into at least one issue when switching and that 29 percent of mobile switchers and 27 percent of broadband switchers said the whole experience was so bad they wouldn't want to switch again in future," Telecommunications Commissioner Tristan Gilbertson said.</p>
        
            <p>More than a quarter said the whole experience was so bad they would not want to switch again in future.</p>
        
            <p>He said a lack of protocols between the "gaining" service provider and the "losing" service provider seems to be the central issue with the current switching process, leading to double billing, unexpected charges and delays.</p>
        
            <p>"We see an important opportunity for the industry to work towards addressing these issues and we welcome the indications received from the TCF, the telecommunications industry forum, that they're keen to work with us to explore this further."</p>
        
            <p>Gilbertson said having a healthy, competitive market means ensuring consumers face no or very low barriers to change between competing products and providers.</p>
        
            <p>"It will take some time to improve the process, but we still encourage consumers to shop around for the best deal for them and, if they want to switch, work with their new provider to help ensure the process runs as smoothly as possible."</p>
