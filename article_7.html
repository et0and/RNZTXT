            <p>Landlords will again be able to claim tax deductions for interest on residential investment properties from Monday, but experts aren't convinced it will lower rent prices.</p>
        
            <p>A property economist says reducing costs for landlords may increase competition in the housing market.</p>
        
            <p>The deduction scheme was removed by the previous government, and reinstating it was part of the coalition agreement between National and Act.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, landlords will be able to write off 80 percent of their mortgage interest, rising to 100 percent from April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>ACT had initially asked for a 60 percent deduction to be backdated for this past financial year, effectively giving landlords a tax refund.</p>
        
            <p>However, ACT backed down on this, with David Seymour saying earlier this month it was "probably not worth the amount of benefit it would have given".</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said although it would not necessarily decrease rent prices, it might slow their growth.</p>
        
            <p>When interest deductibility was removed, rent prices did not climb at a faster pace, so its reintroduction would not necessarily bring them down.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe some landlords might pass through cost savings to tenants, but there's just bigger forces at work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The research says rents are driven more by supply and demand, and by tenants' wages, than they are landlords' costs."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said it might encourage more investors into the rental market, which would increase the supply of properties up for grabs.</p>
        
            <p>But this, too, came with complications.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have more property investors, then at the margins you might have fewer owner-occupiers. Those people who are renting and might be thinking about buying a property could potentially find themselves with a bit more competition."</p>
        
            <p>He said it would not necessarily shut out first-home buyers specifically, but it would increase the competition across the board.</p>
        
            <p>Property Investors Federation president Sue Harrison said the effect on renters would not be instantaneous.</p>
        
            <p>She said it would be about two years until the benefits of interest deductibility began to trickle down - and whether rent increased, depended on interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Once interest rates ease a bit, that's when you'll see some flow-through," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said landlords had been struggling to pay mortgages and do maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>"The government relies on private people providing housing, and when they make that hard, the housing's not there, so who actually suffers? It's the renters."</p>
        
            <p>She said she knew of landlords who had sold up, saying running a rental property was just too expensive, and vacancy rates were incredibly low.</p>
        
            <p>She was hopeful the rule changes would encourage more people to buy or retain properties, and then rent them out.</p>
