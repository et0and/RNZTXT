            <p>Fletcher Building says class action proceedings have been filed in the Federal Court of Australia over leaky pipes manufactured by its subsidiary, Iplex Pipelines Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher said it will make no further comment on the action taken by law firm Baker McKenzie on behalf of people who bought the polybutylene pipes, which later developed leaks.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher previously stated the problem with leaky pipes installed in Perth, Australia was a result of installation errors and not a manufacturing problem.</p>
        
            <p>Iplex intended to defend the proceedings.</p>
