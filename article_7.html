            <p>Regulatory worries are set to continue for casino operator SkyCity, with the resumption of an independent review into the suitability of its Adelaide casino licence.</p>
        
            <p>The review was launched in 2022 but was paused in 2023, as the company faced court proceedings against the same casino for breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules in South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The court proceedings have now concluded, with the Adelaide casino ordered to pay $73.6 million over the breaches.</p>
        
            <p>In a share market announcement on Wednesday, SkyCity said the review's findings would be reported to the South Australian Liquor and Gambling Commissioner by the end of 2024 - although the deadline could be extended.</p>
        
            <p>The review would look into SkyCity's operations to ensure the company was still suitable to hold a casino licence.</p>
        
            <p>Similar probes into rival casino companies in Australia found a number of shortcomings.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity also faces the threat of a temporary suspension of its New Zealand casino licence for breaches of its host responsibility code.</p>
        
            <p>The company was recently ordered to pay $4m after admitting breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws in New Zealand.</p>
