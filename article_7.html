            <p>The developer of a grocery price comparison app says supermarkets have responded positively to the online tool.</p>
        
            <p>In his spare time, Aucklander Roc Wong built a free app called "Grocer" that compares the cost of grocery items at different supermarkets in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It works by scraping public data from different supermarket websites and apps to build a database of prices. The average price variance for individual items is $2.</p>
        
            <p>Wong told Nine to Noon that, contrary to speculation, supermarkets support the app, as long as the prices are updated and remain accurate.</p>
        
            <p>"From my point of view, building Grocer wasn't about challenging supermarkets. It was about providing myself and other consumers with a tool to make informed produce decisions and potentially maximise value for our spending."</p>
        
            <p>Wong said that Grocer is his side project and currently runs on sponsors.</p>
        
            <p>"But apart from that there are no financial transactions happening within the app... For me as an individual it's not very sustainable. I have to constantly reply to email queries, while also finding time to do the coding."</p>
        
            <p>But he is working with his co-founders to seek investment to build better features and a bigger business.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a long term vision for the app but it is primarily focused on making sure we make the best application that makes a material impact on getting the most for consumer budgets.</p>
        
            <p>"People can still feel powerless and that they have to accept the price of food when they have a fixed budget. Our app gives them a better choice".</p>
        
            <p>Last Thursday, the Grocery Commissioner Pierre van Heerden told Nine to Noon he would like consumers to be able to order their shopping through grocery comparison apps.</p>
        
            <p>"They could have a consumer facing app where you can go and put your grocery list in. Then with AI and algorithms they can work out your best price and say we are placing the orders with these supermarkets.</p>
        
            <p>"So you can get three deliveries from three different supermarkets with the best price. I believe that is something that will force all supermarkets to bring prices down."</p>
        
            <p>Wong said the commissioner's idea was possible but he would need more time and financial support.</p>
        
            <p>"In the current form of Grocer it's not that sustainable to build all those functionalities based on the donations and sponsorship. That's one of the reasons we're seeking investment to transform into a real business."</p>
        
            <p>Wong said he would like to see supermarket vendors help app developers.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope the vendors can provide a public interface for developers like me to build these kinds of third party apps to facilitate price comparisons and all other kinds of grocery activities there."</p>
