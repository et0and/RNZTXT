            <p>Banks are ready to begin rolling out a confirmation of payee services which is expected to cut down on transaction errors and scams.</p>
        
            <p>The service known as CoP for short, was set up by banks, but would be managed by GetVerified.</p>
        
            <p>GetVerified chief executive Duncan Robertson said New Zealand was among the first countries to roll out the CoP service nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Major banks plan to begin offering the service over the next three to four months, with services by other financial service providers to follow.</p>
        
            <p>Bank customers would notice the service when paying someone new, when editing an existing payee or making a one-off payment.</p>
        
            <p>Instead of relying on initials or nicknames, customers will need to provide both the account name and number of the recipient, which need to match up with bank records.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said a no-match result will serve as a red flag to customers.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no blocks to making payments, regardless of the result. But we encourage everyone to take a moment and think carefully before proceeding," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A partial match could be due to a typo or the use of initials instead of a full name, while no match suggested the account name may not match the intended recipient.</p>
        
            <p>"We recommend customers pause and double-check with the person they're paying, to ensure correct account details. Only proceed if you are confident in the match and trust the recipient," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Scammers are constantly evolving their tactics and CoP will not fully protect customers from scams."</p>
