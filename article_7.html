            <p>Surf's up for Aucklanders, with the announcement that a new wavepark facility is coming to the city's North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>The multi-million-dollar project is slated to break ground later this year, and features a world-class training facility, surf-school, as well as restaurants and accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>It was announced to a packed room of surfies and stakeholders today, with everyone - including the city's mayor - foaming to get out amongst it.</p>
        
            <p>Located in-land in Dairy Flat, the brand new wavepark from global surf park developers Aventuur will take advantage of a soon-to-be constructed Spark data centre to keep waves nice and toasty.</p>
        
            <p>Aventuur spokesperson Trevor McKewen said the surf park was a world first.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a seven-hectare solar farm that will create renewable energy which the data centre will use," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The excess heat from the data centre will be then funnelled into the surf pool to heat it, which New Zealand surfers will tell you, is a god-send.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no other pool in the world that has done this."</p>

            <p>McKewen said the project was a huge undertaking.</p>
        
            <p>"Most things are normally quoted around this as being a hundred million dollar project, that's what pools are about.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the pool part only, it doesn't take in Spark's elements of their contribution and what they're doing with the data centre," said McKewen.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a massive, massive project, not just for Auckland, but New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The surf-park received resource consent, meaning it was all take-off for those wanting to take part.</p>
        
            <p>A number of famous faces were in attendance for the reveal, including pro surfers Adrian 'Ace' Buchan and Glenn 'Micro Hall.</p>

            <p>Paris Olympic surfing representative Billy Stairmand was also there, just weeks before he sets off to Tahiti for the games.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only three weeks away, we fly over in three weeks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to the challenge, it's a big, intense, scary wave, but again I think I've got the ability to beat anyone over there and hopefully bring a medal home for New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>He said the park was an exciting opportunity for New Zealand surfers.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a massive opportunity for, not only the development of surfing and the next generation of competitive surfers, but surfing in general."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown - a keen surfer himself - agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a fantastic addition to what we've got already," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got a whole lot of advantages if they get the data centre up, and use the wasted water, it sends a lot of good messages, I love it, it's a great thing."</p>

            <p>Addressing the crowd, Brown said the surf park would not put added costs on ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"I supported this proposal because it offers local employment and business opportunities on a scale which Auckland can play a role in the recovery of the tourism industry, and best of all, it didn't cost ratepayers a cent."</p>
        
            <p>Those wanting to hit the totally tubular waves would have to hang-10, however, as the park is expected to open by summer of 2026, or the year after.</p>
