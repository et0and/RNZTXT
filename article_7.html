            <p>Meridian Energy has paused plans to build one of the world's largest-scale green hydrogen facilities in Southland, but is not ruling out the project in the future.</p>
        
            <p>The Southern Green Hydrogen project has been in the works for years.</p>
        
            <p>In its annual results released on Wednesday, Meridian chief executive Neal Barclay said the economics of producing green hydrogen at scale had become more challenging.</p>
        
            <p>"Markets have been slow to resolve the gap between the cost of producing green hydrogen and potential customers' willingness to pay for it."</p>
        
            <p>Meridian Energy announced a $429m profit, four times higher, than the previous year this week.</p>
        
            <p>Australian resource firm Woodside Energy was named as a preferred partner to develop the project in 2022, but that partnership has now wrapped up, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He was not ruling out progressing the project when the time was right.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to actively monitor our target markets as we believe Southern Green Hydrogen remains well placed to be a competitive green hydrogen opportunity, compared to other projects and jurisdictions," Barclay said.</p>
