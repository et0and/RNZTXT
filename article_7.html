            <p>Mitre 10 is set to take over the location of a central Wellington Warehouse outlet when the red shed is vacated this year.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week the Warehouse confirmed it would close the Tory Street store as its lease was not likely to be renewed.</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse has operated out of the Tory Street location since 1994.</p>

            <p>The store was closed for nearly a year after a fire in April 2023 while it awaited needed repairs and refurbishment.</p>
        
            <p>Mitre 10 said in a statement its new location would include a green garden area and a cafe.</p>
        
            <p>It would be run by Brendan Hall who also owns Mitre 10 Crofton Downs.</p>
        
            <p>"Brendan and the team are looking forward to bringing the Mitre 10 experience to the Te Aro community, contributing to the local economy and providing employment opportunities to the local area.</p>
        
            <p>Mitre 10 will have access to the site from July and anticipates a new store opening towards the end of 2025, or early 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Warehouse general manager of national store operations, Shane Nalder, said earlier in the week they loved being part of the city community for three decades.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, we've exhausted all options to stay at this site.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not the outcome we wanted."</p>
        
            <p>Commonsense Organics had its store in the same complex as the Warehouse's central city outlet.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ ahead of Mitre 10's confirmation chief executive Anna Pitches said news of the Warehouse's closure had made her "a little nervous".</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to have other flourishing retail outlets in our neighbourhood and [the Warehouse] does bring extra foot traffic into the area and incidental customers who come to us as well," Pitches said.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped that any new business in the area would complement her store's ethically sourced produce and environmentally conscious ethos.</p>
        
            <p>Pitches said if Mitre 10 was to open a store in the location the New Zealand owned and operated businesses would be ideal.</p>
        
            <p>"One hundred percent, I think that would be a great fit for that site.</p>
        
            <p>"We like aligned businesses of course but ultimately it's just about it being vibrant and bringing people to the area so that there's additional foot traffic and a full carpark and that it doesn't turn into a wasteland," Pitches said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Commonsense did notice a small impact on their turnover when the Warehouse was closed due to fire damage in 2023 but she wasn't concerned about disruption caused by the construction and fitout of a new business at the location.</p>

            <p>Kamer Okleh, 12, was visiting the Red Shed with her parents this week.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would be sad to see the business go as her family shopped there regularly and it had often been the source of some of her favourite toys.</p>
        
            <p>"This is kinda like my childhood Warehouse. So I'm a little sad it's going to close down but I'm excited to see what it will hold for the future," Okleh said.</p>
