            <p>Third quarter retail trade figures are expected to reflect a difficult period for consumers, retailers and the economy.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ is expected to release the latest retail sales data at the end of the week, with economists forecasting a further drop in overall spending.</p>
        
            <p>The volume of seasonally adjusted second quarter retail sales fell 1 percent from the March quarter, with the value of sales down slightly by 0.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac senior economist Satish Ranchhod was forecasting a 2 percent drop in third quarter retail spending, with core retail spending - which excluded fuel and motor vehicle costs - likely to see a more moderate drop.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing pressures on household budgets on two big fronts. First, inflation is still quite high. That's eroding the spending power. We've also seen big increases in interest costs; that's constraining their ability to spend," Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the upcoming spending figures will reinforce what is a softening picture for the economy. That's likely to make the Reserve Bank feel more comfortable about keeping the OCR on hold at that upcoming November policy meeting."</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Bank senior economist Miles Workman said a drop in retail spending was what the Reserve Bank was hoping for.</p>
        
            <p>"They are trying to get households to tighten their belt, because until households are in belt-tightening mode, they are not going to get the downwards pressure on CPI inflation that they're trying to engineer."</p>
        
            <p>Workman was forecasting a 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in the volume of retail sales, with perhaps an increase in values, given the high inflationary environment.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank was targeting annual inflation of between 1 and 3 percent, which compared with the September quarter's annual inflation of rate of 5.6 percent.</p>
