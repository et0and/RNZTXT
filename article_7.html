The time may be coming to lock in, so here's how you can spot it.

            <p>If you're thinking about fixing a mortgage, you're probably wondering what term to choose.</p>
        
            <p>All the major banks are offering one-year fixes of 5.79 percent, according to Mortgagerates.co.nz, while there is 5.49 percent on offer for two years, and 5.59 percent for terms from three years out to five.</p>
        
            <p>The official cash rate is expected to fall further this year, but much of the drop has already been priced into rates.</p>
        
            <p>So is it worth taking a longer term?</p>
        
            <p>Infometrics chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan conducted some analysis of interest rates based on a $100,000 mortgage.</p>
        
            <p>He looked at the total interest rate cost over a five-year period on a floating rate, fixing every year on a one-year rate, fixing every two years on a two-year rate and fixing every three- four- and five years on those longer rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously these strategies are somewhat simplistic, because people are likely to fix for different terms depending on what rates are on offer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it demonstrates the cost or savings of blindly sticking to one strategy, or picking the wrong length of time to fix for."</p>
        
            <p>He used forecasts of mortgage rates in the coming years, and actual rates for years in the past. The calculation was done on interest only.</p>
        
            <p>He said if someone fixed for one year in March 2021, and continued to fix for one year each March after that, by March 2026 they would have paid $25,530 in interest.</p>
        
            <p>"If you'd repeatedly fixed for two years from this date, your interest would total $23,620; three years, $21,410; four years, $17,603; five years, $15,050; floating, $34,879. Clearly fixing for five years at 3.01 percent was the best option, with the benefit of mostly hindsight."</p>
        
            <p>But he said that was unusual. Usually fixing for five years did not turn out to be the best option.</p>
        
            <p>"Apart from 2020/21, the only other times are a few small windows in the mid-2000s. In fact, between 2007 and 2018, a five-year fix was almost always the most expensive option, often by a considerable margin.</p>
        
            <p>"Typically, fixing for five years is going to be most attractive - or perhaps least unattractive - just before five-year rates start to rise. Of course, you don't know when that is going to occur, but jumping in just after they've started rising can sometimes be ok - it doesn't necessarily turn out cheaper than other options, but the scope for regret tends to be less.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, you also end up paying a bit of a premium for the certainty associated with rates of three to five years. Sometimes this premium is so large that floating would have been better."</p>
        
            <p>He said one- and two-year rates were rarely more expensive than floating and the one-year rate was often the lowest available.</p>
        
            <p>On average, over the past 10 years, a series of one-year fixes would have cost $23,842.11 over five years on a $100,000 home loan, compared to $24,250.41 for two-year fixes and just over $25,000 for three-year fixes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really difficult to pick, but shorter fixed terms will generally be more cost-effective. The time you should consider longer terms is when they've just started pushing upwards - even if they're the highest rates compared to shorter terms on offer at the time."</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr said he favoured splitting his own loan into smaller parts across a range of fixes. "And I think rates have a little further to fall."</p>
        
            <p>Corelogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said there had been a "stampede" to short loans. "To the point where 47 percent of new lending in November was floating, and it's not hard to imagine a similarly quick shift the other way if/when the RBNZ signals some kind of end or slowing to OCR cuts, and possibly global uncertainty lingers."</p>
        
            <p>He said the data indicated people did not see much value in those longer rates yet.</p>
        
            <p>"But I could imagine it happening this year. We should probably all learn a lesson from 2021 when taking the candy of the shortest or one-year rates didn't prove to be the best strategy - of course, you only ever know that in hindsight. And of course, some people may well see value in the current longer rates for their own situation if they just want certainty."</p>
