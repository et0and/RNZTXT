            <p>The potential new owner of the Whakapapa ski field has expressed interest in operating the famous Chateau Tongariro hotel.</p>
        
            <p>The building located near Mount Ruapehu was shut indefinitely in February 2023 due to its high earthquake risk.</p>
        
            <p>Whakapapa Holdings has expressed interest in redeveloping it and running the hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Its director Tom Elworthy said it was an integral part of the tourism offering around the Whakapapa Village and the national park area.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a material number of beds during the off season for the summer tourism operation both on the mountain but also the Tongariro Crossing and mountain biking."</p>
        
            <p>It would be very difficult to replace the chateau with a building of that scale economically, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Elworthy said it was hard to say how much it would cost to fix the earthquake-prone hotel due to them not being able to access it.</p>
        
            <p>That was understandable as negotiations were still underway with the departing tenant for the building, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He was optimistic they could restore it.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen some structural drawings, we have had some of our guys look at it, we aren't too confronted by it."</p>
        
            <p>Elworthy said the agreement would need to be a long term lease at a peppercorn rental rate.</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu Mayor Weston Kirton told RNZ that there had been a number of people interested in redeveloping the property.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not unusual for people to come forward and show some interest."</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said from what he understood there was another party that was seriously interested in the hotel.</p>
        
            <p>"We are dealing with another party that has progressed fairly well last year to engage with the government over the future of the Chateau."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor wouldn't reveal any other details of the party due to it being confidential.</p>
        
            <p>He said their interest was in seeing the Chateau back open.</p>
        
            <p>Kirton told RNZ that a petition the district council had created calling for it to be saved had over 13 thousand signatures and would be submitted to parliament in the next two months.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea is to actually just ensure that the government are aware that there's a lot of interest in this facility and we want to see a future for it."</p>
