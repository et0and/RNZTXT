            <p>The union representing TVNZ staff is calling on the public to join a campaign protesting the broadcaster's plans to axe programmes and cut jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Last week TVNZ announced plans to cut up to 68 jobs - and scrap several long-running shows, including Fair Go and Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>E tū spokesperson Michael Wood has told Midday Report the Save Our Stories campaign united workers, viewers and supporters to remind TVNZ of its responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"TVNZ isn't just some business, it's a vital part of our society and Kiwis need a strong TVNZ to tell Aotearoa's stories and hold power to account.</p>
        
            <p>"This is about everyone - every single New Zealander is a stakeholder in this, so we invite everybody who wants to build and protect a strong media landscape to support the campaign."</p>
        
            <p>People could help by signing an open letter to TVNZ, and sharing the campaign video, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So many people have reached out to our union to show their support for TVNZ workers and ask how they can help. From prominent public figures, to people whose lives have been changed thanks to TVNZ's coverage, to dedicated viewers who don't want to see their favourite shows get the axe.</p>
        
            <p>"These people can help by signing the open letter, sharing our video, and sending the message to decision-makers that our media is worth protecting."</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ staff from the E Tū union voted unanimously to reject the proposals.</p>
