            <p>Consumer confidence soured i June as households' hopes for interest rate relief faded.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac McDermott Miller Confidence Index fell 11 points to 82.2, wiping out gains from the past six months.</p>
        
            <p>A confidence level below 100 signalled households were pessimistic about the economic landscape.</p>
        
            <p>Households also felt less confident about their expected financial situation, and more people felt it was a bad time to buy a major household item.</p>
        
            <p>In a sign of difficult conditions, 42 percent of households said their financial position had deteriorated over the past year, while 14 percent said it had improved.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac senior economist Satish Ranchhod said households were doing it tough.</p>
        
            <p>"Recent months have seen hopes for an early reduction in interest rates reduce as inflation has held up," Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ongoing high borrowing costs, combined with a more uncertain labour market is undermining consumer confidence."</p>
        
            <p>Ranchhod said inflation pressures meant any relief by way of a Reserve Bank rate cut was not on the horizon.</p>
        
            <p>"That will have been a disappointment to those households who had been hoping for near term relief on their borrowing costs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In more bad news for the struggling retail sector, most households felt it was a bad time to buy a big-ticket item.</p>
        
            <p>"With pressures on their finances and nervousness about where the economy is heading, households are keeping their wallets shut," Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even with strong population growth, retail spending levels have been falling in recent months, with households switching away from nice to haves and towards value-for-money."</p>
        
            <p>McDermott Miller market research director Imogen Rendall said the feeling of pessimism was visible across all demographics.</p>
        
            <p>"Almost half of women see themselves as worse off financially than they were a year ago, compared with just under a third of men.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking ahead to next year, both men and women have similar expectations for their personal finances, with around a quarter expecting to be worse off."</p>
        
            <p>Rendall said women were especially downbeat about the economic outlook.</p>
