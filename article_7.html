            <p>Adrian Orr's decision to step down as Reserve Bank governor was a personal one, and he felt it was the "right time" to resign, according to the bank's chair.</p>
        
            <p>Reserve Bank chair Neil Quigley has spoken to media this afternoon, after today's shock announcement of Orr's resignation, after seven years of service, and part-way through his second term.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was not going to "characterise the reasons" for Orr's resignation</p>
        
            <p>Quigley said this afternoon that he had discussed the resignation process with Orr for the past "several days", and the governor felt it was the right time to leave.</p>
        
            <p>"He's achieved a great deal that he set out to do when he took the job, we've been through a lot, not just the pandemic, but all of the changes the bank has been through over Adrian's term as governor.</p>
        
            <p>"So Adrian feels that he has done the job and he has inflation under the target range and he feels positive about that."</p>
        
            <p>Quigley said he still had a "very good relationship" with Orr.</p>
        
            <p>"He and I have been through a lot in my time as board chair and his time as governor, and we have very good memories of the challenges we have fronted."</p>
        
            <p>Orr is taking leave until the end of the month and did not appear at this afternoon's media conference.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't make sense for someone like the governor to have a grey period where they have come to a decision, but they have continued to be around the bank," Quigley said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the job of the Reserve Bank governor was one that faced "unrelenting critique of your actions".</p>
        
            <p>"No matter what you do, there are alternatives that other people say they would have taken, so there is a time when you think that having achieved what you want to achieve, that's enough.</p>
        
            <p>"He's decided he's on leave and he's comfortable with that decision.</p>
        
            <p>"He's doing what he feels is appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>Quigley conceded that the sudden resignation was not an everyday occurrence, "but it's what has happened in this case".</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Governor Christian Hawkesby will be Acting Governor until 31 March.</p>
