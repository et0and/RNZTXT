            <p>The new government inherited finances in better shape than expected, according to latest Treasury figures.</p>
        
            <p>The budget deficit for the five months ended November was $2.8 billion, about $1.1b lower than forecast in the half-year financial update (HYEFU).</p>
        
            <p>Tax revenue was $49.1b, more than half a billion dollars above forecast because of higher provisional and income tax, and tobacco, alcohol, and fuel duties.</p>
        
            <p>"The September quarter labour market statistics showed lower employment levels but that average hourly earnings increased," Treasury said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Crown revenue was further lifted by an increase in interest earnings by the Reserve Bank.</p>
        
            <p>Expenses were $300 million below forecast at $56.8b, reflecting marginally lower spending on community housing and welfare payments, which Treasury said was largely a matter of timing.</p>
        
            <p>Net debt was $83.9b, $1.8b below forecast, and equating to 20.9 percent of the value of the economy, reflecting gains on investments held by the NZ Superannuation Fund and ACC.</p>
        
            <p>The figures do not reflect the effect of any decisions by the new government, which had just just been formed at the end of November.</p>
        
            <p>The HYEFU forecast a budget deficit of $9.3b for the year ended June, and at the time Finance Minister Nicola Willis said the government books were in a worse state than expected.</p>
        
            <p>She has detailed a range of cost savings and new revenue totalling $7.5b over the next five years from axing clean car discounts, early childhood subsidies, and ending big projects. A Budget policy statement is due in March and will provide more detail on spending priorities.</p>
