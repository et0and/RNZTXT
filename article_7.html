            <p>New Zealanders have been cheated out of nearly $5 million in three months by cyber security incidents - mostly scams and fraud.</p>
        
            <p>CERT NZ's latest Cyber Security Insights report said scam and fraud reports increased 32 percent in the three months ending 30 September, compared to the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>It said 11 cases reported to it had financial losses of over $100,000 - about half relating to a scam involving a job, business, or investment opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>Fraudsters were using new tactics to target unwary New Zealanders, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Criminals used fake investment websites that look legitimate, with physical addresses, business registration numbers and even messenger-app groups with 'peers', all created to build trust, keep their target invested and steal as much money as possible.</p>
        
            <p>There was an increase in job scams, where a fake job listing is advertised resulting in applicants giving personal information and often money and financial details as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear that scammers are using the current economic uncertainty to their advantage," CERT NZ director Rob Pope said. "We're asking that New Zealanders stop and pause before jumping into these offers and potentially opening themselves up to real loss."</p>
        
            <p>In total 2136 incidents were reported in the three months from 1 July to 30 September, up 10 percent from the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The $4.7m in direct financial loss was up 11 percent on the previous three months.</p>
        
            <p>CERT NZ has launched a website with information on how victims of cyber scams can get help and how to stay safe online.</p>
