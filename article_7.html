            <p>TVNZ has announced its current commercial director, Jodi O'Donnell, will become its new chief executive from next year.</p>
        
            <p>In her current role, she has been responsible for partnering with agencies and advertisers and making the most of revenue opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ's chairperson, Alastair Carruthers, said it was a transformative time for the broadcaster.</p>
        
            <p>"Jodi's an outstanding commercial leader who's delivered significant innovation and strategic change throughout her time at TVNZ," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"She has a deep understanding of the media landscape and is passionate about the challenges and opportunities TVNZ faces as it pursues a digitally led future."</p>
        
            <p>O'Donnell said she was looking forward to leading TVNZ as its first female chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>She said she felt strongly about the importance of local media and telling New Zealand's stories.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ had an important history and an exciting future.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an incredible group of TVNZers who are committed to our advertisers and our audiences and I'm looking forward to leading our people as we transform the business into a digital first media organisation."</p>
        
            <p>Carruthers also thanked Brent McAnulty who has filled the role in a temporary capacity for the last six months.</p>
        
            <p>"His calm guidance has steered the business through a constrained advertising period, while delivering important programming for our viewers, including the return of free-to-view sport to TVNZ and comprehensive coverage of the 2023 general election."</p>
