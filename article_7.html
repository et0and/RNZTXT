            <p>WorkSafe is calling on manufacturing businesses to boost safety standards, saying too many workers are losing their fingers in industrial machinery.</p>
        
            <p>In the last two months courts had imposed more than half a million dollars in penalties to companies whose employees have lost fingers at work, it said.</p>
        
            <p>In one recently sentenced case, WorkSafe said Thompson Engineering in Timaru was fined $247,000 and ordered to pay $35,000 in reparations after a worker had two of their fingers amputated and a third degloved by a punch and shear machine in January 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In another case Anglo Engineering in Auckland was fined $200,000 and ordered to pay $35,337 in reparations after a worker had three fingers partially amputated following an accident with a punch and forming press in March 2022.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe principal inspector Mark Donaghue said he was appalled by how often workers received life-altering injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"We get notifiable injuries on a weekly basis... from smaller amputations to more significant entanglement and amputation injuries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They happen far too often. There's no need for them to be happening, they are preventable."</p>
        
            <p>He said machinery could cause a variety of injuries if not properly maintained.</p>
        
            <p>"From cutting to entanglement, to crushing, to drawing in and degloving... there's quite a variety, including projectile-type injuries where stuff breaks and gets flung about."</p>
        
            <p>Donaghue said businesses had no excuses for letting their workers get injured.</p>
        
            <p>"The main reason is that businesses aren't taking responsibility... smaller operators may not have the resources to put controls in place... possibly not putting enough training," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But ultimately they're not taking ownership of their equipment and legal duties to keep [workers] safe."</p>
        
            <p>Donaghue urged businesses to ensure staff are well-trained and all machinery is properly maintained.</p>
