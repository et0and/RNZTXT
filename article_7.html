        <h2>Should first-home buyers rush to get in the market?</h2>
        <p>
Property research firm Corelogic says there is good news for first-home buyers in 2025.

            <p>First-home buyers had a record year last year, responsible for 26.1 percent of all property purchases.</p>
        
            <p>But if you are in the market for your first home, you might be wondering whether you need to jump now, or whether you have time on your side.</p>
        
            <p>Property research firm Corelogic said there was good news - although investors and existing homeowners were likely to be more active this year, conditions should still suit those in the market for their first home.</p>
        
            <p>Economist Kelvin Davidson said first-home buyers were tapping into KiwiSaver, making use of banks' low-deposit lending allowances, and buying new builds to get around the loan-to-value rules entirely.</p>
        
            <p>First-home buyers were 27 percent of new-build buyers in 2024, Davidson said.</p>

            <p>The large number of properties available for sale meant buyers had a lot to choose from, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A softer market helped, too - the median price paid by first-home buyers was $698,000 last year from $719,000 in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"I think conditions will generally be in first-home buyers' favour over the next little while.</p>
        
            <p>"It looks if anything as though mortgage rates will fall a bit further... prices are still down 15 percent or 20 percent from the peak. There are reasons to be reasonably confident about first-home buyers' ability to keep buying.</p>
        
            <p>"If predictions for house prices are right and they go up 5 percent on average this year, I don't think that's necessarily an incentive to rush."</p>
        
            <p>But on the other hand, Davidson said, first-home buyers who had finance approved and found a house they liked might not see a reason to wait.</p>
        
            <p>"There are always trade-offs, even a 1 percent rise in house prices means that bit of extra deposit is required. But that's offset against the chance mortgage rates fall a bit further... there are always different things to contemplate."</p>
        
            <p>He said investors' market share was 21.7 percent in 2024 compared to an average since 2005 of 24.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>With overall sales numbers expected to rise from 80,000 in 2024 to 90,000 in 2025, it was likely all buyer groups would do more deals in 2025, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>First-home buyers' market share might decrease as investors became more active again, but that did not mean they would necessarily buy fewer houses.</p>
        
            <p>"They could see their market share drop to 24 percent this year and still purchase about 1000 more properties than in 2024. In other words, a lower market share doesn't mean the demise of first-home buyers."</p>
        
            <p>For investors, a big fall in the top-up required to service a loan on a rental property was a significant shift, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you plug in a purchase price of $780,000 - the median paid by mortgaged [investors] in 2024- assume 30 percent deposit, 4 percent gross rental yield, interest-only mortgage and 100 percent deductibility, a drop in mortgage rates from around 7 percent to about 5.5 percent broadly cuts the weekly cash requirement from $350 to $200.</p>
        
            <p>"That's still significant for a new investor, but much less of a hurdle than before."</p>
        
            <p>It would probably be a "fairly balanced" market for everyone this year, with opportunities for all buyer groups, Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>Owner-occupiers who wanted to move could find increased activity freed up "sales chains", where the purchase of one property was relying on the sale of another.</p>
