        <p>

            <p>Business confidence has perked up at the start of the year, although firms are less upbeat about their own outlook and still expecting solid inflation pressures.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Bank's January survey shows headline confidence rising four points to a net 37 percent, but companies' own outlook dipped to 26 percent optimism.</p>
        
            <p>Chief economist Sharon Zollner said the results were a mixed bag, with inflation expectations sitting at 4.28 percent, and nearly half of firms expecting to raise their prices.</p>
        
            <p>"Inflation expectations took a step lower, but they are still too high at 4.3 percent. Cost and price expectations are holding up, with a solid jump for the retail sector of firms expecting to raise their prices."</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, expected cost rises are still higher than expected price rises, so firms are certainly not expecting to be able to pad margins."</p>
        
            <p>Zollner said the survey pointed to firms thinking the worst of the downturn is over, but the economy was at "a delicate juncture".</p>
        
            <p>"We are forecasting a pretty good outcome compared to some scenarios: The RBNZ has done enough; it'll take a while for that to be incontrovertible but by August they can commence a steady stream of OCR (official cash rate) cuts."</p>
        
            <p>The stubbornness of some inflation components might yet mean the Reserve Bank hiked again to be sure even if it later turned out to be a mistake, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Although the medicine has been bitter, it's working. We just need those pricing intentions to start playing ball to steer clear of another dose of monetary tightening."</p>
        
            <p>The survey pointed to less positive employment and investment expectations, profit and export indicators and wage growth moving sideways.</p>
