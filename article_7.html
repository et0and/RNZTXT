        <h2>Kiwibank forecasts better second half after profit dip</h2>
        <p>
The state-owned bank's half-year profit has fallen as the weak economy hit its margins and increased costs, but it lent more money.

            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended December compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank's half-year profit has fallen as the weak economy hit its margins and increased costs, but it lent more money.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Steve Jurkovich said the state-owned bank supported customers through the recession and a subdued housing market, which had crimped margins and led to a rise in money set aside for bad debts.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said Kiwibank had been increasing lending at double the rate of other banks and deposits grew 1.6 times faster.</p>
        
            <p>"This growth underscores our commitment to driving competition that benefits everyday Kiwi and contributing to a productive economy by helping businesses to thrive."</p>
        
            <p>However, its drive for market share, upgrading its technical systems to improve protection from scams, as well as improvements in physical branches saw a significant rise in its expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Jurkovich said Kiwibank was looking to a broad uplift in business and the economy as interest rates continued to fall.</p>
        
            <p>"The OCR (official cash rate) track signals more cuts to come which are needed for Kiwi households and businesses looking to borrow and to create momentum in the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"The second half of 2025 should see growth gather pace, including a rebound in employment demand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The government has raised the prospect of injecting another $500 million in extra capital to strengthen the bank to compete more rigorously with the big four Australian-owned banks.</p>
