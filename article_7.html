            <p>The Financial Markets Authority has started legal action against insurance giant IAG for what it says is of overcharging consumers.</p>
        
            <p>The FMA alleges the company failed to properly apply multi-policy discounts and overcharged 269,000 clients $35 million stretching back 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>It says IAG self reported the issue and has moved to repay affected customers.</p>
        
            <p>The FMA is seeking a court declaration of wrongdoing and the imposition of a financial penalty.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
