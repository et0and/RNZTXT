            <p>Pania Tyson-Nathan (Rongomaiwahine, Ngāti Kahungunu) has been made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (NZOM).</p>
        
            <p>Dame Pania has received one of the most prestigious New Years Honours in recognition of her contribution to Māori and business.</p>
        
            <p>For more than 30 years she has dedicated her career to advancing Māori economic development across community, business and government sectors.</p>
        
            <p>Raised in the Hawkes Bay, she developed a sound understanding of business management early in life through her parents.</p>
        
            <p>In August last year Dame Pania was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame and is regarded as one of the most influential wahine Māori in business.</p>
        
            <p>At the event celebrating the honour in Auckland the now Dame Pania said it was important to "never underestimate the teaching form the marae."</p>
        
            <p>"At the marae, the front doesn't work without the back and vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's also about humility and those who are coming through the opportunity to be amongst others.</p>
        
            <p>"Tā Wira Gardiner always said to me, 'Go to war with what you've got' and that's exactly what we've done."</p>
        
            <p>Since becoming the CEO of New Zealand Māori Tourism in 2008 she has continued to build the industry and broaden understanding of the value of mātauranga Māori in business.</p>
        
            <p>She has helped position NZ Māori Tourism as a key contributor, participant and influencer within the tourism industry today.</p>
        
            <p>Her knowledge and leadership played a vital role in supporting the Māori tourism industry through the difficulties experienced throughout the Covid-19 pandemic where she continued to champion the innovative approaches Māori operators were taking.</p>
        
            <p>Te Māhia is her home and those who know her well said she has maintained a humble demeanour and remains dedicated to her people.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Pania's dedication to ensuring Māori have the opportunities they deserve in business has been hailed as a type of leadership that is unique and profound as it focuses more on people than profits.</p>
        
            <p>She is a wife and mother of eight children.</p>
