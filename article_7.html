            <p>Love it or hate it Valentines Day is here, and comes with the potential for plenty of spending.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality NZ's chief executive Steve Armitage told Midday Report Valentines Day certainly provided a bump-up for the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking back on historical spend data you can see that [spending is] up as much as 10 percent, and given that valentines day falls on a Friday this year, we certainly expect to see [spending] in that again."</p>
        
            <p>He said these kind of events were important on two fronts.</p>
        
            <p>"Finding time and space to just celebrate the one you love is hard, because we are, you know, immersed in work and on our devices to much these days - so being in the moment I think is important.</p>
        
            <p>"From a business point of view, they provide predictable days for demand because people do tend to be organised and book in advance.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you know, if we are getting as much as 10 percent increase in spend, that's material to business - particularly given the years we've had in recent times around hospo."</p>
        
            <p>When asked the likelihood of getting a reservation without booking in advance, Armitage said it would be tough.</p>
        
            <p>"There are always venues that accept walk-ins only, but I'm not sure how the optics of not being organised will play out trying to impress someone."</p>
        
            <p>He said one of the most important parts of Valentines Day was celebrating the one you love.</p>
        
            <p>"I would say wherever there are two people enjoying themselves, whether that's you or a long-term love, just be in the moment with each other.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a golden opportunity to appreciate and celebrate the one you love."</p>
