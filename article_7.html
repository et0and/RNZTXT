            <p>An economist believes New Zealand's house prices will begin to lift this year after a "deep downturn".</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic New Zealand's February housing chart pack showed increased activity last month among people who owned multiple properties and people who shifted home.</p>
        
            <p>It also showed a small drop back in the market share of first home buyers to a quarter of the market.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic NZ chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said with mortgage rates expected to fall in line with the Official Cash Rate cuts, house prices were likely to rise.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a sense now that we might just be starting to turn around off the back of those lower mortgage rates," Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank had indicated they expected four to five percent growt - analysis Davidson said he would support.</p>
        
            <p>"Even when it does arrive, four or five percent growth in house prices would still be relatively subdued compared to past upturns."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was still a lot of listing in the market, lack of housing affordability and credit restriction, which restrain the market.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said with regard to the number of houses sold, he expected by the end of 2025 they could see the market reach its long-term average of between 90,000 and 95,000 properties.</p>
