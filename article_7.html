            <p>Households are set to make big calls about their mortgages this year, as they weigh up their options amid falling interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Property research company CoreLogic says four out of five borrowers kicked off the new year with either a floating mortgage rate or a fixed term of less than 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>For new loans, only 10 percent were fixed for longer than 12 months, whereas a year ago it was at 51 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The share of new loans on floating rates - which tend to be higher than fixed rates - has risen from around 17 percent a year ago to 28 percent.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic said it was evident in existing loans too, with the share of debt on floating rates up sharply to 14 percent - the highest level since 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said borrowers have been keen to take advantage of falling mortgage rates as the Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the most intriguing aspect of the mortgage market this year would be to see when borrowers would again see value in long-term rates.</p>
        
            <p>"The answer to that will be a decision for each borrower to make, but there is certainly a sense that most of the Reserve Bank's eventual full monetary policy easing has already been factored in to some current mortgage rates - or in other words, those longer-term rates might not fall much further," he said.</p>
        
            <p>David Cunningham - chief executive of mortgage broker Squirrel - said it would not take much for longer-term rates to become popular again, currently hovering around the mid-5 and early 6 percent mark.</p>
        
            <p>"In the last 10 or 15 years you've had fixed rates generally in a 4 to 5 percent range so when we see those 2, 3, 4 and 5 year fixed rate below 5 percent, I think it starts to become a viable option for people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cunningham believed some rates could start falling below 5 percent in the next three months.</p>
        
            <p>He said the rise in floating interest rates was a little surprising, but borrowers were happy to take the short-term pain of higher servicing costs for long-term gain.</p>
        
            <p>Loan Market mortgage advisor Michelle Isemonger warned of the risks that came with floating interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always risks that come with floating. Your repayments are going to be higher than what they would be if they were fixed," she said.</p>
        
            <p>But Isemonger said more borrowers were taking the risks.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot pointing towards the interest rate coming down, so people are taking that gamble. And it is a gamble because you really just don't know what's going to happen, and the biggest consideration really is that your repayments could go up."</p>
