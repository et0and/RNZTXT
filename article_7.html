            <p>The Court of Appeal says two Wellington-based bankers have a case to answer over their roles as directors and partners in the Drylandcarbon management companies.</p>
        
            <p>Drylandcarbon was a carbon offset fund managed by Will Leckie and Chris Morrison's company, Lewis Tucker & Co, on behalf of the 50-50 partnership they had with Ant and Wendy Beverley.</p>
        
            <p>The' venture fell apart after difficulties over the management of Drylandcarbon's first fund, launched in 2019, and the parties went their separate ways.</p>
        
            <p>However, Ant Beverley said Leckie and Morrison used Drylandcarbon's intellectual property to advance their own interests with a second fund - leaving the Beverleys out of the deal.</p>
        
            <p>"We are determined to ensure that Messrs Morrison and Leckie are answerable for what we see as multiple serious breaches of their duties as directors," Beverley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Wendy and I took the Drylandcarbon opportunity to Lewis Tucker in late 2017 in good faith, having spent six years designing and developing the structure and mechanics of the partnership and management opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>This motion allowed the Beverleys to take their case against Leckie and Morrison to the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Leckie and Morrison said they were slightly disappointed about the outcome of the appeal, but remained confident in their position and welcomed the opportunity to present their case in court.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's judgement has nothing to do with the underlying case and we welcome the opportunity to explore the real issues in court.</p>
        
            <p>"As we have said before, we are disappointed that the relationship between the directors broke down, but we followed a very clear and robust process to protect investors in Drylandcarbon and the organisation's culture," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the case is now before the courts, we will not be making any comment on this process."</p>
        
            <p>The case was unrelated to the current activities of Drylandcarbon and Forest Partners.</p>
