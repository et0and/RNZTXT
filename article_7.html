Buckingham St fashion stores Wallace & Gibbs and IKON are closing after 30 and 18 years respectively.

            <p>Iconic Arrowtown retail group Wallace & Gibbs will close two of its six stores, citing an ongoing hangover from the pandemic years.</p>
        
            <p>The family-owned group will shut its Buckingham St fashion stores Wallace & Gibbs and IKON by mid-year, which have been operating for 30 and 18 years respectively</p>
        
            <p>Director Delvine Wallace said the businesses remained profitable.</p>
        
            <p>"The ongoing hangover from Covid-19 with supply chain and staff recruitment issues, increased business costs, significant changes to shoppers' habits, and online shopping pressure is a sign of the times," Wallace said.</p>
        
            <p>"With both store leases up this July, we saw it as opportune to close that chapter and put renewed energy and vigour into our other tourism and fashion enterprises."</p>
        
            <p>It had been a great run with the businesses and it felt like the right time to let them go despite mixed emotions, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Their daughters had grown up in the businesses from learning the ropes to taking management roles.</p>
        
            <p>One of them, Caroline Walak, said it felt like the end of an era and it would be difficult to say goodbye.</p>
        
            <p>"But we are very grateful for what we have accomplished and celebrate what has been an exciting journey together."</p>
        
            <p>The other Wallace & Gibbs group stores will remain open.</p>
        
            <p>It comes a day after luxury label Kate Sylvester called it quits after 31 years in the fashion business, as retailers struggle with high costs and low profits.</p>
