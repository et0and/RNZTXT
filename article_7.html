            <p>The Queenstown Lakes District Council has filed charges against three companies over a slip in 2023 which forced the evacuation of homes, and left ten homes red-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>In September last year the homes in Reavers Lane were hit by debris during torrential rain.</p>
        
            <p>Skyline Gondola later apologised, and said it believed debris from its worksite contributed to the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Forty-one people had to be evacuated from their homes on the night, and later 10 homes were red-stickered and two yellow-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday the Queenstown Lakes District Council said it had commenced a prosecution relating to the activities that allegedly contributed to the slip that occurred on the Ben Lomond Reserve that affected Reavers Lane on 22 September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The council has filed charges against three companies for alleged breaches of the Resource Management Act 1991, and the defendants are due to appear in the Queenstown District Court on 21 October 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The council said as the matter is before Court, it would not be commenting further .</p>
