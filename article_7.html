            <p>Housing confidence has lifted to its highest level in more than two years as people accept the housing downturn is over, but there is still a large degree of caution about the future.</p>
        
            <p>ASB's January Housing Confidence Survey showed 51 percent of respondents expected house prices to rise - the highest since October 2021 - compared with 34 percent in the October survey, with annual price growth of 2.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Fewer people expected interest rates to rise, falling to 15 percent from 28 percent, but fewer also thought it was a good time to buy a house, 2 percent from 6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ASB senior economist Kim Mundy said house price expectations were a pointer of the trend and not a reflection of the state of the market.</p>
        
            <p>"While house prices are likely to continue rising, we're not forecasting the type of growth we saw in the last upswing over 2020 and 2021, with still-high interest rates acting as a powerful market moderator."</p>
        
            <p>Mundy said the survey showed an increasing number believe interest rate rises were close to peaking, although respondents remained ready for further rates.</p>
        
            <p>"The upshot is that even in the absence of more hikes, it could still be quite a few months before mortgage interest rates fall from current levels."</p>
        
            <p>The prospect of debt-to-income ratios from the middle of the year and prospective changes to tax rules for property investment were also adding caution to the market.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklanders were the most confident about future price rises, the end of interest rate rises, and that it was a good time to buy.</p>
        
            <p>Mundy said the survey offered conflicting signals for prospective buyers, which might add to the caution, but any market pick up might alert the Reserve Bank to inflation risks.</p>
