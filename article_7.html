            <p>Police have arrested two protesters who scaled the building of international weapons company NIOA in Rolleston, south of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The protesters, from the group Peace Action Ōtautahi, climbed onto the roof of the company's NZ headquarters this morning, hanging large banners across the outside of the building.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the situation had been safely resolved following the arrest of two people who will appear in court charged with burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the remaining protestors left the scene voluntarily.</p>
        
            <p>In late December, the group hung a banner across the Bridge of Remembrance in a similar protest.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, the global munitions company acquired Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, an Australian owned, America-based manufacturer of firearms and ammunition operating out of Tennessee.</p>
        
            <p>According to the company's website, its products are "used by civilian sport shooters, law enforcement agencies, the United States military and more than 80 State Department approved countries across the world".</p>
        
            <p>In a press release, Peace Action Ōtautahi said the aim was to highlight the alleged killing of innocent civilians with weapons supplied by NIOA.</p>
        
            <p>NIOA has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency staff were also on the scene, alongside the police Public Safety Unit and negotiation team.</p>
