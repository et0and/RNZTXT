            <p>First-home buyers are on a record-breaking streak, accounting for 27 percent of the market share.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic's six-monthly First Home Buyer Report indicates first-home buyers were getting a foot on the property ladder, despite stretched affordability, high interest rates, and cost of living pressures.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said first-home buyers were sitting well above the long-term 21 percent average share of the market, though the total number of deals was relatively low.</p>
        
            <p>"FHBs (first-home buyers) are proving relatively more successful in buying their first home than at any other time," Davidson said, with all six areas in the survey recording above-average shares of first-home buyer purchases.</p>
        
            <p>Wider Wellington has held the strongest market share for FHBs with 33 percent of purchases in the year to date, which was 4 percent above the average range.</p>
        
            <p>At the other end of the spectrum, first-home buyers in Tauranga held accounted for 21 percent of the purchases, which was 5 percent above average, with Auckland, Christchurch, and Dunedin also reporting a 5 percent higher than average share. Hamilton was 6 percent above for 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Provincial markets show a similar trend with Invercargill holding the strongest market share for first-home buyers with 32 percent of purchases, a significant 10 percentage points higher than the long-term average.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the typical first-home buyer often entered the market above the 'bottom rung', rather than starting from the bottom of the ladder.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, $690,000 is lower than the median price paid across all buyers at $762,500, but it's significantly higher than the lower quartile across all buyers at $565,000," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It wouldn't be a surprise to see FHBs continue to hold onto an above-average share of property purchases in the next six to nine months."</p>
        
            <p>However, he said a change of government could bring investors back into the market in larger numbers, though there were other market factors to consider.</p>
        
            <p>"To be fair, low rental yields and high mortgage rates, hence high 'top ups' from other income sources, could prevent a strong return from property investors.</p>
        
            <p>"But this FHB Report probably still marks a line in the sand, and FHBs may start to see some competing buyers returning."</p>
