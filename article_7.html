            <p>Fletcher Building's chair Bruce Hassall is resigning from the company's board earlier than planned.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Hassall said he would step down at its annual shareholders meeting in October, after the company posted a large $120 million interim loss.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Ross Taylor also announced his resignation following the result, but is serving out his six-month notice period.</p>
        
            <p>But in an announcement on Monday morning, Fletcher said Hassall has resigned as board chair with immediate effect.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher said he wanted to expedite the appointment of a new permanent chair, who would then lead the appointment of a new chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, independent director Barbara Chapman has been appointed acting chair, and would lead the search for a new chair.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher Building said Chapman would not put her name forward for the permanent chair role.</p>
        
            <p>"The board and management continue to prioritise the operational performance of the company, finalisation of the NZICC (International Convention Centre) project, and managing the Western Australia plumbing matters," Chapman said.</p>
