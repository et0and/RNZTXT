        <h2>Concern for economy as truck drivers visa rules change</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Shutting truck and bus drivers out of the Work to Residence Pathway could slow the economy and increase costs for businesses and families, Transporting New Zealand says.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration New Zealand announced on Sunday that drivers who applied for an Accredited Employer Work Visa would not be eligible to apply for a Transport Work to Residence Visa.</p>
        
            <p>It also said 18 previously announced roles would be removed from the 'Green List', a fast track to residency, and the Construction and infrastructure Sector Agreement.</p>
        
            <p>Some of these roles include panel beaters, road traffic controllers, road roller operators and linemakers.</p>
        
            <p>Transporting New Zealand's policy advisor, Billy Clemens, said the pathway helped local businesses compete with international employers.</p>
        
            <p>"Offering that pathway to residence after two years of commitment to New Zealand was an important incentive to attracting those skilled, experienced operators in a highly competitive international market."</p>
        
            <p>Clemens said the pathway should be kept open for at least 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"That would allow our sector and members just a more adequate time period to address those acute skill shortages."</p>
        
            <p>The national association for civil construction and engineering, Civil Contractors New Zealand, has also taken issue with the changes.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Alan Pollard said the changes to the Green List jobs were putting big infrastructure projects at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be able to move very quickly when the projects that are promised by the government are actually properly funded and committed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Without access to a smooth running immigration pathway, we're going to struggle to resource it."</p>
        
            <p>Projects like new Roads of National Significance, water network upgrades and cyclone recovery work would all suffer under the changes, Pollard said.</p>
        
            <p>The announcement took the association by surprise, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very keen to work with the government to find a better solution that allows for the reinstatement of the roles."</p>
        
            <p>Pollard said some of the roles removed from the Green List were critical to deliver on some of the large scale infrastructure projects proposed by the government.</p>
        
            <p>The transport minister, Simeon Brown, declined to comment.</p>
