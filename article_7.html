            <p>Three special feathers have been sold at an auction in Auckland today for more than $10,000 each.</p>
        
            <p>Webb's head of decorative arts, Leah Morris said one rare huia feather sold for $19,000, another went under the hammer for thirteen thousand and the third for $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>Morris said a buyer is still negotiating over the sale of a fourth feather and a fifth was sold privately for $5000.</p>
        
            <p>Interest in the extinct native bird's feathers has soared since a single feather sold at Webb's earlier this year for a record $46,521 - making the feather the most expensive in the world, and more expensive than gold.</p>
        
            <p>
The huia is now extinct. The last confirmed sighting was in 1907.
