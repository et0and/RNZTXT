            <p>Fuel prices are down 5 percent, despite earlier predictions they could top $3 a litre.</p>
        
            <p>The price dips come as consumer confidence has taken a big hit in the latest Westpac survey, as the GDP figures are set to be released today.</p>
        
            <p>Fuel prices are one source of relief for consumers. [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/542256/no-clear-justification-higher-fuel-margins-could-limit-petrol-price-relief They have dropped by up to 5 percent over the past two months.</p>
        
            <p>The average price for a litre of 91 petrol is $2.62, down 14 cents on last month while diesel is selling at $1.92 on average. It was up over $2 a month ago.</p>
        
            <p>The price drops have occurred despite predictions at the start of the year that fuel prices could soar well past $3 a litre.</p>
        
            <p>Gaspy spokesperson Mike Newton said there had been a sustained price drop since around 23 January.</p>
        
            <p>All the factors driving prices up had reversed, such as international oil prices had dropped while the New Zealand dollar had strengthened against the US dollar.</p>
        
            <p>"And all of this is to do with economic uncertainty basically - the decrease in demand worldwide for oil due to economic uncertainty which of course drops the price of oil.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a huge amount of geopolitical issues at the moment which could see things go in any direction."</p>
        
            <p>These included Israel's bombing and a new ground operation in Gaza, Russia's war in Ukraine and uncertainty over what US President Donald Trump would do with tariffs and trade wars, Newton said.</p>
