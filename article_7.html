            <p>The trial of a temporary ferry connecting the Wynyard Quarter to Auckland city will continue for the next two weekends under extended hours.</p>
        
            <p>The free ferry was put in place by the Auckland Council agency in charge of repairs Eke Panuku at the start of May after the Wynyard Crossing Bridge got stuck in an upward position.</p>
        
            <p>The pedestrian bridge has been closed to the public since March as a result, causing an 18 minute detour for people to access restaurants and bars on the other side.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses reported a drop in turnover so large that they had struggled to pay staff.</p>
        
            <p>The ferry is free but small, with a capacity of 60 people.</p>
        
            <p>A letter sent to stakeholders from Eke Panuka confirmed the trial will continue on this Saturday from 8am to 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>It will not operate on Sunday, because of a motorcycle rally for men's mental health taking place beside the Viaduct Events centre and taking up the space for ferry queues.</p>
        
            <p>It will also run on Saturday 25 and Sunday 26 May, for the same hours.</p>
        
            <p>But on 25 May, Eke Panuku recommends people take the City Link Bus around the viaduct harbour, due to the Africa Day event, which is expected to bring large numbers of people.</p>
        
            <p>The ferries cannot operate at night because of a lack of light for boarding and disembarking.</p>
