            <p>Popular Wellington cafe Olive is being sold after 20 years and is set to be revamped by new business owners from the Thistle Inn in Thorndon.</p>
        
            <p>It comes in a string of closures across the capital including bakery Myrtle and Burmese restaurant Mabel's.</p>
        
            <p>Olive is owned by its head chef Jamie Morgan and brothers Ferdi and Carlo Petegna who also own Fratelli on Blair Street.</p>
        
            <p>The cafe has previously turned away former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her husband Clark Gayford because it was at capacity in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Thistle Inn owner Richard Walsh confirmed to RNZ it has bought the cafe but wouldn't say what the plans for the future of it were.</p>
