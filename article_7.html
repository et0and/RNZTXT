            <p>The owner of the Glenbrook Steel Mill saw its half-year earnings plunge amid softer steel prices and weak domestic demand from the building and construction sector.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Steel's underlying profit fell 88 percent to $3.1 million, from $25.5m a year ago. Its revenue was down 14 percent to $427.8m.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Steel - part of Australia's BlueScope Steel - said domestic steel sales volumes were also down 13 percent, while export volumes increased, but weaker prices due to global oversupply from China limited financial returns.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Steel chief executive Robin Davies said domestic demand for steel had likely reached the bottom.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's certainly probably at GFC [global financial crisis] levels for steel demand in New Zealand. I've been in New Zealand Steel now for just over 17 years at it's the weakest demand I can remember in that time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Davies was "reasonably optimistic" about a recovery this year as interest rates were reduced, likely leading to improved demand in building and construction.</p>
        
            <p>"I think a rebound would be a strong word to use. I think a slow recovery ... maybe the second quarter this calendar period on the back of the interest rate reductions and that restores some confidence," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Davies was hopeful the government's fast-track approvals process could also help improve demand.</p>
