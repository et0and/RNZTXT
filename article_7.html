            <p>The cruise industry wants to get more value out of fewer ships by building more tourism experiences on land and getting more locally grown goods on board.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Cruise Association has launched a national strategy for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>It is aimed at managing the sector and growing its annual economic contribution to $1b by 2040.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 hit the cruise industry hard and now increased costs and global competition means a 15 to 20 percent reduction in ship visits is expected for the next two seasons.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Jacqui Lloyd said the sector wants to work more closely with local and central government and tourism operators to grow cruise business.</p>
        
            <p>"When we're talking about a billion growth, we're not talking about throwing more ships in New Zealand, we're talk about extracting more value.</p>
        
            <p>"How can we help build better tourism experiences in regional areas to increase spend, but also how can we look at providoring on the ship, how can we get more New Zealand produce onboard that is sold through our regions as well.</p>
        
            <p>"Growing value is really important and we think we can do that in that 16-year timeline."</p>
        
            <p>Lloyd said prior to Covid-19 cruise industry expenditure contribution was around $500m.</p>
        
            <p>But despite a future billion-dollar goal she said the future of cruise is not just about economic growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We are wanting to have a net carbon zero tourism supply chain, that can match the cruise line's focus to be net carbon zero by 2050.</p>
        
            <p>"We want New Zealanders to think that cruise is good for the country... and we want the visitors to come back with a really wonderful experience."</p>
