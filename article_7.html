            <p>The Queenstown Lakes District Council has filed charges against three companies over a slip in 2023 which forced the evacuation of homes, and left ten homes red-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>On 22 September the homes in Reavers Lane were hit by debris during torrential rain.</p>
        
            <p>In October the Queenstown Lakes District Council (QLDC) mayor Glyn Lewers said that Skyline Gondola had apologised, and said it believed debris from its worksite contributed to the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Forty-one people had to be evacuated from their homes on the night, and later 10 homes were red-stickered and two yellow-stickered.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday the Queenstown Lakes District Council said it had commenced a prosecution relating to the activities that allegedly contributed to the slip that occurred on the Ben Lomond Reserve that affected Reavers Lane on 22 September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The council has filed charges against three companies for alleged breaches of the Resource Management Act 1991, and the defendants are due to appear in the Queenstown District Court on 21 October 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The council said as the matter is before Court, it would not be commenting further.</p>
        
            <p>Skyline Enterprises has confirmed it is one of the three companies facing charges.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the company said it was disappointed to receive notification that Skyline is to be subject of regulatory action as a result of weather-related incidents that occurred last year.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said "In September 2023, an unexpected and very significant weather event hit Queenstown causing flooding and slips across the region. This rain event caused the movement of material on Bob's Peak, adjacent to Skyline, in the vicinity of the Reavers alluvial fan. Immediately following the incident last year, Skyline committed to supporting Queenstown Lakes District Council's clean-up activities and have worked in association with Council in the remediation of the slope below Skyline."</p>
        
            <p>The company said it acknowledges the distress the events have caused in the community.</p>
        
            <p>It said it, the QLDC, and other parties involved continue to work to ensure remedial works are expedited and completed for the benefit of the community, and it has no other comment at this time.</p>
