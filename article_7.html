            <p>The Lyttelton Port Company has been fined in Christchurch District Court on Wednesday, after a staff member was killed on the job in April 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Don Grant died when he was struck and killed by coal, on the deck of a cargo ship.</p>
        
            <p>He was hit when coal was being moved from the port via a conveyor belt, and loaded onto the ship by a jet-slinger. The jet-slinger propels coal into the ship's hold.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the incident, Grant was working as a "hatchman", and was stationed on the deck of the ship.</p>
        
            <p>Grant was following LPC's procedures, and was standing in the position he was trained to.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ director Kirstie Hewlett said investigations found several safety failings by LPC in the management of risks for workers involved in the loading of coal.</p>
        
            <p>"Included in the range of issues identified by the investigation was the hatchmen being located within the potential firing line of the jet-slinger. This meant if it was re-positioned, or moved without their knowledge, they'd be at risk of being struck by the coal."</p>
        
            <p>There were steps the company should have taken to provide a safe working environment, Hewlett said.</p>
        
            <p>"Loading coal is a known high-risk activity for LPC, and there were a lack of controls and policies in place around this specific activity.</p>
        
            <p>"There should have been more controls in place to reduce the potential of harm when coal was being loaded onto vessels at the port."</p>
        
            <p>Since the incident, LPC has made changes to reduce the risk of hatchmen being struck by coal, including hatchmen standing in a designated safe zone, rules around when the coal can be poured to keep workers safe, and increased CCTV.</p>
        
            <p>"Since April 2022 there has been significant work across the ports sector to improve health and safety," Hewlett said.</p>
        
            <p>"While this doesn't change what has happened. We want to assure those working on ports and their families that improving health and safety on New Zealand's ports has been a major priority."</p>
        
            <p>Lyttelton Port Company (LPC) has been ordered to pay a fine of $480,000 and $35,000 in costs to Maritime NZ.</p>
        
            <p>The judge also made an adverse publicity order requiring LPC to publish a statement about the incident.</p>
