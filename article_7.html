            <p>Mercury Energy is warning residential customers are set for a near 10 percent rise in electricity bills this year, blaming it on a host of factors including higher lines charges and energy costs.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the company revealed $418 million in half-year underlying profit, down four percent from a year ago, which Mercury put down to lower renewable generation and higher costs.</p>
        
            <p>It also slumped to a bottom line loss due to changes in the value of unhedged contracts.</p>
        
            <p>Mercury said from April, its residential customers faced an average 9.7 percent increase in their overall electricity bill, largely reflecting higher lines and transmission charges, and investment in infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>A rise in the cost of wholesale electricity was also a factor, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"While ensuring resilient, safe, and secure electricity is paramount, we recognise that the impacts will be felt to varying degrees with our customers," chief executive Stew Hamilton said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to directing our support to those who need it most," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Mercury chair Scott St John said the half-year period, which also saw it slump to a bottom-line loss, was marked by significant challenges, including inflation and cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>It said hydro inflows were low in the North Island, but Lake Taup≈ç was above normal levels by the end of 2024, which Mercury said was due to it rebuilding storage ahead of winter 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Wind generation was also down due to lower than average wind, and maintenance outages led to lower geothermal generation.</p>
        
            <p>Operating expenses were $16 million higher than the prior period, as the company invested in generation maintenance.</p>
