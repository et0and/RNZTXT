        <h2>Shoppers disappointed with businesses, survey finds</h2>
        <p>

            <p>A majority of consumers think the businesses they deal with are failing to deliver on their brand promises, according to a survey.</p>
        
            <p>A brand experience report by professional services company Accenture Song in New Zealand indicates an overall average of 71 percent of consumers do not believe their services providers are meeting expectations.</p>
        
            <p>The survey which looked at 80 New Zealand brands, found more than three-quarters (78 percent) of consumers who used travel services in the past year gave their provider a thumbs down, followed by disappointment with media and entertainment and general insurance (72 percent), telecommunicaitons (70 percent), retail including groceries (69 percent), utilities (66 percent) and financial services (63 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Accenture advertising chief business officer Storm Day said part of the problem was businesses cutting back on costs.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said prioritising profit over customer expectations could be more costly in the long run as it was difficult to rebuild brand value, once lost.</p>
        
            <p>"When customers see such a vast gap between a brand's promise and the experiences they encounter, their trust for the brand erodes," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Promising one thing and letting customers down when it comes to the experience is detrimental."</p>
        
            <p>She said there were tools available to help businesses meet customer expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"Technology offers enormous potential to help companies live up to their promises," Day said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're helping clients use generative AI to personalise the customer experience."</p>
