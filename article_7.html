        <h2>Grocery workers struggle with low pay, understaffing and customer abuse</h2>
        <p>
More than 70 percent of supermarket and grocery workers said their wages were not sufficient to cover living costs, a union survey found.

            <p>Low pay, understaffing and customer abuse are causing major concern across the grocery industry, according to a survey of more than 1500 supermarket and grocery workers from major retail chains.</p>
        
            <p>The survey - completed electronically in May through First Union's member database - shows thousands of supermarket workers are grappling with the high cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>They are also dealing with regular incidents of customer abuse in understaffed supermarkets that are typically paying the majority of workers less than the living wage.</p>
        
            <p>Union national secretary for retail and finance Rudd Hughes said workers hailed as heroes during the Covid-19 pandemic were no longer treated that way by employers.</p>
        
            <p>More than 70 percent of those surveyed said their wages were not sufficient to cover living costs, and more than 60 percent of a sample size of 1514 workers said their pay rises over the past two years had not kept pace with rising costs.</p>
        
            <p>Only 21 percent said if they received an unexpected $500 bill tomorrow, they could pay it.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the National-NZ First-ACT coalition's repeal of fair pay agreement legislation denied workers a pathway to negotiate minimum standards across the supermarket industry.</p>
        
            <p>"They've offered up a paltry tax cut, whereas fair pay agreements would have actually made a real difference to workers' wages."</p>
        
            <p>The survey showed 69 percent of workers had considered quitting in the past two years, and on top of this, 90 percent said their stores were understaffed.</p>
        
            <p>"Understaffing is a major contributor to workers' stress and burnout, and it makes supermarkets much more unsafe workplaces for staff than they should be," Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>Abuse of staff by customers and other incidents of violence and dangerous behaviours at work were a growing problem, and more likely to occur with fewer staff around.</p>
        
            <p>More than a third of those surveyed reported being verbally assaulted or threatened at work, and 30 percent said they had had to confront thieves in their stores.</p>
        
            <p>Another 4 percent said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted, and 2 percent said they had been spat on.</p>
        
            <p>"No one should have to deal with regular and sustained danger and abuse at work, and least of all those who aren't even paid a living wage and have few prospects for improvements in the workplace," Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Foodstuffs announced up to 25 Pak'n'Save and New World supermarkets would be using facial recognition technology to try and combat rising thefts and violence against staff.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the survey's findings would be key in outlining minimum standards for the union's upcoming bargaining with all supermarket major chains.</p>
