            <p>Elon Musk's satellite broadband service Starlink might have topped Consumer NZ's ranking of the country's best internet providers - but there's a warning it won't be the best solution for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>Product Test writer Nick Gelling said 80 percent of Starlink's customers were very satisfied with its service, reliability and connection speed.</p>
        
            <p>It was particularly welcomed by rural customers who had not had access to strong internet services in the past, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Starlink was the first satellite service that Consumer had received enough responses about to include in the survey.</p>
        
            <p>"While more expensive than its competitors, Starlink offers triple the speed. That would be a big deal for rural customers who haven't experienced such fast internet before. It might also explain Starlink's extremely high satisfaction score, 80 percent compared with the average of 58 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Starlink is able to provide a better service in rural areas, it's quite a lot faster than copper internet and even the 4G wireless internet that gets out into the regions."</p>
        
            <p>While it was a good option for people who could not connect to fibre, it would probably not be best for those living in cities, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Starlink doesn't really compete with fibre internet. If you are in a place that can get fibre internet, you're better off going with that than with a satellite provider.</p>
        
            <p>"The satisfaction results [for Starlink] wouldn't be anywhere near that high if you were just talking to people in urban areas."</p>
        
            <p>Now NZ was the second-best performer, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been around a few years but are still not a huge player in the market. They're notable for having really good customer service."</p>
        
            <p>Sky Broadband, which was the top performer last year, was bottom of the table.</p>
        
            <p>Sky had been a fairly new entrant to the market last year and had made a push with competitive pricing and putting its "best foot forward", Gelling said.</p>
        
            <p>"Now they've captured that core base maybe they've relaxed a bit and their service has slipped. We're really keen to emphasis that SKy Broadband is a good reminder not to get complacent. Just because your provider was good it doesn't mean they'll be good into the future."</p>
        
            <p>Internet providers could be doing better by New Zealanders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that our overall market average for customers satisfaction is only 58 percent across the whole industry shows there's definitely plenty of space to improve."</p>
        
            <p>Many people were worried about how difficult it would be to change providers, but 80 percent of those who had switched said it was a simple process, Gelling said.</p>
