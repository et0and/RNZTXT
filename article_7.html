            <p>Blackwell Global Holdings, a small finance concern listed on the New Zealand stock exchange, said it had just found out that one of its directors, Michael Chai, was arrested and detained in January.</p>
        
            <p>Blackwell Global chairperson Sean Joyce said Chai's arrest was not related to Blackwell and they were trying to find the exact details of the charges.</p>
        
            <p>"The independent directors have today, through an intermediary, sought the resignation of Mr Chai as a director of the company."</p>
        
            <p>"The independent directors are taking legal advice on this matter, and are looking at the implications of this development on the company."</p>
