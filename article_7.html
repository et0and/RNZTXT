            <p>A Wellington mum says she is relying on bread and pasta to keep food costs down and fill tummies at home.</p>
        
            <p>At Pak'nSave Kilbirnie in Wellington, shoppers on Tuesday gave a resounding consensus that fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy are putting serious pressure on their budgets.</p>
        
            <p>This comes as the Commerce Commission investigates the two big supermarket chains over pricing and promotional practices.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mum and community worker Chanelle Pokoati said the high cost of groceries has made bread a crucial staple for her family.</p>
        
            <p>"We're eating a lot of carbs to get full. We eat a lot of pasta, rice, potatoes, and bread. A lot of bread. Like, toast is our everyday thing. We just get full on bread."</p>
        
            <p>She said every grocery shop, she made hard choices to meet her children's needs and keep costs low.</p>
        
            <p>"I find that I have to sacrifice a lot more. To be able to buy [my child] fruit, we'll sacrifice and not get a meat pack or something."</p>
        
            <p>Primary school teacher Fiona Crossett said she would sometimes put pricier items in her trolley back at the checkout.</p>
        
            <p>"Cheese, sometimes I think I take that out of the shopping trolley because it is a bit more expensive and I'm kinda going not buying meat as much and looking for alternatives, because it becomes cheaper."</p>
        
            <p>Kilbirnie shoppers were also sceptical of the deals and specials advertised on supermarket shelves.</p>
        
            <p>One man said: "They only put on special things that they can't sell. So, they drag you in with that so you can buy some more".</p>
        
            <p>Crossett said: "I don't tend to go for them because I don't really see them as a saver".</p>
        
            <p>"I think you just end up spending more money because you think it's a good deal but it's not."</p>
        
            <p>Another woman said: "I always check on the individual price of the product, because sometimes you can get ripped off or perhaps the ticketing price is not the same at the checkout".</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission investigation into Woolworths and Foodstuffs will look at whether certain pricing and promotional practices comply with the Fair Trading Act.</p>
        
            <p>It followed complaints laid by Consumer New Zealand which questioned the accuracy of pricing and specials at supermarkets.</p>
        
            <p>But the Council of Trade Union's chief economist Craig Renney did not expect the investigation to make a difference to food prices on its own.</p>

            <p>"That's something that we require more competition in the market for, and something that would require more resilient supply chains."</p>
        
            <p>Renney said people on the lowest income also needed to be on a living wage to have any chance at staying ahead of rising food prices.</p>
        
            <p>He said right now, the lack of supermarket competition meant low wage earners were bearing the brunt of high grocery costs.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why we've consistently called for employers to pay the living wage, because that's calculated to give people more choice and more decency in their lives".</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs and Woolworths said they would comply with the commission's investigation, but neither accepted RNZ's requests for an interview.</p>
