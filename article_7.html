            <p>The country's biggest bank has cut retail interest rates in the wake of softer than expected inflation numbers.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ has cut home loan and term deposit rates between 10 and 30 basis points (BPS).</p>
        
            <p>The popular one year fixed special mortgage rate is falling 29 basis points to 6.85 percent, and the two year rate by 30bp to 6.49 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Local managing director for personal banking Grant Knuckey said market conditions had changed in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the OCR (official cash rate) announcement last week, we've seen a drop in wholesale rates so we're able to pass on savings to our customers.</p>
        
            <p>"In recent years many people have typically fixed their home loans on shorter terms. That means many will soon be in a position to take advantage of these lower rates."</p>
        
            <p>At the same time ANZ cut term deposit rates by 10 to 30 BPS for 6-month and longer terms because of recent decreases in wholesale rates and the reduction in home loan rates.</p>
        
            <p>Last week Westpac led the sector with cuts to similar levels as ANZ for lending and deposit rates.</p>
        
            <p>A slowing of inflation to an annual rate of 3.3 percent has prompted economists to forecast official cash rate cuts as early as August, but most definitely by November.</p>
