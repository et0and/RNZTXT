            <p>Thousands of Woolworths supermarket workers have walked off the job for two hours to protest their wages and working conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 200 shops are affected by the shutdown between midday and 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>FIRST Union national retail secretary Rudd Hughes said staff from Woolworths stores in Auckland were arriving in Ponsonby for a protest.</p>
        
            <p>"We should see a really sizeable crowd here," he said. "We've been at the bargaining table for over 13 days. We're getting very little movement from the company. We've moved quite a long way in our claims, and you know, what we're hearing from them is that they don't want to move any further."</p>
        
            <p>Some stores may have to close during the strike action, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will certainly be minimal staffing, we're not sure whether or not it will affect them as much in that way, this is more about getting our voice out there and getting the company to hear us, because they haven't been hearing us across the [negotiating] table."</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said workers were also concerned about the rising levels of abuse directed at staff in stores.</p>

            <p>Woolworths says stores will be open as usual, and that it is offering workers increases of between 6.8 percent and 10.1 percent over two years.</p>
        
            <p>"Making sure our team is paid fairly has always been a priority for us and we've brought a strong offer to the table in our discussions with FIRST Union," said a spokesperson. "We are one of the leaders in pay for our sector."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths said it had improved sick leave benefits, increased caregiver and bereavement leave and improved discounts it offers to staff, and agreed a 19 percent pay increase in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, we're underway with a $45 million investment in making our stores safer including team safety cameras in all stores, trolley locks, fog cannons and double-entry gates. We're also looking at bringing in duress alarms for those working in isolated areas.</p>
        
            <p>"In the current challenging economic environment, our customers need us to provide affordable food. We have to balance increasing costs in our business so we can provide more value for our customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Our stores will be open as usual and we will continue to engage with FIRST Union in good faith."</p>
