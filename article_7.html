            <p>The husband of ejected MP Darleen Tana has set up a new e-bike business just months after his former business was liquidated owing hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>Company Office documents confirm Christian Hoff-Nielsen has registered a bike hire company, Woohoo Trading, with him listed as the sole director and shareholder.</p>
        
            <p>Allegations were made against Hoff-Nielsen's former business that migrant workers were owed wages and there had been breaches of visa conditions.</p>

            <p>That led to questions of Tana about how much she knew of the claims, what she did about them, and what steps she took to inform the Greens.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party suspended her in March and hired a lawyer to investigate, whose report said the MP changed her evidence during the course of the inquiry, and Hoff-Neilsen's evidence tended to obfuscate rather than elucidate the issues.</p>
        
            <p>She left the Green Party but refused to quit as an MP until the Greens invoked the waka-jumping legislation last week, and her removal as an MP was confirmed by the Speaker this week.</p>
        
            <p>Hoff-Nielsen's previous bike business went into voluntary liquidation in July owing $413,000, including $133,000 to Inland Revenue.</p>
