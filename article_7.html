            <p>It is an anxious time for 230 North Island mill workers who are waiting for a meeting where they will learn if their company is closing down or not.</p>
        
            <p>Winstone Pulp International has proposed closing two of its mills near Ohakune because of high wholesale power prices.</p>
        
            <p>For the past few weeks Winstone has been meeting with energy company Mercury and ministers to try and find a way to stay open.</p>
        
            <p>A petition was launched last week to save the mill - as there are fears the nearby communities will turn into ghost towns because Winstone is the main employer in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The final decision was expected on Monday, but it was extended until Tuesday afternoon, and the company planned to meet with workers at 3pm to tell them the outcome.</p>

            <p>Petition organiser Liz Brooker said it had been a tough time for workers and their families.</p>
        
            <p>"With literally everyone knowing someone who works at the mill, our whole community is understandably on edge.</p>
        
            <p>"Kaimahi have already started planning to leave the region and then, out of the blue on Sunday night, Monday's planned announcement to staff was suddenly moved to Tuesday afternoon. This has provided us with a small glimmer of hope," Brooker said.</p>

            <p>Winstone Pulp electrician and union delegate Daniel Abernathy told Morning Report there was a "bit of hope" that a deal was being made with the government so the mills could stay open.</p>
        
            <p>Abernathy said the company had responded positively to the 189 submissions staff made to improve the mill and cust down on costs.</p>
        
            <p>He said staff had been working hard to make sure the mills were in the best condition, should they remain open.</p>
        
            <p>Resources minister Shane Jones has threatened to end the electricity authority if it did not work harder to regulate power prices, but the government is yet to intervene on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>However, Brooker said people were wondering if that would change the upcoming news.</p>
        
            <p>"We know others like Pan Pac in Hawke's Bay have been with WPI in high level discussions with the government, so just maybe a solution has been found?" she said.</p>
