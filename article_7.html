            <p>Stuff has revealed the logo and name of its new 6pm TV bulletin that will replace Newshub at 6 from July.</p>
        
            <p>It will be now be called ThreeNews.</p>

            <p>Samantha Hayes, who currently hosts Newshub at 6 will present the new bulletin - which will be hour-long on weekdays and half an hour in weekends - on TV channel Three and the 3 Now app when it begins on 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>"Before we had Newshub we had 3 News, we felt that the name 'ThreeNews' was both a nod to our storied history, but also different enough to show that this isn't a continuation of our older news offering but an evolution," Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD) networks head Juliet Peterson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Stuff isn't just reproducing what we've always had. It's going to be an exciting new bulletin while still retaining Three's unique touch and approach.</p>
        
            <p>Several senior reporters and producers from Newshub will join Stuff journalists around the country to produce the programme.</p>
        
            <p>"We are producing something that will be both familiar and fresh, a great marriage of the Three brand and Stuff's live and lively news ethos," Stuff Digital managing director Nadia Tolich said.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Newshub's owners WBD announced it had made a deal with Stuff to create a replacement 6pm news bulletin.</p>
        
            <p>WBD had announced the closure of Newshub in March to curb losses it described as unsustainable.</p>
        
            <p>It also axed its show, The Block NZ, and will sell the four townhouses later in 2024.</p>
