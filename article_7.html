            <p>With forecasts of significant electricity price rises on the horizon, the Electricity Retailers Association NZ (ERANZ) has launched a new online resource for those struggling to stay "warm and well" this winter.</p>
        
            <p>The online portal aims to provide options for consumers struggling to pay their bills, and while some of these are price plans from energy retailers, others are provided by government or community organisations.</p>
        
            <p>These include pointing people towards the ERANZ-funded EnergyMate program, which provides a coach who will visit a customer's home and develop an action plan with their power company.</p>
        
            <p>Other options that are highlighted include switching to a more manageable power plan such as prepay.</p>
        
            <p>Information is also provided about programs like the ERANZ power credits scheme, which can potentially provide lump-sum credit payment worth $110 twice a year for eligible customers.</p>
        
            <p>Other recommendations include directing customers towards the Energy Efficiency & Conservation Authority's Warmer Kiwi Homes grant and informing renters of their rights under the Healthy Homes Standards.</p>
        
            <p>ERANZ chief executive Bridget Abernethy said there was a need for the information to be made available.</p>
        
            <p>"We think it's important to share information about the support available to consumers. We're hoping it will also be useful for organisations offering financial advice to people in their communities, particularly those experiencing energy hardship.</p>
        
            <p>"Our members are very conscious that rising electricity prices will have an impact on consumers, and this is just one of the many ways in which they can help," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first thing households should do if they are having difficulties paying their power bill is call their retailer. Electricity retailers have teams and programmes specifically designed to help customers in hardship find more affordable ways to pay.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition, we're pleased to offer clear information to consumers about other help available."</p>
        
            <p>Electricity Authority data shows arrears and disconnections seem to be falling over recent months, but this follows a seasonal trend.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ's acting head of research and advocacy, Jessica Walker said access to easy-to-understand information for those struggling was vital.</p>
        
            <p>"Energy hardship in New Zealand is a grim reality for many households, with Consumer NZ's research finding that nearly one in five households struggle to pay their power bill.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been signalled that many households could see double-digit price increases this year and as a result, we expect more and more New Zealanders to have trouble staying warm and well this winter."</p>
        
            <p>Jake Lilley, spokesperson for financial mentor network Fincap, said the Electricity Authority, community support networks and the electricity industry have been focusing on improving how they respond to people struggling with their bills.</p>
        
            <p>"We welcome the mandatory customer care obligations on electricity retailers that will set clear minimum standards for support from April.</p>
        
            <p>"These are a first step to a future where no one goes without the essential electricity service they need because they are broke or struggling to community."</p>
        
            <p>He said mentors often reported that missed payments were covered by Work and Income.</p>
        
            <p>"This feeds other issues with the previously reported $2.6 billion of debt to the Ministry of Social Development."</p>
        
            <p>ERANZ said the resource was not a response to the customer care obligations.</p>
