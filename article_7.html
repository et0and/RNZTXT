            <p>A jewellery store owner is still concerned about safety, months after being hospitalised in a robbery.</p>
        
            <p>In June, Gurdeep Singh and his family were tending to their store, Pooja Jewellers in Auckland's Papatoetoe, when a group of men burst in, trying to grab trays of jewellery.</p>
        
            <p>Singh tried to intervene, and was struck multiple times in the head with a hammer by one of the assailants.</p>
        
            <p>The group fled the scene after Singh's son chased them out of the shop with a sword.</p>
        
            <p>Five people were arrested in relation to the incident earlier in the year, including a 16-year-old who was charged with aggravated robbery.</p>
        
            <p>Months on, Singh said he was doing good and feeling positive, though he was still physically recovering.</p>
        
            <p>The pain is still there a bit, he said.</p>
        
            <p>This injury has done something to my eyes, I'm kind of finding it very hard to work with the bright lights on.</p>
        
            <p>With the pain and stuff, as per the doctor said, it will take maybe a year or so to heal 100 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said they had since increased security in the store, and had not had any further break-ins or attacks after the June attack.</p>
        
            <p>The door is much bigger, stronger, it's just impossible to get through now, he said.</p>
        
            <p>We have extra locks, and we are always aware and vigilant to see what's going on.</p>
        
            <p>Some safety concerns still remained, however.</p>
        
            <p>We feel safe when we are inside the store, I do feel sometimes with other people out there, I don't know, once crazy person could come out, attack for no reason, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just what happened to us, it's just what's actually happening around the world, especially in South Auckland, that we're noticing a lot of stabbing and killing and shooting and stuff like that.</p>
        
            <p>My concern is for the whole community actually to be honest, not just only for me and my family.</p>
        
            <p>Police were checking in on Pooja Jewellers as RNZ arrived to interview Singh.</p>
        
            <p>He said foot patrols from police and community patrollers were making a difference.</p>
        
            <p>It does make me feel more protected, he said.</p>
        
            <p>I feel safe, and I feel comfortable and happy for the shoppers, the people coming in from other parts of the city to Papatoetoe.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said the local retail association was in the process of working with Auckland Transport and the council to install more CCTV in the area.</p>
        
            <p>We have a few, but I realised not all of them are in working condition as they should be.</p>
        
            <p>We have requested for new CCTV, and hopefully we will have more cameras very soon in the town.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said he wanted more security personnel in the area into the new year, and for them be present for longer hours than the previous patrols.</p>
        
            <p>He said following his attack, Papatoetoe retailers had come together.</p>
        
            <p>We're all looking out for each other, helping and supporting, that's the best thing that's happened in our town, I think that will continue in coming years as well.</p>
