            <p>Dairy prices have recorded their biggest jump in three months.</p>
        
            <p>The average price at the overnight auction rose 3.3 percent to US$3861 a tonne, following the 1.8 percent rise a fortnight ago.</p>
        
            <p>The price of wholemilk powder, which strongly influenced the payouts for local farmers, rose 2.9 percent to US$3408 a tonne.</p>
        
            <p>Prices for all other products also rose, including butter, up more than 5 percent, skim milk powder up 3.5 percent and mozzarella up nearly 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The dairy season is winding down and recent market prices supported a forecast payout of $7.80 per kilogram of milk solids.</p>
        
            <p>NZX dairy analyst Rosalind Crickett said wholemilk powder was at its second-highest price in the last 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"Purchasing was led by a perceived return to the market by North Asia on this occasion, with the region nearly doubling its buying activity," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Crickett said it could be driven by a slight drop in March milk production in China.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, the results overnight are pleasing to see for farmers as the curtain is drawn on the 2023/24 New Zealand milk production season."</p>
