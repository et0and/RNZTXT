        <h2>The environmental cost of mega data centres</h2>
        <p>
Microsoft has unveiled a 'hyperscale' data centre in New Zealand and Amazon is opening one soon. Their work is an energy-hungry undertaking. Audio

            <p>Microsoft has unveiled its first hyperscale data centre in New Zealand, joining another colossal centre operated by the company CDC.</p>
        
            <p>Amazon Web Services is also due to open one soon.</p>
        
            <p>Their growth is partly riding on a boom in using artificial intelligence, for everything from web searches to complex modelling.</p>
        
            <p>Training and using AI is an energy-hungry undertaking.</p>
        
            <p>According to Goldman Sachs, a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search and data centres globally are expected to more than double their power use by 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Reuters recently cited Morgan Stanley research putting data centres' 2030 climate impact at about 2.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.</p>
        
            <p>Like Microsoft, many other tech giants have ambitious goals to lower or eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
            <p>But they are also recording explosive growth in a world with finite renewable energy supplies.</p>
        
            <p>One investigation by the Guardian found many of the big tech companies were artificially lowering their climate impacts using products called renewable energy certificates.</p>
        
            <p>Other similar reports have increased the pressure for companies to show they are growing the renewable supply where they operate, enough to cover their operations and growth.</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to a deal with Contact Energy, Microsoft says its new data centre at Westgate in Auckland is powered entirely by renewable electricity.</p>
        
            <p>
Data centres are on track to consume 4 percent of the world's electricity by 2026.

            <p>Technically the power comes from the national grid, but Microsoft NZ managing director Vanessa Sorenson says signing a 10-year supply deal with Contact two years ago gave the electricity company the certainty it needed to build a new unit at the Te Huka geothermal field. Microsoft also paid Contact $300 million to support building the geothermal facility.</p>
        
            <p>Although the deal was done before the advent of ChatGPT and the subsequent AI explosion, Sorenson says Microsoft has run the numbers 30-odd years into the future and will have plenty of renewable power to back its New Zealand growth.</p>
        
            <p>"In terms of the expansion we have 100 percent done those numbers," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"And [Te Huka Unit 3] is going to generate 51.4MW and we don't need anywhere near that, so we'll actually be putting energy back on the grid."</p>
        
            <p>Like CDC's new data centre, Microsoft's will not use water for cooling - addressing a concern with data centres overseas sucking precious water to cool their servers in regions which are already too dry.</p>
        
            <p>Sorenson says the Westgate centre is the most sustainable one the company has built.</p>
        
            <p>But while the new wave of New Zealand centres are selling their sustainability, the average person typing in a query to ChatGPT or some other cloud-based programme is probably not putting an energy load on a New Zealand-powered server - it is more likely in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Like the internet itself, the impacts of that energy use are global - unless a customer, such as the New Zealand government, has specifically contracted with the likes of Microsoft to have its data stored here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Rebecca Mills of carbon impact consultancy the Lever Room says AI used well can slash emissions and help combat climate change.</p>
        
            <p>Her company uses it for tasks such as working out how much carbon is being sucked in by the ocean, figuring out energy-saving routes, and helping companies quickly measure and shrink their greenhouse emissions.</p>
        
            <p>She is keen to see the new developments built in the most sustainable way.</p>
        
            <p>"For countries like New Zealand who have a good renewable energy mix then we ae at a really strategic advantage here especially if we're building that into our potential [and] planning.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as the potential to unlock and help us reduce emissions, I think that could be quite significant."</p>

            <p>Not all tasks are quite so important as procuring a habitable climate.</p>
        
            <p>Environmentalist Izzy Fenwick recently got a big reaction to a post on social media asking people to "please stop using ChatGPT for tasks you could simply do yourself".</p>
        
            <p>She owns a software company, Futureful, helping businesspeople make more ethical decisions - and stresses she was not anti-AI, just anti-wasteful uses of it.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of our sustainability challenges are so complex, it's more than the human brain can wade through. Great use. Not a great use is 'create an image of a half dog half lizard' or writing this 100-word email I can't be bothered doing myself," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the really interesting comments I got a lot of from that post I shared was, 'oh my god I had no idea'."</p>
        
            <p>She says many of her contacts were horrified to learn how much water and energy their queries were using, when those resources could go to much more critical - even life-saving - uses.</p>
        
            <p>But it is not always easy to avoid AI.</p>
        
            <p>When I typed "data centre emissions" into an ordinary Google search bar to research this story, the first result was an AI generated overview from Gemini, Google's artificial intelligence chatbot - despite the query not having asked for an AI summary</p>
        
            <p>It turns out AI is well aware of its own impact, or at least of the servers on which it runs.</p>
        
            <p>The summary said: "Data centres contribute to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases that cause rising temperatures, more severe weather events, and sea-level rise."</p>
        
            <p>User beware.</p>
