            <p>The award-winning Newshub journalist who spearheaded a failed attempt by staff to save its news operation has taken a new job with The New Zealand Herald.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Morrah is joining the Herald's editorial team on 15 June as a senior investigative reporter, focused on producing online video news content.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month it was confirmed that Newshub's owner Warner Brothers Discovery had rejected the staff's counter-proposal. The Morrah-devised plan would have seen a stripped-down version of the television news bulletin, transitioning online within two years.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the entire Newshub operation will shut down at the end of next month (June 30) with the loss of up to 300 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>NZME chief content officer Murray Kirkness said Morrah - twice named Reporter of The Year and a winner of Best News Coverage awards at the NZ Television Awards and Voyager Media Awards - would bring "invaluable" expertise to his new role.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only is he an exceptional investigative reporter, but his experience will be very beneficial as we continue to focus on our multimedia approach to news, expanding and enhancing our video news offering."</p>

            <p>Morrah said he was "excited" to continue to deliver investigative news in video form as well as contributing to NZME's other platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"I see this as a great opportunity and a new challenge where I'll be helping to expand the New Zealand Herald's video offerings."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Newhub's long-time 6pm news anchor, Mike McRoberts, is moving to the National Business Review as Te Ao Māori editor.</p>
