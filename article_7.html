            <p>TVNZ staff are railing against the broadcaster's proposal to slash almost 70 jobs, and programmes including Sunday and Fair Go.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were told of the plans last week, but E Tū union members have today unanimously rejected the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>E Tū negotiations specialist Michael Wood says members are angry about both the suggested changes, and shoddy consultation.</p>
        
            <p>They understand change is needed, but want the opportunity to share alternative ideas, rather than being dictated to by their employer, Wood said.</p>
        
            <p>The union has asked TVNZ for more time to provide feedback, better collaboration, and to share the financial information it used to inform the proposal, he said.</p>
