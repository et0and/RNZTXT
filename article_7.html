            <p>A New Zealand software company is reaping the rewards of investment in artificial intelligence, hitting a major milestone of 100 million users.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch-based Lumin started as a simple cloud-based PDF editor, but has since added AI features and e-signature services - which have proved popular.</p>
        
            <p>Lumin was also integrated with Google Workspace.</p>
        
            <p>Founder and chief executive Max Ferguson said key to recent growth had been investment in AI features and larger businesses adopting Lumin.</p>
        
            <p>The company's major customers included Airbnb, Netflix and Uber.</p>
        
            <p>He said Lumin - formed in 2014 - was also profitable, which can be uncommon for young tech companies.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been of the philosophy that constant growth and profitability is the way we want to run the business," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson said a key reason was that Lumin started with little capital and did not raise venture capital.</p>
        
            <p>Lumin also focused on keeping its product offering simple and easy to use, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson said he was "passionate" about the New Zealand tech ecosystem, and was committed to keeping the business headquartered in the country, with offices around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"I see Christchurch as a really good hub. We've got a great university here, great other educational facilities and there's a lot of people that are looking for opportunities in tech," Ferguson said.</p>
        
            <p>He also believed the tech sector presented "huge [economic] growth potential" for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the other exports and businesses we work on rely on physical products and then shipping costs get in the way and it becomes a bit more challenging."</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson said tech could be exported "pretty much on an equal footing" to other major countries.</p>
        
            <p>He also wanted to see younger New Zealanders inspired by the tech sector.</p>
        
            <p>"When I went through the school careers process, there were few options presented to me. I could be an engineer, or a doctor, or a lawyer - which are all great professions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to spread the word that, in the modern world, going niche in terms of your profession and going into things like tech could be a really great career option."</p>
