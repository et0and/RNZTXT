            <p>The local head of supermarket giant Woolworths is leaving the company.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Spencer Sonn will depart at the end of March after four years with the Australian owned chain.</p>
        
            <p>During that time he has led the business through the pandemic and unprecedented scrutiny by the Commerce Commission and government over dominance in the sector by itself and Foodstuffs.</p>

            <p>The regulator's market report resulted in new regulations, a code of conduct, and industry regulator over the past 18 months aimed at promoting greater competition in the grocery sector and lowering prices, although two major chains were criticised last year for making little or no progress on key issues.</p>
        
            <p>In addition Sonn has also overseen a multi-million dollar revamp of the chain, including a rebranding from Countdown back to Woolworths.</p>
        
            <p>However, local earnings have fallen, as costs rose faster than revenue, prompting the parent company last year to write down the value of the operation by $1.6 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths group chief executive Amanda Bardwell said Sonn had headed the New Zealand operation through "challenging times".</p>
        
            <p>"Some highlights of his time leading our New Zealand business include the rebranding of Countdown to Woolworths, the introduction of Everyday Rewards, the transformation of FreshChoice and our fresh food journey including the refresh of our cold chain."</p>
        
            <p>Sonn was positive about his time in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been lucky to ... meet many local customers over the last few years, but also to spend time with our team, growers and local suppliers, and see first-hand the passion and care they demonstrate every day."</p>
        
            <p>Sonn is returning to South Africa for a position with an unrelated large retailer, also called Woolworths, whose businesses include Country Road fashion brands.</p>
        
            <p>However, he leaves the business with two outstanding issues: a bid to buy meal maker Beak and Johnston, which is now before the Commerce Commission and, criminal charges brought by the regulator for alleged inaccurate pricing and misleading advertising.</p>
