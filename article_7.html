            <p>The average New Zealander is expected to spend $600 on Black Friday, according to a PriceSpy survey, with more than half saying they will be buying Christmas gifts.</p>
        
            <p>But those unsure how much to spend on presents were not alone, economist Brad Olsen said.</p>
        
            <p>The same question was pestering him last week, so he turned to Instagram for answers, creating a poll asking his followers how much they were planning to spend on Christmas and birthday gifts for close friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>More than 500 people responded.</p>
        
            <p>"About half of all of the respondents to my unscientific survey or poll suggested that between $51 and $100 is the usual amount that you should spend on a gift for friends or family," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, nearly 200 of Olsen's Instagram followers wanted to spend between $26 and $50.</p>
        
            <p>"Thirty-nine percent of respondents in my unscientific poll chose that."</p>
        
            <p>About 40 people told him they were looking at spending more than $100 per gift.</p>
        
            <p>Olsen said the results of the poll surprised him.</p>
        
            <p>"I might have expected a few more people to opt for the much cheaper than usual gift size, $0 to $25 given all of the challenges out there at the moment, but a lot of people highlighting that it really depends on if they can find the right gift or not."</p>
        
            <p>On the streets of Auckland, opinions on how much gifts should cost ranged from the very cheap to the very expensive.</p>
        
            <p>One man in Auckland CBD told First Up said he would splurge on his mum because she was a generous gift-giver</p>
        
            <p>He was planning to buy her something for about $200.</p>
        
            <p>The most expensive gift she had ever given him - which was also the most expensive gift he had ever received - was $1000, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Many others believed that presents should not cost more than $20.</p>
        
            <p>One father said he would make his daughter a present, but would not spend more than $20 on materials.</p>
        
            <p>And for those with a lot of people on their list, $2 shops were a popular option. One man with 12 nieces told First Up his budget only allowed him to shop there.</p>
        
            <p>Social media influencer Rachel Luetele runs an Instagram account on budgeting tips, called The Savvy Saver.</p>
        
            <p>She said a good starting point was sticking to a list of what your recipients would like.</p>
        
            <p>"Have a list - figure out what your children actually need and what they would love, and don't just worry too much about spending a certain amount of money. Focus more on what they actually would find valuable and enjoy, and focus on that."</p>
        
            <p>Next, people should get creative with the shopping, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Look secondhand, there is absolutely nothing wrong with going to secondhand stores and buying things to DIY and make.</p>
        
            <p>"And then if you can't find what you need, then definitely research online. Wait for the sales. Black Friday is a really good sale, obviously."</p>
        
            <p>The Mental Health Foundation said money and the expectation on people to spend was one of the biggest causes of stress at Christmas time.</p>
        
            <p>It was reminding people not to forget about all the free, festive community events that could make the season a bit more magical.</p>
