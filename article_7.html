            <p>SolarZero customers are being told not to worry about the future of their solar panels, as the company goes into liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>The company said on Tuesday that "due to unsustainable operating losses, and liquidity constraints, the business is unable to continue trading in its current form".</p>
        
            <p>SolarZero owner BlackRock told RNZ on Thursday the board of SolarZero had formed a view that the business was not sustainable in the long term without significant restructuring.</p>
        
            <p>Discussions were held with multiple parties to identify options that could support the business "while meeting the needs of stakeholders", a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Regrettably, these efforts could not be brought to fruition and the company's board made the difficult decision to appoint a third-party liquidator to oversee the transition of the business and address the interests of creditors."</p>
        
            <p>BlackRock had been the sole shareholder of SolarZero since 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Some customers were concerned about the future of their contracts with SolarZero. It sold solar power systems on a no-money-upfront basis, and a 20-year lease agreement.</p>
        
            <p>SolarZero said the subscription would continue for existing customers, although no new systems would be sold. It would be managed by Verofi.</p>
        
            <p>'The benefits will continue including battery replacement, 24/7 monitoring, battery optimisation, repairs and support when moving house. The SolarZero App remains fully operational and is supported by experienced solar engineers."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Green Investment Finance has invested in SolarZero. It has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ said SolarZero was entitled to assign its rights and obligations under its terms and conditions to another party.</p>
        
            <p>"SolarZero has advised that 'services will continue uninterrupted to customers throughout the country with Verofi'. Therefore, at this stage, there is no need for customers to do anything.</p>
        
            <p>"If Verofi wishes to change the terms and conditions, it would need the agreement of customers to do so," a spokesperson said.</p>
