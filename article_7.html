        <h2>Retailers push for overhaul of Easter trading hours</h2>
        <p>
Shop owners say current trading restrictions - which say they must close, but online retailers can stay open - are outdated, unfair and confusing.

            <p>Retailers want legislative changes so they can open over Easter, arguing current trading restrictions are outdated, unfair and confusing.</p>
        
            <p>Most shops must close on Good Friday and Easter Sunday under the Shop Trading Hours Act, but the legislation does not cover online retailers.</p>
        
            <p>Dairies, service stations, restaurants and cafes can open, but alcohol can only be sold to people who are eating a meal.</p>
        
            <p>Breaches of trading restrictions could result in fines of up to $1000, but councils could provide exemptions for certain shops to open on Easter Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>About 65,000 people were expected to attend this weekend's Warbirds Over WƒÅnaka, where local shops were allowed to open to provide an economic spin-off for the region.</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young said inconsistent restrictions nationwide created confusion for shoppers and retailers.</p>
        
            <p>"Stores are open in one area where you might live, then they're not open in another area. That can be quite a surprise," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"From a business perspective, say you're a national business, you have to be cognisant of what the specific local rules and interpretations of that legislation are for each of the holidays to make sure that you can comply appropriately."</p>
        
            <p>Business owners should be able to choose whether to open over Easter, Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then retailers have the choice around what is the best thing for them in their region, and it's consistent right across the country, and it's consistent with the online shoppers where you can shop 24/7," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Young said Retail NZ supported the continuation of special rights for shop workers, which meant they were guaranteed Easter Sunday off if requested.</p>
