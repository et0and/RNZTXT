        <h2>Cancer diagnostics firm Pacific Edge hit by US insurance setback</h2>
        <p>
The losses come as the company reels from the decision of US Medicare provider Novitas to axe cover for CXbladder tests.

            <p>Cancer diagnostics company Pacific Edge has posted a bigger-than-expected loss as it invested in expansion but suffered from problems with a medical insurer in the US.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the 6 months ended September, compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>Net loss $15.3m vs $10.6m</p>
        
            <p>Revenue $16.6m vs $13.6m</p>
        
            <p>Operating expenses $31.8m vs $24.2m</p>
        
            <p>Cash reserve $62.2m vs $93.4m </p>
        
            <p>No dividend</p>
        
            <p>The company has been battling the fallout from a decision by US Medicare provider Novitas that it would no longer cover the cost of the CXBladder tests, which accounted for about 70 percent of its revenue.</p>
        
            <p>The decision has been contested by the company and US users and for the time being use of the Pacific Edge tests are still being covered.</p>
        
            <p>It is also assessing a proposed rule change from the US Food and Drug Administration that would categorise lab-developed tests as medical devices, requiring it to show the safety and effectiveness of their tests.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Edge Chairman Chris Gallaher said the company has managed growth despite headwinds.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific Edge has continued to grow test volumes and revenue through the first half of the 2024 financial year amid the ongoing uncertainty over Medicare coverage of Cxbladder. "</p>
        
            <p>"The company has adapted and will manage its capital reserves to weather a Medicare non-coverage decision, the most adverse outcome of the</p>
        
            <p>range of alternatives now possible."</p>
        
            <p>Revenue growth was ahead of last year but has slowed in recent months as uncertainty over Medicare coverage affected demand for the tests.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the Medicare issue the company restructured operations cutting staff and controlling other costs, which chief executive Peter Meintjes said had yet to show through in its finances.</p>
        
            <p>"The reorganization and other cost control measures have appropriately lowered our expense base, while continuing to focus on driving test throughput and revenue."</p>
        
            <p>Meintjes said there was no indication when a Medicare decision would be made, although it could be no later than late-July next year.</p>
        
            <p>He said the company had cash reserves of $62m that would see it through if the decision was negative.</p>
        
            <p>"Under such a scenario Pacific Edge, supported by its strong balance sheet, would continue to work towards regaining coverage within four years, with attempts made for re-coverage with every piece of new clinical evidence. "</p>
