            <p>The number of consumers in arrears edged higher in December as people borrowed more for holiday spending, but the pace of growth has slowed.</p>
        
            <p>Credit bureau Centrix's latest report shows 470,000 were behind in loan payments, up 1.3 percent on a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Keith McLaughlin said a seasonal increase in arrears was usual, although there were signs that households were getting on top of their debt.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the festive season, we've observed the seasonal uptick in consumer arrears as people lean on credit products to help celebrate the end of the year."</p>
        
            <p>Personal loan arrears and buy-now-pay-later increased in December on the month before but were either steady or lower than a year.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it sends all the signs that households have their budgets under control, and I think we're going to see a gradual improvement in household arrears over a period of time," McLaughlin said.</p>
        
            <p>Mortgage arrears rose more quickly in December on the month before, with 22,100 accounts past their due date, to be 7 percent higher than a year ago, and nearly half of the 14,300 hardship cases were mortgage repayments.</p>
        
            <p>"Highest rate of financial hardship is with those aged between 35 and 49 years old, an age bracket who are likely to have mortgage repayment obligations to meet."</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin said falling interest rates were likely to help households gain greater control over their debt levels as borrowers refix to lower mortgages rates.</p>
        
            <p>But the drop in rates was also proving to be a driver of demand for credit with a 13 percent rise in new residential lending, although it remained still well below the property boom in 2021, while new demand for car loans, personal loans, and buy-now-pay later were all lower than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>McLaughlin said the business sector was doing it much tougher because of weak consumer demand, poor cash flow, and the Inland Revenue being tougher on late taxes.</p>
        
            <p>Liquidations were up 36 percent year-on-year, with the construction, property, and transport industries particularly hard hit.</p>
        
            <p>"I do fear for some businesses out there ... it has been a struggle for some time, their cash flows haven't risen to cover rising costs, so I think we're in for three or six months of difficult times and I think we will see a lift in liquidations and receiverships."</p>
        
            <p>He said further interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank, and the freeing up of lending rules, should flow through to consumer spending would be a boost for business.</p>
