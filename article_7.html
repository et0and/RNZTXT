            <p>Share markets appeared a bit calmer on Tuesday, with S&P Futures up and the Nikkei recovering 9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>But local commentators are warning there are likely to be bumps ahead for markets and investors.</p>
        
            <p>Markets around the world suffered on Monday due to concerns about the US economy, technology stocks, weaker-than-expected earnings from some countries and the prospect of rising Japanese interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"A fear factor crept in rather than anything substantially changing overnight," said Devon Funds Management head of retail Greg Smith.</p>
        
            <p>"It was sort of related to the Yen carry trade - the carry trade has been to borrow yen at low rates and invest in tech stocks, which ave been a bit of a one-way bet but tech stocks have been in the back foot - that hasn't just happened in the last couple of days... then the Bank of Japan raised rates but not hugely.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably what we've seen in the last couple of days is a kneejerk reaction. We were due a correction and that's not to say we won't see periods of weakness play out over the next few weeks."</p>
        
            <p>He said there would probably be some "dip buying" that would affect share prices.</p>
        
            <p>"Often after you have a big spill, like things don't keep going up and up, they also don't keep going down and down."</p>
        
            <p>He said investors should expect some bumpiness for a while.</p>
        
            <p>By mid-afternoon today, Japanese stocks had rebounded after suffering their biggest single day fall since the 1987 Black Monday, up nearly 10 percent having fallen by 12 percent the day before.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's ASX and New Zealand's NZX were both down marginally as well. The falls followed significant sell-offs on Wall Street; both the Nasdaq and S and P 500 closed more than three percent down.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiSaver provider Kernel founder Dean Anderson agreed investors should be comfortable expecting there would be larger swings - up and down - in global markets.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot of movement of capital at the moment, particularly on the back of the focus on the Japan-US carry trade.</p>
        
            <p>"More broadly, there is a lot of competing market noise. The markets are jumping on these single data points trying to interpret what is next. Last night the US had a positive services sector result, which paints a more optimistic view on the state of the US.</p>
        
            <p>"Tomorrow, NZ will see the latest labour market statistics, ahead of the immigration data next week before the Reserve Bank OCR announcement."</p>
        
            <p>He said with the "heightened state" of the markets, all of those decisions and data points would be extrapolated and could cause large swings.</p>
        
            <p>"For the typical investor though, it is a reminder that these swings go both ways and trying to time them is impossible. Someone who sold in reaction yesterday may equal miss out on a rebound tomorrow."</p>
