            <p>ASB has cut a number of its fixed home loan rates.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was the fifth fixed mortgage rate drop this year.</p>
        
            <p>The six-month rate drops by 10 basis points to 5.79 percent, and the four and five-year rates by 20 and 10 basis points, respectively, to 5.59 percent and 5.69 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ASB executive general manger personal banking Adam Boyd said a growing number of customers were splitting their mortgages across different terms.</p>
        
            <p>The drops take effect immediately.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Squirrel chief executive David Cunningham said borrowers were frequently choosing a one and two-year split or a two and three-year.</p>
        
            <p>"The 4.99 percent [two-year] rate has been an absolute game-changer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone has gone from short terms to the traditional two-year which New Zealanders have loved for decades.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing almost no money going floating and a very low level into six-month fixes because those rates are materially higher."</p>
