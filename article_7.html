            <p>An Auckland company has developed a form of debit card that can be loaded with money and given to workers for them to choose the benefits they need most, without having to claim reimbursements.</p>
        
            <p>The cards can be tailored to block what the boss might consider off-limits spending - for example, alcohol or gambling.</p>
        
            <p>Extraordinary co-founder Steve Zinsli told Checkpoint's Lisa Owen that initially, staff could use the card only to get healthcare benefits - but in a cost of living crisis, workers are increasingly keen on other "every-day" perks too.</p>
        
            <p>When the card first launched, many companies were focused on providing health and well-being benefits without employees having to wait weeks out of pocket before being reimbursed.</p>
        
            <p>More recently, popular benefits have included public transport allowances to encourage staff to come into the office, parking allowances, and gym and fitness memberships.</p>
        
            <p>The benefits enabled employers to make remuneration packages more attractive, and to "tell a story about what that economic value is actually for", he said.</p>
        
            <p>There were bonuses for the company, too.</p>
        
            <p>"There's less absenteeism, less presenteeism. If you think about the public transport allowance, you're removing that cost barrier of getting your employees back into the office after that work-from-home period that everyone had."</p>
        
            <p>Employers could also track public transport use to report its progress on sustainability, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you give someone a voucher... what happens if you lose a voucher? Where has the money gone?</p>
        
            <p>"The company has spent this money on something that then the employee is not going to utilise. It's economically inefficient."</p>
        
            <p>Companies in a range of sectors - including scaffolding, trucking and banking - were using the card to boost recruitment and retention.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more around the individual businesses that are seeing ways to package remuneration in different ways."</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint host Lisa Owen asked Zinsli why couldn't companies just pay staff a cash bonus?</p>
        
            <p>If the aim was to boost staff health and well-being, or the use of sustainable transport, then the card had more "meaning and impact", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some companies allowed employees to use the cards for one-off payments in supermarkets too, and it was one way for them to differentiate themselves and demonstrate core values in a competitive recruitment market, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've already got great remuneration packages; they're just looking at ways to go above and beyond, to be that next level of great."</p>
