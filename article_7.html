        <h2>No trains but Sail GP, Luke Combs fans urged to take public transport</h2>
        <p>
Auckland's rail network is shut for a month and some ferry services canned, but people can still "travel smoothly", Auckland Transport says.

            <p>Auckland Transport has assured fans they can take public transport to major events across the city this weekend, despite trains and some ferry services not running.</p>
        
            <p>The city's rail network is closed for one month until 28 January, with buses replacing trains.</p>
        
            <p>AT's group manager of public transport operations Rachel Cara said there would be extra buses before and after American country singer Luke Combs' concerts at Eden Park on Friday and Saturday, but fans should allow more travel time.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be more than 100 special event buses transporting fans to Eden Park from the city centre and North Shore and back again at the end of the concert.</p>
        
            <p>"Because it takes longer to clear a large crowd with buses than trains there will be longer than usual wait times at the end of the concert, so we're asking people to be patient and consider all their options.</p>
        
            <p>"To help provide more alternatives, we have also set up an additional park and ride and shuttle bus service operating from Alexandra Park which will be a good option for people not taking the event buses to the city or North Shore."</p>
        
            <p>Rail replacement buses and regular weekend buses would be available for people attending SailGP and Auckland FC's match against Melbourne City, Cara said.</p>

            <p>"With three big events taking place across Auckland this weekend it's going to be busy out there so we're asking people to plan their travel ahead of time so they can travel smoothly to these amazing events."</p>
        
            <p>An exclusion zone in place on the Waitematā Harbour around the SailGP race area would also affect some ferry services between 1pm and 6pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Alternative bus services would be available at affected ferry terminals to Bayswater, Birkenhead, Hobsonville Point, and West Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>There would also be ambassadors stationed at those ferry terminals to help passengers.</p>
        
            <p>From 1pm for Luke Combs ticket holders and from 11:30am for SailGP ticket holders, bus travel would be free.</p>
        
            <p>People can go to www.at.govt.nz/events for more information about transport options for all three events.</p>
