            <p>Food price inflation has slowed to its lowest level in more than two years.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said fruit and vegetables drove a 0.6 percent drop in the food price index last month, with small drops in meat and groceries.</p>
        
            <p>The annual rate of food inflation slowed to 2.1 percent, the smallest rise since May 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Cheaper fresh produce was the main influence on the annual figures, offset by more expensive takeaway and restaurant meals, as well as groceries.</p>
        
            <p>Petrol, domestic airfares, rents, commercial accommodation, and tobacco and alcohol showed solid rises last month and annually.</p>
        
            <p>The data covers just under half of the consumer price index.</p>
