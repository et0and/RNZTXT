            <p>Analysis - You have to hand it to the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>For such a tiny nation, stuck at the bottom of the South Pacific, it's a country that punches well above its weight.</p>
        
            <p>Take last Saturday night, for example, when the All Blacks yet again walloped the Wallabies in Wellington, keeping the elusive Bledisloe Cup locked away in the NZRU trophy cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>For Australia, it's been a 22-year drought.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just sport. A range of musicians, writers, filmmakers, artists and actors from the Land of the Long White Cloud strut the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>But there's another, perhaps more arcane, area where New Zealand has made the rest of the world sit up and take notice.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to central banks, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is something of a trailblazer. And a radical one at that.</p>
        
            <p>Back in the 1990s, it was the first central bank to target inflation as a way of controlling the economy and during this latest inflation outbreak, it was the first central bank to raise interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>It has since gone on to push its official cash rate to a 5.5 percent peak.</p>
        
            <p>Right now, all eyes are on our Kiwi cousins to see what happens next.</p>
        
            <p>Why? Just four months ago, RBNZ supremo Adrian Orr was threatening to raise interest rates again if inflation refused to decelerate into the bank's comfort zone quickly enough.</p>
        
            <p>That call was altered at the very next meeting and by August, the bank suddenly had to begin cutting as the economy plunged into recession.</p>
        
            <p>The sudden turnaround took most pundits by surprise, given the aggressive stance the Wellington-based monetary overlords had adopted throughout this inflation episode.</p>
        
            <p>Many global counterparts have begun asking: Could we be next?</p>
        
            <p>Given New Zealand has been in recession for most of the past two years, the surprise was that the RBNZ was so shocked by the latest sudden downturn.</p>
        
            <p>When it cut rates in August with a fairly dire warning about the economic outlook, the currency took a dive as traders took fright at what might be around the corner.</p>
        
            <p>They now expect a succession of rate cuts in the months ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Since the December quarter of 2022, New Zealand has had just one-quarter of growth, and that was back in the June quarter of last year.</p>
        
            <p>To many observers, the recession hasn't been one that, to misquote Keating, New Zealand had to have.</p>
        
            <p>While Michele Bullock and her predecessor Phil Lowe constantly maintained their aim was to keep as many employed as possible - and hence limit rate hikes - the Kiwis have gone on an all-out war against price inflation.</p>
        
            <p>The philosophy on the other side of The Ditch has been that inflation is the enemy and recessions simply are a by-product of the battle.</p>
        
            <p>Economist Brian Easton explains the downturn has been partly caused by weak export performance as China's economy stalled.</p>
        
            <p>But much of the pain is self-inflicted.</p>
        
            <p>"Another factor in the decline has been that the Reserve Bank has consciously engineered a contraction to restrain inflationary pressures, using higher interest rates which cut back investment, thereby weakening the economy and making it harder to raise prices and wages," he said.</p>
        
            <p>From a 0.25 per cent nadir during the pandemic, the RBNZ propelled the official cash rate to 5.5 per cent.</p>
        
            <p>It sparked a congratulatory wave of admiration from many senior Australian economists, who despaired that the Reserve Bank of Australia lacked such courage.</p>
        
            <p>Even now, they point to New Zealand's inflation decline, which was down to 3.3 per cent in the June quarter from a 7.2 per cent peak, as evidence that the Kiwis got it right.</p>
        
            <p>Here, our most recent quarterly inflation reading was stuck at 3.8 per cent, although our latest monthly number came in well below that at 2.7 per cent.</p>
        
            <p>Recessions are easier to engineer than to fix.</p>
        
            <p>Lose your job when you're in your mid-50s for any length of time and it's a tough haul back into the workforce.</p>
        
            <p>For school kids or anyone graduating from tertiary education, a couple of gap years between study and a chosen profession disqualifies many.</p>
        
            <p>After the bruising experience of the 1990s recession, when it took a full decade to return to the pre-downturn jobless level, the RBA has been conscious of the brute power it wields with interest rate hikes.</p>
        
            <p>The past two years have been intensely difficult for households and governments with seemingly no control over the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Inflation coupled with soft wage growth saw real incomes plummet here and in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>That was compounded by the fastest rate hikes in decades, which pushed heavily indebted households to the brink.</p>
        
            <p>It was bad enough in Australia, with rates rising to 4.35 per cent, but the Kiwis were forced to endure official rates of 5.5 per cent.</p>
        
            <p>Even with the recent cut, and more to come, they will be paying more than in Australia for quite some time.</p>
        
            <p>But there is a bigger, more ominous change afoot.</p>
        
            <p>From cost of living, a more existential crisis is in the wings: earning a living.</p>
        
            <p>While the RBNZ may be gearing up to celebrate its impending victory over inflation, it could well prove hollow.</p>
        
            <p>Remarkably, the Kiwi unemployment rate remained incredibly low until the beginning of this year, before starting to spike.</p>
        
            <p>From 4 percent in the December quarter last year, it hit 4.6 percent in the June quarter and there are fears it will continue to rise strongly from here.</p>
        
            <p>Even so, there is a good chance the numbers are skewed.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike most countries, New Zealanders have access to a well-worn escape path whenever the RBNZ goes crazy. It's just a 2-hour flight across the Tasman to Australia.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time in more than a decade, the country's population is shrinking as departing Kiwis outnumber new arrivals.</p>
        
            <p>In the 12 months to March, 78,200 New Zealand citizens migrated to another country, leaving a net loss of 52,500.</p>
        
            <p>"As Stats NZ notes with a degree of understatement, this exceeds the previous record of 72,400 departures and net loss of 44,400 citizens in the year to February 2012," said Professor Paul Spoonley from Massey University.</p>
        
            <p>It is a trend that appears to be accelerating, reigniting fears from decades past of a brain drain, with highly qualified Kiwis waving goodbye in record numbers as the economy tanks, for a better life in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Even before this latest evacuation, New Zealanders made up the fourth-biggest migrant community in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Government records now indicate almost 670,000 Australian residents were New Zealand-born, representing around 15 percent of the New Zealand population.</p>
        
            <p>Let's hope a few of them can play rugby.</p>
