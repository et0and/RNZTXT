            <p>Arvida, who has 35 retirement communities across New Zealand, is proposing to cut more than 400 hours a week from care workers, nurses, and activity coordinators at its Wellington Village at the Park, in Berhampore.</p>
        
            <p>E Tū spokesperson Rochelle Hill said they were proposing to cut 54 hours from the roster of registered nurses and more than 350 care hours from the remaining staff.</p>
        
            <p>She said the cuts would result in job losses and a cut in quality of care.</p>
        
            <p>Hill said Arvida had advised them they had run a trial at five of their sites with the model they were proposing to implement at Village at the Park.</p>
        
            <p>"They're saying they can cut over 400 care hours in a week from a roster and have no reduction in safety well-being or quality of life for their residents, and we strongly disagree with that."</p>
        
            <p>She said Arvida needed to provide more information on why the cuts were necessary.</p>
        
            <p>She said if cuts were necessary they wanted to work with Avida to ensure they were done in a way that did not impact residents' care and was humane for staff.</p>
        
            <p>Village at the Park director Tristan Saunders said no decisions had yet been made on any proposed changes.</p>
        
            <p>"We are currently engaging with our team, the unions and our residents on some proposed changes to the way we structure our team.</p>
        
            <p>"In those discussions, we have provided assurances that our proposed changes would not affect the quality and safe delivery of our care services."</p>
        
            <p>Saunders said: "We agree with E Tū and the NZNO that there are funding challenges for the aged care sector which we are having to work through."</p>
        
            <p>"We will be continuing to discuss these issues with our Village at the Park care team and management as we work through our consultation and feedback process."</p>
        
            <p>Chief Executive of the Aged Care Association Tracey Martin said the proposed changes appeared to be about "right-sizing" the business following the demands of the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>But Hill didn't believe those demands had lessened.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday about 150 people picketed against the proposed changes outside Village at the Park.</p>
        
            <p>"With fewer staff, we won't be able to care for all of them because there won't be enough time," said E tū delegate and care worker Rita Narendra.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want any resident to stay in bed until the end of the shift. I don't want to see residents not getting up to enjoy their life as they always do. I don't want to see any resident ringing the bell with no one attending to them. It's very sad."</p>
        
            <p>Martin said she would be amazed if Arvida lowered their staffing to those levels.</p>
        
            <p>"That behaviour is unacceptable, I don't believe that is what Arvida is doing."</p>
        
            <p>She said the ACA would not stand for any member lowering its staffing to the point of abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Village at the Park resident Lew Skinner said the proposed cuts had not been communicated clearly to residents.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents and their relatives are dismayed they had not been clearly told by Arvida what is happening," Skinner said.</p>
        
            <p>"The two letters they've received had given no real information and had just confused people."</p>
