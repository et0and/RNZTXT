            <p>The Bank of New Zealand has defied a slowing economy and demand for credit to post a record annual profit.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the year ended September compared to the previous year:</p>
        
            <p>BNZ chief executive Dan Huggins said the result reflected contrasting performance between the first and second halves of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"The result reflects a strong first half, with a decline in net profit of 12.5 percent in the second half reflecting the broader economic slowdown in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Revenue growth was driven by a near 16 percent rise in net interest income - the difference between what the bank borrows at and what it charges - and its interest margins rose to 2.4 percent from 2.15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Huggins said there was a more cautious approach to borrowing by consumers and businesses with lending rising 2.5 percent increase, below last year's growth, while deposits rose 3.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The BNZ's operating expenses were up nearly 14 percent as it invested more in systems particularly to combat fraud and scams.</p>
        
            <p>But in a sign of the times it nearly doubled the amount set aside for bad and doubtful debts to $172m from $89m a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the slowing economy and intense competition across the banking sector, we've continued to see growth across the business as more New Zealanders choose to bank with BNZ."</p>
        
            <p>He said the BNZ had gained nearly 5000 home loan customers from other lenders during the year, but at the same time had given more than $50m interest rate relief to customers.</p>
        
            <p>"While most of our home lending customers have moved onto higher rates, we continue to proactively contact those who we have identified as potentially needing additional support."</p>
        
            <p>Huggins expected a flat economy for the coming year, but forecast a gradual recovery in confidence and activity.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealanders are resilient, and while the year ahead will remain challenging, we are optimistic about New Zealand's future potential and prosperity."</p>
