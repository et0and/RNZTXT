            <p>Retirement Village operator Ryman Healthcare is in a trading halt as it proposes to raise $1 billion of new capital to reduce debt and reset the balance sheet.</p>
        
            <p>Jarden Securities Limited, Craigs Investment Partners and Forsyth Barr will together place $313 million of shares with institutional investors at an offer price of $3.05 a share.</p>
        
            <p>The balance of about $688m will be offered by way of a fully underwritten entitlement offer of new shares to shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>Ryman chair Dean Hamilton said the equity raise would reset the balance sheet, to a debt gearing of 23.1 percent from 37.3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"We are on a journey and have already made significant transformation progress over the past 12 months, including our board, management and governance refresh, changes to our pricing model and moving to a functional structure. Resetting our balance sheet will support us to progress our business improvement programme further."</p>
        
            <p>Ryman chief executive Naomi James, who joined Ryman in November 2024, said the business improvement programme was focused on releasing cash from the business of more than $500m over the next three to five years, targeting $100m-to-$150m in annualised cash improvement through revenue and cost opportunities and taking a disciplined approach to growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We are transforming how we operate so that our residents continue to have the best experience in retirement living, with access to industry leading care," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The trading halt would be lifted at the completion of the institutional offer or by the opening of trade Wednesday, 26 February.</p>
