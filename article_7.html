            <p>Digital and telco services company Spark is selling its stake in the Connexa towers business and considering the sale of other non-core assets, as it looks to offset weak consumer spending and business investment.</p>
        
            <p>The company also cut its full year underlying profit outlook and dividend payout by 9 percent, with capital spending down by up to $65 million, alongside "materially higher cost reductions over a multi-year period."</p>
        
            <p>Spark chair Justine Smyth said the company was also looking to attract investment to support the expansion of its data centres.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise the need to secure alternative long-term funding options outside of free cash flow, to support our development pipeline, and we are currently exploring capital partnerships to achieve this."</p>
        
            <p>Updated guidance for the 12 months ending June 2025</p>
        
            <p>"The board and management acknowledge that our current financial performance falls short of what is acceptable, and we understand the disappointment our shareholders will be feeling," Smyth said.</p>
        
            <p>"The challenges we are facing are both cyclical and structural. Weak business investment and consumer spending continue to curtail growth and squeeze margins.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, we are undertaking a significant transformation of our enterprise and government division to address structural segment challenges."</p>
        
            <p>Mobile service revenue was expected to be largely flat year-on-year compared to the original forecast for 3 percent growth.</p>
        
            <p>Enterprise and government connections remained stable during the quarter, but average revenue fell with "increased price erosion at contract resigning" and "aggressive competitive" pricing.</p>
        
            <p>While a drop in IT services had stabilised, profit margins were down.</p>
        
            <p>It said net labour cost reductions of $50m a year were on track, and it was working to deliver a $30m net cuts to operations.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking forward, we are resolutely focussed on resetting performance in our core, expanding the SPK-26 Operate Programme to significantly reduce our cost base and offset market headwinds, and simplifying our portfolio," Smyth said, adding that Spark was also looking for a buyer for its stake in mobile towers business Connexa.</p>
        
            <p>"While a transaction is not yet certain, the strong levels of interest we have received is reflective of the high quality of the Connexa business."</p>
        
            <p>An update on the review of non-core assets would be announced no later than when Spark releases its first half results, in February, or sooner if there was a material change.</p>
        
            <p>Spark chief executive Jolie Hodson said the company had a lot of work to do, but demand for data had continued to grow and its brand health was strong.</p>
        
            <p>"We recognise that we have a lot of work ahead of us to win back the confidence of our shareholders, and we are committed to that work," Hodson said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Spark will provide more details on the benefits and associated transformation costs of the expanded SPK-26 Operate Programme at its interim results in February.</p>
