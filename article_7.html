            <p>A US company that puts AI-enabled cameras on the front of buses to try to stop cars from blocking bus stops has entered the New Zealand market.</p>
        
            <p>Hayden AI has teamed up with Japanese owned NEC New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Their aim extends to policing bus and cycle lanes, and double-parking, "to improve road safety in New Zealand and Australia", a company statement said.</p>
        
            <p>NEC already has public transport contracts providing passenger information for buses in Canterbury, and signed a similar one worth up to $16.5m for Wellington last year</p>
        
            <p>Hayden AI claimed its system had sped up buses on monitored routes in New York, where it was introduced in 2022, by five percent.</p>
        
            <p>The system sent footage of any traffic violation to authorised agencies for human review first, it said.</p>
        
            <p>It had put cameras in the windshields of hundreds of buses in the US, and was involved in a pilot in Estonia, industry websites said.</p>
