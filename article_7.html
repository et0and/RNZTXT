            <p>Three years ago, after building Waikato Regional Council a new home, Stark Property bought the council's old Grey Street building and riverside sheds. They are now home to Made, a new mixed retail and commercial development in Hamilton East.</p>
        
            <p>Developer Matt Stark knows the jokes people make about Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"They say, 'Oh, you're from Hamilton?' I love Hamilton and I actually laugh when people say that because I think our city is pretty cool. It just hasn't been discovered."</p>
        
            <p>There is plenty of Waikato to be discovered at Made. Bare is a bulk bin and refillery from Raglan; Pirongia Mountain Vegetables has local fruit and vegetables that are said to be cheaper than the supermarket; while Fruney sells Hamilton fine chocolates and contemporary pastries.</p>
        
            <p>2023 has not delivered the best economic environment for a new venture, and though Stark said it had been worrying, he thought Hamilton was ready for the urban market, where local makers sell to local consumers.</p>
        
            <p>"People still want to be entertained through food. Post-Covid, people are really wanting to shop local more and I think that's what this market offers."</p>

            <p>Hannah Engelsman, owner of gelato business Little 'Lato, moved down to Hamilton from Auckland and opened a flagship store in the Made market. She said they have shelved plans for another store fearing it was too risky. But the shop at Made has been a success.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought it might be busy, but it's just blown us away."</p>
        
            <p>She said she now had good problems to solve like finding more freezer space and staff, and making enough gelato.</p>

            <p>Producers not ready to open their own store can be part of The Larder a cooperative store where sellers share space. Lauren Wu sells her pottery through other stores, but says The Larder offers a unique opportunity to meet customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone has been really friendly; it's been really really busy though, which is obviously great."</p>
        
            <p>Around the corner from The Larder, George Downey from Oat Brothers said he's had a lot of sleepless nights wondering if opening a store was the right thing to do.</p>

            <p>"Opening weekend was massive and great and exciting. And then the Monday after that was actually really quiet and we were thinking, 'Oh no, was this the right thing [to do]?'"</p>
        
            <p>However, Downey said things picked up throughout the week and another big weekend followed. He thought Made was onto something positive.</p>

            <p>Shoppers RNZ spoke to were keen to see what was on offer. One had brought her grandmother along to explore the market and said it was better than she expected. Another said they lived in the Bay of Plenty but read about the development in the newspaper, and came to see it.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone involved hoped more people would make their way to Made to check out the new riverside offering.</p>
