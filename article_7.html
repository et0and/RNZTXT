            <p>The news of the Canadian drone incident at the Olympics is being reported widely by international news agencies.</p>
        
            <p>The Football Ferns have complained after a drone operated by a Canadian support staff member was caught flying over their training practice.</p>
        
            <p>A person was detained by police and Team Canada has issued an apology, saying it is investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The New York Times, through its sporting sub-site The Athletic, said the drone incident had provided some "unexpected drama".</p>
        
            <p>Reporter Meg Linehan said it was not clear yet what would be the consequences of allegedly trying to record another team's training session.</p>
        
            <p>Linehan pointed out security forces had been on heightened alert for drones, though many were put up by tourists.</p>
        
            <p>"Drones have been a story across Paris 2024, with French prime minister Gabriel Attal saying Tuesday that an average of six drones per day have been intercepted at Olympic sites."</p>
        
            <p>USA Today said the Paris Games had not started yet and were facing controversy.</p>
        
            <p>"The 2024 Olympic Games in Paris haven't even had an opening ceremony yet, and we're already dealing with a potential cheating scandal."</p>
        
            <p>The Daily Mail called it an "Olympic spy storm" and reported the incident as "Canadian Soccer is facing cheating allegations entering the Paris Olympics".</p>
        
            <p>An Associated Press story was picked up by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the state broadcaster.</p>
        
            <p>ESPN's report focused on the statements by the New Zealand Olympic Committee and the Canadian Olympic Committee, including it was "reviewing next steps" with the International Olympic Committee, the Paris organising committee and FIFA.</p>
        
            <p>Many Canadian news outlets carried the story prominently, filed by the Canadian press agency. It highlighted the Canadian Olympic Committee's statement that the person flying the drone was a "non-accredited" member of Canada Soccer's support team.</p>
        
            <p>The agency, like many other media reports including RNZ, also noted the gap between the two teams in world rankings.</p>
        
            <p>"Canada, the defending Olympic women's soccer champion, is scheduled to open its tournament against 28th ranked New Zealand on Friday in Saint-Etienne."</p>
        
            <p>Some news outlets around the world - like the Guardian - carried a Reuters story on the drone. The Guardian headlined it "Olympic spying claim".</p>
        
            <p>The news was also picked by the English edition of the South Korean national daily newspaper JoongAng Ilbo, JoongAng Daily, which also used a Reuters articlereporting the drone had "disrupted" the Ferns' training session.</p>
