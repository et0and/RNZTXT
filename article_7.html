            <p>A $250 million expansion of the Christchurch Engine Centre, which maintains aircraft, has been announced.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch Engine Centre is operated by Air New Zealand and American company Pratt & Whitney.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, chair of Air New Zealand Dame Therese Walsh and Pratt & Whitney president Shane Eddy all took part in a groundbreaking for the project in Christchurch on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Therese said the expansion would allow the introduction of new GTF engine repair and maintenance, and allow work currently done overseas to now be done in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said the expansion would allow the airline to service its V2500 engines powering A321ceo aircraft and PW1100G-JM GTF engines on A320/A321neo aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>"The introduction of new GTF repair capability will be completed in 2026, and the Christchurch Engine Centre will maintain, repair or overhaul both the V2500 and PW1100G-JM engines for many years to come," said Dame Therese.</p>
        
            <p>Eddy said the Christchurch Engine Centre had a proven track record of delivering exceptional performance and quality with a highly capable workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"With the Asia-Pacific region projected to experience the highest aviation growth globally over the next 20 years, it is a strategic imperative for us to invest here and partner with Air New Zealand as we continue to expand the GTF MRO network in support of the growing fleet."</p>
        
            <p>He said the expanded site would need 200 additional highly skilled staff members.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the project marked a significant investment in New Zealand's economy by Air New Zealand and Pratt & Whitney, and would help expand the country's aviation industrial capability.</p>
