            <p>Wellington City Council has banned e-scooter company Beam from operating in the capital after breaking its fleet cap.</p>
        
            <p>Two weeks ago, following whistleblower allegations the council suspended Beam's license leading to its scooters being removed.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said a report from platform Ride Report showed Beam had operated on average an extra 100 e-scooters more than it was meant to between 26 July 2023 and 21 June 2024, which was a breach of its licence.</p>
        
            <p>Chief planning officer Liam Hodgetts said after considering information provided by Beam, Ride Report and the whistleblower the council concluded the license had been materially breached.</p>
        
            <p>"It is now clear to us that there have been breaches of Beam's licence to Trade in Public and the Operator Code of Practice.</p>
        
            <p>"Of particular concern is the admitted breach of the e-scooter cap, and failure to communicate openly with the Council regarding these breaches.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also found Beam's responses to be inadequate and as a result there has been a loss of trust and confidence."</p>
        
            <p>Hodgetts said cancelling the license was not a decision the council took lightly but noted that elected members set a cap to ensure a balance between having enough devices to meet demand while reducing the risk to pedestrians of footpath clutter.</p>
        
            <p>"This has clearly been breached and as such we deem termination of the licence to be the most appropriate course of action."</p>
        
            <p>The company's license was also cancelled in Auckland for the same reason.</p>
