            <p>Australian visitor numbers are bouncing back strongly despite representing the country's largest gap in visitor volume.</p>
        
            <p>Pre-Covid-19, Australians made up about 40 percent of all overseas visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors numbers from Australia have recovered to 83 percent of pre-Covid levels, but there were 265,000 fewer visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport, RotoruaNZ and TƒÅtaki Auckland Unlimited have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to help to keep Aotearoa on the radar of Australian tourists and attract them to visit both destinations in a single trip.</p>
        
            <p>The latest visitor figures were discussed during the annual Auckland Airport Tourism Forum in Wellington on Wednesday, ahead of the the industry's TRENZ conference.</p>
        
            <p>They revealed that 1.27 million Australian visitors visited Aotearoa in the 12 months to February 2024, compared with 1.54 million in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Indonesia has now topped the travel destination list in Australia, representing 14 percent of all Australian outbound trips.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, that was New Zealand at 13 percent of all outbound overseas trips, but it has since dropped to 12 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport's chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said the industry needed solutions to help speed up the recovery of the Australian tourist market.</p>

            <p>"While numbers are tracking well and in-line, or even surpassing, other in-bound tourism markets, Australian tourists have an outsized impact on New Zealand's traveller recovery because they make up such a large portion of the market," Hurihanganui said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our forum today is all about shining a light on the important Australian market and coming together as a tourism industry to find solutions.</p>
        
            <p>"When we think of tourism it's often easy to think of the long-haul trips. However, our neighbours across the ditch are our number one volume visitor market.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to ensure we remain attractive and relevant to Australian travellers as a destination in a competitive global tourism market that is also vying for high value Aussie visitors."</p>
        
            <p>The demand for visiting friends and family has recovered the quickest, reaching 86 percent of 2019 levels while holiday-goers has been lagging a behind at 70 percent recovery.</p>
        
            <p>The strongest recovery - and outlier - was in Queenstown, which hit 117 percent recovery compared to 2019 figures, with 235,000 Australian visitors arriving in the year to February.</p>
        
            <p>The figures also revealed that international tourist numbers have surged back, with 3.1 million overseas visitors arriving in the year to February.</p>
        
            <p>That was compared to 3.9 million during the same period in 2019, with United States, United Kingdom and India all above pre-Covid levels.</p>
