            <p>A Christchurch company's developmental aircraft has gone supersonic.</p>
        
            <p>Dawn Aerospace's aircraft, Aurora, broke the sound barrier on a remotely piloted flight last week from the Glentanner Aerodrome near the base of Aoraki Mount Cook.</p>
        
            <p>The flight broke the record for the fastest and highest flight from New Zealand, when it reached a speed of Mach 1.1 at an altitude of 25km (82,500 feet).</p>
        
            <p>The flight also set a global record, becoming the fastest aircraft to climb from ground level to 20km (66,000 feet), completing the ascent in 118.6 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>In August the company said it had had initial talks with the United States military and NASA about using its rocket-powered space plane.</p>
        
            <p>Dawn Aerospace chief executive Stefan Powell told Morning Report it had taken the company five years of work to get to this point.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly not easy. The real difference is this is not a rocket, it's an aircraft in every sense, so you have to go through a very strict regulatory process.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very challenging, but once you get there it means you can fly multiple times a day."</p>
        
            <p>Powell said that there had been three separate test campaigns in the last three months where the aircraft has increased from relatively moderate speeds and altitudes.</p>
        
            <p>"We've built up progressively. Every flight we go up we fly higher, we fly faster."</p>
        
            <p>As for the record-breaking flight, Powell said the Aurora went up twice as high as a commercial aircraft, right to the edge of the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"If you go much further there isn't any air. You can't practically fly a plane anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sort of a hybrid between a rocket and an aircraft. Because it has a rocket engine, we can actually fly up above the atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"We can fly higher than a balloon, but lower than a satellite. Which means there's all kinds of regions of the atmosphere that we can access."</p>
        
            <p>By getting into this zone, Powell said it is very interesting for atmospheric science and micro-gravity science.</p>
        
            <p>Powell highlighted the company's ultimate goal is to go to space twice in a day.</p>
