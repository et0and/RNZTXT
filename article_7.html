            <p>Start-up company HealthNow has changed its brand to Extraordinary, and repositioned the business to meet growing demand for an expanded range of low cost ways for employers to reward employees.</p>
        
            <p>Extraordinary connects employees to personal well-being accounts funded by their organisations, with a Mastercard that can be used to purchase a range of goods and services, beyond the initial offering of health services, such as dental work.</p>
        
            <p>Founder and chief executive Steven Zinsli said Extraordinary eliminated the administratively heavy and complex process of providing employees with gift cards, managing reimbursements, and setting up and tracking worker allowances.</p>
        
            <p>Extraordinary officially launched in January 2024 as HealthNow, with 10,000 Mastercards issued across multiple high profile organisations, including ASB, Port of Tauranga, Booths Logistics and ACROW Group.</p>
        
            <p>Zinsli said the business had since added more than 100 big and smaller-sized businesses to its customer base, and was expanding into Australia, following a successful capital raise of $3.4 million in June.</p>
        
            <p>"Along the way we also discovered that our payment technology could solve a broader list of problems and simplify quite complex processes for our customers."</p>
        
            <p>Employers were able to select where and how much employees could spend on an annual basis, with typical contributions of between $250 and $1000 a year.</p>
        
            <p>Zinsli said the company's revenue had grown by four times over the past four months, generating enough cash flow to fund its expansion.</p>
