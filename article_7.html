            <p>Inflation pressures are showing more signs of easing, but consumers still look reluctant to spend to any extent.</p>
        
            <p>A slew of Stats NZ data showed food prices rose 0.2 percent in August on July, but the annual rate eased to 0.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Higher prices for eating out, takeaways, and groceries were the main drivers behind the annual gain of 3.6 percent, while fruit and vegetable prices fell 12.2 percent .</p>
        
            <p>Among groceries olive oil, butter and chocolate were notable price rises.</p>
        
            <p>"The average price of a 250g block of chocolate has increased 20 percent since this time last year," consumer prices manager James Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>World olive oil supplies and prices have been affected by bad weather in Europe, while chocolate prices have surged on the back of disease, drought, and reduced supplies.</p>
        
            <p>However, transport costs fell in August with petrol pump prices falling further and airfares also cheaper, while rents continued to edge higher.</p>
        
            <p>The items cover just under half of the consumer price index and suggest inflation is slowing further.</p>
        
            <p>ASB senior economist Mark Smith said the partial numbers pointed to inflation of 0.3 percent for the month.</p>
        
            <p>"The moderating annual inflation impulse increases our confidence that annual CPI inflation will fall below 2.5 percent in the third quarter."</p>
        
            <p>He expected the Reserve Bank to continue cutting the official cash rate, by 25 basis points in its next two meetings, to 4.75 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Actual OCR moves will be heavily conditional on the inflation, labour market and wider economic outlook," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>But other Stats NZ data showed tepid consumer activity, despite the first rise in retail sales using electronic cards in seven months.</p>
        
            <p>Sales rose 0.2 percent for the month, but were still 2.9 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Spending on durable goods, such as furniture and electronics, fuel, and clothing increased, but hospitality and vehicle related sales were lower.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac senior economist Satish Ranchhod said the rise was modest given tax cuts had come into effect.</p>
        
            <p>"We expected that tax cuts would support a larger rise in spending. However, New Zealand households are yet to throw their wallets open."</p>
        
            <p>He said high living costs and interest rates continued to be headwinds and it would take some time before recent falls in interest rates filtered through to households.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, the softening labour market means many households are still cautious about their spending."</p>
