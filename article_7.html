            <p>The number of company liquidations has soared, as businesses struggle to stay afloat in a slowing economy.</p>
        
            <p>The latest monthly report from credit bureau Centrix shows liquidations are up 19 percent year-on-year, and business credit defaults up 5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Construction, hospitality and transport businesses appear to be the hardest hit, as consumers and businesses pull back on spending.</p>
        
            <p>That is despite an improvement in business and consumer sentiment in recent months.</p>
        
            <p>Centrix managing director Keith McLaughlin said the trend of difficulty for businesses often followed that of consumers.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost of running a business has gone up and to counter that, consumers haven't been spending as freely as they may do in a good economic environment and therefore, their revenue has fallen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The construction, hospitality and transport sectors were doing it particularly tough, with businesses in those sectors twice as likely to be placed in liquidation, according to Centrix.</p>
        
            <p>In a sign that households were continuing to do it tough, Centrix said the number of consumers behind on their repayments rose by 5000 month-on-month to 461,000.</p>
        
            <p>That equated to more than 12 percent of active borrowers, and was 6 percent higher than the same period a year ago, and tracking at just above 2018 levels.</p>
        
            <p>Centrix said arrears were expected to rise during late spring and early summer, which was typical for the period due to Christmas shopping.</p>
        
            <p>Financial hardship cases also continued to rise, up 24 percent from a year ago, and have been rising since November 2022.</p>
        
            <p>In more positive news for households, home loan arrears moderated slightly month-on-month, although they were 12 percent higher than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>However, the overall number of home loan arrears remained low, with 20,700 home loans reported as past due, which made up 1.39 percent of borrowers.</p>
