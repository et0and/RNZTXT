            <p>I turn 65 in March 2025, at which time I will also be eligible for superannuation. I am currently working full-time and will continue working whilst still contributing 3 percent to KiwiSaver. I assume at that point, the company I work for will no longer contribute its portion to my KiwiSaver. I do not intend to withdraw anything from KiwiSaver, but how will my superannuation be impacted with this arrangement? </p>
        
            <p>This is an easy answer - it won't be.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Super isn't means-tested or income-tested (although some international pensions can offset what you get) so withdrawing KiwiSaver won't impact what you receive at all.</p>
        
            <p>You're right that your employer may not continue making contributions after 65.</p>
        
            <p>My mum has run out of money in her retirement. She has her house contents insured for around $300,000, which, amazingly, probably is accurate mostly because she has some antique family heirlooms. She can't afford the nearly $3000 per year in premiums. Should she sell her contents or insure them for less than their replacement value.</p>
        
            <p>Rebecca Styles, who is Consumer NZ's insurance expert, suggested she could get a valuation to make sure items are insured for the right value.</p>
        
            <p>"To try and reduce the premium she could increase the excess on the policy [or] alter the sum insured to a lesser amount. While this wouldn't cover the total financial loss of all the items, it would cover some of it.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's still too expensive, it could be a case of choosing which items she wants to specify on the policy, and those she doesn't.</p>
        
            <p>"If it still proves too expensive, she could try and shop around insurers for a better deal. Giving the insurer a call and explaining the situation may help. They could advise on some options."</p>
        
            <p>Styles said any specific antique items should be listed separately with set cover limits.</p>
