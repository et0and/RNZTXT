            <p>Consumers and corporations are looking for ways to take meaningful action on climate change and sustainability, two studies suggest.</p>
        
            <p>A report by the Sustainable Business Network found sustainability was a key focus for almost all organisations it interviewed, although second to profitability.</p>
        
            <p>The network conducted 30 interviews with senior executives at organisations that had an annual turnover above $50 million.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Westpac survey of more than 1000 customers, found nearly two-thirds would consider using an interest-free loan to make their home and transportation more energy-efficient.</p>
        
            <p>Sustainable Business Network head of advisory and impact Tori Calver said firms wanted to take climate action.</p>
        
            <p>She said market pressure and regulation were the main drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"Organisations exporting to Europe are seeing strong pressure to prioritise action in emissions reduction.</p>
        
            <p>"Plus, new regulations like the climate-related disclosures, which makes it mandatory for big companies to report on climate risk, are having an impact," Calver said.</p>
        
            <p>Customer expectation was another factor driving businesses to action on climate change and sustainability.</p>
        
            <p>"Some businesses see sustainability as a competitive advantage, while others have noticed an increase in job seekers wanting to work for purpose-driven companies," Calver said.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac survey found only a quarter of customers were prepared to pay more for higher-emissions goods - if it helped fund initiatives to reduce the country's climate impact.</p>
        
            <p>"Banks are stepping up with products and solutions to help people make meaningful changes in an affordable way," Westpac NZ chief executive Catherine McGrath said.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac survey found 31 percent of customers felt New Zealand was doing enough to counter the effects of climate change, while nearly two-thirds were concerned about the impacts of climate change.</p>
