            <p>The chief executive of vegetable supplier Leaderbrand wants a long-term fix to State Highway 2 between Wairoa and Napier.</p>
        
            <p>Part of it is closed again today due to a slip between Putorino and Kotemaori, north of Waikare Road intersection.</p>
        
            <p>The road will be closed overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Richard Burke said with no diversions available, the company has no choice but to re-route its trucks from Gisborne to Rotorua before heading south to the Cook Strait ferries.</p>
        
            <p>He said a longer-term more resilient solution is needed that is not just fixing the existing road which keeps being closed.</p>
        
            <p>Burke said although its trucks have to go the long way, the ferry timetable to cross the Cook Strait does not change.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be a fair bit of disruption tomorrow while the guys try and play catch up and swing things around.</p>
        
            <p>"But to be fair, we've been doing this for the last 12 months so it seems like it's a normal daily event - which is kind of bad for us, because we're good at it, as we have to do it often.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no question the guys are kind of, I mean to be fair, pretty over it."</p>
        
            <p>Burke said Leaderbrand is absorbing the extra costs and not putting its prices up.</p>
