            <p>Many people are being stung with surprise tax bills of thousands of dollars - with employees on parental leave among the hardest hit.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2019, Inland Revenue has sent out automated income tax assessments to New Zealanders on a wage or salary.</p>
        
            <p>Generally, the calculations are accurate. However, if someone's circumstances change during a financial year, there might be a refund or an amount owing.</p>
        
            <p>The rising cost of living means many Kiwis are doing it tough, and many are stressed about tax bills.</p>
        
            <p>We want to hear from RNZ readers who have been stung with a surprise tax bill this year.</p>
        
            <p>Perhaps you're having to make cuts in other areas to accommodate the bill you weren't expecting.</p>
        
            <p>You might be a teacher, a nurse, or a mum on maternity leave who has found out you suddenly have a large amount owing due to a change in circumstances or backpay. Perhaps you have a cautionary tale to share with others?</p>
