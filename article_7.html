            <p>A Crown-owned investment vehicle is putting $78 million towards new solar, hoping to boost renewable electricity generation.</p>
        
            <p>The deal between government-owned New Zealand Green Investment Finance (NZGIF), and solar developer Far North Solar Farm, would connect five solar sites to the national grid.</p>
        
            <p>The five planned sites the NZGIF financing was available for would generate around 1.13 GW of new clean electricity, enough to power about 178,000 homes a year.</p>
        
            <p>NZGIF's chief executive Sarah Minhinnick said the deal reflected its mandate to accelerate investment that decarbonised the country's economy.</p>
        
            <p>"The Connection Facility Agreement is a tailored solution, designed by NZGIF, to introduce a new pool of capital to accelerate renewable energy generation in New Zealand. We look forward to seeing more private capital driven towards these solar developments," Minhinnick said.</p>
        
            <p>FNSF has also agreed to sign a $22m works agreement contract with Transpower.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower said the grid connection agreement was the first of many around the country.</p>
        
            <p>"The ability for a developer to access capital is another critical element of getting renewable energy developments off the ground," said Transpower's executive general manager of customer and external affairs Raewyn Moss.</p>
        
            <p>The deal was signed at Parliament on Tuesday evening.</p>
