            <p>ANZ Bank has confirmed it has fixed an outage to its online banking services that has caused disruption for thousands of customers for four hours, a day out from Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>An ANZ spokesperson said a system outage between 10.30am and 2.30pm on Tuesday caused "intermittent issues" for people logging into its goMoney app and internet banking services.</p>
        
            <p>"All other services, including debit and credit cards, PayWave, EFTPOS, ATMs and payment processing continued to work normally and were not impacted.</p>
        
            <p>"The outage has now been resolved, however some customers may have still experienced slight issues as the backlog was cleared.</p>
        
            <p>"We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused."</p>
        
            <p>According to Downdetector, a site which monitors internet outages, nearly 5500 customers had reported an outage between 10am and 2.30pm.</p>
