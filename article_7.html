The maker of the Red Band gumboots said the 12 percent profit improvement reflected a return to normal in the agriculture division, despite a drop in footwear sales.

            <p>Rubber goods maker Skellerup has posted a record first half-year profit as its agricultural division rebounded, and the company says it's preparing for possible tariff hikes in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended December compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>The maker of the Red Band gumboots said the 12 percent profit improvement reflected a return to normal in the agriculture division, despite a drop in footwear sales.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pleased with the record first-half result underpinned by an expected but significant lift from our agri division, which reverted to a more normal seasonal pattern with stronger sales of dairy rubberware consumables in international markets," chief executive Graham Leaming said.</p>
        
            <p>Skellerup's previous year's result was affected by customer destocking.</p>
        
            <p>It said footwear sales were weaker, particularly due to weaker economic conditions in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Skellerup's operating cash flow fell 12 percent, as it increased its inventory levels to manage disruption to shipping routes, and in case of US port strikes and a possible increase in US tariffs.</p>
        
            <p>Its industrial division saw a slight fall in earnings, as the company faced a slowdown in the Australian construction market, the timing of sales into the mining sector and lower demand for high-performance marine foam products in the US.</p>
        
            <p>Skellerup expected its full-year profit to be between $52 million to $56m, with the top end of its guidance $1m lower than previous guidance.</p>
