            <p>The New Zealand dollar has regained a bit of ground against a strong US dollar after late afternoon trading, rising to almost 56.1 US cents.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi is up nearly half a percent on this morning's 55.5 US cents, but is expected to remain under pressure, alongside other major currencies.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ dollar is trading at levels last seen in October 2022, with the Australian dollar also trading at two-year lows against the US dollar.</p>
        
            <p>The US dollar continued to hover near record highs, amid fading expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve later this month.</p>
        
            <p>US inflation was expected to rise above the Fed's target range once President-elect Donald Trump moved back into the White House next week, with policies designed to drive economic growth, but also add to price pressures.</p>
