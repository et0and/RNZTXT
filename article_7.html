            <p>Meridian believes it's increasingly unlikely generators will have to dip into the water supply reserves in the hydro lakes.</p>
        
            <p>Power supplies and prices are under threat because of low lake levels.</p>
        
            <p>But Transpower is making it easier for generators to access reserves in some lakes from next month.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, it announced generators can take more water from lakes Pūkaki, Tekapo (Takapō) and Hāwea during September and October if needed, to help stave off an electricity shortage.</p>
        
            <p>Meridian spokesperson Chris Ewers said there has been some welcome rain over the past week and more is forecast.</p>
        
            <p>He said Meridian also has six wind farms that regularly provide 25 percent of power it needs and higher winds are also forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Ewers added the company is reasonably confident of getting through spring without needing use the reserves.</p>
