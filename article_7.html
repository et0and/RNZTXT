            <p>Consumer confidence has taken a knock and turned more pessimistic, despite falling interest rates and lower inflation, researchers say.</p>
        
            <p>The ANZ-Roy Morgan survey showed a four point fall in confidence in October, to 91.2, after three months of improvement, which had measured confidence at the highest level in more than two years.</p>
        
            <p>However, the latest survey showed consumers less confident about their current financial position and future outlook.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ economist Henry Russell said a worsening labour market has given consumers a reality check.</p>
        
            <p>"Employment prospects remain very weak and that's likely to weigh heavily on households as we see job security fears rise."</p>
        
            <p>"So the cautious recovery we've seen over the past few months has come unstuck."</p>
        
            <p>A net 22 percent of respondents said they were worse off financially than a year ago, an increase on the September survey, while a net 14 percent said they expected to be better off next year, compared to 25 percent last month.</p>
        
            <p>Consumers were also slightly more pessimistic about the near term economic outlook, and less optimistic about the longer term prospects, and the appetite for buying a big ticket item remained negative.</p>
        
            <p>Russell said falling interest rates and lower inflation would deliver benefits to consumers in due course as they trickle through to household budgets, but the likelihood of unemployment pushing through 5 percent would weigh on activity.</p>
        
            <p>"There are things for consumers to look forward to, but it's going to be a tough six to nine months before we get there."</p>
