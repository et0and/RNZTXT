            <p>The Body Shop New Zealand has been placed into liquidation, with all stores closed and around 70 jobs lost.</p>
        
            <p>A notice in the New Zealand Gazette confirmed liquidation of the company began on Thursday, with Neale Jackson and Daniel Stoneman of Calibre Partners appointed as liquidators.</p>
        
            <p>A message on the beauty retailer's website confirmed all retail locations were now permanently shut, and the online store was no longer processing orders.</p>
        
            <p>"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our valued customers for your unwavering support throughout the years," a statement said. "Your passion for our products and ethical values has meant everything to us."</p>
        
            <p>The closure of the New Zealand business was signalled in January, when The Body Shop NZ appointed voluntary administrators.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, administrators said a buyer had not been found for the New Zealand business, with work starting on clearing all stock and winding down operations.</p>
        
            <p>The beauty brand had 16 stores with about 70 permanent staff.</p>
        
            <p>Its UK business was saved from administration in September after investment firm Aurea Group bought its 113 UK stores, and gained control of its Australian and North American assets.</p>
        
            <p>The Body Shop was founded in the UK in 1976 by British businesswoman Dame Anita Roddick, focusing on ethical beauty products.</p>
