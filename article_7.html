        <h2>As it happened: Uncertain future for Newshub staff as Stuff takes over 6pm news</h2>
        <p>
Stuff will drop the Newshub name as it takes over Three's 6pm bulletin with fewer than 40 of 250 staff to be brought over.
</p>
        
            <p>Media company Stuff will take over and run a 6pm bulletin for TV station Three from the 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>The bulletin will not be called Newshub, and will run a one-hour bulletin from Monday to Friday, and a 30 minute bulletin on weekends.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff's Sinead Boucher has told staff the company will "definitely be bringing some Newshub staff" to produce the 6pm bulletins.</p>
        
            <p>Both companies held meetings with staff on Tuesday after Newshub owner Warner Brothers Discovery confirmed Newhub's operations were to be shut down.</p>
