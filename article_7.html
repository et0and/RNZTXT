        <h2>Highway median barriers hit farmers in the pocket</h2>
        <p>
Median barriers on SH2 near Katikati are "severely limiting" access and hurting horticultural and agricultural businesses, farmers say.

            <p>Median barriers on State Highway 2 near Katikati are "severely limiting" access and hurting horticultural and agricultural businesses, farmers say.</p>
        
            <p>The flexible wire rope barrier was installed on SH2, south of Katikati, in July as part of NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA) safety improvements.</p>
        
            <p>Sections of the new median barrier can be found between Katikati and Ōmokoroa.</p>
        
            <p>The barrier has drawn criticism and protests because it limits cars and trucks from turning into side streets.</p>
        
            <p>Rick Burke, who has farmed on Lund Rd for 40 years, said the barriers would have an economic impact.</p>
        
            <p>"With vehicles having to unnecessarily travel a considerable distance further to get back to their roads, the vehicle running cost and extra man hour cost will be significant and hasn't been considered by NZTA."</p>
        
            <p>It demonstrated the "arrogance and illogical thinking" of NZTA that was "hell-bent" on blocking right-hand turns off SH2 into side roads, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Burke said Katikati township would be impacted by locals making a choice to go to Ōmokoroa or Tauranga for supplies because of the added travel distance.</p>
        
            <p>"At a time when our country is trying to reduce emissions, NZTA has failed to consider the environmental impact of the emissions created by extra running time of vehicles, including school buses [and] trucks trying to get to a destination via a convoluted highway system."</p>
        
            <p>Rex D'Ath owns a small avocado orchard on Wright Rd and said he would likely face extra charges from the packhouses because trucks have to travel further.</p>
        
            <p>He also had concerns about truck movements at the roundabouts that have been installed at intersections between the barriers.</p>
        
            <p>"The roundabouts they put in, [they're] too small and the big trucks won't be able to get around them, plus all the extra distance that they're having to travel."</p>

            <p>D'Ath now travels an extra 5km to leave or enter his road and said there are around 1000 residents on Wright Rd.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost to New Zealanders that are using this road [SH2] is going to be phenomenal."</p>
        
            <p>Both Burke and D'Ath said there have been very few accidents on SH2 near their roads, so they don't think the barriers are needed, especially now the speed limit is 80km/h.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said there were 25 fatal and 66 serious injury crashes on the road between Waihī and Ōmokoroa, between 2009 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Since June residents have held multiple protests against the barriers. The first one was a slow-moving convoy of vehicles, some adorned with signs, other protests have seen people line the side of the highway.</p>
        
            <p>A NZTA spokesperson said median barriers will no longer be installed on SH2 between Matahui/Lockington roundabout and Wharawhara Rd, or between Morton Rd and Pahoia/Esdaile Rd.</p>
        
            <p>There will now be 2.6km of median barriers instead of the 14.2km NTZA was going to install.</p>

            <p>NZTA board chief executive Nicole Rosie said two more roundabouts and wide centre-lines will be built while maintaining all right-turning movements on remaining intersections along the highway.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision addresses the concerns we have heard about local travel impacts and turning access and recognises the unique circumstances of this section of SH2 - specifically that local roads connect to the state highway with no alternate routes and significant distances before turning opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware there are a range of views in the community about this issue and that not everyone will be satisfied with the board's decision."</p>
        
            <p>This approach appropriately balances travel impacts for local journeys and safety for all road users, she said.</p>
