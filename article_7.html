            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) wants to refloat plans for all Cook Strait ferries to work out of the same port.</p>
        
            <p>Between 2018 and 2020 when the former government's plans for new Cook Strait ferries were in play, GWRC was pushing for a multi-user port which Bluebridge and the Interislander would work out of.</p>
        
            <p>The Future Ports Forum was made up of GWRC, the Wellington City Council, Centreport, NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi, KiwiRail and Bluebridge. It was tasked with finding the best place to situate such a port.</p>
        
            <p>The forum decided Kaiwharawhara (where Interislander worked out of currently) would be the best spot to build a multi-user port.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail did not agree, preferring a new terminal at Kings Wharf, beside Bluebridge's existing spot and closer to downtown Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>In August, GWRC chair Daran Ponter wrote to Finance Minister Nicola Willis stating that there were significant benefits to transitioning to a multi-use port in the medium- to long-term.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said it would create a level playing field for all ferry operators, offer significant efficiencies for the capital's port and free up land at Kings Wharf for city use.</p>
        
            <p>He said it would require planning across multiple agencies, further consideration of alternative financing options, and a government commitment.</p>
        
            <p>It would also see land reclamation at Kaiwharawhara and a new transport interchange for State Highway 1.</p>

            <p>Ponter said GWRC would be interested in restarting the future Ports Forum to get the project over the line.</p>
        
            <p>Willis wrote back to Ponter last week and acknowledged the council's interest in a multi-user port. She said the government's immediate focus was ensuring port infrastructure decisions are well aligned with any decisions regarding new ships to provide Cook Strait ferry services.</p>
        
            <p>Willis said if a multi-port was to go ahead, discussions would be needed to ensure there was sufficient network capacity at both ports, given their importance the services play for the wider transport network.</p>
        
            <p>She said the government would be open to the establishment of a revitalised Future Ports Forum.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter told RNZ in the short-term, work would still have to be done to build a new single-use Interislander ferry terminal for its current and future ferries.</p>
        
            <p>He said planning and construction for a multi-use terminal was likely at least five years away.</p>
