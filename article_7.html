            <p>A Whanganui supermarket has apologised after telling a customer who spent more than $1000 on groceries she was required to give personal details in relation to the transaction.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after Taysha Williams alleges she was asked for private information by Pak'n Save staff without explanation - and told she could not leave the supermarket without doing so.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said she and her children went grocery shopping at Pak'n Save Whanganui on March 1, spending more than $1000.</p>
        
            <p>"I was asked to give my details but with no explaination for why, and if I didn't I was not allowed to leave," she wrote in a statement on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Williams claims she had paid eftpos and had a receipt.</p>
        
            <p>"I asked again why they needed my details and if they could show me the policy of the reason behind their request."</p>
        
            <p>Williams claims that, over the course of 30 minutes, she spoke to five different supermarket workers, including three supervisors, who looked through files for any mention of the policy.</p>
        
            <p>"Not one of them could find anything or tell me why I needed to give my details," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"While all of this is happening, my children standing there confused and annoyed, I am feeling like I'm being accused of stealing.</p>
        
            <p>"Embarrassment for being singled out of all the customers in the store."</p>
        
            <p>Williams alleges at this point she was approached by a sixth member of staff who told her she had to hand over her details "because of fraud or incase someone was to report your card stolen, because it's not very often we've come across this".</p>
        
            <p>She says would have no problem handing over these details - provided someone could point her to where it says that in the store's policy.</p>
        
            <p>Williams claims she was told again she couldn't leave the store, but that he "didn't know" what would happen if she did.</p>
        
            <p>At this point, she says she and her children "walked out" and later lodged a complaint.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement posted to social media on Tuesday, an unnamed spokesperson said Pak'n Save Whanganui acknowledged Williams' experience "and take this opportunity to provide some clarity".</p>
        
            <p>"Under tax legislation introduced in 2023, businesses are required to collect certain details for purchases over $1,000 to ensure compliance with tax rules. Unfortunately, in this instance, we didn't explain this properly, and we sincerely regret the frustration and confusion caused.</p>
        
            <p>"We've reached out to the person affected directly as we want to apologise and make things right.</p>
        
            <p>"We're reviewing what happened and taking steps to ensure our team is better prepared to communicate clearly and respectfully in the future. We appreciate the feedback and remain committed to providing a positive experience for all our customers.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the supermarket's statement, Williams claims she is yet to be contacted directly in response to her complaint.</p>
        
            <p>"I see the post on social media from Pak'n Save Whanganui, but I would like this matter to be resolved in a professional manner," she wrote. "I would have liked the incident on Saturday night to be dealt with in that way also."</p>
