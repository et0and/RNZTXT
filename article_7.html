            <p>Members of Climate Liberation Aotearoa gathered in Wellington CBD to rally against the cruise ship industry.</p>
        
            <p>The group of about 20 climate protesters converged near the entrance of Cable Car Lane where tens of passengers from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship were lined up.</p>
        
            <p>The group was walking in the middle of the road but was not blocking traffic.</p>
        
            <p>They were carrying banners that read: 'They cruise, we lose' and 'End luxury emissions'.</p>
        
            <p>In March, the group asked Christchurch City councillors to count cruise ship emissions in the city's climate targets so they are included in the emissions reduction plan.</p>
        
            <p>"The emissions are being released into the atmosphere - they have to be part of our reduction goals as well. The heavy fuel oil they burn puts small ultrafine particulates into our air that are carcinogenic. In terms of these polluting small particulates, one cruise ship is actually the equivalent of 1 million cars," Climate Liberation Aotearoa spokesperson Michael Apathy had said then.</p>
