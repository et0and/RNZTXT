            <p>The New Zealand dollar is trading at a nearly two-year low, meaning New Zealanders can expect more pain at the petrol pump.</p>
        
            <p>Falling to around 55.5 US cents to the NZ dollar, this rate has not been seen since October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The falling rate means imported goods - including fuel - will cost more, but it's good news for exporters, who will see higher returns.</p>
        
            <p>AA fuel price spokesperson Terry Collins told Morning Report if people thought prices for petrol now were bad, the prices at the pump now are from oil bought over a month ago so it will only get worse.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gone up $10 a litre...and those contracts were forward contracts so we're yet to see those prices come through, so we'll be seeing more prices going up."</p>
        
            <p>He could see prices go up at least another cents up at the pump.</p>
        
            <p>The cause is mainly geo-political, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Beef and Lamb Alliance Group global sales director James McWilliam said it was positive news for exporters after two very long and challenging years for the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"What this means for the industry is the red meat sector returns about nine to 10 billion (dollars) to the New Zealand economy on an annualised basis and about 90-95 percent of that is exported."</p>
        
            <p>The US was one of the largest the New Zealand market traded into, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality New Zealand spokesperson Sam MacKinnon said bars, cafes and restaurants rely on a strong domestic market.</p>
        
            <p>The latest data from payments company, Worldline, shows hospitality sector spending fell 2.7 percent in 2024.</p>
