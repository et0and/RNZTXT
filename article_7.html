            <p>The High Court has placed Auckland property investor and developer Du Val Group into interim receivership.</p>
        
            <p>The interim orders were made against Du Val Capital Partners, together with a number of entities within the Group - at the request of the government financial regulator, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA).</p>
        
            <p>Interim receivership orders were also made against directors Kenyon and Charlotte Clarke.</p>
        
            <p>The court also approved the FMA's request for asset preservation orders.</p>
        
            <p>The order comes as the FMA carries out an investigation into Du Val Group.</p>
        
            <p>The FMA said it would not provide further comment but noted there were about 120 investors in the Du Val entities, marketed as wholesale investments.</p>
        
            <p>It said John Fisk, Stephen White and Lara Bennett of PwC have been appointed interim receivers.</p>
        
            <p>PwC would provide an interim report to the court within 10 working days or a period the court allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the FMA issued a formal warning against Du Val Capital Partners - the investment arm of Du Val - for potentially misleading or deceiving investors.</p>
        
            <p>The FMA said information provided to investors in December 2022, about Du Val's plan to restructure the mortgage fund, was misleading.</p>
