            <p>Westpac is reducing the interest rate it charges on some of its fixed-term home loans.</p>
        
            <p>Its one-year special rate drops by 20 basis points to 5.59 percent, its 18-month rate by 30 basis points to 5.39 percent, and its two-year rate by 10 basis points to 5.39 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a move by ANZ on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The bank will also reduce some of its term deposit rates by 5, 10 and 20 basis points.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ chief economist Mike Jones said on Wednesday that 81 percent of mortgages now had less than 12 months until they refixed.</p>
        
            <p>"In data going back to 1999, that's only been matched once before, in 2011/12."</p>
        
            <p>He expected six-month and one-year rates would fall below 5 percent by about the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank is expected to cut the official cash rate by 50 basis points next month, although markets have priced in much of the reduction already.</p>
