            <p>Troubled dairy company Synlait faces more uncertainty, less than a week after shareholders voted to save the company.</p>
        
            <p>This time, the company has withdrawn its earnings guidance for the 2024 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait said its 2024 performance was affected by "unforeseen year-end timing differences between July and August for manufacturing and shipping".</p>
        
            <p>It also faced additional costs related to its strategic review and deleveraging plan because of the extra time needed to carry out the work.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait said as a result, its final underlying earnings result would be below the previously announced guidance - which it said was at the lower end of the $45 million to $60m range.</p>
        
            <p>The previous guidance excluded a non-cash adjustment of $17m.</p>
        
            <p>The withdrawal of its guidance came after Synlait shareholders voted to approve a $130m loan from major shareholder Bright Dairy last week, to meet a deadline to repay Synlait's debt.</p>
        
            <p>If the loan had not been approved, Synlait faced the possibility of voluntary administration.</p>
        
            <p>"The board is committed to resetting Synlait's balance sheet to help it return to a position where it can deliver on the growth potential seen in its core advanced nutrition and foodservice businesses," Synlait told the NZX.</p>
        
            <p>"To achieve this, considerable steps are being taken to complete the deleveraging plan. The first step was completed on Monday 15 July 2024 with the $130m payment made to Synlait's banks."</p>
        
            <p>Synlait said it remained on track to meet minimum underlying earnings for bank covenant purposes.</p>
