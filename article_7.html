        <h2>Productivity surging as staff return to office, bosses say - Staff disagree</h2>
        <p>
But staff themselves saw things differently.

            <p>Employers say worker productivity is surging as more bosses insist that staff return to the office.</p>
        
            <p>A survey by recruiters Robert Half found 70 percent of employers reported increased productivity over the past year, compared to only 36 percent of staff who felt the same.</p>
        
            <p>Robert Half regional director Ronil Singh said the findings from the report - which surveyed 751 hiring managers and workers - differed from Stats NZ data from last year, which saw productivity fall.</p>
        
            <p>He said it may be because employers were changing how staff worked.</p>
        
            <p>"One [factor] will be the return to the office environment for a lot of employers and businesses. We're definitely seeing a request from most employers across New Zealand where they're actually asking for the employees to come back to the office more," Singh said.</p>
        
            <p>"What that does is actually enhances collaboration and innovation. There's also a combination of things like there's been a lot of investment and automation tools and streamlining of processes from a technology point of view."</p>
        
            <p>Singh said restructures and staff cuts may also explain why businesses felt more productive - although staff dissatisfaction may explain why workers did not feel more productive.</p>
        
            <p>He said restructures or cuts to staffing levels meant those who remained potentially faced heavier workloads.</p>
        
            <p>"One way businesses are able to take the pressure off some of these staff is by hiring contract staff ... preventing the burn out and attrition rates."</p>
        
            <p>Despite more businesses asking staff to return to the office, Singh did not believe it was the end to the pandemic-era boom of working from home.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's over," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there needs to be a happy balance between being aware of employee needs and employee experience and operational efficiency.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the employee and employers both have to come to an understanding where you need both."</p>
