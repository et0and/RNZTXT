            <p>A rise in the number of applications for advertised jobs continues to outpace the number available.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Seek NZ Employment Report for the three months ended February indicates a notable rise in the jobs advertised in January was followed up with a 2 percent drop in February, with no change quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        
            <p>It said all of the large hiring industries recorded a decline, or no change in ad volume in February.</p>
        
            <p>A 15 percent drop in demand for call centre and customer service workers led the month on month decline among the industries.</p>
        
            <p>"After two years of steady and significant decline in job ad volumes, the past eight months have been broadly flat," Seek country manager Rob Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we may not be out of the woods yet, the days of significant, broad-based drops in worker demand should be behind us."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>"Annual average advertised salary growth continues to slow but remains above inflation," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>Advertised salary growth rose by 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, while annual advertised salary growth slowed to 2.6 percent in February over the year.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite having some of the more robust labour markets over 2024, advertised salary growth has slowed more notably in the more regional parts of the South Island," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Slower advertised salary growth in some of the largest industries is dragging down the national average, with some smaller industries like Science & Technology growing much faster."</p>
