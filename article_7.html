            <p>Dairy prices have fallen for the first time in four months.</p>
        
            <p>The global auction overnight saw the average price ease 2.3 percent to US$3630 a tonne.</p>
        
            <p>The whole milk powder price - which influences payouts for local farmers - fell 2.8 percent to $3286 a tonne.</p>
        
            <p>Other products were mixed - cheddar rose, while prices were weaker for butter and skim milk powder.</p>
        
            <p>NZX dairy analyst Rosalind Crickett said it was "the largest pricing slump felt on the platform since August last year".</p>
        
            <p>She said the results were in line with expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"On a regional buying front, North Asia continued their reign as top buyer of both milk powders and butter, while the Middle East took out the top buyer's spot [for] cheddar," Crickett said.</p>
        
            <p>Skim milk powder recorded the biggest price decrease in the auction, falling 5.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Although it's worth noting that the average price [for skim milk powder] still sits well and truly above those seen through December-January," Crickett said.</p>
        
            <p>Dairy company forecasts indicated a payout of around $7.80 per kilogram of milk solids in the current season.</p>
