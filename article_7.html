            <p>Skinny has come out on top again for the eighth year in a row as best mobile provider in Consumer NZ's satisfaction survey.</p>
        
            <p>The survey found Skinny customers had the highest levels of satisfaction and value for money across the mobile sector.</p>
        
            <p>Results showed 69 percent of its customers were happy with the value offered compared to the market average of 54 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, One NZ formerly Vodafone, the largest network provider in the country, was deemed the worst.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer investigative writer Ruairi O'Shea said despite having the most customers, the telco company also had many who were not happy with its services.</p>
        
            <p>A Commerce Commission customer service survey, released in September, showed similar results.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to internet providers, Sky Broadband had the highest level of overall satisfaction ratings based on speed, reliability, bill accuracy and contract terms.</p>
        
            <p>"Now came a close second in terms of overall satisfaction and it performed consistently well across other measures of satisfaction too," O'Shea said.</p>
        
            <p>Contact was at the bottom of the list as the worst internet service provider. Just over half of its customers were happy with its services, fewer than half felt it offered value for money.</p>
        
            <p>One NZ was also at the bottom of the list as an internet provider.</p>
        
            <p>"Only 55 percent of One NZ customers were very satisfied and it was the worst rated provider for clarity of contract terms, customer support, technical support and value for money," O'Shea said.</p>
        
            <p>Slingshot and 2degrees were the other two providers who make up the bottom four list.</p>
        
            <p>"Sticking with the same provider instead of checking out the competition can cost you hundreds of dollars per year. As soon as your fixed-term contract is up, search for other options, you might just up your satisfaction levels and lower your bills," O'Shea said.</p>
        
            <p>Skinny, One NZ, Slingshot, Sky Broadband, and 2degrees have been approached for comment.</p>
