            <p>Weaker agricultural market conditions have forced rural services company PGG Wrightson (PGW) to cut its full-year earnings forecast.</p>
        
            <p>The company is now expecting operating earnings of about $43 million compared to its previous forecast of $50m for the year ended June.</p>
        
            <p>PGW chair Garry Moore said trading conditions had deteriorated for a range of reasons but the result had been a reduction in spending.</p>
        
            <p>He said drought in several regions, low sheep meat demand and higher supply, high interest rates and costs, and delays between sales and income for producers had taken a toll.</p>
        
            <p>"Whilst we have seen a slight uptick in farmer and grower confidence in recent months, this is off a low base and sentiment in the sector remains subdued."</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing some clients defer spend where they can and hold off on discretionary items. In this context PGW's outlook for the remainder of the financial year remains cautious."</p>
        
            <p>Moore said the medium and long-term prospects for the sector and the company remained positive.</p>
        
            <p>"As a business, PGW does well when our clients prosper and consequently the converse is true that when times are tough for our clients this also impacts our performance.</p>
        
            <p>"Notwithstanding the difficult trading conditions, PGW continues to maintain and grow share in the markets in which we operate."</p>
        
            <p>In February the company reported a near halving of its six-month profit and suspended its dividend to preserve cash.</p>
