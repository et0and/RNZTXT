            <p>The Bank of New Zealand says it has restored access to online banking services, which had been out of action this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The bank said the outage had affected customers' ability to conduct online banking, including the BNZ app, cards and ATMs.</p>
        
            <p>It apologised to customers for any inconvenience while it worked to get the system back online.</p>
        
            <p>On BNZ's Facebook page, one person said it was a "hassle" and they had gone to three petrol stations where their card had been declined.</p>
        
            <p>Another said they were waiting at the checkout line with a trolley load of groceries and no ability to pay.</p>
        
            <p>Another person said such outages happened too often and left customers without access to their funds.</p>
