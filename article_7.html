            <p>Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran says it wants to explore more routes to India - once it is through the tough economic "headwinds" buffeting the airline.</p>
        
            <p>The national carrier had seen many passengers travelling to Singapore and then taking other airlines to India and it would like to explore more routes when it can.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the national carrier posted an underlying profit of $222 million in the year to June - a drop of more than half.</p>
        
            <p>And the company's net profit for the financial year was down 65 percent to $146m, compared to $412m a year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Although the result was expected - in April, it downgraded its full-year earnings guidance - the airline did not anticipate profits to be flying high any time soon.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran told Checkpoint it was facing "a few headwinds".</p>
        
            <p>"We came off a very, very good result last year - $585m - and that was reflective of revenge travel after Covid and this year - particularly in the second half - there's been a few headwinds that we have to deal with."</p>
        
            <p>The first of those factors was the subdued New Zealand economy, which was being felt most keenly in government spending on domestic travel, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Government spend is down 28 percent - and that wouldn't be a surprise to anyone - and that generally represents about a fifth of our domestic business.</p>
        
            <p>"Corporate and small-medium enterprises are also down, 10 to 12 percent."</p>
        
            <p>Updating its fleet and engine availability was the second challenge, he said.</p>

            <p>"It's just one of those things - you make decisions ... 20 years ago to run with a Rolls-Royce Trent engine and we've got some challenges [with supply].</p>
        
            <p>"Today, I've got four Dreamliners that we've got engine issues with. We just can't get engines out of Rolls-Royce at the moment, and I've got six Airbuses that also we're waiting for engines out of Pratt & Whitney."</p>
        
            <p>The third factor was tough competition in the American market, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic between China and US was running at only 25 percent capacity, which meant they had extra planes, and this had an impact on US carriers flying into New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still flying, and we've got people on our planes but not getting the revenue out of those particular routes that we'd done previously."</p>
        
            <p>Foran said the airline expected the next six months to be similar but for profits to pick up after that.</p>
        
            <p>So what routes were making money?</p>
        
            <p>Foran said there had been "increased traffic across the board" as passengers from New Zealand flew into major American hubs such as Dallas, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>
        
            <p>They were part of the Star Alliance with United, but this precluded them from doing deals with Delta and American Airlines, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The various authorities quite rightly want the thing to be competitive ... so you can cut your cloth in one area, but you can't everywhere."</p>
        
            <p>In future, the airline was "very interested" in new routes into India, Foran said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of traffic heading there now that get on our Singapore flight, then ... they branch off and they could go to any number of cities in India."</p>
        
            <p>Another option was "getting back into Europe", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Any talk of expansion was moot, however, until the engine supply issue could be resolved, he said.</p>
        
            <p>They were also hoping to see "a couple" of new planes from Boeing at the end of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the ink is signed on those, then I'm more comfortable to start selling."</p>
        
            <p>The airline was not looking to cut routes on its struggle American sector at the moment, he said.</p>

            <p>"It's a pretty cyclical business; there are periods when you get tailwinds, and there are periods when you get headwinds and America is a good market for us.</p>
        
            <p>"I think absolutely us pointing to America makes a lot of sense, and yes I'm very happy with New York."</p>
        
            <p>On the question of over-priced fares, Foran said the average fare was down on a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>"That's surprising, isn't it? People will say, 'Gee, I paid too much ... but the average is the average - and that's reflective of whether you're on domestic jet or a smaller turbo-prop plane."</p>
        
            <p>Asked by Checkpoint host Anna Thomas whether it would bow to pressure to reduce fares over the school holidays, Foran blamed demand and supply.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit like fresh strawberries - if supply is short, you're probably going to pay more for a product."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand recently pulled the plug on its 2030 climate targets, saying the resources needed to meet them were unaffordable and unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Foran said supply chain issues and expenses could slow the introduction of newer, more fuel efficient aircraft into the fleet.</p>
        
            <p>The target was still under review, he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to go back and reassess that. Our commitment to that is as strong - if not stronger - than it has ever been, [but] this is a very sensible governance decision."</p>
