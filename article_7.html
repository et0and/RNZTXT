        <h2>Kiwi couple trapped in Noumea for 10 days fail in bid to get insurer to pay</h2>
        <p>
The couple complained to the Financial Services Complaints, after political unrest in Noumea forced them to hunker down for ten days.

            <p>A couple who were trapped in their accommodation for ten days due to protests in Noumea were unsuccessful in their complaint that their travel insurer should cover the trip costs.</p>
        
            <p>The pair complained to Financial Services Complaints, an ombudsman service that deals with complaints that cannot be resolved directly between financial service providers and clients.</p>
        
            <p>It does not identify the parties involved.</p>
        
            <p>In this case, the couple booked a two-week holiday in New Caledonia in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>Their credit card gave them a complimentary travel policy.</p>
        
            <p>They did not book specific tours or activities before they left for the trip because they thought they would do this on a day-by-day basis when they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>But on the day they landed, civil and political unrest broke out and the city was locked down.</p>

            <p>"They could not leave their accommodation and were effectively trapped there for ten days until they were able to return home on a flight arranged by the New Zealand government," the complaint said.</p>
        
            <p>They made a claim to their travel insurers.</p>
        
            <p>The insurer said some of their expenses were covered under the tour cancellation section of their policy but the couple wanted the full amount available paid, which was $4000.</p>
        
            <p>"Although they had not booked specific tours or activities prior to arriving in Noumea, they said their whole trip was a tour and this was effectively cancelled, and so they should be covered for this," the case notes said.</p>
        
            <p>It noted it was clear the trip was ruined by the unrest and they experienced significant distress.</p>

            <p>But, it said the policy wording meant the insurer had paid all it had to.</p>
        
            <p>"The policy did not provide cover for expenses the insured would have incurred had the holiday not been cut short."</p>
        
            <p>The service said the policy specifically excluded cover for costs and losses arising from loss of enjoyment.</p>
        
            <p>"We explained that this is a standard clause in travel insurance policies."</p>
        
            <p>There had been significant delays in the claim being assessed and the communication was poor, the service noted.</p>
        
            <p>The insurer offered $1000 to resolve the complaint.</p>
        
            <p>The service said people should check their travel policy wording so they knew what would be covered if something unexpected happened.</p>
