            <p>Business and finance leaders expect inflation to be firmly under control, and the official cash rate to likely fall sharply, over the next year.</p>
        
            <p>The Reserve Bank's (RBNZ) quarterly survey of expectations shows two-year-ahead inflation expectations at 2.12 percent - up 9 basis points from the last quarter, but within the RBNZ's 1 to 3 percent target.</p>
        
            <p>The survey had responses from 40 business leaders and professional forecasters.</p>
        
            <p>The official cash rate is expected to fall 50 basis points by the end of December to 4.25 percent, and decrease to 3.33 percent in a year's time.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ said expectations for the unemployment rate remained steady, up just one basis point from last quarter's 5.11 percent to 5.22 percent in a year's time.</p>
        
            <p>Expectations for wage growth declined slightly to an annual 2.81 percent growth in a year's time, but the average two-year-ahead expectation for annual wage inflation rose 30 basis points to 3.16 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The survey also showed belief the economy would rebound, with economic growth expected to be 2.17 percent in two years, up slightly from previous expectations.</p>
        
            <p>On the housing front, expectations are building for the market to pick up over the coming year, with house price inflation expectations up 71 basis points to just over 3 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, two-year house price inflation expectations fell nearly a quarter of a percentage point to 4.17 percent.</p>
