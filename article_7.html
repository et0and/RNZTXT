            <p>Ezibuy's parent company has appointed administrators - and this time it includes other brands including Katies and Millers.</p>
        
            <p>Mosaic Brands told the ASX it had received the support of a majority of its commercial partners and the board had been confident in a restructure process it had under way.</p>
        
            <p>That included simplifying operations and reducing the number of shops, focusing on "key growth brands" and reducing costs.</p>
        
            <p>Mosaic told the market that the process had involved talking to its lenders, suppliers, landlords and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).</p>
        
            <p>The ACCC has issued court proceedings relating to late or non-delivery of good during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>But it said a small number of stakeholders did not support the proposal or negotiating a commercial outcome and Mosaic could not reach a commercially acceptable resolution with the ACCC.</p>
        
            <p>It said the group would continue to trade and would focus on "brand rationalisation and wider restructuring".</p>
        
            <p>KPMG has been appointed receiver by a secured lender.</p>
        
            <p>At the end of September, Mosaic said it was still finalising its latest annual results, which were taking longer than expected.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, voluntary administrators were appointed to Ezibuy, which owed more than $100 million to creditors.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Mosaic said its significant decline in sales through 2022 was at odds with the rest of the business.</p>
        
            <p>But Mosaic bought it back earlier this year, planning a simplied online-only operation.</p>
        
            <p>Ezibuy was founded in New Zealand in the 1970s and was owned by simplified until it just before the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Facebook, Ezibuy told followers that online orders would continue to be shipped and inquiries responded to.</p>
        
            <p>Although some commenters expressed sadness, others said their recent experiences with Ezibuy had not been positive. Some complained about difficulty getting refunds and the loss of familiar Ezibuy brands.</p>
        
            <p>Mosaic said the board wanted to reiterate its belied - "to those who supported the restructure, to Mosaic's customers and most importantly Mosaic's dedicated team across Australia" - that the business had a long-term future.</p>
