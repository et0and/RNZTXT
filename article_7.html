        <p>
New Zealand-listed shares have underperformed compared to many global markets with greater exposure to tech sector gains, though an improving economy could help drive up domestic values.

            <p>New Zealand-listed shares have underperformed compared to many global markets with greater exposure to tech sector gains, though an improving economy could help drive up domestic values.</p>
        
            <p>Salt Fund economist Bevan Graham said New Zealand companies offered good value despite continued market volatility and uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>"In the US we know valuations are pretty stretched in some sectors, particularly in the tech sector."</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, he said New Zealand's tech-light market was in line for some improvement.</p>
        
            <p>"With respect to domestic equities, we think the outlook is improving here in New Zealand, but look, we're not immune to that global volatility.</p>
        
            <p>"There are certainly risks out there to be to be mindful of, but there are pockets of opportunity out there as well."</p>
        
            <p>Graham said easing inflation and interest rates cuts were supporting economic growth.</p>
        
            <p>"So we'll see a long period of earnings downgrades in New Zealand gradually starting to switch to upgrades as as the year progresses," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Still, a recent survey by New Zealand do-it-yourself retail investment app Sharesies found investment in US tech exchange NASDAQ was the most popular exchange among users.</p>
        
            <p>Sharesies acting commercial and financial officer Erin Avery said nine-of-the-10 largest declines were NZX investments over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"Notable exceptions were NZX listed Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and the Fonterra Shareholders Fund." Both those companies were actively using technology to drive growth.</p>
