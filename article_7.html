            <p>Legal controls banning the movement of fruit and vegetables out of an Auckland suburb will remain in place until next month.</p>
        
            <p>A male oriental fruit fly was found in Birkdale on the North Shore in February, sparking restrictions on produce.</p>
        
            <p>Biosecurity spokesman Mike Inglis said no more of the pests had been found in surveillance traps, which were being regularly checked.</p>
        
            <p>Specialist staff and a mobile field laboratory are cutting up fruit and vegetables and checking for any signs of larvae.</p>
        
            <p>Inglis said the produce restrictions would be in force until 10 April.</p>
