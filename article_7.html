            <p>Trans-Tasman flights will return to Hamilton Airport for the first time in 13 years.</p>
        
            <p>Jetstar flights will operate out of the airport to Sydney and the Gold Coast from June 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian airline will also run a new direct service between Dunedin Airport and the Gold Coast from the same time.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Regional Airport chief executive Mark Morgan said the news came after more than a year of negotiations with the airline and border agencies.</p>
        
            <p>"Analysis indicates the flights will boost the regional economy by about $45 million per year." Morgan said.</p>

            <p>Hamilton mayor Paula Southgate said it was a "huge win" for the city and region.</p>
        
            <p>"Air travel plays a major role in economic and social connectivity, and this will open up Hamilton to Australia and the world."</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Airport chief executive Daniel De Bono said the new flights into the southern city were a result of five years of hard work and negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how much our community and everyone in the lower South Island wanted this and we are incredibly proud and excited to announce this new service."</p>

            <p>Jetstar Group chief executive Stephanie Tully said the airline was excited to be further expanding its network in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in a period of unparalleled growth for Jetstar in New Zealand, launching five new routes in the past three months and providing greater low-fares connections to key regions across the country.</p>
        
            <p>It said the airline provided critical competition, selling a million domestic fares for less than $100 in the past year.</p>
