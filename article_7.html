"Here's to reinventing yourself at any age. Here's to calling it when you're satisfied you've given something literally everything you've got," Jordan Rondel wrote on social media.

            <p>Jordan Rondel, aka The Caker, has decided to call it a day on her successful baking business, selling the boxed cake kits company along with the name she has become known for.</p>
        
            <p>"The Caker brand has been built on the sturdiest of foundations - honesty, commitment and passion. Anouk (Jordan's sister) and I dedicated a huge chunk of our lives to upholding its purpose and values, ingraining the business into every part of us. My name became synonymous with it, I became The Caker," Rondell wrote on Instagram to her 71.1K followers on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"But while stuck on the exhilarating rollercoaster of entrepreneurship for almost 15 years (the last 3 being the most relentless), I've come to realize that I'm me, Anouk is Anouk and The Caker is actually, all of you - the band of cake lovers who supports it and appreciates it, those who make it a part of their celebrations - you are all Cakers."</p>
        
            <p>The popular fancy cake kits - with flavours like coconut lime and raspberry and flourless dark chocolate gold leaf - will still be sold in Australia and New Zealand, while Rondell will remain in Los Angels creating recipes, making cakes and working on collaborations.</p>
        
            <p>"Here's to reinventing yourself at any age. Here's to calling it when you're satisfied you've given something literally everything you've got. Here's to cool new shit. Here's to The Caker," Rondel captioned a post of pictures on her social media.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be over here looking for a new ride in the theme park of life for a while, k, bye, love you."</p>
        
            <p>Rondel closed The Caker bakery on Auckland's Karangahape Rd in August, 2023. That same year she judged The Great Kiwi Bake Off alongside chef Peter Gordon.</p>
        
            <p>A year earlier, in 2022, Rondel released a carrot cake mix in collaboration with model Chrissy Teigen, which turned pear-shaped when months later it was reported that Rondel was "shocked" to see Teigen's Cravings brand had introduced a line of mixes that looked a lot like her own.</p>
        
            <p>Rondel acknowledged at the time to Stuff that she "didn't invent the concept of a cake mix", but said she had worked hard to secure a niche with a "luxury, elevated cake mix".</p>
        
            <p>"We're a tiny little pinprick of a brand here and we've invested everything we have in building a brand... But now I'm just like, shit, some of that market is being taken by someone else and we're just being pushed to the side."</p>
