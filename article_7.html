            <p>Consumer sentiment is improving with increasing confidence in the economy, following widespread pessimism over the past few years.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac McDermott Miller Consumer Confidence Index rose 7 points to 97.5 in December, which was still below long-run averages, but the most upbeat in three years.</p>
        
            <p>Anything below 100 indicated a pessimistic view.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac Senior Economist Satish Ranchhod said the pressures that had been squeezing households' finances in recent years were now easing, with inflation and mortgage rates falling.</p>
        
            <p>"We think 2025 will be a brighter year for New Zealand households and the economy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Interest rates are likely to fall further. That will support a gradual firming in the housing market and economic growth."</p>
        
            <p>He said retail and hospitality spending was expected to improve as more consumers rolled off high mortgage interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"We're also likely to see the labour market firm in the latter part of next year as economic activity recovers."</p>
        
            <p>He said confidence among men improved by 12.1 points to 108.6, which was a contrast to women who remained pessimistic with an increase of 2 points to 87.2.</p>
        
            <p>"Close to half of women believe they are worse off financially than they were a year ago, compared with under a third of men," Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>McDermott Miller research director Imogen Rendall said younger groups were more confident than older people.</p>
        
            <p>Confidence among those aged 18-29 rose 11 points to 106.1, with those aged 30-49 rose 13.7 points to 103.3 and those 50+ saw confidence fall 0.6 points to 88.8.</p>
        
            <p>People in work were also more confident with a 10.4 points to 104.8, while those not in paid work saw little change - up just 1.8 points to 85.2.</p>
