            <p>Another day, another regulatory headache for SkyCity.</p>
        
            <p>The South Australian Court of Appeal ruled the casino company must pay A$13 million (NZ$13.8m) in unpaid casino duty, over a long-standing dispute between the company and the treasurer of South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The matter related to differing interpretations of a 1999 agreement on the tax covering loyalty points used and earned on gaming machines at Sky's Adelaide casino.</p>
        
            <p>The court ruled in favour of the treasurer, finding that credits on gaming machines, resulting from loyalty points, must be included in gaming revenue when calculating casino duty.</p>
        
            <p>It also found that loyalty points earned by customers on gaming machines, must not be deducted from gaming revenue.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, SkyCity estimated it would have to pay additional casino duty of about A$13m to cover the treatment of loyalty points between January 2014 and January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>However, the court also ruled in favour of SkyCity's position that an interest penalty should not be enforced.</p>
        
            <p>The company said that matter would be decided by a single judge of the Supreme Court at a later date.</p>
        
            <p>If the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Treasurer, relating to the penalty interest payments, SkyCity estimated it may need to pay A$20m in penalty interest.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity said the Court of Appeal's ruling meant it would have a A$2m hit to its underlying earnings in the 2024 financial year ending in June, with the A$13m payment included as a one-off cost.</p>
        
            <p>It said the additional A$2m was likely to be the ongoing duty that SkyCity Adelaide would have to pay.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the additional costs, SkyCity said its full year profit guidance was unchanged at between $125m and $135m, while underlying profit for the full year would likely be between $290m and $390m.</p>
        
            <p>It was the latest regulatory headache for SkyCity.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity has set aside provisions to pay a civil penalty and associated legal costs of about $79m in respect of money laundering breaches in Australia, and is also expected to pay up to $8m New Zealand authorities over similar breaches.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity remained under investigation regarding its Adelaide casino licence and host responsibilities at the Auckland casino.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking earlier in the day, the company's outgoing chief executive, Michael Ahearne, told RNZ the company had set aside money for any compliance issues that may arise.</p>
        
            <p>"We've made provisions for any such penalties which are an estimation of any potential penalties that we may have," he said.</p>
