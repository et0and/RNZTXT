            <p>New fast-track consenting legislation will allow projects like a large gold mine in Central Otago to go ahead more quickly, while still ensuring environmental protections are in place, the Minister for Resources Shane Jones says.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Stock Exchange-listed company Santana Minerals said more promising results from drill testing of a proposed mine at the company's existing 272sqkm Bendigo-Ophir Project near Tarras, could yield between 100,000 to 150,000 ounces of gold each year - which would equate to a minimum of $325 million a year under current gold pricing.</p>
        
            <p>It is still early days, with the mining permit pending and the resource consent application yet to be filed - but landowners near the site have made agreements with the company to allow mining there.</p>
        
            <p>Santana Minerals chief executive Damian Spring told RNZ on Wednesday that the new "pro-mining government" and its repeal of Labour's Natural and Built Environment Act and the Spatial Planning Act in December, gave certainty to progress the project.</p>
        
            <p>The company briefed the Minister for Resources, Shane Jones of New Zealand First, about the project in December.</p>
        
            <p>"They have their private obligations, to mobilise the capital etc but I assured them that our government is certainly keen to see a lot more activity in the mining sector," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the incoming legislation to allow ministers to fast-track consents for projects of significant economic and regional interest would come through Parliament in late February.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to, in 2024, convince investors, convince the industry, that I can deliver a level of certainty for them, so they can spend their own money and secure the consents within the statutory framework passing for resource management and mining," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said New Zealanders could be assured projects would still be held accountable for environmental protections and mitigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We're at a crossroads in terms of climate change policy. Mining is absolutely essential for a credible climate change response in terms of rare earth minerals - absolutely necessary for decarbonisation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And there are always trade-offs. I'm going to ensure that those trade-offs are put in front of the people of our nation and decided upon on the basis of science, economics and a robust understanding as to what are the cost benefits in terms of going right or left."</p>
        
            <p>Santana Minerals said it aimed to have the resource consent application lodged by the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, Santana Minerals bought Matakanui Gold, which had exploration permits at Bendigo-Ophir, and drilling and infill drilling continued in 2021.</p>
