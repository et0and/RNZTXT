            <p>Fletcher Building is in a trading halt ahead of a government announcement, later on Friday, about leaky pipes in Western Australian homes, manufactured by its Iplex subsidiary.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher had been in mediation with stakeholders, including the Government of Western Australia, as part of a joint industry response to the leaky pipe issue.</p>
        
            <p>Perth-based building firm BGC blamed Iplex for the bursting and leaking pipes, but Fletcher said installation was the problem.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher said Friday's announcement would include material information in respect of its shares.</p>
        
            <p>"This announcement is expected to outline whether the Government of Western Australia will accept a joint industry response to this issue," Fletcher said in a statement to the market.</p>
        
            <p>The trading halt would remain in place until Fletcher made its own announcement, shortly after the government made theirs.</p>
