            <p>A major development opening on Friday in Tauranga is part of a push to get residents back into the heart of the city.</p>
        
            <p>The $200 million Elizabeth Towers has 23 townhouses and 96 apartments and included the rebuild of department store Farmers, which has sat on the corner of Devonport Road and Elizabeth Street for 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>As the name suggests, it has two towers - one being 10 storeys and the other nine storeys.</p>
        
            <p>Economic development agency Priority One chief executive Nigel Tutt said the city centre was going through a large transition.</p>
        
            <p>"This is really quite a big change for Tauranga city, because we haven't had larger apartment blocks built previous to this."</p>

            <p>Elizabeth Properties Limited project manager Brett Nicholls said the vision was to transform thinking about living well in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have sincerely appreciated the community enthusiasm for and interest in Thirty Eight Elizabeth | Elizabeth Towers and that we've been able to act as a catalyst for positive change in the heart of Tauranga."</p>
        
            <p>He knew of about 20 new developments underway in central Tauranga, he said.</p>
        
            <p>This included Te Manawataki o Te Papa, a new civic precinct in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>Te Manawataki o Te Papa - or the 'heartbeat of Te Papa' - will take up a city block and include a new library, community hub, civic whare and museum, all facing an inviting green space.</p>
