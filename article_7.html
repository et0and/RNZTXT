        <h2>Synlait Milk seeks approval for $130m loan to pay bank debt</h2>
        <p>
The specialty dairy company says it may need to cease trading or initiate a formal insolvency process, if alternative arrangements cannot be made to satisfy the banks involved.

            <p>Synlait Milk has set the date for a special meeting of shareholders to approve a $130 million loan from its major shareholder, Bright Dairy.</p>
        
            <p>The specialty dairy company needed the money to pay bank debt due next month.</p>
        
            <p>It recommended shareholders accept the arrangement, given its limited options.</p>
        
            <p>It had failed to find a buyer for its DairyWorks business, was still reviewing a possible sale of its other North Island plants, and also needed to find $180m to repay a retail bond due in December.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the company said it may need to cease trading or initiate a formal insolvency process, if alternative arrangements could not be made to satisfy the banks involved.</p>
        
            <p>Bright Dairy said the loan facility was one part of its wider support to see Synlait return to a much stronger financial and operating position.</p>
        
            <p>However, the outcome of the vote was far from certain, as Bright Dairy with a 39 percent stake cannot vote on the resolution, while the second largest shareholder, A2Milk, with a near 20 percent stake, was not saying either way.</p>
        
            <p>A2 Milk's support for the loan was by no means a given as it was in a dispute with Synlait after it cancelled Synlait's exclusive supply agreement.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the mountain of debt and high costs, a significant majority of Synlait's nearly 300 suppliers of special A2 milk have given two years' notice to quit.</p>
        
            <p>The special meeting was scheduled for 11 July.</p>
