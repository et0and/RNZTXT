            <p>Te Matatini - the national kapa haka championships - kick off in New Plymouth tomorrow, (Tuesday 25 Feb) the first time the event has been held in Taranaki for more than 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>More than 40,000 people are expected to visit the Bowl of Brooklands, with more than 2.5 million expected to check out the action on television or online.</p>
        
            <p>It is predicted the Taranaki economy will receive a $22 million boost, but surprisingly some local businesses are still unsure of what to expect.</p>
        
            <p>Sandwiched between the celebration of classic US motor vehicles - Americarna - and the Womad music festival, a record 55 groups will compete at Te Matatini this year and accommodation has been at a premium.</p>

            <p>Chair of festival hosts - Te Kāhui Maunga - Elijah Pue said some rōpū of up to 60 people, including support crew, were staying hundreds of kilometres away from the venue in Ngāmotu.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand there are visitors staying in Whanganui, in Hāwera, Mōkau and in New Plymouth and everywhere in-between.</p>
        
            <p>"And so there are going to be upwards of 40,000 people in Te Kāhui Maunga's rohe and that's across the breadth and width of our rohe."</p>
        
            <p>Pue expected cash registers to be ringing throughout the region.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the economic impact across our rohe is going to be immense. You will have groups booking hotels, motels, campgrounds, restaurants, RSAs. Spending money at petrol stations, supermarkets, cafes and bars, clubs and karaoke bars. The works."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was hard to underestimate the impact of Te Matatini.</p>
        
            <p>"What you are going to see and feel is a hype for Te Matatini. There's a huge excitement building for Te Matatini the biggest festival ever in it's history and the fact it is going to be here in Te Kāhui Maunga and indeed here in Ngāmotu."</p>

            <p>Michelle Brennan, of the Taranaki Chamber of Commerce, had been busy promoting the 'be prepared message' to its members.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Matatini is a bit of the unknown and I guess we've all been working very hard to make sure people are aware and businesses in particular about the impacts that could be, but a lot of them are saying they are still not sure."</p>
        
            <p>A case in point was Art Cafe owner Nickie Parker.</p>
        
            <p>"You know we've had emails from the council saying be prepared there's going to be a huge influx of visitors and we're just not really sure are they going to be eating at cafes or are they going to be bulk buying from the supermarket. We're just not really sure.</p>
        
            <p>"We would love it to be super busy and for everyone in town to be super busy. That would be amazing, so yeah, fingers crossed."</p>
        
            <p>Shirley Smith was co-owner of the Hot Waffle food truck.</p>
        
            <p>"It should be crazy. I don't know, but we've been told everyone is underestimating what it's going to be like.</p>
        
            <p>"When a van load of hungry people turn up to your dairy they're going to clean it out and then they'll be nothing left for the locals, so they're telling people to prepare cause once you run out you're buggered."</p>
        
            <p>The Hot Waffle would be parked at a pop-up food court in Waitara during the festival hoping to take advantage of people staying at marae in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Bryan Mattock - manager at Crowded House Bar and Grill in New Plymouth - was feeling more confident.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had rōpū and ask us if we can have karaokes so we've got karaoke coming in Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday nights that have been booked for.</p>
        
            <p>"You know without talking figures Te Matatini will be a massive massive boost for us especially when we are getting booking for 60 to 80 plus people booking in one group."</p>
        
            <p>He reckoned locals were going to be blown away.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a massive culture shock for the town. You know this week we've got Americarna on which is also a great event but come Sunday the American flag is coming down and the Māori flag is going up and they'll be going up everywhere."</p>
        
            <p>Te Matatini is at Brookland Park and the Bowl of Brooklands from 25 February through to 1 March.</p>
