            <p>Retailer Briscoe Group has reported near record full year sales, though tight profit margins hit the bottom-line.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of Briscoes homeware and Rebel Sport said both brands delivered positive sales growth, though trading conditions were expected to remain tough.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking forward we do not underestimate just how tough trading will continue to be with the first half expected to be especially challenging," managing director Rod Duke said.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect this will see second half profitability exceed that produced for the first half in a return to a more normalised shape of profitability.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hopeful that the economic recovery will gradually emerge as the year continues, which will assist us to achieve our goal of protecting this year's level of profitability."</p>
        
            <p>Board chair Dame Rosanne Meo said the full year result reflects one of the most challenging retail environments seen in New Zealand for many years.</p>
        
            <p>"In this marketplace to be within 0.06 percent of last year's record sales, to manage costs to be only 1.11 percent higher than the previous year and to reduce inventory by a further $5m is frankly, a remarkable performance."</p>
        
            <p>Duke said the company would focus on cost control and to maintain gross profit margins at current levels.</p>
        
            <p>"The Group's full-year result was negatively impacted from KMD Brands Limited's decision to not pay any dividends during the year."</p>
