        <h2>Bad debts leads to profit falls for specialist lenders</h2>
        <p>
Profits for non-bank finance groups have taken a tumble for a second consecutive year, driven by higher costs and an increase in bad debts, according to a new report.

            <p>Profits for non-bank finance groups have taken a tumble for a second consecutive year, driven by higher costs and an increase in bad debts, according to a new report.</p>
        
            <p>Business consultancy KPMG's annual survey of 26 finance companies, building societies and credit unions - now described as the specialist lending sector - showed combined profits fell 25 percent to $243 million.</p>
        
            <p>Total assets increased by 7 percent to $19.3 billion, as increased lending and higher interest rates lifted income.</p>
        
            <p>But that was offset by the higher cost of money, increased overheads, and a significant lift in the amount set aside for bad and doubtful debts.</p>
        
            <p>KPMG head of banking John Kensington said despite the fall in sector profitability, there was a noticeably more positive tone this year.</p>
        
            <p>"A combination of a change in government to one that is perceived as and starting to show that it is more business friendly, interest rates</p>
        
            <p>starting to drop, inflation coming under control and changes to the CCCFA (Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act) have all been little rays of sunshine."</p>
        
            <p>Kensington said the sector was valuable, serving a range customers, which the main retail banks either ignored or serviced poorly, but it recognised times were changing and it needed to sell itself better.</p>
        
            <p>"The role that it plays in providing alternative types of finance to 1.7 million New Zealanders is not to be underestimated."</p>
        
            <p>Kensington said amid talk of forcing greater competition to the major banks, the specialist lenders needed fairer treatment so that the current regulatory system did not disadvantage them.</p>
        
            <p>"They'd like to see some proportionality in the regulation, so it wasn't a rule that one size fits all, because it doesn't for them."</p>
        
            <p>"So they could get access to some slightly cheaper funding because they'll argue that what they're doing is just as vital a role."</p>
        
            <p>"Top of mind here was access to an ESAS or ESAS lite account and the ability to access funding more comparable to the levels achieved by banks," Kensington said.</p>
        
            <p>ESAS is the RBNZ supervised system for the immediate settlement of inter-bank financial transactions, which is open to 12 banks and five large non-bank institutions.</p>
        
            <p>The government has told the Reserve Bank to look at ways of making regulations on capital levels and other requirements more appropriate for the size of the various companies.</p>
        
            <p>Kensington said overall if economic and regulatory conditions improved then the small players would prosper.</p>
