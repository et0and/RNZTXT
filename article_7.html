            <p>Households believe the market has reached a turning point, with more people expecting prices to increase, according to ASB's latest housing confidence survey.</p>
        
            <p>For the first time in 18 months, more New Zealanders expected prices to increase than decrease, the survey for the three months to October showed.</p>
        
            <p>A net 34 percent expected prices to rise from levels seen in the quarter, compared to the start of the year, where 43 percent expected prices to fall.</p>
        
            <p>"Aucklanders continue to be the most bullish in their house price expectations, in a continuation of the theme we saw last quarter," ASB said.</p>
        
            <p>However, households were split on whether it was a good time to buy, with a net 6 percent agreeing that it was a good time to buy.</p>
        
            <p>ASB said the survey took place during the election campaign, which was a time of "heightened uncertainty".</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand housing affordability remains woeful by any historical standard, but some hopeful Kiwis might be figuring that after a 16 percent peak-to-trough fall in prices and some decent wage growth, there won't be a better time to try and cobble together the cash for a deposit," it said.</p>
        
            <p>A net 28 percent expected a further increase in interest rates, but only 15 percent believed rates would fall.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest shift continues to be the number who expect rates to move sideways, up four-fold over the year-to-date," ASB said.</p>
        
            <p>"That tends to be the camp we're in too - while we don't anticipate any further OCR [official cash rate] hikes at this stage, we think it'll be at least another nine months before the RBNZ [Reserve Bank] is comfortable loosening policy up."</p>
