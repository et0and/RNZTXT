            <p>Global financial services firm JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) and Craigs Investment Partners (CIP) have formed a strategic partnership.</p>
        
            <p>"We've chosen to partner with CIP given their position as the leading private wealth investment firm in the New Zealand market and the alignment of both our organisations' goals and values," JP Morgan Australia and New Zealand chief executive Andrew Creber said.</p>
        
            <p>Craigs chief executive Simon Tong said the multi-year deal would help Craigs develop its investment offerings with direct access to JP Morgan's global network.</p>
        
            <p>"Craigs has a long history of being local but acting global and this is another example," Tong said.</p>
        
            <p>JP Morgan's Australia and New Zealand head of wholesale Mark Carlile said the collaboration will also benefit the global firm.</p>
        
            <p>"In turn, CIP will provide JPMAM with a strong, long-term partner to support New Zealand's growing wealth management segment. Our businesses complement each other, and we are excited for future collaboration and growth opportunities providing diversified, quality solutions to New Zealand investors," Carlile said.</p>
        
            <p>Craigs head of private wealth Jeremy Williamson said JP Morgan operated at the highest level of global investment.</p>
        
            <p>"The objective of the partnership is to further develop CIP's investment capabilities and insights by directly accessing JPMAM's global capabilities and expertise, which will benefit our clients, our advisers and our investment committee," Williamson said.</p>
