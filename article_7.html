        <h2>Transpower to consult on new North and South Island power link</h2>
        <p>
The Commerce Commission last month approved Transpower's near $400-million proposal to strengthen the national electricity grid.

            <p>Transpower is consulting with the energy sector to gauge demand for an undersea high voltage direct current link (HVDC) to connect the national grid between the North and South Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The Commerce Commission last month approved Transpower's near $400-million proposal to strengthen the national electricity grid.</p>
        
            <p>But the commission asked the national grid operator to consult with the industry to ensure the $103m investment in the Cook Strait undersea link would benefit consumers.</p>
        
            <p>Power customers will eventually pick-up the overall $392.9m cost to upgrade the national grid, though it will be up to the Electricity Authority to decide who pays for what.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower executive general manager grid development John Clarke said the existing Cook Strait cables would reach the end of their life in the early 2030s, so it was "timely" to consider future possibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"We are planning infrastructure now for a future where electricity powers more of our transport and more of our industry in New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"By 2050, we expect electricity use to have increased almost 70 percent compared to 2020, and we need to consider what role the HVDC link will play in that future."</p>
        
            <p>The cables connect the North and South Islands' electricity systems between Benmore in the South Island and Haywards in the North Island,</p>
        
            <p>Transpower said an upgraded HVDC would bring renewably generated electricity northwards from the south and support system stability into the future.</p>
