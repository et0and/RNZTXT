            <p>There's light at the end of the cost of living tunnel, though insurance costs are likely to remain high, an economist says.</p>
        
            <p>The country's biggest bank, ANZ, cut retail interest rates on Wednesday in the wake of softer than expected inflation numbers.</p>
        
            <p>It followed Westpac last week dropping its home loan interest rates after the Reserve Bank softened its stance on the outlook for the official cash rate.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ's chief economist Sharon Zollner told Morning Report consumer price index data suggested inflation would be back in the 1-3 percent target range.</p>
        
            <p>She predicted the Reserve Bank would start cutting the official cash rate by October or November.</p>
        
            <p>Recent interest rate moves by banks were pre-empting that, Zollner said.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course because most people are fixed it's not going to make an immediate difference to most people but there's light at the end of the tunnel."</p>
        
            <p>Most borrowers were sticking to short six or 12 month terms in anticipation of cuts, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a bad idea to split up your mortgage and put a bob each way, it sort of rules out nailing it, but it also rules out regretting it because you got it completely wrong."</p>
        
            <p>While council rates had likely peaked and rent levels for new tenancies were moving downward, insurance premiums would "continue to be a bugbear".</p>
        
            <p>"The Reserve Bank will focus on core inflation and sort of park those things that they can't do much about.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course people don't just buy core goods, they have to buy what they have to buy and insurance is a necessity, so it's ok for the Reserve Bank to say they'll look through it but it's harder for households," Zollner said.</p>
        
            <p>Loan Market director and mortgage broker Bruce Patten had clear advice for borrowers - stick to fixing for shorter periods.</p>
        
            <p>People shouldn't be sucked into the lower longer term rates, he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"The rates will come down, dont expect 2s or 3s but certainly by this time next year you would expect something in around the mid 5s.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything is pointing towards the fact that we're going to have lower rates... it'll happen this year it's just whether it happens before November."</p>
