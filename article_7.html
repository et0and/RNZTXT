        <h2>Banks warn of 'scams war'</h2>
        <p>
NZ's major banks are all Australian-owned - and the 'big four' across the Tasman say they are under constant cyber-attack that is costing consumers billions.

            <p>Australia's "big four" banks are under constant attack, says the National Australia Bank's executive for group investigations Chris Sheehan.</p>
        
            <p>"Every bank. Every bank is being attacked all the time."</p>
        
            <p>Australia's big four banks, it has been revealed, are being bombarded by cyber attacks every minute of every day, leaving customers increasingly vulnerable to scams.</p>
        
            <p>The attackers were trying to get into the banks' computer systems, deny services to customers, use malicious code or breach security logins.</p>
        
            <p>And the purpose of these attacks?</p>
        
            <p>"If it's not us being attacked, then our customers are being attacked, in an effort to steal their information and their money.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no typical demographic.</p>
        
            <p>"The entire community is at risk," Chris Sheehan told ABC's The World Today.</p>
        
            <p>Indeed, Chris Sheehan is blunt - it is warfare out there.</p>
        
            <p>"We're engaged in asymmetrical warfare on a day-by-day basis," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're dealing with threat actors of all different types.</p>
        
            <p>"From, being colloquial, Larry the loser, in the basement at home that's having a bit of a chop away at the laptop and trying to steal money from people or hack into a system, all the way to highly sophisticated, ruthless and resilient transnational organised crime groups and they're the ones that are driving 90 percent of the scams that are hitting Australian victims.</p>
        
            <p>"And then at the top end of the scale, we're dealing with nation-state actors, malicious nation-state actors.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's asymmetrical warfare.</p>
        
            <p>"It changes every day," Sheehan said.</p>
        
            <p>
Chris Sheehan says the NAB and most other major financial institutions have stopped including hyperlinks in official communications with customers.

            <p>Australians were being fleeced to the tune of $3 billion (NZ$3.3bn) a year by cyber criminals via scams, according to cyber security expert Troy Hunt.</p>
        
            <p>And while he was hesitant to label the attacks "warfare", he said the extent of the cyber attacks on Australia's financial institutions was not well understood by the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I imagine most people are not aware of how prevalent the online attacks are, probably in part because they don't have a sense of the fact these attacks do originate from all over the world, all sorts of different demographics are mounting them."</p>
        
            <p>"There are attacks online, attacks against individuals, attacks against corporations.</p>
        
            <p>"It really is prevalent," Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>He argued the exponential increase in cyber crime related to the perceived lower risk compared to, say, physically robbing a bank.</p>
        
            <p>The risk involved with engaging in cyber crimes was different for those in countries where it was unlikely the perpetrator could be extradited.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is totally different. And the reward's totally different as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not about grabbing cash out of a till, it's about potentially grabbing hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars in one go," Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>The result was that banks, including the NAB, worked hard on their cyber defences.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a call centre and an operations team focused on the frauds and scams issue that is close to 350 to 400 people - they're on the phone and available to our customers 24/7, 365 [days a year]," Sheehan said.</p>
        
            <p>Like other institutions, the NAB had also told customers it no longer sent text messages to customers with links, so if there was a link in a text message, the customer knew it was a scam.</p>
        
            <p>Sheehan conceded, though, that once a bank customer hit "send" on a scam payment, it was usually too late for the money to be recovered.</p>
        
            <p>"If it looks or sounds too good to be true, or if someone's applying pressure to you that you're going to miss out on something, or you're going to suffer a penalty, if you don't make that payment, they are massive red flags.</p>
        
            <p>"If the story you're being given, either by a text message, email, whatever, contains either of those elements, don't hit send on a payment, run a mile.</p>
        
            <p>"Seek advice from your bank, talk to friends or relatives, but don't hit send."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Banking Association, which represents the banking industry, agreed with the NAB that the nation's financial institutions were effectively at war.</p>
        
            <p>"We are amidst a scams war in this country," an Australian Banking Association spokesperson told the ABC.</p>
        
            <p>"Banks are working around the clock to protect Australians from scams and the industry will continue to invest record amounts in the latest scam-fighting technology to protect customers.</p>
        
            <p>"Extra safeguards from banks are helping to ensure less Australians are losing money to the international criminal gangs who run many scams."</p>
        
            <p>The ABA said Australian banks were known to have some of the strongest anti-scam protections in the world.</p>
