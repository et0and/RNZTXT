        <h2>New Plymouth Airport solar farm ready for take off</h2>
        <p>
The first phase of the project will see 14,400 solar panels installed generating enough power for 2000 homes for a year.

            <p>A 15-hectare solar farm project designed to make New Plymouth Airport energy self-sufficient is ready for take off.</p>
        
            <p>The first phase beginning next week will see 14,400 solar panels installed, generating up to 14,700 megawatt hours - or enough to power 2000 homes for a year.</p>
        
            <p>Chief Executive David Scott said as well as making the airport self-sufficient in sustainable energy the solar farm would provide an added income stream via the sale of surplus power.</p>
        
            <p>"It will also take more than 1500 tonnes of CO2 out of our atmosphere each year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The solar farm on farmland that New Plymouth Airport leases from NPDC will be a cost-effective and efficient power source with long-term benefits for the airport and the environment, and demonstrates our commitment to modern, eco-friendly facilities."</p>
        
            <p>Scott said the solar power facility would use the latest technologies that could be adapted to future developments in solar energy, withstand Taranaki's changeable weather and be used with developing EV charging systems.</p>
        
            <p>Puketapu HapÅ« manager Kelly Moeahu said it was proud to support the initiative.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only does it align with our values of environmental stewardship, but also contributes to the well-being and self-sufficiency of our community. This solar farm represents a positive step towards a sustainable future for our Puketapu Rohe and the wider Taranaki region."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand chief Sustainability and corporate affairs officer Kiri Hannifin applauded the project.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic to see New Plymouth Airport take a leadership position, growing renewable energy resources is critical for New Zealand's future. The entire aviation system needs to decarbonise and this is one step closer to that, well done."</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth District mayor Neil Holdom said it was exciting the project was getting underway - as it brought to life a commitment for the district and the region had to transition towards a low emissions future.</p>
        
            <p>"NPDC has been on the path to creating a cleaner, greener future for our Sustainable Lifestyle Capital through our Climate Action Framework and other sustainability initiatives, but we've also been working with others across Taranaki to look for new opportunities as an alternative to the gas and farming industries which we are so known for.</p>
        
            <p>"This venture being built on NPDC-owned land will serve as a major boost for sustainable energy in our district and encourage more players to invest."</p>
        
            <p>The solar farm was being constructed by Infratec New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>General manager Nick Bibby said the project would not only help decarbonise the electricity system, but was an excellent example of how well-designed projects could achieve both commercial and community objectives.</p>
        
            <p>"We are proud to be working with forward-thinking organisations such as New Plymouth Airport and its owners the NPDC to help achieve sustainable energy outcomes for future generations in the Taranaki region."</p>
