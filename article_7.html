            <p>Business confidence has fallen slightly but improving activity shows things are looking brighter.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ's survey for November showed general sentiment down 1 point to net 65 percent optimism, off the back of a ten year high the month before.</p>
        
            <p>But the more closely followed "own activity" measure was up 2 points to 48 percent optimism.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner said it was positive news.</p>
        
            <p>"As long as we don't get any more negative surprises from offshore, or that sort of thing, then things are looking up.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing a pretty broad-based improvement in both sentiment and activity, but it is off fairly low levels, and so it's going to feel like hard yards."</p>
        
            <p>Zollner said unemployment and business failures are likely to continue, given the economy is still very weak - but the tide is turning.</p>
        
            <p>She said confirmation of continued interest rate cuts was helping to cure business sentiment.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that is a positive for not just investment, but also employment. If firms are confident better times lie ahead, then they are more likely to take risk - whether that's making an investment or perhaps even just holding on to a staff member. That in itself could be a risky thing to do when your cash flow isn't where you need it to be.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing a lift, not just in the expectations of how the economy is going to go, but firms' own activity, investment, employment, profitability. Across the board things are improving, so that is a pretty clear signal that better things lie ahead."</p>
        
            <p>Zollner said businesses are also feeling better about getting credit during the next 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>She said although times were not easy, both firms and household balance sheets were in a better position than during the global financial crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"The price of credit is one thing, but the availability of it is also absolutely crucial, so this does suggest that the availability of credit is not expected to be a constraint.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not suggesting at all there isn't a lot of stress out there, but it doesn't look like the economy as a whole needs a lot of balance sheet repair before we can get back into action again, so I think that is also a pretty positive sign."</p>
