            <p>The Warehouse Group has dropped its full-year earnings outlook with falling consumer demand and mild winter weather adding to the challenges facing the retailer.</p>
        
            <p>"Retail across New Zealand is under pressure, and we are no exception," interim chief executive John Journee said.</p>
        
            <p>"Market conditions and cost of living pressures have continued to be challenging into our fourth quarter and we expect these conditions to continue through to our year end."</p>
        
            <p>Journee has taken the interim role after the departure of Nick Grayston, who had been brought in to turn the company's fortunes around in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>He said the company was taking decisive action to address areas it could improve.</p>
        
            <p>"We are exercising tighter cost control and we have a laser focus on trading our core brands, The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery and Noel Leeming."</p>
        
            <p>The group expected full-year sales from continuing operations to be between 6 percent and 7 percent down on last year's result.</p>
        
            <p>Underlying profit was expected to be in a range of $22 million to $30m, compared to $83.4m in the prior year, excluding the loss from discontinued operations and any potential restructuring costs.</p>
        
            <p>Continuing operations excluded Torpedo7, which it recently sold for $1, but included results from online channel TheMarket.com which was to be closed on Monday after failure to find a buyer.</p>
        
            <p>In January, The Warehouse posted a nearly $24m first half loss.</p>
