            <p>Food prices are 6 percent higher than a year ago, but were cheaper in November than October.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ said cheaper fruit and vegetables were the main reason for the 0.2 percent fall in November's food prices compared to the previous month.</p>
        
            <p>The annual increase was mostly driven by higher prices for fresh eggs, lollies and peanuts. Restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food were the second largest contributor.</p>
        
            <p>Other selected price indexes indicated a 0.1 percent monthly increase in alcoholic beverages and tobacco, with an annual increase of 8.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Petrol fell 2.2 percent month-on-month, but was up nearly 11 percent on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Rental housing also fell slightly in November by 0.2 percent month-on-month, but was up 5.5 percent on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Prices also fell slightly in October, led by a drop in most grocery and fresh food items.</p>
        
            <p>Prices fell 0.9 percent that month compared with September. Despite the monthly fall, prices were 6.3 percent higher than a year earlier, Stats NZ said.</p>
