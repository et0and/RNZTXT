            <p>BNZ says its online banking service is back online after an outage on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second outage this weekend, following another on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>More than 300 people reported that they couldn't access BNZ between 9am and 12.30pm today.</p>
        
            <p>Customers expressed their frustration on social media, saying the recurring outages were not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>Kia ora Jjengar, we apologise for any inconvenience caused by this. Although issues were resolved as of 19:12 yesterday we are now dealing with further outages. We do not have an ETA for a fix at this time. To keep up to date please view our status pagehttps://t.co/ZdX4Vf0yoQ</p>
        
            <p>BNZ said some customers might still have issues logging in.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to 1News earlier on Sunday, a BNZ spokesperson said the bank was affected by an outage as a result of an issue experienced by a network provider.</p>
        
            <p>It apologised to customers for any inconvenience.</p>
