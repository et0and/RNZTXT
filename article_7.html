            <p>Concerning differences between the KiwiSaver contributions of men and women have been exposed in new research from Te Ara Ahunga Ora The Retirement Commission.</p>
        
            <p>The report revealed a 36 percent gap between the amount men and women are putting into KiwiSaver each year.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ara Ahunga Ora policy lead Dr Michelle Reyers said KiwiSaver balance inequalities were outpacing the actual gender pay gap.</p>
        
            <p>She said men and women are contributing the same percentage of their salaries, but women were disadvantaged by working part-time and taking greater care responsibilities, which were unpaid.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing the impact of women being in part-time rather than full-time positions, and all of that is really contributing to the gap being a lot bigger than the hourly rate of 9 percent," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The research also highlighted ethnic pay gaps which saw lower KiwiSaver contribution amounts for M훮ori and Pacific peoples.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are M훮ori or Pacific, you are likely to have around $1500 less contributed into your KiwiSaver account annually than a European person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>However, M훮ori have the second highest average employee contribution rate of the ethnic groups reported in this research, despite having the lowest average income.</p>

            <p>The data highlighted the sizeable impact of ethnic and gender pay gaps on New Zealanders' abilities to prepare adequately for retirement.</p>
        
            <p>It is already known that M훮ori, Pacific Peoples and women are more likely to be reliant on NZ Super in retirement due to lower savings and investments.</p>
        
            <p>Retirement Commissioner Jane Wrightson is calling on employers to take a careful look at their current KiwiSaver policies and whether they have their employees' best interests at heart.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment we're not seeing employers show the initiative we'd hope to see," Jane Wrightson said.</p>
        
            <p>"One in three employees already contribute at a rate higher than the 3 percent minimum. Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of employers contribute more than the compulsory 3 percent, and almost half include KiwiSaver contributions in total earnings for some or all of their employees, which can disincentivise employees to contribute.</p>
        
            <p>"If we want to see change, I think we need to see a more proactive attitude across the board from employers. We all have a stake in New Zealand's future and there are concerns that people may not be saving enough for retirement, so we need to be taking practical steps to tackle these issues."</p>
        
            <p>Reyers said it was pleasing to see the Australian government taking steps to address the retirement savings gap for women.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped similar measures could be introduced on this side of the Tasman to support women on paid parental leave by paying superannuation on the paid leave.</p>
