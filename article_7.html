            <p>The fact that about half the population is saving for retirement despite the current cost-of-living crisis shows how resilient people are, the Retirement Commission says.</p>
        
            <p>New research gathered by the commission found more than half of the 3000 survey respondents described their financial position as "uncomfortable".</p>
        
            <p>Women were feeling it more - as were young people aged between 18-35, the commission's personal finance lead Tom Hartmann said.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation of financial discomfort for women has significantly worsened â€¦ since 2022, it's gone from 51 percent to 60 percent and 64 percent of women report feeling financial stress," Hartmann told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite concerning to see so many New Zealanders struggling financially but it's good to see those who manage to still actively save for the long-term."</p>
        
            <p>The research showed it was half the population saving for retirement and setting long-term financial goals, increasing from 54 percent in 2022 to 59 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Being able to do so despite having money worries showed the resilience people had in this area, Hartmann said.</p>
        
            <p>Survey results also showed Kiwis - particularly those ages 18-34 and Pasifika - were trying to reduce their debt products over time.</p>
        
            <p>Many people - 76 percent - were also choosing to save for big ticket items rather than go into debt to purchase them.</p>
