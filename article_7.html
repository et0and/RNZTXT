            <p>Casino operator SkyCity has reached a settlement with the Department of Internal Affairs over breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.</p>
        
            <p>The settlement includes an admission of guilt and a penalty of nearly $4.2 million.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity admitted to breaches from 2018 to 2023, and said they largely related to historical matters.</p>
        
            <p>The agreement is subject to approval by the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, SkyCity agreed a near $74m settlement with Australian authorities for breaches of anti-money laundering laws at its Adelaide casino.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Internal Affairs proceedings began in February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>SkyCity executive chair Julian Cook said regulators in Australia and New Zealand were "rightly holding SkyCity to account".</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past few years, considerable progress has been made towards upgrading our anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing systems," Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"This does not lessen the seriousness with which we take these breaches and we are disappointed that SkyCity is in this position."</p>
        
            <p>Cook said it took its responsibilities in combating money laundering and terrorism financing "seriously".</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of the SkyCity Board and management team, I accept and apologise for these long standing failings," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have fallen short of the standards we should hold ourselves to, alongside failing to meet the expectations of our regulators, customers, shareholders and the communities we are part of.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to, and have begun, delivering the level of change that is required to meet these expectations."</p>
        
            <p>With two regularotary matters now settled, SkyCity continued to face the threat of a temporary suspension of its local casino licence for alleged breaches of the host responsibility code.</p>
