            <p>KiwiRail is delaying the re-opening of a major section of Auckland's rail line by an extra two months to complete rebuild work.</p>
        
            <p>The track between Papakura and Pukekohe in south Auckland has been closed since September 2022 to complete a $419 million project to extend overhead electricity.</p>
        
            <p>It was set to re-open to commuters by the end of this year, but now it has been pushed back until mid-January 2025, after the Christmas network-wide closure, to complete KiwiRail's upgrade and renewals work.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail chief asset development officer David Gordon said the work would avoid major inconvenience down the track and would enable a more reliable and frequent service.</p>
        
            <p>"It just makes sense to get the rebuild work done before the line between Papakura and Pukekohe reopens to commuter trains," Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>"To start these new services only to have to stop them again at a later date would be more frustrating and create unnecessary disruption."</p>
        
            <p>The current electrification work will be completed on time, and work to rebuild the line will begin in May.</p>
        
            <p>That will involve removing the existing tracks and replacing the ageing foundations.</p>
        
            <p>Franklin Councillor and AT board director Andy Baker supported the work being brought forward.</p>
        
            <p>"During my time on the AT board I've seen a lot of benefits of taking a 'dig-once' approach to projects where you get in and do the job right from the get-go so you don't muck communities around with multiple disruptions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Bus replacements between the Pukekohe and Papakura stations continue.</p>
