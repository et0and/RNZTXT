            <p>Grocery consumer advocates want the Commerce Commission to have greater powers to force more supermarket competition.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the commission's first annual report into competition in the grocery sector since the appointment of Grocery Commissioner Pierre van Heerden is published.</p>
        
            <p>The report painted a concerning picture of the $25 billion grocery sector, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Supermarket margins have increased, profits remained high and the two main operators, Foodstuffs and Woolworths, remained dominant, van Heerden said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to see more competition and sustained pressure on the major supermarkets to deliver better outcomes for consumers."</p>
        
            <p>Grocery Action Group chair Sue Chetwin told Midday Report The Warehouse selling more groceries and Costco opening in Auckland has brought some competition - but not enough.</p>
        
            <p>"We applaud the report, but what we'd like to see is more action, and the regulator being given more tools to create more competition," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Chetwin worried if the commission simply slapped supermarkets with fines for not changing their ways, consumers would end up paying for them.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't imagine that the duopoly are going to suck those up, they're just going to pass them on to consumers," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What we really need is more competition."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths said it had strived to give better value for its consumers, and in the past year had been losing money on some sales with its profits more than halved.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs, behind the New World, Pak'n Save and Four Square brands, said it supported the commission's vision for a more competitive, transparent and fair grocery market.</p>
        
            <p>Van Heerden recently criticised supermarkets for pricing errors, saying New Zealanders were likely losing tens of millions of dollars a year.</p>
        
            <p>And last month he said the Grocery Supply Code was not working properly.</p>
        
            <p>In February, a new tool was launched for whistleblowers to help lift the lid on potential anti-competitive behaviour in the grocery sector.</p>
