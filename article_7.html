            <p>Some of computing giant Apple's services went offline on Thursday, including for customers in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Apple TV+, the App Store and Apple Music were all down in the US, Reuters reported. RNZ was unable to access the App Store, met with a message: "Cannot connect. Something went wrong. Please try again."</p>
        
            <p>Other services such as Apple TV+ would open, but not play any content.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of outage reports were made to website-tracking service DownDetector just after 11am (NZ time). Some users reported being unable to sign in, with Apple telling them their accounts did not exist.</p>
        
            <p>Apple's own system status page at 12.30pm showed outages for parts of the App Store and its podcast service.</p>
        
            <p>Tech site The Verge said users of less well-known Apple services like TestFlight and Apple Business Manager were also having issues.</p>
        
            <p>By 12.45pm, Apple said all the outages had been resolved bar its Developer ID notary service.</p>
        
            <p>It came just hours after messaging service Whatsapp, owned by Meta, had a global outage.</p>
