            <p>Former prime minister Sir John Key is retiring as the chair of ANZ New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The bank said Sir John would also retire as a director of its Australian parent, ANZ Group, effective from the middle of next month.</p>
        
            <p>He was appointed chair of ANZ New Zealand in January 2018 and joined the group board the following month.</p>
        
            <p>Sir John was New Zealand's prime minister between 2008 and 2016.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ has appointed Scott St John as the new chair of its New Zealand division, to succeed Sir John.</p>
        
            <p>St John is the chair of Mercury Energy and Fisher and Paykel Healthcare</p>
        
            <p>Sir John said he was "proud" to have helped make ANZ "a better company".</p>
        
            <p>"While it's the right time for me to step back on my commitments, I know ANZ is in a strong position and that Scott St John will be an outstanding chair of ANZ New Zealand and director of ANZ Group."</p>
        
            <p>ANZ Group chair Paul O'Sullivan said Sir John's "unparalleled" business and political experience played a "critical role" in the bank's success.</p>
        
            <p>"As a board we will miss his wise counsel, global insights and good humour and we wish him and his family the very best for the future."</p>
