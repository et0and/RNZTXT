            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has confirmed some jobs could be "significantly impacted" by a change proposal kicking off on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>But it has stopped short of confirming whether more roles could be disestablished.</p>
        
            <p>So far it has already announced nearly 350 jobs are gone, or are proposed to go.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday it will begin consulting on proposed changes to Te Whakatairanga Service Delivery's Market Integrity branch, which "delivers world leading regulation to protect the fairness and integrity of markets in Aotearoa New Zealand", branch general manager Sanjai Raj said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are proposing some changes to how the Market Integrity branch is structured and to the way we deliver our services for the public of Aotearoa New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those who are in positions that are proposed to be significantly impacted by the proposed change have been invited to meet with their people leaders for individual meetings on Monday, Tuesday and possibly Wednesday of this week."</p>

            <p>A spokesperson told RNZ they could not "confirm disestablished roles" until the change process is completed.</p>
        
            <p>It follows rolling job cuts at MBIE, with some announced earlier this year before Finance Minister Nicola Willis' directive to slash costs.</p>
        
            <p>Others happened during a round of voluntary redundancies in March.</p>
        
            <p>In May, the ministry said it had accepted further voluntary redundancies, bringing its total job losses up to 341 full-time positions.</p>
        
            <p>Further reductions were also on the cards in the Digital, Data and Insights Group, subject to a consultation process, a spokesperson had previously told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>More than 6000 jobs have gone from the public sector, or are proposed to go, as part of Willis' cost-cutting measures.</p>
