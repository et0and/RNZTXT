            <p>MediaWorks says it will look to redeploy any staff facing redundancy to other areas of its radio business.</p>
        
            <p>MediaWorks owns well-known radio stations, including MaiFM, MoreFM, The Breeze, The Edge, and The Rock.</p>
        
            <p>The company is proposing job cuts for the second year in a row, after reporting a net loss last year, before significant items and tax, of more than $14m.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the company said: "The proposals have included changes of reporting lines, the disestablishment of some roles and the creation of new roles.</p>
        
            <p>"If roles are confirmed as disestablished we will also explore redeployment options in other areas of the business."</p>
        
            <p>The company needed to meet customers' needs and adapt to the changing market.</p>
        
            <p>It would not be commenting further while working through the proposals, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>MediaWorks posted a net after-tax loss of $107.1m after an impairment of $86.5m in May.</p>
        
            <p>Last October, it released its audited financial statements, along with notes from the auditor, PwC, warning of "material uncertainty".</p>
        
            <p>It had made a net loss of nearly $126m, with liabilities exceeding assets by $19.4m.</p>
        
            <p>The auditor said there was "significant doubt" about whether MediaWorks could continue to operate beyond June 2025, given its bank financing arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>"The ability of the group to support its ongoing operations over the forecast period to 30 June 2025 is dependent on a successful renegotiation of its lending terms with the lenders including revised facility limits and covenants and to meet the terms of any revised agreements ongoing," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"These events and conditions along with the other matters… indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern."</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, MediaWorks cut dozens of jobs and abruptly closed its new station, Today FM, in an effort to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>In September, Whakaata Māori also confirmed there would be job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>In August, TVNZ reported a loss of $85m against a $1.7m profit the year before, driven by a $62m write down in asset values, which were not specified, and a $39m drop in revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Warner Bros Discovery New Zealand also closed its news operation Newshub in July, following a $138.2m after-tax loss for the 12 months ended December 2023, compared to a $34.9m loss in 2022.</p>
