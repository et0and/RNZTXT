            <p>A major labour hire and recruitment firm with more than 1000 workers has gone into receivership.</p>
        
            <p>Two specialists from accounting firm Deloitte, David Webb and Robert Campbell, have been appointed receivers for five companies in the ELE group.</p>
        
            <p>"The appointment was made at the request of the companies' director, following efforts to seek additional investment and a sale of the business and/or assets," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The receivers said they were working to get in touch with all those who were affected and expected to have a better picture on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>ELE recruited staff in New Zealand and overseas for the building, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors, and also offered refrigerated transport and freight services, through a subsidiary.</p>
        
            <p>The five companies put into receivership were: ELE Holdings Limited, ELE Management Limited, ELE Limited, Tranzport Solutions Limited, and RISQ New Zealand Limited. A sixth company, ELE Security Limited, was not in receivership and was continuing to trade.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to some customers Campbell wrote: "We are mindful of the many employees whose employment was required to be terminated".</p>
        
            <p>ELE's sole director is Brent Mulholland, who lives in Tauranga, according to Companies Office records. The group had more than 10 offices around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, First Union said around 500 migrant workers were affected by the receivership, and it called on the government to come to the workers' aid.</p>
        
            <p>General secretary Dennis Maga said the affected workers were on temporary visas and it wanted the immigration rules changed to allow them to get jobs with other accredited construction firms.</p>
        
            <p>"This would be a welcoming Christmas gift to these workers, and this move would alleviate their fear of losing jobs while their families struggle in their countries of origin."</p>
        
            <p>He said a review of the construction industry's labour practices was needed. Hundreds of migrant builders had been recruited from overseas but have ended up without jobs, he said.</p>
