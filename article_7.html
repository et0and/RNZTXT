            <p>Debt laden dairy company Synlait Milk will raise close to $218 million from its two main shareholders to preserve its future.</p>
        
            <p>It revealed details of its desperately needed equity raise after the close of markets on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait's two major shareholders have committed to pay well above its recent market price to ensure its survival.</p>
        
            <p>Major shareholder Bright Dairy of China will supply the bulk of the money, $185m, buying new shares at 60 cents each - double the recent market price. That would lift its stake to just over 65 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Synlait's major customer A2 Milk will invest nearly $33m, at 43 cents a share, a 43 percent premium to the recent price, preserving the size of its near 20 percent stake.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait chair George Adams said the company's future depended on the deal being approved.</p>
        
            <p>"If the resolutions are not passed, it's likely Synlait would need to cease trading and initiate a formal insolvency process," Adams said.</p>
        
            <p>The proposal, which excludes any participation from other shareholders, had been carefully thought through and was Synlait's best option, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The selected equity raise structure provides the greatest certainty of reducing Synlait's debt in the shortest timeframe and at a more favourable price than alternative structures."</p>
        
            <p>The proposal is conditional on Synlait refinancing its bank debt, and settling its dispute with A2 Milk.</p>
        
            <p>Bright Dairy and A2 Milk cannot vote to approve the share issue to themselves, but have committed to supporting the issue to the other party.</p>
        
            <p>An independent report said the share raising proposal was better than the alternatives and ultimately in the interests of the other minority shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait managed a crucial debt payment after Bright Dairy agreed to pay $130m, and has just reached a conditional settlement with A2 Milk over a disputed supply and manufacturing contract for infant formula.</p>
