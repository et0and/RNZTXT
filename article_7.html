        <h2>Commercial property increasingly popular with investors</h2>
        <p>
Commercial property is offering higher returns than residential properties.

            <p>Commercial property has become increasingly popular with Mum and Dad investors, offering higher returns than residential properties.</p>
        
            <p>
There have been been price corrections of up to 25- 30 percent in some areas, Rethink Group said.

            <p>Rethink Group chief executive Scott O'Neill said there were compelling reasons for investors to favour commercial over residential property, which had seen a cooling off in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said deals were few and far between with many would-be commercial property investors chasing high-yielding opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a pretty tightly held market. There's been price corrections of up to 25- to 30 percent in some areas, and that's creating the value we see now," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And obviously thousands of other investors are seeing the same value."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Property Council New Zealand's 2024 report valued the commercial property sector at $350 billion with a forecast to grow to $399.5b this year, with an annual 3.72 percent growth rate through to 2029.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast O'Neill said recent Real Estate Institute data indicated only a slight 1.7 percent rise in median house prices, but still down on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>"More investors are moving towards long-term, stable returns in commercial property, with favourable lease agreements across multiple sectors, as highlighted in the New Zealand State of Commercial Real Estate Leasing Report 2024," O'Neill said.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition to these trends, factors like lower interest rates, tax advantages, and strong economic performance are driving investor confidence.</p>
        
            <p>"For Australian investors, New Zealand's market offers a seamless extension of their property investment experience."</p>
        
            <p>O'Neill said growth areas included the main centres and region hubs like Tauranga, Hamilton and Dunedin, which offered high yields at low entry costs.</p>
