            <p>Job ads fell in most industries and regions last month with a large increase in the number of people applying for work.</p>
        
            <p>The latest BNZ-Seek employment report shows a near 5 percent fall in the number of job ads on the Seek website in May on April, which had a similar level of decline.</p>
        
            <p>The number of ads fell more than 30 percent on a year ago to the lowest level in eight years, outside of the Covid-19 lockdowns.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an incredibly tough labour market at the moment, and Seek data reflects that, with declining ad volumes in most regions and in all sectors," country manager Rob Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>The construction sector led the monthly decline in jobs ads with a 12 percent month-on-month drop in engineering roles.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast, call centre and customer service roles rose 2 percent, while sales roles were up 1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there have been major cuts to the public sector and in May this was mostly felt outside the major metro regions, with a 7 percent decline in regional public sector roles month-on-month," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"Applications per job ad, which measures competition among candidates for vacant roles, did not grow or decline in May and remain exceptionally high," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is particularly true for roles in manufacturing, transport and logistics, construction and trades and services."</p>
        
            <p>The number of people applying for each position was up nearly 70 percent on a year ago.</p>
