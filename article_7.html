            <p>Ryan Bridge is first in line to be the new host of Newstalk ZB's 5am to 6am Early Edition morning show, Stuff understands.</p>
        
            <p>Bridge, who hosted Three's AM Show from 2021 to 2023, was slated to have his own 7pm current affairs show at the commercial broadcaster starting later this year.</p>
        
            <p>That show was axed, however, along with the entire Newshub operation earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>It seems he has quickly moved on, with Stuff learning negotiations are under way with Newstalk ZB's parent company NZME.</p>
        
            <p>Bridge declined to comment when contacted by Stuff, saying: "I think sometimes it's best just to keep your mouth shut at times like this."</p>
        
            <p>Bridge has considerable experience in radio, having served as a business reporter on RNZ's Morning Report, and hosted the drive show on Magic Talk, which later became Today FM, before joining The AM Show.</p>
        
            <p>Kate Hawkesby left Early Edition at the end of 2023 after six years in the hosting seat, during which time Jason Winstanley, chief audio officer at NZME, said the show had been "number one in every survey, including reaching 38 percent total New Zealand share at the end of 2021".</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for NZME told Stuff, Hawkesby had not been replaced "as yet" and that they could not confirm Bridge was joining Newstalk ZB.</p>
