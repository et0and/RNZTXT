            <p>Businesses on Auckland's waterfront say they are cautiously optimistic about Wynyard Crossing Bridge being operational again.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council has reassured its development agency Eke Panuku is rectifying "minor teething issues" after the bridge malfunctioned twice since re-opening on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Eke Panuku confirmed the bridge was temporarily shut on Tuesday evening to investigate a sensor issue but is now running again in line with its current operating hours of 7.30am-11.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said it also closed the bridge for about 15 minutes on Monday morning due to a technical error.</p>
        
            <p>The pedestrian bridge, which raises and lowers its span to allow boats to pass, had been closed for most of 2024 for major repairs.</p>

            <p>Pedestrians had to walk for 20 minutes or take a ferry to get to Wynyard Quarter bars and restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>Wynyard Pavilion general manager Alex Pearson said Friday was the venue's biggest day since last summer.</p>
        
            <p>Pearson said the city's North Wharf was full of people the weekend after the bridge opened.</p>
        
            <p>"When the bridge is up for boats to come through, there are hundreds of people waiting on either side.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been amazing for all the businesses down here."</p>
        
            <p>He was confident technical faults would be resolved.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like just some small faults and they seem to be fixing it as fast as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"If they expect any major faults it would be great to get some communication from them but so far so good.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to act positive."</p>
        
            <p>But the general manager of The Conservatory Daniel Toldeo said the bridge's reduced operating hours meant it still was not business as usual.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen an increase in foot traffic which is very positive.</p>
        
            <p>"But because the bridge is not fully open, people are leaving by 10pm or 10.15pm to catch the ferry or get to the bridge before it closes."</p>
        
            <p>Toledo said in previous years when the bridge was open 24 hours a day, their patrons would stay until midnight.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped all technical issues would be resolved in time for Sail GP in January.</p>

The Wynyard Bridge was still undergoing testing on 12 December and closed off to foot traffic.

            <p>"If it continues breaking down, I don't know if it will be very good for confidence. But we're hoping for the best."</p>
        
            <p>Eke Panuku said the bridge would operate 24/7 once they were confident technical issues had been ironed out.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was prioritising the safety of all users.</p>
        
            <p>It cost around $10.6 million to fix the bridge, according to an update from Eke Panuku in October.</p>
        
            <p>The $3.7m bridge was built in 2011, and designed to only have a short, five-year lifespan.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby the bridge, the Karanga Plaza steps had also had a makeover, being converted into an open-air harbourside pool.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown said the free-to-use seawater pool equipped with four roped lanes, a jumping platform, and changing facilities, would open on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said the thirty-three-metre-long swimming area cost $500,000.</p>
        
            <p>He said he asked Eke Panuku earlier this year to investigate a potential swimming area in the city centre harbour.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said because the steps were already a popular spot for people to swim and jump into the water it made sense to develop it into a safer dedicated pool.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea was to develop a safe, affordable, lightweight structure to test the appeal of lap swimming in the city centre harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Utilising existing pontoons helped keep the costs down, and it's a good example of doing things better, faster, and cheaper."</p>
        
            <p>He said the pool's water quality would be closely monitored and tested with live updates shared on SafeSwim's website.</p>
        
            <p>He said the pool was a step toward transforming the northern end of Wynyard Point from an industrial area into a large-scale green space.</p>
        
            <p>"Aucklanders elected me to make the most of our harbours and environment, which is one of my top-five priorities.</p>
        
            <p>"This new harbour pool is part of a much bigger piece of work that will see more of Auckland's prime waterfront transformed into vibrant public spaces for everyone to enjoy."</p>
        
            <p>The regeneration of Wynyard Point had been allocated $119m in the Auckland Council's long-term plan.</p>
