            <p>The site that was home to the Smithfield meat plant in Timaru for nearly 140 years is now on the market.</p>
        
            <p>Alliance Group confirmed the closure of the 139-year-old site and 600 jobs to go with it in October, due to the country's declining livestock numbers and weaker demand for red-meat in markets like China.</p>

            <p>A month later, the farmer-owned co-operative reported a net loss after tax of $95.8 million in the year to September - $51m of which went towards the costs of shutting down the Timaru site and redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>The 32.4 hectare industrial and rural site bordered the Showgrounds retail complex on Bridge Street just north of Timaru.</p>
        
            <p>"The historic Smithfield meat processing plant has been a major icon in this growth location and is now offered to the market for definite sale," the Colliers real estate listing read.</p>
        
            <p>It said Alliance had largely de-commissioned the meat works operation.</p>

            <p>Three titles included buildings with cold storage, and service infrastructure like "huge" high power supply and water take, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"A small, protected WW2 observation bunker adds some character to the coastal edge," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Its deadline private treaty sale will close on 26 March.</p>
        
            <p>The farmer-owned co-op reported a $70m loss after tax in the year to September 2023, a serious dive on the year before's $73.6m profit, which prompted the co-op to ask its shareholders to help raise capital.</p>
        
            <p>It then hired Craigs Investment Partners to explore external capital raise options.</p>
