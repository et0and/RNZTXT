            <p>New data shows luxury property sales across the country have dropped by more than 50 percent in the last four years.</p>
        
            <p>Statistics from the Real Estate Institute reveal only 152 properties valued at $5 million dollars or more were sold across New Zealand last year - a figure down 55 percent from 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Luxury sales in Auckland dropped by 14 percent in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Other regions like the Queenstown Lakes District saw a 91 percent increase in sales between 2023 and 2024, and sales in the Bay of Plenty rose 20 percents in the same period.</p>
        
            <p>Paterson Luxury Real Estate's Caleb Paterson said they had seen a number of luxury properties brought onto the market, only to be withdrawn a few months later due to a lack of interest.</p>
        
            <p>"The figures show a considerable shift in regional demand with Queenstown and Bay of Plenty picking up a share of the very top end of the residential market, potentially at the expense of Auckland," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While the $5 million plus market makes up only around one percent of the total market, this could represent a noticeable migration of wealth out of the country's commercial centre.</p>
        
            <p>"If we are seeing signs of an exodus from Auckland or simply a sharp increase in the number of high net worth families populating regional New Zealand from overseas or other parts of the country, a wealth transfer of this level may have repercussions for businesses in all three regions, particularly if it continues on its current trajectory."</p>
        
            <p>Paterson said while the last quarter of 2024 saw the lowest volume of sales, early indications suggest a resurgence of ultra-premium property sales in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking at our current listings, every single property has had an increase in engagement and viewing over the past month."</p>
