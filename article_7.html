            <p>Twenty years ago $1 could buy you one litre of petrol, half a block of butter and a sizeable bag of mixed lollies from the local dairy.</p>
        
            <p>And if you were alive in 1969, a litre of milk, one dozen eggs and around 3kgs of sugar all cost less than $1.</p>
        
            <p>In 2024, after two years of high inflation, peaking at just over seven percent in 2022, First Up decided to find out how far a gold coin can stretch.</p>
        
            <p>One man who had just paid for his groceries at a West Auckland fruit and vege shop said nothing in his trolley was that cheap.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing in here for a dollar."</p>
        
            <p>Next door, the manger at Aussie Butcher looked a bit confused when asked what can a gold coin could buy at his store.</p>
        
            <p>"A bone, that's about all."</p>
        
            <p>And at a seafood shop in Henderson a dollar would not fetch much, but at least you won't walk away empty handed.</p>
        
            <p>The shop assistant told First Up , $1 could buy "a couple mussels" or "a very small piece of gurnard".</p>
        
            <p>Next stop was the local bakery, turned out there was nothing available for $1.</p>
        
            <p>The man behind the counter said the cheapest item he had was $2.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have to be very generous to offer you something for a dollar."</p>
        
            <p>But asking nicely paid off.</p>
        
            <p>Small bread rolls were priced at six for $3 and he was happy to sell a single one for $1.</p>

            <p>Nearby at Zeki's Cafe, a quick scan of the food cabinet showed everything cost well above a dollar.</p>
        
            <p>However, the barista was keen to help and offered one piece of Turkish dollar in exchange for a gold coin.</p>
        
            <p>Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said the price of butter was an example of the effects of inflation.</p>
        
            <p>"A dollar just doesn't go as far anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"If you think back to 40 years ago, a dollar would buy a block of butter 20 years ago, you'd get half a block, ten years ago, you'd get a quarter of a block. Now you're going to get 15 percent of a block."</p>

            <p>The New Zealand $1 coin was introduced in 1991, and since then, it has halved in value.</p>
        
            <p>"Roughly speaking, it'd be worth $2 you'd be getting twice as much stuff for your money back then than you do today," Eaqub said.</p>
        
            <p>But don't underestimate the power of the gold coin just yet.</p>
        
            <p>According to a shop assistant at Dollar Dealers, it could be exchanged for something priceless.</p>
        
            <p>A shelf in one corner of the shop was lined with hundreds of DVDs, selling for $1 each.</p>
        
            <p>"We get customers that just come in for our DVDs on a daily basis."</p>
        
            <p>Of course the supermarket was a great source of $1 deals. A 400 gram tin of tomatoes was only 92 cents when First Up visited.</p>
        
            <p>At the pick n mix bins, $1 got you about 37 raw almonds, or three dried apricots.</p>
        
            <p>As for apples - one Granny Smith was about 75c.</p>

            <p>And while one loose bread roll cost about $1.50, you could get lucky with a Snickers bar on special for just one gold dollar coin.</p>
        
            <p>But, as economist Shamubeel Eaqub said, it was not possible to survive on $1/ day, in New Zealand, in 2024.</p>
