        <h2>The Warehouse buyout could boost competition, grocery commissioner says</h2>
        <p>
A proposed acquisition of The Warehouse Group is an interesting development, says Pierre van Heerden.
</p>
        
            <p>A bid to take over The Warehouse Group could help rein in New Zealand's supermarket duopoly, the grocery commissioner says.</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse has been approached by founder Sir Stephen Tindall and a private equity firm about a potential buyout that could position the company as a third player in the supermarket industry.</p>
        
            <p>Grocery Commissioner Pierre van Heerden says he's keeping a close eye on the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"We are watching it with interest because we would welcome any competition in the market that increases competition at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>The grocery regime has been set up to ensure new players, or existing small players, can have a fair go at competition in the industry, van Heerden said.</p>
        
            <p>He said issues with suppliers would be dealt with quickly but the Commission needed to know where to look.</p>
        
            <p>Grocery retailers can't put pressure on suppliers and there is an anonymous supporting tool in place for reporting this, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What that gives me, is it gives me the ability for the team to get in and ask specific of the retailers and delve down to find the issue."</p>
        
            <p>Good competition was expected but needed to be fair, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be looking at it very carefully and ensuring that all our powers are used."</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse had sites, staff, shelving and logistical systems in place "so it does certainly make sense".</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment they've got around 9000 products that they supply but that's really for the top up shop, it's not the main shop.</p>
        
            <p>"What we would really love to see is more competition on the main shop and I believe they do have the capability to do that but then again, as you say, there's a lot of water to go under the bridge."</p>
