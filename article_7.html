        <h2>‘Disaster’ - Tauranga’s marine precinct sale $4m below value</h2>
        <p>
Tauranga City Council sold the precinct for $13.987m to a developer who proposed transforming it into a "premier superyacht refit destination".

            <p>The sale of Tauranga's marine precinct for at least $4 million below its valuation is a "disaster waiting to happen", says a local business owner.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council sold the precinct at Sulphur Point for $13.987m to Christchurch developer Sam Rolfe.</p>
        
            <p>The 2.98-hectare precinct, also known as Vessel Works, was valued between $18.63m and $19.24m and is zoned for port industry.</p>
        
            <p>Some sites within the precinct are already privately owned.</p>
        
            <p>Rolfe approached the council in late 2023 with a proposal to buy the precinct with a vision of it becoming a "premier superyacht refit destination".</p>
        
            <p>The sale conditions meant most working boat operators would have to relocate from their precinct berths.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the sale, the council also agreed to fund up to $29.2m to develop an alongside wharf and replace the existing Bridge Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>The decision - made under the Government-appointed commission - has been criticised by precinct users and newly elected councillors.</p>
        
            <p>At an extraordinary council meeting on Wednesday, marine precinct users aired their frustrations over the "unconscionable" sale and being forced to leave the precinct.</p>
        
            <p>Erika Harvey, who owns a fishing business with her family, told the meeting the sale wasn't just "a bad deal", it was a "disaster waiting to happen".</p>
        
            <p>"The public is paying while the private owner profits.</p>
        
            <p>"You've justified this by promising superyachts will bring in wealth, based on pretty pictures and a vision … but the math doesn't add up," said Harvey.</p>

            <p>The council's projections showed each super yacht visit would contribute between $70,000 to $100,000 to the local economy, Harvey said.</p>
        
            <p>"The existing marine industry, which you're pushing out, workboats, logistic vessels and fishing boats, contributes well over $100m annually right now.</p>
        
            <p>"You're ready to sacrifice that for a speculative luxury industry.</p>
        
            <p>"The marine precinct was meant to support local fishing and marine industries."</p>
        
            <p>Harvey called for an independent investigation into the sale of the precinct.</p>
        
            <p>When the council purchased the land from the Port of Tauranga in 2004, covenants were placed to ensure the site was used for marine-related activities.</p>
        
            <p>These were defined as operations or activities that provided goods and services to the marine industry.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director of marine service company Pacific7, Sean Kelly, said the council needed to "grow some teeth and stop the sale".</p>
        
            <p>He said he planned to file an injunction with the High Court to try to stop it.</p>
        
            <p>"We're only asking for what we were promised. We're asking for what the marine precinct was designed to be and we're asking for [the council] to finally deliver it."</p>
        
            <p>Moana New Zealand general manager Mark Ngata said they had operated from Tauranga for over 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>As the country's largest Māori-owned seafood business, he said the company, its partners and fishermen had invested in the region.</p>
        
            <p>"We find it unconscionable that we can put all this investment into this particular area over 30 years and then with a pen we're gone."</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga was the second largest port where the company offloaded fish and it invested around $8m per year into the region, Ngata said.</p>
        
            <p>It had returns of $21m from the region which were returned to its 58 iwi shareholders through dividends, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fisherman's Wharf, where the council suggested businesses could offload, was unsuitable because their boats would not fit under the harbour bridge, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've displaced us as a sector."</p>
        
            <p>The public gallery was crammed with around 30 people who applauded the speakers.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Mahé Drysdale said the sale was now an unconditional agreement and inherited from the commission.</p>
        
            <p>It was up to the new council to find a solution and "make the best of the situations that we've been dealt", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Rick Curach said he wanted an outcome that would not compromise the fishing and workboat operations.</p>
        
            <p>When the council purchased the land, it was clear it was meant for fishing and workboats, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But then this vanity issue came along and totally displaced that; it's just unconscionable."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Glen Crowther said the needs of the fishing community were "pretty simple" - they needed a place to tie up boats, a wharf to unload, and access to ice and parking.</p>
        
            <p>The least the council could do was apologise and find a solution, said Crowther.</p>
        
            <p>Marine precinct activity also had $26.3m of debt allocated to it, but the sale proceeds were initially not going to be used to pay down the debt.</p>

            <p>Instead, the $13m was earmarked to help fund the $306m civic precinct Te Manawataki o Te Papa.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale wanted the $13m put towards the debt, which the councillors voted for.</p>
        
            <p>The council would also investigate infrastructure options for the fishing and workboat industry.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council had to do two valuations.</p>
        
            <p>One valued the precinct at $18.63m and the other at $19.24m.</p>
        
            <p>This did not include the 7195m2 hardstand area, valued at $6.12m and $7.81m respectively.</p>
        
            <p>The purchaser, Rolfe, agreed to align his offer at a mid-point between the two valuations.</p>
        
            <p>Rolfe was also unwilling to pay the "harbour front premium" of $3.3m because he believed it was appropriate for residential but not an industrial precinct.</p>
        
            <p>The hardstand area also provided a limitation because it must remain a hardstand which devalued the land.</p>
        
            <p>These valuations, plus some of the equipment included in the proposed sale meant the council arrived at the $13.987m price.</p>
