            <p>One of the country's best known charity retail chains is closing.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Aid will shut its 24 shops, known for selling rugs, baskets, arts and crafts goods from developing countries.</p>
        
            <p>The not-for-profit group was a leader in importing fair-trade products such as coffee and ethically based food items, but said it needed to change to survive.</p>
        
            <p>"The cost-of-living crisis has led to rising costs and diminishing sales, which has significantly impacted on the organisation's financial performance," Trade Aid said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The shops would be progressively closed and the organisation shifted to online sales, wholesaling and importing from producers and farmers.</p>
        
            <p>It said it would remain true to its 50-year-old founding philosophy of fair prices and incomes to help overseas communities out of poverty.</p>
        
            <p>"Trade Aid remains committed to its purpose; to improve producers and farmers' lives through providing them with a fair income and a way out of structural poverty, and to raise Kiwi's awareness of fair trade."</p>
        
            <p>Trade Aid thanked its staff, colunteers and customers for their support.</p>
