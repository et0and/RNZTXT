            <p>Motorists might "test the boundaries" when it came to parking but it is "reasonable" for a supermarket to respond, a business sector head says.</p>
        
            <p>After years of anything goes at the Whang훮rei Pak'n Save, the supermarket has begun enforcing its time limit of 90 minutes and a customer-only policy for its busy car park.</p>
        
            <p>Those who don't comply face fines.</p>
        
            <p>While the move has antagonised some, supermarket shoppers have long complained they have nowhere to park while people not even buying groceries take up all the spaces.</p>
        
            <p>North Chamber chief executive Leah McKarrow said Pak'n Save could do what it wanted at its car park and seemed to be making a change to make it easier for its customers.</p>
        
            <p>She believed the signage about time limits had been up for some time, however, the biggest challenge was if people did not know there was now an enforcement policy.</p>
        
            <p>"It should come as no surprise to parkers ...It's pretty reasonable I think from the supermarket's perspective."</p>
        
            <p>McKarrow said she wouldn't park in Pak'n Save's park if she wasn't shopping there. She had been caught out in the past and her vehicle had been towed away.</p>
        
            <p>It was the city's biggest carpark located within the CBD so it could be tempting "to push the boundaries" and park there and head off somewhere else.</p>
        
            <p>"It reminds us that actually parking restrictions are there to be fair to the majority."</p>
        
            <p>Parking has been in the spotlight in Whang훮rei and the council recently hosted a packed meeting about changing its parking requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone had an opinion."</p>
        
            <p>If those working in the city took up all the parking spaces it would unfair on shoppers and other visitors, McKarrow said.</p>
        
            <p>She also pointed out Whang훮rei had a generous parking policy compared with the likes of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The city was split into three zones, and people could park in zone three, about a seven-minute walk from the CBD, for $2 for the whole day.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to Checkpoint, Pak'n Save said the changes to its 300-space park were introduced in August, but no tickets were issued until September.</p>
        
            <p>It said the changes were made after customers complained they couldn't find a park and it was discovered people were parking there while visiting nearby businesses.</p>
