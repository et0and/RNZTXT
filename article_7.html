            <p>A woman who has proved herself in a male-dominated trade wants to own a business so she can give others a break.</p>
        
            <p>Maria Contreras Huerta has just won the Plumbing World national scholarship for apprentices.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old could not speak any English when she arrived in New Zealand from Chile 16 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>By the time she was 14 she had her heart set on being a plumber.</p>
        
            <p>A Gateway programme at school introduced her to the trade and from day one she knew it was what she wanted to do.</p>
        
            <p>When a plumber came to her house to fix a hot water cylinder she took her chance, and texted Morrinsville Plumbing and Gas Services managing director Dave Strong. She showed up in her school uniform armed with her CV.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a person that wants to get things done and don't really wait around."</p>
        
            <p>She had never had any doubts the job was for her.</p>
        
            <p>"I love it so much because every day I'm doing something new. One day I could be doing a hot water cylinder in someone's house and then the next day I could be on a commercial site doing some stainless steel pipeout or drainage sticks so it's pretty cool."</p>
        
            <p>It also made her day when customers were happy with her work.</p>
        
            <p>She told Checkpoint she was feeling proud about her win because she had worked hard and put in a lot of "blood sweat and tears" since starting her apprenticeship.</p>
        
            <p>Her dream was to own her own business with the goal of helping people who were struggling or did not have anyone to support them.</p>
        
            <p>"Those people who don't have people to back them up and to say 'Hey you can do it, you've got this' - I want to be that person."</p>
        
            <p>She would also be keen to hire disabled people who often got turned down for jobs without being given a chance to prove themselves, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Huerta had observed more interest among women wanting to be plumbers.</p>
        
            <p>However, she had experienced her share of "looks" or queries from customers or other workers when she arrived on site.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's usually pretty good but you get some people who are like 'What is she doing here?' ...I'm pretty much there to work, so I'm just going to do my job. I don't care."</p>
