            <p>SkyCity Entertainment Group will pay $204 million to settle a dispute with MPF Parking after it terminated a long-term car park concession agreement.</p>
        
            <p>MPF agreed to return the Auckland car park to SkyCity on 31 January, after the $220m sale of the concession between the parties collapsed in late October.</p>
        
            <p>MPF terminated the agreement after SkyCity failed to deliver the fire-damaged underground car parks at the International Convention Centre on time.</p>
        
            <p>In a recent update to the market, SkyCity said a delay in the settling of the Auckland Car Park Concession Agreement with MPF had resulted in lower earnings from the carpark, which has almost 2000 spaces.</p>
        
            <p>The dispute ended up in the High Court, which ruled in favour of SkyCity's interpretation of the settlement in late November.</p>
