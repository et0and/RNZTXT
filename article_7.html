            <p>Infant formula maker A2 Milk declared its first ever dividend as it lifted its bottom line on strong English label sales, offsetting supply constraints in the China label market.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended December compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>Its infant milk formula (IMF) sales grew by 7.2 percent, led by its English label, which was up 13 percent, while China label sales were 2 percent higher, which the company put down to temporary supply constraints that were resolved in the first half.</p>
        
            <p>"Execution of our growth strategy has resulted in another period of strong operational and financial performance," chief executive David Bortolussi said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pleased to declare our first ever dividend, recognising the substantial progress we have made as a business and rewarding our shareholders for their continued support," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The company said there was some improvement in the total China IMF market, with the number of newborns increasing for the first time since 2016.</p>
        
            <p>A2 Milk expected the increase due to a catch-up in Covid-related postponed pregnancies and 2024 being the year of the dragon in the Chinese calendar, which was typically associated with higher births.</p>
        
            <p>The company continued to expect a longer-term modest decline in births.</p>
        
            <p>A2 Milk's margins were slightly lower due to air freight costs as the company tried to limit the impact of supply constraints.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the overall China IMF market decline, the company was rewarded with a strong English label performance in the China and wider Asian market.</p>
        
            <p>English label IMF sales in Asia rose 22.7 percent, which the company said reflected a further shift in the China IMF market from China label to English label.</p>
        
            <p>Its US revenue rose by 13.2 percent, while the Australian and New Zealand market saw a 2.7 percent fall in revenue, primarily due to a further decline in the Daigou channel.</p>
        
            <p>A2 Milk's other business, Mataura Valley Milk, benefited from higher global dairy trade auction pricing and higher milk volumes.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, it expected revenue growth of low to mid double-digit percent, up from the previous estimate of mid to high single-digit percent.</p>
        
            <p>Its gross margin was also expected to rise, as well as marketing expenses, while administrative expenses were estimated to fall.</p>
