            <p>If you've been supermarket shopping recently, there's a good chance your trolley contained milk and toast bread, and maybe some bananas and avocados.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs has released data for the year showing Value two-litre standard milk was the most-purchased item across the North and South islands.</p>
        
            <p>There were 18.9 million bottles sold in the North Island in the year and 4.4 million in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, Bluebird chips original cut were next with 13.6 million bags sold. Third was a 500g Pams butter, with 11.5 million. The bread category accounted for eight of the top 20-selling products with over 51 million loaves sold.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Kiwis love their milk, but seeing these numbers really puts it into perspective," said Jocelyn McCallum, head of grocery and food at Foodstuffs North Island. "At a time when budgets were tight, shoppers were prioritising value and practicality.</p>
        
            <p>"Staples like milk, bread and butter were top picks. People were clearly balancing essentials with the occasional treat, like Bluebird chips or Whittaker's chocolate."</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, butter was second place and milk took the rest of the top five.</p>
        
            <p>"Our South Island shoppers really focus on value, quality and simplicity," said Justin Waddell, head of category and promotions at Foodstuffs South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though times have been tight, essentials like milk, butter, and bread are non-negotiable for many. Budget-friendly staples showed how people were making practical choices."</p>
        
            <p>The popularity of Maggi Onion Soup in the South - in 16th place with 863,610 packets sold - might be explained by its role as a key ingredient in two South Island snack staples: cheese rolls and onion chip dip.</p>
        
            <p>Among fruit and vegetables, bananas, avocados and broccoli were the stars of 2024. There were 33.5 million individual avocados sold across both islands, while banana bunches, a regular top seller, sold 31 million.</p>
        
            <p>Broccoli was near the top of the fruit and veg rankings with 17.2 million heads being sold in the North Island and 5.9 million in the South Island.</p>
