            <p>The Warehouse Group has received an approach from the company's founder and an Australian private equity firm about potential interest in acquiring its shares.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Stephen Tindall, who started The Warehouse and with the Tindall Foundation remains a majority shareholder, and Andamantem Capital Partners, have made the move.</p>
        
            <p>The group has advised shareholders and stakeholders to not sell their shares while advice is sought from the company's directors.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement it said the approach received did not constitute an offer to acquire the business or shares of the company, and it may not result in any proposal.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a difficult year for The Warehouse Group with the high cost of living and falling consumer demand hitting the retailer hard.</p>
        
            <p>In June, it dropped its full-year earnings outlook to be between 6 percent or 7 percent down on last year's result.</p>
        
            <p>Underlying profit was expected to be in a range of $22 million to $30m, compared to $83.4m in the prior year, excluding the loss from discontinued operations and any potential restructuring costs.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the company has also dealt with the abrupt departure of its chief executive and the sale of its sporting good chain Torpedo7 for $1.</p>
