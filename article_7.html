            <p>The Labour Inspectorate could soon be knocking on the door of hundreds of businesses nation-wide, as it launches a major crackdown on those not abiding by the law.</p>
        
            <p>The inspectorate said it had multiple compliance monitoring operations underway or due to start soon across both major islands.</p>
        
            <p>Sectors under the microscope include retail, hospitality, construction, security, horticulture, viticulture and dairy.</p>
        
            <p>Areas the Inspectorate was looking into included paying the minimum wage, recordkeeping, holiday pay, leave and payment of premiums.</p>
        
            <p>In some cases, the operations may be supported by Immigration New Zealand and Tenancy Services, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Combating exploitation of workers - migrants and others - is a priority for the Labour Inspectorate and MBIE's other regulatory teams," Labour Inspectorate head Simon Humphries said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want employers to operate on a level playing field where no one is taking unfair advantage by abusing employees or skirting employment legislation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Humphries said one of the larger operations - Operation Atoll - saw inspectors visit businesses in the central North Island starting in late January.</p>
        
            <p>"So far in this operation, teams of labour inspectors have visited employers in the Hamilton and Napier areas and several areas of concern were identified," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Numerous other operations are also already underway nationally while other major operations are due to start later this month."</p>
