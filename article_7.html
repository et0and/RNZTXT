            <p>The New Zealand dollar is under pressure and trading at a more than two-year low against the US dollar at 0.5550 US cents.</p>
        
            <p>The US dollar is trading at a two-year high, following December's much stronger than expected United States employment report, with this week's inflation data also expected to exceed the US Federal Reserve's target.</p>
        
            <p>The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, which is 60 percent up on the 160,000 estimate, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi is trading at levels last seen in October 2022, with the Australian dollar also trading at two-year lows against the US dollar at 0.6147 US cents, with most other major currencies at multi-month lows.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac currency strategist Imre Speizer said the Kiwi was vulnerable to fresh lows, with potential to test March 2020's low of 0.5470 US cents over the next one-to-three months.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi starts the week around 0.9050 Australian cents.</p>
