            <p>Restaurant operators who responded to a recent survey have reported lower than usual pre-Christmas bookings.</p>
        
            <p>The Restaurant Association was sent to 2500 members, and 194 businesses responded.</p>
        
            <p>In the survey, 65 percent of respondents said bookings were faring worse compared to a typical year.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and Wellington businesses had the highest representation in the survey, at 28 percent and 21 percent respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses from other regions also participated, including Northland, Thames-Coromandel, Waikato, Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>One restaurant operator told the survey some businesses were opting for cheaper options for their work Christmas functions, such as home barbecues.</p>
        
            <p>Another restaurant said bookings typically planned months in advance were now planned at shorter notice.</p>
        
            <p>Other feedback included people spending less, sharing dishes, and skipping desserts.</p>
        
            <p>About 40 percent of respondents said they were pessimistic about this summer season being a strong trading period, and 27 percent said they were somewhat optimistic, 10 percent were very optimistic, and 22 were felt neutral.</p>
