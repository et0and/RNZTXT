            <p>The coalition government has hinted at imposing a cap on the surcharges people pay for using their debit and credit cards.</p>
        
            <p>Australia is set to ban debit card surcharges as part of a crackdown on consumer fees to ease financial pressure on households.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand government has confirmed it has been working on changes to both debit and credit card fees for the past three months.</p>
        
            <p>Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly said he was waiting to receive advice from the agency before making decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"They've consulted on two things. One is around the interbank charge which is currently 0.7 percent moving to 0.2 percent, that's what they've proposed.</p>
        
            <p>"And the second element is whether they have a total surcharge cap, which is an issue that I'm very interested in."</p>

            <p>Bayly said the Commerce Commission should return its advice in the next few weeks and people could expect an announcement on changes "very shortly".</p>
        
            <p>Former Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Labour MP Duncan Webb said his party had also been looking into making changes while in government.</p>
        
            <p>"There's nothing that irritates me more than seeing a 2 percent fee for using my PayWave, and I think we should be looking at it because we know that's not the actual cost of using the PayWave system.</p>
        
            <p>"So I hope our consumer affairs minister has a good look at it and stops some more of the gouging by the financial service providers."</p>
