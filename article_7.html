            <p>Auckland retailer Smith and Caughey's has confirmed it will downsize, rather than closing the doors for good.</p>
        
            <p>The 144-year-old department store announced in May that it would permanently shut in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>But last week, it said another option for the future of the business had been identified, and that was to scale back.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the retailer confirmed the plan which would save about 100 jobs, while another 100 people would still face redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>The Queen Street store will remain open by downsizing its operations to one floor in the central city, while the Newmarket store will still close, earlier than anticipated, at the end of next month.</p>
        
            <p>The company currently employs about 240 staff.</p>
