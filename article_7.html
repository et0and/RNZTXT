            <p>Fonterra has raised its forecast payout to suppliers and posted a big rise in first quarter earnings, margins and profit.</p>
        
            <p>The forecast midpoint of its payout range for the current season has been increased by 25 cents to $7.50 a kilo milk solids in a range of $7 to $8 a kilo.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Miles Hurrell said the improved forecast reflected better prices and market conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Global Dairy Trade prices have lifted, and our sales book is also well contracted for this time of year, giving us confidence to increase our forecast Farmgate Milk Price.</p>
        
            <p>"It's still early in the year, with potential for further volatility in commodity prices, so we will continue to watch market dynamics closely and provide updates as needed."</p>
        
            <p>This week's auction rose 1.6 percent, taking prices to their highest level in five months.</p>
        
            <p>Hurrell said the co-operative has had a 63 percent rise in earnings to $575 million, with its after tax profit rising 85 percent on a year ago to $392m, leading to an increased forecast earnings of between 50 to 65 cents a share.</p>
        
            <p>Its three business operations - Ingredients, Foodservice and Consumer - had driven the rise in earnings, with gross margin up nearly six percentage points to 21.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Foodservice and Consumer channel performance is due to improved margins as well as the co-op allocating more milk to these higher returning channels. We've also seen continued strong performance in New Zealand Ingredients, but lower margins in Australia Ingredients."</p>
        
            <p>It was expected the higher margins would continue throughout the first half of the year, before tightening in the second half because of higher costs and a narrowing in the price gap between various products, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our increased forecast earnings guidance of 50-65 cents per share reflects this and we are on track for a strong interim dividend."</p>
        
            <p>Hurrell said Fonterra was pressing on with new products for various markets such as an adult milk powder for Japan containing our protein and targeting muscle loss, and developing a cake containing probiotics for Greater China.</p>
