            <p>Most hairdressers don't know some salon rules that could repealed even existed in the first place, a Wellington hairdresser says.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour is spearheading a review of the hairdressing industry to address what he views as "unnecessary" regulations.</p>
        
            <p>They included rules prohibiting dogs, other than guide-dogs, from being inside a barber shop, and a ban on staff serving their clients refreshments.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of Matt Forsman Hair in Wellington, Matt Forsman, told Morning Report most of the industry is unaware of the regulations.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest, no one in my industry that I know knew that we weren't allowed to serve drinks to clients," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And for the most part during the recent boom in people buying dogs, a lot of people have actually enjoyed bringing their dogs into the salon as well, so we're all a bit surprised that this wasn't allowed."</p>
        
            <p>Lifting those restrictions would not change much in practice, said Forsman.</p>
        
            <p>The only thing that would save hairdressers money or make their processes more efficient, is making it easier to set up new premises, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It kind of feels like they're dealing with a problem that isn't there.</p>
        
            <p>"It ... seems like a 'don't ask, don't tell' situation where, unless you're setting up a new salon, and unless you're being reviewed by the health board, we just sort of go on our business."</p>
        
            <p>The review would look at whether current rules are suited to a billion-dollar industry made up of mostly small businesses, while ensuring public health is protected, said Seymour.</p>
        
            <p>"Health and safety is really important, but not every rule and regulation is actually helping," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a short and sharp review... The review is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2025."</p>
