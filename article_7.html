            <p>In the latest episode of RNZ podcast Thrift, we look the ways to enjoy Christmas on a budget.</p>
        
            <p>Julie and Jacinta are financial mentors at Kingdom Resources in Christchurch, and they have a bunch of tips to help us all have a thrifty - yet jolly - little Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Julie says it's never too early to start planning - in fact she advises people that the best time to think about Christmas is 1 January. When she sits down with a client, one of the first things she discusses with them is their priorities for Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"What are your emotions going to be like? What do you want to be proud of? What do you want to have those moments of you know, the highlights," she says.</p>
        
            <p>And that's actual highlights that you've enjoyed, as opposed to some kind of experience you've curated to look good on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't want to look back with regrets and go, 'Oh, I wish I hadn't spent so much money on those table decorations to make it look beautiful', and 'I wish I'd spent more time with the kids playing games down at the park', or even getting together with neighbours riding their bikes, things which actually don't cost anything, but you remember," says Jacinta.</p>
        
            <p>Follow and listen to Thrift on [https://open.spotify.com/show/6YXwcCfyP7mMn4nJqEGoF6 Spotify, iHeart, Music or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>
        
            <p>Julie reckons a good tip is to reflect on Christmases past when you were a child.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was a good Christmas, what made those highlights? What are the good things that you remember as a child?"</p>
        
            <p>A memorable Christmas does not need to be traditional or pricey or fancy, it just needs to be different to every day life, the pair say.</p>
        
            <p>"What sort of foods can you do that are a little bit different from the day-to-day, stuff, but doesn't cost a fortune?" says Jacinta.</p>
        
            <p>That could be as simple as a bag of meringues or a bag of marshmallows, she says.</p>
        
            <p>Jacinta also ecommends adding one item per week to the grocery bill in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>There are also a lot of desserts that only need quite basic baking ingredients that you might have at home, your children are probably only too happy to help you make them, and of course, to lick the bowl.</p>
        
            <p>And while it's nice to think about a feast at Christmas, there's no need to go crazy and double up on foods.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't have to have ham and lamb and turkey you could choose one of those three things," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Or maybe none of them.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be that actually, the children really don't like meat and vegetables and salads. Can you do a nice big platter of some different little treat foods that they wouldn't normally have? It doesn't have to be traditional Christmas food. I think it just needs to be different," says Jacinta.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to the presents themselves, it's also a good idea to think outside the square, like offering someone an experience or organising a shared gift for the whole family instead of presents, they suggest.</p>
        
            <p>Some people even make homemade vouchers, offering the gift of time.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll come and babysit or dog sit and as a young mum, having a babysitter so that you can go out to the beach with your husband, it's pretty invaluable. A lot of people don't have that support," says Jacinta.</p>
        
            <p>Another option is to not give presents at all, or think about op shopping, the pair say.</p>
        
            <p>Op shops can be good places to find cheap stylish jars, a great way of displaying home baking or perhaps a granola mix.</p>
        
            <p>"Doing home-made food is a great idea, especially if you already have a lot of those ingredients, making up little jars with maybe a biscuit mix, layered so it looks pretty or even making up some shortbreads, home-made fudge into little jars," says Jacinta.</p>
        
            <p>Plan ahead, it's not just the details of the day, but the general vibe. Think ahead to New Year and consider what kind of Christmas you want to reflect on.</p>
        
            <p>Don't stress about food, it doesn't need to be traditional stuff. Go for platters and a few treats.</p>
        
            <p>With presents, do it differently. If it's a big purchase, buy practical things you know people want and get other family members to chip in, otherwise play Secret Santa with small, fun gifts that won't break the bank.</p>
        
            <p>Check out your local op shops for cheap, easy gifts, table decorations, platters and things to be upcycled and consider home-made gifts, craft projects and possibly the greatest gift of all: food.</p>
