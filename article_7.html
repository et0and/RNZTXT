            <p>A Christchurch hire company is proposing to take over running the 2024 New Zealand Agricultural Show to ensure this year's event goes ahead.</p>
        
            <p>In April, the Canterbury A&P Association board announced it was cancelling this year's show due to financial difficulties, and earlier this month most of the board announced they would retire.</p>
        
            <p>Phil Anderson said his company, Event Hire, had sent the association a proposal to run a slimmed down version of the show, with a reduced number of stalls and visitors.</p>
        
            <p>He said they would hope to get between 30,000 to 50,000 visitors over three days. Last year the show got 110,000 visitors.</p>
        
            <p>They are also proposing moving the show from Thursday to Saturday, rather than the traditional Wednesday to Friday.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>The Agricultural Show usually ends on the Canterbury Anniversary Day public holiday.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Anderson said reducing the visitor numbers would help the planning process.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>"From a planning perspective it is good to work with limited numbers," Anderson said. "You can do pre-sales, and manage your infrastructure. Its really driven around traffic management, and toilet infrastructure et cetera."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Anderson said they also want to reduce the entry fees to make it very affordable for families, and to reduce the cost for stall holders.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Under the proposal, the association could either lease Event Hire the land to run a show in conjunction with the association's showing events, or have Event Hire partner with it and share profits.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>"What we are trying to do is remove a lot of the risk for them, and just say here is a guarantee for money you could make."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the proposal does present certain risks for the company.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>"There is definitely heightened risk for our company, the cost to do it and the exposure. I mean we want to deliver this really well, and obviously people will give feedback, and you are in the public eye."</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>He said they also have an ongoing relationship with the show which they did not want to damage.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Anderson said they were encouraged to get involved by a number of customers who usually have stalls at the show, and wanted to see it go ahead this year.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>He said they are meeting with the board on Tuesday, and would need a decision by the end of May in order to get on with planning.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Canterbury A&P Association board chairperson Stewart Mitchell said the proposal was being considered by the General Committee on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>He said if it was considered to have merit, it would come before the board later in the month.</p>
