        <h2>Ryman Healthcare reports half-year profit has fallen by half</h2>
        <p>
The company says operating costs went up as a result of opening three new main buildings and working to fill care beds and sell-serviced apartments.

            <p>Retirement village operator Ryman Healthcare has reported its half-year profit has fallen by half on increased operating costs and a deferred tax expense.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended September compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>The company said revenue increased by 10 percent driven by increases in care and village fees.</p>
        
            <p>But operating costs went up too as a result of opening three new main buildings and working to fill care beds and sell serviced apartments. This slashed profits by 50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Executive chair Dean Hamilton said sales of occupation rights agreements (ORAs) for apartments are up 5 percent, but margins are squeezed.</p>
        
            <p>"The strongest six-month period in the last three financial years, demonstrating that demand for Ryman's product remains strong. Whilst we maintained pricing in a challenging market, this has translated to a compression in resale margins per unit, which are dependent on unit price inflation."</p>
        
            <p>He said Ryman is working to improve business through a new pricing model and improving service efficiencies.</p>
        
            <p>"Our new pricing model recognises that our residents are staying longer and our need to cover village operating costs, which have increased significantly in recent</p>
        
            <p>years (rates, insurance and electricity in particular). The financial benefit of these changes will flow as new ORA contracts are entered, most of which will be realised over a 15-year timeframe."</p>
        
            <p>Nine new sites are under construction with two expected to be completed in the second half of the 2025 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton said the second half of 2025 will continue to be challenging.</p>
        
            <p>"Residential housing volumes and pricing continue to be subdued, impacting the ability of prospective residents to settle on ORAs. We expect these conditions to continue through the second half.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect to have negative free cash flow between $50-100 million as settlements are deferred into FY26."</p>
        
            <p>Dividends remain suspended and Ryman intends to review this in 2026.</p>
