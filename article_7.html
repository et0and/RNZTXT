            <p>Goodman Property Trust (GMT) is looking to build large data centres in Auckland with the support of global investors, as part of an ambitious plan for growth.</p>
        
            <p>The property investor and developer was planning to bring its management inside the company as a necessary component of establishing a fund management arm at a cost of $272.4 million.</p>
        
            <p>If approved by unitholders, the restructured company will establish an Auckland-based property fund with an initial $300 million investment, with expectation to grow it to $2 billion within 3-5 years.</p>
        
            <p>GMT chief executive James Spence said Goodman had the scale to attract global investment.</p>
        
            <p>"Alongside what we do at the moment, which is buy, redevelop and build high quality logistics assets. We're also looking at the possibility of data centres in Auckland," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The characteristics of a data centre are quite similar in shape, size and location as warehouse and logistics spaces.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got about 50 hectares of brownfield, last-mile industrial sites in South Auckland that we're investigating the possibility for data centre development."</p>
        
            <p>Spence said GMT's existing portfolio was of a size and scale to attract global investment.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things the fund may look to do is buy assets directly from GMT itself. We've got a portfolio of $4.5 billion that's been built over the last 15 to 20 years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are two things that global investors are looking for at the moment - industrial and data centres and we think our portfolio will be pretty attractive to those seeking to invest in the Auckland market. "</p>
