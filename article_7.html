            <p>Consumer spending growth was at its slowest in five years, capping off a difficult trading year for retailers.</p>
        
            <p>Data from payments company Worldline showed consumer spending through core retail merchants - excluding hospitality - rose 0.8 percent last year, from the year before.</p>
        
            <p>The average transaction size also declined by 0.6 percent to $50.35 in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Worldline chief sales officer Bruce Proffit said the low spending growth confirmed a difficult year for merchants.</p>
        
            <p>"While consumers may have made more transactions through retailers in Worldline NZ's payments network than the previous year, the annual underlying spending growth - that is, the actual increase in dollars spent - was the lowest we've seen in the last five years," he said.</p>
        
            <p>In the hospitality sector, the value of spending fell 2.7 percent in 2024 from a year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Looking at December spending, Worldline said consumer spending processed through all non-food core retail merchants was down 0.7 percent on December 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Figures for the month confirm the pattern previously reported for pre-Christmas spending. That is, the traditional end-of-year spending spree did occur but was not enough to push spending above year-ago levels in the major cities," Proffit said.</p>
        
            <p>Annual declines occurred in Auckland/Northland and Wellington, with both areas down 2 percent from December 2023, while Canterbury fell 0.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The biggest decline was in Marlborough, which fell 2.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, some regions saw spending growth, with the West Coast up 4.2 percent and Whanganui 3.4 percent higher than December 2023.</p>
