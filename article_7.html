            <p>A word of advice for the silly season - take extra care while putting up your festive decor this year, and be mindful carving the Christmas ham.</p>
        
            <p>According to 2023 ACC data, there were 5604 claims for 'festive decor' related accidents and a staggering 9307 claims for 'food and drink' related injuries during the Christmas period from 1 December to 10 January last year.</p>
        
            <p>Cooking accidents involving baking, barbecuing, and carving resulted in 4141 claims, while eating and drinking accidents collectively accounted for 5166 claims.</p>
        
            <p>When it came to festive decor, climbing up or down ladders and stepping on or off chairs and stools were responsible for 5163 injuries. Meanwhile, accidents involving Christmas trees, decorations, lights, and Christmas crackers caused 303 claims, and gift wrapping mishaps - scissors included - added another 138 claims to the tally.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland topped the list of most injury-prone regions across both categories, followed by Waikato, and different age groups also faced distinct risks.</p>
        
            <p>Those aged 30 to 34 suffered the most food and drink-related injuries last Christmas, particularly to their fingers, hands, wrists, and arms, while 60 to 64-year-olds were most prone to festive decor injuries, often hurting their lower backs, knees, and shoulders.</p>

            <p>Kiwi teens, on the other hand, were the most careful with decorations, with 15 to 19 year olds making only 87 claims, while those 85 and older were the least injury-prone when it came to food and drink, with just 136 claims.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past ten years, almost 2500 injuries related to Christmas have been reported to ACC on any given year.</p>
        
            <p>And the figures aren't surprising - the leadup to Christmas can be a busy time for many, with more stressors and tiredness contributing to greater chance of injury; there's food to cook, presents to wrap, trees to decorate, lights and tinsel lying around, and plenty more people floating around the house than usual.</p>
        
            <p>ACC Injury Prevention Leader James Whitaker says the best way to avoid Christmas injuries this year is to "have a hmmm" - that is, assess the risks before diving into your festive tasks.</p>
        
            <p>Dental disasters can strike at any time, and that includes Christmas. Auckland dentist Dr Aftab Moosa told RNZ Afternoons that festive foods like pork crackling, pitted olives, and hardened nougat can lead to trouble if you're not paying attention.</p>
        
            <p>"Things that are inconsistent in their texture, a little bit crispy that you didn't expect, can suddenly cap the tooth off an angle and you can snap something. Pork crackling seems to come up as a recurring theme ... but it's anything which is a surprise."</p>
        
            <p>So what should you do if you have a dental emergency over the holidays?</p>
        
            <p>"The general textbook consensus is you should see a dentist as soon as possible, but it might be a bit tricky if you're down the West Coast or Coromandel and everybody else is away."</p>
        
            <p>Moosa says pharmacy products like 'temporary dental cement' and 'short-term filling repair' can be a "lifeline" - particularly in situations where you can't get professional help. For toothaches and gum problems, there are other solutions.</p>
        
            <p>"Something as simple as clove oil is really good at soothing toothaches ... you can always drop a few drops on a cotton swab, or if you're having issues with gum health, saltwater rinses or good quality mouth wash can be really helpful there as well."</p>
