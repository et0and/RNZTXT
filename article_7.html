            <p>Samantha Hayes, who currently hosts Newshub at 6 will present the new bulletin - which will be hour-long on weekdays and half an hour in weekends - on TV channel Three and the 3 Now app when it begins on 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>"We are producing something that will be both familiar and fresh, a great marriage of the Three brand and Stuff's live and lively news ethos," Stuff Digital managing director Nadia Tolich told Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>It has hired several senior reporters and producers from Newshub and will also use Stuff journalists around the country for the programme.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Newshub's owners Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD) announced it had made a deal with Stuff to create a replacement 6pm news bulletin.</p>
        
            <p>WBD had announced the closure of Newshub in March to curb losses it described as unsustainable.</p>
