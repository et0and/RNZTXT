        <h2>Du Val founders' lack of legal aid could delay FMA case</h2>
        <p>
Kenyon and Charlotte Clarke owe almost $240m to creditors and investors after their company was placed into statutory management.

            <p>Part of the Financial Market Authority's case against the former owners of insolvent property developer Du Val may be delayed because the couple cannot find a legal aid lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>Legal aid is government funding for people who cannot afford a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>Kenyon and Charlotte Clarke owe almost $240 million to creditors and investors after their company was placed into statutory management in August.</p>
        
            <p>A hearing on the FMA's action against the Clarkes for asset preservation orders was due to start on 3 December.</p>
        
            <p>But in a decision released on Thursday, Justice Neil Campbell revealed the Clarkes had been unable to secure a lawyer and gave them a deadline to do so.</p>
        
            <p>"Given that the Clarkes remain without legal representation, the FMA accepts that it is not feasible for [the] hearing to proceed," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I agree. However, because the Clarkes are entitled only to a reasonably [sic] opportunity to obtain representation before the FMA's applications are heard, I am also of the view that... the Court [should be] informed of the efforts made by the Clarkes to obtain representation."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell directed the Clarkes to obtain legal aid by 29 November, or give a comprehensive explanation for why they had not done so.</p>
        
            <p>If the Clarkes do not obtain a lawyer and file a notice of opposition to the FMA's applications by 6 December, a week after Campbell's deadline, the judge would give them further directions on 9 December.</p>
        
            <p>In a now-deleted Instagram post on Wednesday, Kenyon Clarke promised a "biblical response" to the FMA's case against him.</p>
        
            <p>"While I may be under a gag order not to speak about any questionable FMA investigation, I can say this, get on and charge me," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to see you in court and expose every grubby little deal, every grubby witness and the trial by media in the absence of any evidence. Let's go!"</p>
