            <p>KiwiSaver fund manager Simplicity's building arm is set to begin construction of 264 homes for long-term rent, in Auckland's Morningside, after receiving the necessary resource consents.</p>
        
            <p>Simplicity Living managing director Shane Brealey said at its peak the $175 million project would employ more than 400 people on and off-site.</p>
        
            <p>Construction is expected to start from the middle of this year, with completion by mid-2027.</p>
        
            <p>"Our unique combination of vertically integrated planning, construction, finance, ownership and management allows us to build better, faster and at lower cost," Brealey said.</p>
        
            <p>The development is 150 metres from the Morningside train station, and features a rooftop resident work-from-home space, landscaping with about 1500 native trees and plants in, and a pavilion lounge and cafe for residents.</p>
        
            <p>The development would be built to a minimum Homestar 7 certification standard, with a 150-year design life, Simplicity said. The plans included solar panels, rainwater harvesting, comprehensive car and bike parks with electric charging units, and the goal of minimising construction waste.</p>
        
            <p>"We're on a mission to provide thousands of quality homes across New Zealand, for long-term renting at more affordable prices," Brealey said.</p>
        
            <p>Simplicity Living's 297-home Te Reiputa development in Mount Wellington was on track for completion in May 2026, the firm said, while its 330-home Waiatarua development in Remuera was scheduled to open in January 2027.</p>
        
            <p>Three other developments were already completed, in: Point England, Onehunga and Mount Albert, with a combined 210 homes fully rented.</p>
