            <p>Smith & Caughey's is still dealing with the effects of a cyber attack it suffered on the day it announced its plans to close, its chairman says.</p>
        
            <p>A "response team of digital experts" had worked to ensure the stores could reopen in the days following, Smith & Caughey's chairperson Tony Caughey said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the attack was having ongoing effects on parts of the business.</p>
        
            <p>He said the limitations on its operations were due to a temporary solution being used on its point of sale.</p>
        
            <p>It could not process any refunds or exchanges in-store, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It could only accept cash, eftpos and credit cards for purchases in-store.</p>
        
            <p>More options were available for payment online but gift cards were temporarily not being accepted.</p>
        
            <p>While investigations continued, a third party was monitoring for any signs of customer or other data being made available online, Caughey said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, this monitoring has not identified any signs that data has been leaked or otherwise made available."</p>
        
            <p>Caughey said it had been an emotional time for staff.</p>
        
            <p>On 29 May, the department store revealed its plan to shut its physical and online stores.</p>
        
            <p>The department store, which has been in business for about 144 years, said its proposal would be under consultation with staff for about five weeks.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 staff would be affected by the closure.</p>
