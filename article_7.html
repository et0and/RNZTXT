            <p>Commissioners have declined to grant consent for a McDonalds restaurant to open in Wānaka.</p>
        
            <p>Consent was being sought to open a 455-square metre restaurant with a drive-thru at the Wānaka-Luggate Highway, below Mt Iron.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Lakes District Council opened the proposal up for public submissions and of the 367 made, the majority were against it.</p>
        
            <p>Residents were concerned about the visual and aesthetic impact on the town, litter, as well as the area's values about protecting the natural environment.</p>
        
            <p>Wao Aotearoa Charitable Trust was one group that strongly opposed the idea due to the impact it would have on the town.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed site is highly visible at the entrance of Wānaka and is adjacent to significant landscape features such as Mount Iron,"</p>
        
            <p>"The development will have a substantial adverse impact on the visual and aesthetic values of this sensitive location.</p>
        
            <p>"The proposed mitigation measures, including planting and mounding, are insufficient to address the impacts of the building, signage, lighting, and parking areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This site does not align with the community's objective to protect and enhance our natural landscape."</p>
        
            <p>There were also people who would like to see some golden arches in their area.</p>
        
            <p>One woman, who lived about a kilometre from the proposed site, was for the restaurant being built - but with some conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Opening hours are restricted to 10pm on weeknights and 12pm on weekends," her submission said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am concerned by the potential for excessive traffic movements, unsafe driving and anti-social behaviour by McDonald's customers speeding along Aubrey road at night disturbing sleeping residents. Limiting opening hours would help reduce the impact."</p>
        
            <p>The local also wanted to see safe access for cyclists and contribution to local community projects that enhance the environment of the adjacent Mt Iron Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident in favour said it would be "a positive addition to take away food outlets in the town" and that "it is appropriate for people to have food choices".</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners Helen Atkins, Robert Scott and Lisa Mein considered reports and findings from experts appearing for the applicant, council and submitters.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners noted the effects on landscape character and visual amenity were at the heart of the application.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes the effects on the perception of spaciousness at the entrance to Wānaka at the junction of SH6 and SH84 and on Mount Iron's values, particularly when viewed on approach from the east on the Wānaka- Luggate Highway. It also includes effects on the character of the receiving environment." the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear to us that the landscape architecture experts had different views over the landscape effects generated by the proposal...</p>
        
            <p>"While the locality can be described as a transitional area between urban and rural, the immediate context is outside the urban growth boundary for Wānaka and the existing activities and landscape character are typical of a rural living environment.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge if constructed the consented development will further alter the character of the site. However, we do not consider that the consented development, or even the service station, creates a commercial node.</p>
        
            <p>"Further we find the proposed development at odds with the character typically associated with rural living. We therefore agree with Mr Richard Denney [Landscape for council] that the proposed development is inconsistent with the landscape values of the site and its wider context."</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners considered reports and findings about the architecture, noise, traffic and future planning,</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners also heard the applicants right of reply following the submissions in December, where a number of changes were made to the proposal which included new opening hours of 6am to 11pm and the blade sign [McDonalds logo] reduced to 2.2 metres.</p>
        
            <p>So far, Wānaka has avoided most fast-food chains, but it does have a Subway and a Domino's.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald's New Zealand is not ruling out appealing the decision by the commissioners.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Simon Kenny said the franchise would speak with the developer and consider the next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"As we have stated throughout, McDonald's is committed to working in good faith to follow the process regarding the proposed restaurant site in Wānaka. We'll review and assess the decision, discuss with the developer, and consider next steps with regards to that site. Our intention remains to open a restaurant in Wānaka, navigating some of the local commercial interests."</p>
