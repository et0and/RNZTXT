            <p>Westpac is changing its terms and conditions to stop customers writing abusive comments into the payment system.</p>
        
            <p>The system had alllowed customers to write abuse into the reference field when making a bank transfer.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac said it had found 115 cases this year, and while some were clearly abusive, others were joke messages.</p>
        
            <p>The bank's manager of customer vulnerability, Louisa Brock, said the bank had contacted customers and warned them to stop or they could have their accounts closed.</p>
        
            <p>No-one has had their bank account closed for this reason as yet.</p>
        
            <p>However, Westpac was now changing its terms and conditions to make sure it clear that abusive messages were not acceptable, and it would drop customers who used offensive language.</p>
