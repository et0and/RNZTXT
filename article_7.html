            <p>An Auckland ferry company will continue negotiations with workers on Friday to avoid strike action next week.</p>
        
            <p>Unionised employees of SeaLink, which operates freight and passenger ferries between Auckland, Waiheke and Great Barrier Islands, will strike from Tuesday over pay disparity in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>First Union organiser Justin Wallace said workers want wages and conditions to match that of Auckland Transport's ferries, which had a cash injection to increase pay for crew earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>"SeaLink's workers are struggling with the absurd cost of living in Auckland, while going to work every day knowing that they are being underpaid compared to colleagues who do the same work as them on a different ferry provider."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, chief executive Grady Cameron said SeaLink has put forward an 18 percent pay increase in the base rates for master mariners and a 10 percent increase for other maritime and customer care teams.</p>
        
            <p>He said that was a recognition of the need to remain competitive in the maritime workforce.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue negotiations tomorrow and are committed to finding a resolution that is acceptable to both parties.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that further discussions can still lead to a mutually beneficial agreement and are dedicated to avoiding disruption to our operations and to the services we provide to the Hauraki Gulf."</p>
        
            <p>Cameron said they were working closely with food suppliers, waste management, and fuel and freight to ensure businesses on the island's can continue to operate.</p>
