            <p>Seafood company Sanford has made a strong full-year profit with revenue up 5 percent, but says prices are under pressure with a need for increased cost controls.</p>
        
            <p>Net profit for the year ended September was up 96 percent to $19.7 million with revenue of $582.9m.</p>
        
            <p>"A 5 percent increase in overall revenue, combined with a team focus on selling through aged inventory (orange roughy) and a concerted effort to expedite cash collection, positively led to cash flow improvements," managing director David Mair said.</p>
        
            <p>Underlying profit rose 75 percent to a record $54.3m, with revenue growth of 5 percent to $582.9m and a 78 percent increase operating cash flow.</p>
        
            <p>"While there have been strong prices for most of FY24, we anticipate there will be price pressure on some species, particularly products to China in FY25," Mair said.</p>
        
            <p>"Productivity plans are needed to mitigate increasing costs such as fuel, feed, freight, wages and salaries."</p>
        
            <p>A critical review of assets was undertaken in the second half of the year resulting in a net $19.9m impairment of North Island Mussels for the financial year, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The company anticipated increasing price pressure on some species, particularly on products for sale to China in the current 2025 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Mair said productivity plans were needed to mitigate increasing costs such as fuel, feed, freight, wages and salaries.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a need to review every process and commit to continuous improvement to mitigate further cost increases.</p>
        
            <p>"My objective is to simplify and optimise standardised business processes and tools, enabling more cost-effective outcomes, access to more insightful information, a more secure environment and ultimately better outcomes for our customers and our people."</p>
        
            <p>However, the cost reductions were not expected to flow through the books until the 2026 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Sanford chair Sir Rob Mcleod said the group would continue to review operations and strategy.</p>
        
            <p>" I want to stress that the entire Board is committed to the primary objective of maximising total shareholder return, measured by share price and dividend performance.</p>
        
            <p>The company will pay a full year dividend of 10c a share, which compared with 12c the year earlier.</p>
