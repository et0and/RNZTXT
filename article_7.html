            <p>Shoppers have packed into stores on one of the busiest shopping days of the year, to take advantage of Boxing Day sales.</p>
        
            <p>At Lower Hutt's Queensgate shopping mall, there were plenty of people on the hunt for a bargain.</p>
        
            <p>Clothes, make-up, and jewellery were the most popular purchases with the people RNZ spoke with.</p>
        
            <p>One shopper, Emma, who had an armload of goods, said she she did not normally partake in Boxing Day hype, but this year, just couldn't help herself.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't usually do this, but I had the money and there's so many things I want recently, so I'm going to treat myself.</p>
        
            <p>"I was taking a photo to show my friends the damage that I've done to my financial status."</p>
        
            <p>Emma said $320 she was given for Christmas had covered some but not all of her new items, and she was nervous to check her bank account.</p>
        
            <p>But that wasn't all she was nervous about: "I work downstairs, and I don't want to go to work right now - it's horrendous, so busy!"</p>
        
            <p>Ciara - who was normally out of town at this time of year - had decided to capitalise on being in the city on Boxing Day, and within 90 minutes she and friend Arla had scooped up new pyjamas, multiple t-shirts, make-up, and some jewellery charms.</p>

            <p>Other shoppers, Callum, Abby, and Riley, had been coming to the mall for consecutive years in a bid to find the best post-Christmas bargains.</p>
        
            <p>"We've come for four or five years now on Boxing Day," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a couple of shirts and a new hoodie - 50 percent off, it's pretty good."</p>
        
            <p>Anthony was at Queensgate not for himself, but to pick up some belated Christmas presents for people.</p>
        
            <p>"Here for the deals, here for the steals.</p>
        
            <p>"Something for my brother-in-law and partner (jewellery) ... it's just a watch."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, 15-year-old Caden was carrying the shopping bags for his whānau - clothes for his sister and a toy for his brother.</p>
        
            <p>"For myself, I got a $300, 1500-piece lego."</p>
        
            <p>He said $90-worth of vouchers plus 15 percent off meant it was a pretty good deal, and he was eyeing up some new headphones as well.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, by mid-morning on Boxing Day, Trade Me said more than 4600 unwanted Christmas presents had been advertised for sale on their site - including some humorous listings. A spokesperson for the company saying that figure was expected to grow, and a sizeable chunk of the sellers had promised to donate their earnings to charities.</p>
