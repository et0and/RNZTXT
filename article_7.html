            <p>Investment platform Sharesies is expanding into the rural sector by hosting the online trading of Fonterra co-operative shares among suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>Trading in the shares, which are tied to milk production, to date has been through a closed market on the NZX, but from June co-op members will be able to trade on the Sharesies mobile app and browser, and get enhanced features such as alerts on changing prices.</p>
        
            <p>Co-chief executive Leighton Roberts said the agreement offered a new line of business and should improve liquidity in Fonterra shares.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that will be one of the upsides, the fact people will be able to trade on their mobile, and have a lot more flexibility about making decisions and being able to trade the market."</p>
        
            <p>Fonterra's acting chief financial officer Simon Till said a "tailored and exclusive space" would be more intuitive and accessible for shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe it will offer Fonterra farmers an improved trading experience and new features that will support liquidity under our flexible shareholding capital structure that was introduced last year."</p>
        
            <p>Other features offered by Sharesies included farmers being able to order shares without having funds in trading accounts and to view holdings for multiple farms under one login.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Sharesies' Roberts said it had an eye in the future on running internal exchanges for other co-operatives and had spoken to the unofficial Unlisted exchange as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had several conversations with the Unlisted exchange over the years and continue to. It's one of those things on a priority list we'll get to one day, but we absolutely see some opportunity there, in particular in working with some of the companies on the exchange."</p>
        
            <p>Unlisted companies include kiwifruit exporter Zespri, Silver Fern Farms, several other agricultural businesses, as well as investment firm Rangatira.</p>
