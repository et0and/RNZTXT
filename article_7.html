            <p>People who bought a certain brand of chicken nuggets are being warned not to eat them.</p>
        
            <p>They might contain "small pieces of blue rubber", New Zealand Food Safety (NZFS) said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The affected product - 1kg bag of Pams Tempura Coated Chicken Nuggets with a best-before date of 16 October 2025 - was sold at Four Square, Gilmours, New World, Pak'nSave and Social Supermarket stores across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Return the nuggets to the place of purchase for a refund or, if that's not possible, throw them out," NZFS deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>"As is our usual practice, we will work with Foodstuffs Own Brands to understand how this issue arose and to prevent it happening again."</p>
        
            <p>Existing products had already been removed from shelves, and none was exported.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery was made by a customer, NZFD said, and there had been no reports of "associated issues".</p>
        
            <p>"The vast majority of food sold in New Zealand is safe, but sometimes problems can occur," NZFS said.</p>
