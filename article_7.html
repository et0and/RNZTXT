            <p>The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said some employers in Auckland's hospitality and retail sectors have been exploiting migrant workers.</p>
        
            <p>This follows a large scale crackdown to check over 80 outlets last week following formal complaints.</p>
        
            <p>Labour Inspectorate spokesman Simon Humphries said they found many serious breaches of minimum employment standards.</p>
        
            <p>This included pay below the minimum wage, no employment contracts, breaches of visa conditions, no record keeping and employers demanding money from their staff.</p>
        
            <p>He said employee leave and holiday entitlements were also withheld in some cases.</p>
        
            <p>"We take migrant exploitation seriously. The operation is a tangible example of the commitment to follow up alleged beaches of minimum employment standards and exploitive practices."</p>
        
            <p>Humphries said the intent was to educate where possible but also hold employers accountable who are deliberately exploiting migrants.</p>
        
            <p>"There were instances where we were disappointed to find serious breaches."</p>
        
            <p>He said enforcement action will be taken against businesses where issues of deliberate non-compliance and exploitative practices were uncovered.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage we expect between 12 and 15 infringement notices will be issued which could lead to some accredited employers being placed on the stand-down list."</p>
        
            <p>MBIE is encouraging migrant employees who are concerned about their employment conditions to get in touch through its contact centre.</p>
