            <p>Something needs to be done to address the power imbalance between Uber and its drivers, a lawyer for the Council of Trade Unions has argued in court.</p>
        
            <p>The rideshare company has appealed a 2022 decision, which ruled drivers should be considered permanent employees, with rights like sick leave and collective bargaining.</p>
        
            <p>Uber's lawyers argued on Tuesday that drivers more closely resembled contractors.</p>
        
            <p>The Council of Trade Unions (CTU) and Business New Zealand have also made submissions at the end of the second and final day.</p>
        
            <p>Simon Mitchell from the CTU said discounting drivers from employment rights raised questions about the fairness of the gig economy.</p>
        
            <p>To rule that the gig economy was somehow different to permanent employment, "to apply some different standard", risked taking away the employment rights of thousands of New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>He said the gig economy could "enable faceless corporate entities to enter into contracts with large numbers of employees very quickly, and change the nature of how work is done".</p>
        
            <p>"But fundamentally, the work that is being done is no different to the work that has been being done for decades."</p>
        
            <p>"The shambolic nature of those agreements [between drivers and Uber] is a factor," he said.</p>
        
            <p>To understand the rights and obligations for both workers and the company, it was necessary to look at how the job worked in practice, not what was agreed in the contracts.</p>
        
            <p>Although the contracts looked beneficially flexible, were they in practice, Mitchell asked?</p>
        
            <p>"The way that Uber have constructed these relationships creates a relationship that they determine, and they control.</p>
        
            <p>"And they can retain that control by not having the incidence of employment, and the ability of those drivers to organise [ie. to unionise]."</p>
        
            <p>Peter Kiely, the lawyer representing Business New Zealand, suggested a law change was needed - so it was the purview of parliament, not the courts.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be addressed by a legislative amendment to Section 6 [which] already includes, to use a colloquial expression, carve-outs for volunteers, for screen workers - that might be one way to deal with it, but of course, that would be a matter for parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"But that doesn't stop [the judges] highlighting the paradigm that we are now in."</p>
        
            <p>The appeal concluded after lunch on Wednesday, with the judges yet to make a decision.</p>
