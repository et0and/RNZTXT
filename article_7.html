            <p>Development opportunities to boost Te Tai Tokerau's economy are being put forward to the government in a new Northland regional deal proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Regional deals are part of government plans to develop a joint approach with local councils, the private sector and iwi/hapū to build economies locally.</p>
        
            <p>The deals involve cities or regions joining the private sector, central government and iwi/hapū to identify opportunities and priorities for unlocking growth and better economic outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>John Vujcich, Northland's joint regional economic development committee chair, said four development opportunities had been identified that would significantly benefit the North.</p>
        
            <p>"They have the potential to double Northland's economic production," Vujcich, who is also a Far North District councillor, said.</p>
        
            <p>A first-step "light touch development proposal" for Northland's regional deal must be with the government by February 28.</p>
        
            <p>From there it will go through a selection process before the government decides by the end of the year whether and how to progress.</p>
        
            <p>Government money will partly fund development opportunities. Some of this could come from Crown mineral royalties.</p>
        
            <p>Vujcich said the deal was exciting for the region.</p>
        
            <p>The four regional economic development opportunities settled on at a workshop in Whangārei on January 31 are now going through final consideration.</p>
        
            <p>Vujcich said the opportunities were confidential.</p>
        
            <p>Northland's governance-level joint regional economic development agency, which has members from Te Tai Tokerau's four councils, is involved as is Northland Inc.</p>
        
            <p>The deals must focus on three priority objectives of building economic growth, delivering connected and resilient infrastructure and improving affordable and quality housing.</p>
        
            <p>Vujcich said more detailed work would be done on Northland's deal if it was accepted by the government.</p>
        
            <p>Regional deals must have a 10-year plan realising opportunities. This is part of a 30-year context aligning with local government planning cycles.</p>
        
            <p>They need to be linked into regional and spatial plans and other established processes and have strong private sector engagement.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, former Minister of Local government Simeon Brown said the concept brought new opportunity for the way central government, local government and the private sector worked together.</p>
        
            <p>Central and local government had powerful tools to meet economic challenges affecting New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"Regional deals will be a practical and enduring way to ensure that these tools and mechanisms are used in a coordinated way," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>They would unlock growth in specific geographic areas in a regional-level approach.</p>
        
            <p>The deals would focus on funding and financing tools, regulatory relief mechanisms, efficient and innovative use of existing funding and planning mechanisms and improved central government coordination.</p>
        
            <p>They had to involve partnership as well as funding and financing certainty.</p>
