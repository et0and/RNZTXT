            <p>The Commerce Commission intends to file legal proceedings against Fletcher Building subsidiary Winstone Wallboards following an investigation into the use of customer rebates.</p>
        
            <p>The commission considered Winstone Wallboards' use of the volume rebates, which were discontinued by the company in 2022, breached the Commerce Act.</p>
        
            <p>In a market statement, Fletcher said it would vigorously defend itself against the commission's charges, which were expected to be filed by the end of October.</p>
        
            <p>"We disagree with the commission's conclusion, given that, during the recent building products market study, merchants told the commission that the rebate structures were not a factor that inhibited competition," Fletcher said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we submitted during that process, these rebates are common within the building products industry and are simply one aspect of competing. The commission itself acknowledged that volume rebates were widespread."</p>
        
            <p>In addition, Fletcher said the commission comprehensively investigated Winstone Wallboards on the rebate topic in 2014, and concluded Winstone's market share "was driven by its attractive overall product and service offering, not the rebates, and that the evidence did not support a conclusion the rebates breached the Commerce Act".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked the Commerce Commission for comment.</p>
