            <p>TVNZ has announced a number of key strategic changes to help it reach financial targets, including a plan to bring news capabilities to TVNZ+.</p>
        
            <p>The state broadcaster announced earlier this month that it would be closing the website in February next year, however, it has since reversed the idea.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, a TVNZ spokesperson confirmed it would retain a reduced version of the 1News website, as it works to build audiences for TVNZ plus.</p>
        
            <p>Specific strategic changes include:</p>
        
            <p>Currently there is no information on exactly what these strategic changes will look like.</p>
        
            <p>"Outsourcing decisions around our content workflow and technology functions will be deferred to allow further time to work through the impacts." the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ said it would enter into the second stage of consultation with staff next week, which would include proposals for a restructure to help it reach its savings target.</p>
