            <p>Weak consumer demand is continuing to plague firms, with two listed companies expecting earnings to fall.</p>
        
            <p>Jewellery retailer Michael Hill said New Zealand revenue fell 11 percent in the 45 weeks ended 12 May, although group sales (including Australia and Canada) rose 4.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Hill said margins were being squeezed as costs rose and gold prices hit record highs.</p>
        
            <p>"Positive sales momentum had been expected through the second half in line with anticipated improvements in consumer sentiment and economic conditions," the company said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, this has not materialised, with second-half sales performance broadly in line with the first half, and margin still under pressure."</p>
        
            <p>Michael Hill said it also faced competition in all markets, which pressured margins.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no doubt that consumer discretionary spend, and the fine jewellery category in particular, remain under pressure due to macroeconomic forces," the retailer's chief executive Daniel Bracken said.</p>
        
            <p>"Higher interest rates are leading to a sustained and prolonged decline in consumer spending," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, honey exporter Comvita said it expected lower revenue and underlying earnings, largely due to weaker demand from China.</p>
        
            <p>It said conditions were made worse by the partial cancellation of China's second-largest retail festival, 618.</p>
        
            <p>Comvita expected full-year revenue to be $211million to $218m, compared to the previous estimate of $225m-$235m.</p>
        
            <p>It said underlying earnings would likely be $23m-$28m, down from the previous guidance of $30m-$35m.</p>
        
            <p>The company said a difficult 2024 meant its 2025 target of $50m in underlying earnings was unlikely to materialise.</p>
