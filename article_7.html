            <p>ANZ Bank says spending using its cards fell 0.6 percent last month on the year earlier, with a drop in discretionary spending as well as housing-related items.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's largest bank says spending on tourism-related categories fell 8 and a half percent in December on the year earlier, with every category of tourism sector spending down.</p>
        
            <p>Housing-related spending was down more than 6 percent with weak construction and renovation activity the main reason for the drop.</p>
        
            <p>Discretionary spending also fell about 1 and a half percent, with spending on restuarants and bars showing a marginal improvement.</p>
        
            <p>However, spending on household necessities, such as utilities and insurance was up.</p>
