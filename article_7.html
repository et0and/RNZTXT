            <p>Slowing global trade battered the first-half profits of transport company Mainfreight as post-pandemic demand and prices faded, but the outlook is more positive.</p>
        
            <p>"We're comparing it to one of our better best halves ever, for the year before and of course the full year (2023) was a record year for us," managing director Don Braid said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will always like to do better than the year before. But, when you think about the conditions we're operating in and what we've achieved, we're reasonably comfortable."</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended September, compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>The 43 percent fall in net profit reflected a downturn in all its markets and across all its operations.</p>
        
            <p>However, Braid said last year's result was exceptional in comparison and left the company in a strong cash position.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been able to continue to win new business and continue to expand the operation. The benefits of the year prior produced a lot of cash for us and we've invested that in the network and continue to invest it in the network. We're a bigger and better business as a consequence."</p>
        
            <p>Braid the second half was shaping up to be stronger than the first, which was typical.</p>
        
            <p>"But we're looking a lot further ahead than that, and we're very excited about what's in front of us."</p>
        
            <p>Mainfreight launched its business into India post the first-half result, which he said would open more opportunities for growth.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to have building projects on here in New Zealand and in Australia. We have building projects on in America, for both warehousing and distribution, cross-stocks, and [continue] to develop our footprint in Europe."</p>
        
            <p>Braid said the company had become more of a global business over the past three to four years.</p>
        
            <p>"We are probably seen as a disruptor. We're a smaller global operator than some of our larger competitors and we're busy winning businessâ€¦ so we continue to be upbeat about what the world is about."</p>
        
            <p>Braid said the geopolitical and global economic conditions were tough, but the outlook was positive.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are just the conditions we have to work with. At the same time, people still need to eat and drink and we're about providing freight services for those."</p>
