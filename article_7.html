            <p>The insurance industry is being warned to comply with financial rules after the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) issued a rare public warning for prolonged breaches of rules by the Quest Insurance Group.</p>
        
            <p>The Quest Insurance Group, a subsidiary of the Geneva Finance group, was found to have failed to maintain a minimum solvency margin for its non-life insurance business and not having a required reserve fund for its life insurance business.</p>
        
            <p>Quest offers life, vehicle, and credit insurance cover.</p>
        
            <p>Insurers are required to have sufficient levels of money to cover potential claims as a condition of their licence.</p>
        
            <p>The breaches were technical, which the company reported itself and had now been sorted, RBNZ director of enforcement and resolution Kerry Beaumont said.</p>
        
            <p>The company accepted the breaches which occurred during 2021 and 2022 and the RBNZ investigation said the company had claimed a positive margin level covering some insurance products when it was in deficit.</p>
        
            <p>The company also wrongly claimed an exemption from having to have a special fund to cover other products.</p>
        
            <p>"At all times they were able to pay their policy holders. [But] we never want to see non-compliance among our insurers and that's why we're issuing this warning," Beaumont said.</p>
        
            <p>The warning was serious but appropriate, Beaumont said and it sent a broader message to the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"The warning is a reminder for the insurance industry that effective risk management and sound governance is essential to protect policy holders and that we expect insurers to be compliant at all times."</p>
        
            <p>Beaumont would nott comment on whether scrutiny of the sector had been increased, but said it had regulators "in the field all the time".</p>
        
            <p>She avoided commenting on whether consumers could have confidence in the industry, but said customers could be confident the RBNZ was looking after their interests.</p>
        
            <p>The breaches, if taken to court could have resulted in fines of up to $500,000 for each breach.</p>
