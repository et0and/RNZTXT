            <p>Mortgage broking and investment firm Squirrel has been the target of a "security incident" which has exposed the passport or driver's licence details of 600 peer-to-peer investors.</p>
        
            <p>Squirrel told clients an authorised user had gained access to a third-party system, that was used as part of its investor registration process.</p>
        
            <p>That had allowed the person to extract personal information - specifically passport or driver's licence details - for customers who had registered in the 30 days leading up to 21 July.</p>
        
            <p>Squirrel founder John Bolton said the system held customer's identification details for 30 days, because sometimes the details were not accurately captured and had to be collected again.</p>
        
            <p>"It holds it for 30 days then it drops offâ€¦ The data that was exposed was people's name, date of birth and ID number... there was no Squirrel info or any more personal info exposed."</p>
        
            <p>Squirrel had contacted people who were affected and offered them help with replacing their identification documents, he said.</p>
