            <p>Bladder cancer diagnostics company Pacific Edge's share price plunged more than 60 percent after a US Medicare provider confirmed it would no longer cover the company's flagship Cxbladder test.</p>
        
            <p>The final decision by Novitas meant Medicare coverage of Cxbladder would end from 23 February, but Pacific Edge has indicated it may appeal or pursue legal action.</p>
        
            <p>Trading in Pacific Edge shares resumed at market open on Monday morning, after a temporary trading halt on Friday following the draft announcement.</p>
        
            <p>Its share price was at 13.4 cents on Friday, but fell 63 percent or by more than 8 cents, to 5 cents a share in early trade on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The loss of coverage would likely result in a major financial blow for the company, with Medicare coverage helping deliver $6.5 million in first half operating revenue, which was more than half of its overall revenue.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Edge chief executive Peter Meintjes said the Dunedin-based firm was disappointed by the finalised local coverage determination (LCD), saying it "misunderstands the science".</p>
        
            <p>"Furthermore, we cannot believe that Novitas would commit in writing to review our most recent evidence as part of developing this LCD and then fail to do so," Dr Meintjes said.</p>
        
            <p>"Ignoring a randomised controlled trial published during the lengthy deliberations on the LCD and the consensus of the urology community runs counter to the mandate of a US government health insurance programme," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pacific Edge said it may pursue a preliminary injunction and legal challenge against the decision.</p>
        
            <p>It said it may also further review its operations to reduce cash burn, submit to Novitas for reconsideration and explore strategic alternatives that could support it in regaining reliable Medicare coverage.</p>
