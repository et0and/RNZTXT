            <p>The head of embattled dairy company Synlait Milk has resigned just weeks after the company secured its near term survival.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Grant Watson has resigned after just under three years with the company, during which it has gone to the brink of collapse and been saved by a rescue package from by its major shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait chair George Adams said Watson has led the company through a tumultuous time.</p>
        
            <p>"Recent months have seen a long list of urgent challenges for Synlait, and Grant's ably led the team through them. His achievements are extensive and notably include our balance sheet's recent, successful reset."</p>
        
            <p>Watson called Synlait an "amazing and agile company".</p>
        
            <p>"Working with our passionate employees and farmers who care deeply about Synlait's success has been a privilege. Our team's determination and dedication to deliver has also been a real highlight."</p>
        
            <p>Adams said Watson had helped to drive the company's strategy reset to reduce risk, commercialising plant-based production at its Pokeno plant, and looking for new markets in Asia and securing its China market access.</p>
        
            <p>The head of subsidiary Dairyworks, Tim Carter, has been appointed acting chief executive.</p>
