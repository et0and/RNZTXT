            <p>The Warehouse Group has had a rough six months with its third quarter profits down on the year earlier, the abrupt departure of its chief executive and the sale of its sporting good chain Torpedo7 for $1.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the group's interim chief executive John Journee acknowledged that announcing that the business would be "reshaped" around its three core brands, The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery and Noel Leeming.</p>
        
            <p>The group's management had also been shaken up with new appointments which Journee said would be "laser focused" on what need to be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>So how did New Zealand's largest retail group get to that point?</p>
        
            <p>Here's a timeline of key events which have affected The Warehouse in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The year did not start well for The Warehouse with a drop in net profit of 67 percent for the 12 months ended July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Then-chief executive Nick Grayston described it as a "tough year for us and  tough year for a lot of our customers".</p>
