            <p>Shoppers heading out to snatch a Black Friday deal are being warned to plan their travel carefully, as traffic is expected to ramp up.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, cars were stuck in hours-long queues in the Westfield Newmarket Mall carpark, the weekend before Black Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency is expecting to see more traffic than normal on state highways over the Black Friday period - and says drivers should prepare for delays, especially in areas close to major Auckland shopping areas in Westgate, Newmarket, Mt Wellington and the airport.</p>
