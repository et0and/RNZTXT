            <p>The country's biggest oil and gas producer has taken its New Zealand assets off the market.</p>
        
            <p>In an announcement on its website, Austrian-based OMV said its executive board decided the company would no longer pursue the sales process for 100 percent of its shares in OMV New Zealand Limited.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said OMV NZ would remain part of the exploration and production portfolio of OMV.</p>
        
            <p>The company gave no reason for the decision.</p>
        
            <p>OMV has a 69 percent stake in the Maari oil field, 74 percent of the Pohokura gas field, and full ownership of the Maui field - all of which are off the Taranaki coast - as well as three offshore exploration permits, and onshore storage facilities.</p>

            <p>It entered New Zealand in 1999 but had a significant expansion in operations when it purchased the production operations of Shell NZ for US$578 million in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>OMV first announced it was looking for a buyer in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"OMV, in co-ordination with competent regulators and governmental authorities, will invite potentially interested parties, in a first step, to submit expressions of interest and, in a second step, to submit binding offers," the company said at the time, adding the process was expected to take several months.</p>
        
            <p>A year earlier, OMV said it would be reshaping its global business by reducing oil and gas production by 20 percent by 2030 and ending it completely by 2050.</p>
