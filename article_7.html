            <p>ANZ bank has cut some of its fixed home loan and term deposit rates again.</p>
        
            <p>The country's banks have been slicing interest rate offerings since a dovish statement by the central bank in July pointed to sooner than expected rate cuts.</p>
        
            <p>After the Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate to 5.25 percent last week, banks have continued to drop rates.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ's latest home loan cuts include a 40 basis point drop on the one year special rate to 6.45 percent, and a 50 basis point drop on the 18 month rate to 5.99 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Its one year rate is the best available on the market for that term.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ has also cut term deposit rates with all changes effective from 20 August.</p>
        
            <p>The bank had previously cut interest rates in July and August.</p>
        
            <p>Minutes after the RBNZ cut the OCR last week, Kiwibank reduced various lending and deposit rates.</p>
        
            <p>ASB reduced all interest rates across its fixed and floating lending rates by 25 basis points.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac also cut floating home loan, business lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points.</p>
        
            <p>Wholesale interest rates have been falling recently as financial markets surmised the OCR might fall for the first time in four years.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ started increasing the cash rate in late 2021 in response to high inflation and peaked at 5.5 percent in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>However, in recent months, economic data shows inflation is slowing.</p>
