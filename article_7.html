            <p>A small solar panel installing company owner says he and his staff are devastated by the failure of SolarZero.</p>
        
            <p>The energy business announced its liquidation last Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The board of the company owned by international investment firm BlackRock pulled the pin, blaming "unsustainable operating losses".</p>
        
            <p>Almost 600 businesses are owed close to $40 million by SolarZero.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of employees are also owed more than $1.7m.</p>
        
            <p>Josh's company worked installing the systems and he is one of those unsecured creditors.</p>
        
            <p>Josh, who did not want to give his last name, told Checkpoint it was a huge blow to him and his staff.</p>
        
            <p>"This is massive. This is just unbelievable the damage it's caused, it's just phenomenal.</p>
        
            <p>"We're in debt $70,000. That's just for our November installs that we did."</p>
        
            <p>Josh said he had been working with SolarZero for over five years.</p>
        
            <p>"Basically like an employee, but we're a contractor. We've been doing everything they require."</p>
        
            <p>Josh said his company did frequent training to meet SolarZero's standards.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately for us we did the wrong move and put all of our eggs in their basket and now it's just blown up, and my business is no longer.</p>
        
            <p>"All of my guys are redundant as of 20th December and there's nothing I can do."</p>
        
            <p>Many of his staff were young apprentices and have nowhere to go, Josh said.</p>
        
            <p>"You get this phenomenal bunch of guys who are young and energetic and they're all keen to go to work and they enjoy their job, and then all of a sudden, you have to tell them, it's all over."</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty hard," Josh said, choking up.</p>
        
            <p>He is having to sell assets to try and get back some of his money.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody's got any work three weeks out from Christmas to keep us going."</p>
        
            <p>Josh said there was little warning of the company's troubles, until a stop-work order came through recently.</p>
        
            <p>"We still had bookings in the calendar ... everything seemed normal."</p>
        
            <p>"Somebody had to know what's going on. The politicians need to step in. It's ridiculous."</p>
        
            <p>BlackRock is the world's largest investment firm and in August 2023 set up a $2 billion fund with the previous Labour government to invest in green energy.</p>
        
            <p>Josh said that morally, he felt BlackRock should "just pay us for the work we've done."</p>
        
            <p>"It wouldn't be quite so heartbreaking if at least come 20th of December we got our November payment, then we could probably survive for another month.</p>
        
            <p>"At least pay us for what you owe us."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to Checkpoint, BlackRock said they provided significant funding to the company over the past two years and did not take any capital or charge fees to SolarZero.</p>
        
            <p>The decision to liquidate SolarZero was made solely by its board, who said the business was not sustainable without significant restructuring.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she still has questions about the due diligence undertaken before the government's Green Investment fund loaned money to the company.</p>
        
            <p>She also wants to know how the deal was structured, and how that $115 million investment was monitored.</p>
        
            <p>Josh said SolarZero's failure will have repercussions throughout the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's the scale of SolarZero nation-wide - I'm only one. There's at least 50 other installers nation-wide."</p>
