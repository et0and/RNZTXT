        <h2>Building product price rises likely to push up new home costs</h2>
        <p>
Generation Homes said the sector would probably pass on price increases for products such as cladding, insulation, plasterboard and lining.

            <p>One of the country's biggest home builders is warning about cost pressures, as suppliers lift prices amid a challenging sales picture for building companies.</p>
        
            <p>Generation Homes said the sector faced price increases for numerous products, such as cladding, insulation, plasterboard and lining and flooring, with increases ranging from 3 to 7 percent - costs that would likely be passed on to home buyers.</p>
        
            <p>Well-known products with price rises included Pink Batts insulation, which was up 4 percent, while James Hardie cladding was another signalling higher prices.</p>
        
            <p>GIB plasterboard prices have also increased by 3.9 percent this year, with builders first warned about the changes last year.</p>
        
            <p>The increases came as demand for new homes remained weak. Buyers have stayed on the sidelines due to high interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Generation Homes chief executive Craig Hopkins said higher prices for those and other products meant the cost of a typical new-build house could rise by an extra $20,000-30,000.</p>
        
            <p>He said while it wasn't a huge percentage increase, the costs added up for house buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"When you've got clients who are trying to work within bank ratios and LVRs (loan-to-value ratios) and all the rest of it, you're adding another twenty-thousand to thirty -thousand dollars to a mortgage. It really starts to have an impact on them," Hopkins said.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher Building, owner of the firms supplying GIB and Pink Batts, noted the latter recorded its first price increase in two years.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said lifting Pink Batts prices "was required" due to inflation pressures and "significantly increasing electricity costs".</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher Building said given the market conditions, "it would like to see stability in building supply prices", but economic factors were also at play.</p>
        
            <p>"A weaker New Zealand dollar increases the cost to bring goods into the country, including the raw materials we need to make products," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are holding prices for as long as we can, but there will be times when we need to offset our cost-to-manufacture increases to ensure we can continue to deliver high-quality products."</p>
        
            <p>Another major supplier, Carter Holt Harvey, declined to discuss price increases, while James Hardie has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Hopkins said he understood the cost pressures faced by suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>"You sit here from our side of the equation going 'hey, stop charging us more because it makes the houses more [expensive]'," he said. And then you have the supplier, and they're going 'well hold on we don't have a choice either'. It's a tough one to balance out."</p>
        
            <p>He said competition would help the sector, but warned the government's plans to bring products from overseas would probably not provide an immediate benefit.</p>
        
            <p>"To bring product to New Zealand and then have a distribution chain around the country to be able to get that product out is not a two-second job, and it's not a cheap job," Hopkins said.</p>
