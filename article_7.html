        <h2>Economy crawls out of recession, as GDP grows 0.7%</h2>
        <p>
A small jump back into positive growth ends half a year of bad news and beats economists' expectations.

            <p>The economy has rebounded more strongly than expected out of recession, on the back of improved agricultural production and tourism spending.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data shows gross domestic product -- the broad measure of economic growth -- rose 0.7 percent in the three months ended December, to be 1.1 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>Expectations had been for quarterly growth of 0.3 percent, and and annual contraction of 1.3 percent, after the previous two quarters of contraction.</p>
        
            <p>"Higher spending by international visitors led to increased activity in tourism related industries such as accommodation, restaurants and bars, transport and vehicle hiring," spokesperson Katrina Dewbery said.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis welcomed the confirmation of growth, although acknowledged people were still suffering the after-effects of high inflation and interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"We still have a way to go to get where we want to be, but with economic forecasters predicting further growth in the quarters ahead, things are looking up," Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>David Seymour, who is the acting prime minister while both Christopher Luxon and Winston Peters were overseas, called the slight growth a "sunny tail-end of summer" and also predicted further growth.</p>
        
            <p>"I suspect that news in its self will make people feel better about where the economy is," Seymour told reporters.</p>
        
            <p>He said Thursday's figures show economic recovery is on the way.</p>
        
            <p>"There is still a lot of economic pain but a recovery underway, and just as the sun is shining today, that's got to be good for New Zealander's future," Seymour said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not there yet. We've seen the start of the turning corner, the first green shoots of an economic recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"The government must continue to contain its own spending, freeing up cash for others to spend, if this recovery is going to be strong and sustained," Seymour said.</p>

            <p>Labour said it was no cause for celebration, and New Zealanders were still not better off.</p>
        
            <p>Leader Chris Hipkins pointed to the continued struggles in construction as a direct consequence of government decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"People who have lost their jobs are still suffering because of it. Building and construction is probably one of the greatest examples of that.</p>
        
            <p>"By cancelling a whole lot of projects as soon as they became the government, they've set the entire economy backwards," Hipkins said.</p>
        
            <p>The main growth spots were agriculture, up 1.4 percent, retail up 1.9 percent, and transport up 2.4 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Those were partly offset by a 3 percent fall in construction, reflecting the slow down in house building, and decreases in telecommunications and internet services.</p>
        
            <p>The energy sector, which had dented the previous quarter because of the mid-winter power crunch, rebounded as conditions returned to more normal activity.</p>
        
            <p>Individual shares of the economy - per capita GDP - rose 0.4 percent, the first quarterly increase in two years, but were still more than 2 percent over the year.</p>
        
            <p>The country's purchasing power (disposable income) improved 1.2 percent for the quarter, after shrinking in the previous six months, although it was was still 2 percent down on a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>The latest GDP reading marked the turning point for the economy, which fell into its worst contraction in nearly 30 years outside of the Covid-era.</p>
        
            <p>Lower interest rates are expected to give a spark to household spending and business investment.</p>
        
            <p>Forecasts are for modest, positive growth this year picking up pace in the second half for an annual rate between 1.5-2.0 percent, rising towards 3 percent next year.</p>
        
            <p>However, a soft labour market, with unemployment expected to nudge higher, is expected to keep a brake on household spending.</p>
        
            <p>The uncertain global outlook and impact of any tariffs on world growth is expected to weigh on business activity and investing decisions.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand's quarterly growth rate was one of the stronger among our major trading partners, but the annual contraction was the weakest of any for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr said the economy was still groggy after last year's six month downturn.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still quite weak when you scratch beneath the surface, we are very much crawling out of recession, but I think we'll pick ourselves up and we are optimistic about the outlook."</p>
        
            <p>He expected most sectors to improve through the year, such as retailing and hospitality, but the construction industry would remain in the doldrums until the property market turned around.</p>
        
            <p>ASB senior economist Mark Smith said the emergence of growth would be a "sight for sore eyes" of Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>But he cautioned many parts of the economy remained fragile and there were plenty of challenges ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"We do think the broader global headwinds provide a sizeable dampening over 2025 - we are not so convinced the fourth quarter breadwinners of growth can maintain their pace over the year."</p>
        
            <p>However, the data was not likely to upset the prospects of further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank.</p>
        
            <p>It's delivered 175 basis points of cuts to the official cash rate (OCR) since the middle of last year taking it to 3.75 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ANZ economists forecast three more 25 basis point cuts to 3 percent by July.</p>
