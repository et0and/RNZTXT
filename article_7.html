            <p>Fewer existing homeowners are moving to new properties - and part of that may be because they are stuck in a sales chain, waiting for places to sell, Corelogic says.</p>
        
            <p>It has released its latest housing chart pack, which shows that while sales volumes lifted 1.6 percent in August compared to the same time a year ago, they are still around 15 percent below the 10-year average.</p>
        
            <p>Its data showed that sales to relocating owner-occupiers were particularly weak, at 13.6 percent of the market.</p>
        
            <p>Property economist Kelvin Davidson said there could be some "catch-up" to happen there.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't seen a lot of activity from them lately, but life has still happened in the past two or three years - households expanding, people splitting up - these things are always going on."</p>
        
            <p>He said falling mortgage rates would help that group.</p>
        
            <p>"If financing restrictions ease a bit and housing chains speed up a bit - a lot of people are selling before they buy but if it takes too long to sell, you don't buy either."</p>
        
            <p>He said overall Corelogic expected slow growth in prices and activity, but the level of turnover could remain below the "normal" level of about 90,000 transactions a year for a couple of years.</p>
        
            <p>The number of listings available for sale was up 13 percent year-on-year, to the highest September level in at least six years.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington, Bay of Plenty, Auckland, and Otago, total stock rose by 20 percent to 25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Property values were up 0.7 percent year-on-year but that was only due to growth at the end of last year and early this year. Over the three months to August, values were down 2.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said falling interest rates would help demand. About 65 percent of the country's mortgages by value will refix on to a new mortgage rate over the next 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>But he said there would still be concerns about job security for many buyers.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've lost your job or seen a friend or neighbour lose their job, you're probably not going to want to rush out and trade property.</p>
        
            <p>"Those who still feel confident about their jobs and can get the finance are in a position to take their time and secure a deal in their favour. This includes first-home buyers at present, whereas mortgaged investors are still a little more circumspect."</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said there were indications some smaller investors were re-entering the market but the "top up" between what they would get from rent and their mortgage payments was still large.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said the market was likely to remain soft for some time to come, but that would allow for a realignment after a tumultuous few years.</p>
