            <p>The country's manufacturing sector is continuing to battle tough economic conditions, recording its ninth consecutive month of contraction, despite an improvement in activity.</p>
        
            <p>The BNZ-Business New Zealand Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) rose 3.8 points to 46.7 in November, after falling 2.6 points in the previous month.</p>
        
            <p>A reading below 50 indicated manufacturing was declining, while above 50 indicated expansion.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday's Stats NZ data highlighted the weakening manufacturing sector as a key factor in the overall negative growth numbers.</p>
        
            <p>The PMI showed production (at 43.6) remained "stubbornly low", while new orders and employment showed some improvement, but remained contractionary.</p>
        
            <p>Finished stocks reverted to expansion after a fall in October.</p>
        
            <p>The proportion of negative comments improved in the survey, but manufacturers lamented the lack of demand coming through, evidenced by the contractionary new orders index.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ senior economist Craig Ebert said production was at the heart of the poor run in the PMI over the last nine months.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, it certainly seems to be the latest message of the latest GDP [gross domestic product] accounts and it's also one we've picked up for more than just the last quarter," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[Production] seems to be dragging the PMI overall down as much it has," Ebert said.</p>
