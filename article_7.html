            <p>Henderson Dairy is recalling two batches of its raw milk product due to concerns it may contain listeria.</p>
        
            <p>The batches, sold by Henderson Dairy, are:</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety acting deputy director-general Jenny Bishop said the products under recall were identified through routine testing, and there have been no reports of associated illness.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand Food Safety will work with Henderson Dairy to understand how the contamination occurred and prevent its recurrence," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A listeria infection could be serious among pregnant people, newborns, the elderly, and those with a weakened immune system.</p>
        
            <p>"These products should not be consumed. Return them to Henderson Dairy for a refund or, if that's not possible, throw them out," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>Listeria differed to other harmful bacteria in that it could grow at refrigerator temperatures, Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to be very careful about the foods you eat, or provide to others, if you or they are in a vulnerable group," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is particularly dangerous during pregnancy because it can cause miscarriage, premature labour or stillbirth, and infection in the new-born baby."</p>
        
            <p>However, an infection in healthy adults is unlikely to be severe, at most causing mild diarrhoea and flu-like symptoms within a few days of eating contaminated food.</p>
        
            <p>For those in the vulnerable groups, it usually takes two to three weeks - or even longer - before symptoms appear.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said drinking raw milk carried inherent risks because it might contain harmful bacteria that were killed through the pasteurisation process.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have consumed any of this product and are concerned for your health, contact your health professional, or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for free advice."</p>
