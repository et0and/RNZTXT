            <p>ASB is the latest bank to cut home loan rates, reducing its one-year rate by five basis points to 5.49 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Its 18-month rate drops from 15 basis points to 5.19 percent, with the six-month rate dropping 10 basis points to 5.89 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ASB executive general manager Adam Boyd said the changes would be welcome for home loan customers, and those looking to refix or buy.</p>
        
            <p>"We've lowered rates across several terms three times in the past month, giving our customers and prospective buyers a range of options, whether they're after short-term relief or longer-term certainty," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We already know how popular the short-term rates are and we've seen growing interest in the 18-month term this year," he said. "Competition is fierce when it comes to interest rates and we're pleased to be offering lower mortgage rates for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>ASB has also reduced some of its term deposit rates.</p>
        
            <p>Since Friday, Westpac has offered a 4.99 percent rate for three years.</p>
        
            <p>Loan Market mortgage adviser Karen Tatterson said she had not seen banks match that rate yet, but BNZ had dropped its two-year rate to 5.09 percent, probably in competition.</p>
        
            <p>Edge Mortgages director Glen Mcleod expected more rate movements in coming days, with the official cash rate (OCR) announcement looming.</p>
        
            <p>"It is going to be very interesting to see how the rate changes develop over the next few days, as the announcement gets closer. The fight between sticky inflation and a struggling economy makes this time around very interesting."</p>
