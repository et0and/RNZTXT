            <p>A retail industry group says dwindling consumer confidence is causing more businesses to shut up shop.</p>
        
            <p>Wallets are staying more tightly shut as consumers worry about their spending.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac McDermott Miller Confidence survey shows consumer confidence dropped 11 points in June to 82.2, wiping out the past six months of gains.</p>
        
            <p>A confidence level of below 100 signals households are pessimistic about the economy.</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young told Morning Report consumers and households are uncertain about the job market, housing and their ability fund new expenses.</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at the graphs, they're probably slightly worse than '87 when it took a long time for us to recover from the crash way back then."</p>
        
            <p>Young said she was hearing of some in the Retail NZ membership closing their businesses.</p>
        
            <p>As prices rise, including increases in insurance and freight, retailers were unable to absorb extra costs because the margins were really small, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It really is about surviving till '25, it's how do you get through this next six to eight months and then hopefully we see confidence turn around because whilst the economy's going to take time to change...we actually need consumer confidence and business confidence to turn around..."</p>
        
            <p>Young said businesses should remember customer service was key and look at how they can be agile right now within the current constraints.</p>
        
            <p>And that cash was king.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've got some cash then you can get through."</p>
