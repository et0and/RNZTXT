            <p>The government will look at ways to set up long-term security for investors, when it reverses an oil and gas ban, the Resources Minister says.</p>
        
            <p>But Labour says the changes would lock in emissions for decades to come.</p>
        
            <p>Investors were scared to return to the market in case of a ban by another government and long-term contracts could be a solution, Shane Jones told Morning Report on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The 2018 ban on gas and oil exploration in New Zealand "damaged the perspective that international investors and domestic investors have about our nation", Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"One option is to work with the users of gas and develop a long-term take contract so that investors have the confidence over the next 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>"I did promote the notion - is there some way of developing a bond to reduce the risk?"</p>
        
            <p>He said domestic investors were "fearful a current government might cancel their rights" and there was a need to "secure energy, consistency and security for our nation".</p>
        
            <p>"I do feel that a long-term contract has some merit. The government would need to work assiduously with the users of gas," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very anxious that we don't lose more manufacturing and industry out of New Zealand because of uncertainty about energy.</p>
        
            <p>"One Parliament cannot bind another Parliament, but all parliaments will respect the sanctity of long-term contracts. And I think if the developers in the new frontier of gas boosting see that they've got an enforceable long-term contract with a bunch of users, the there'll be no way that the green politburo can destroy the New Zealand economy again."</p>
        
            <p>The reversal of the ban was a step "backwards" in Aotearoa's climate response, Labour Party energy spokesperson Megan Woods said.</p>
        
            <p>Woods introduced the ban as energy minister in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"This will lock in emissions for decades to come. We are in a transition but a transition is not just maintaining the status quo and continuing to burn fossil fuels for our energy, it is about moving towards something different."</p>
        
            <p>She said the government's policy gave fossil fuel companies free rein to exploit the environment.</p>
        
            <p>But Jones said a change in legislation would come with financial liability for investors.</p>
        
            <p>"This time around there'll still be a financial liability on all of the investors in the gas industry. It'll have more flexibility.</p>
        
            <p>"Regulations will be passed. Liability will still rest with those who have invested, dug, and extracted the gas from the various wells."</p>
        
            <p>It was about taking a "balanced" approach, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to expediting or not only the oil and gas, but also encouraging accelerating the process for people to create more wind farms, solar energy power generation capacity.</p>
        
            <p>"But it requires the fast-track legislation because it takes far too long in New Zealand to get these bog-standard permits allocated."</p>
        
            <p>Industry group Energy Resources Aotearoa was thrilled the ban was being lifted.</p>
        
            <p>A secure gas supply would support the transition towards renewable energy, chief executive John Carnegie said.</p>
