            <p>The median national house price is holding steady as the number of sales increase.</p>
        
            <p>The Real Estate Institute House Price Index for May indicates the value of the housing market rose 2.3 percent last month.</p>
        
            <p>However, the national median sale price fell slightly by 1.3 percent on the year earlier to $770,000 from $780,000.</p>
        
            <p>Still, 10 out of 16 regions saw price increases with West Coast leading the way with a 14 percent increase to $405,000.</p>
        
            <p>REINZ chief executive Jen Baird said the total number of sales rose last month, reflecting an increase in stock levels and new listings.</p>
        
            <p>"Nationally, seasonally adjusted figures show a 5.2 percent increase, indicating that year-on-year sales counts performed slightly above expectations -- an encouraging sign despite the current economic challenges," Baird said.</p>
        
            <p>The national number of listings rose 25 percent on the year earlier, with notable increases in Wellington (+103 percent), Hawke's Bay (+34 percent), Marlborough (+33 percent), Auckland (+30 percent), Otago (+31 percent) and Waikato (+21 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Stock levels increased by 22 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"With a continued flow of new options coming to the market adding to a large level of stock this does provide a lot of choice for buyers and a sense that they can take their time to make decisions," Baird said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the 8 percent annual increase in the number of sales was a contrast to current challenges in securing finance, changes in the job market, and the wait on changes to the Reserve Bank's official cash rate (OCR) and mortgage interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>"With a continued flow of new options coming to the market adding to a large level of stock this does provide a lot of choice for buyers and a sense that they can take their time to make decisions," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Others are snapping up properties at attractive prices before the expected slowing during the winter months and the potential reemergence of investors mid-year.</p>
        
            <p>"It might be a few months yet before the residual impact of readjustments post the government's 100-day plan and budget are felt. Indeed, there are cool economic breezes being felt but there are signs of more positive activity ahead."</p>
