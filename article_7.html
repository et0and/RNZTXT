            <p>Dairy company Synlait has made a $96 million first half loss, and announced a review of its North Island assets.</p>
        
            <p>The speciality milk producer was carrying a lot of debt, but said it had secured an extension to a $130 million debt repayment until 15 July, after placing itself in a trading halt last week.</p>
        
            <p>It has also secured $30 million in short-term funding to the end of June, along with amendments to its banking arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait was also planning to raise addition capital, though its share price was trading at a significant discount.</p>
        
            <p>It was yet to find a buyer for DairyWorks business, and was in arbitration with major customer, A2 Milk, after it cancelled Synlait's exclusive supply agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The full year result was expected to be significantly down on the year earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Synlait's trading halt lifts this morning.</p>
