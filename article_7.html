            <p>Food wholesaler Gilmours is freezing prices of essential products in a move it says will help struggling hospitality businesses - but there is no such move planned for households as food price inflation stalls.</p>
        
            <p>Products included in the freeze for hospitality businesses are from grocery, chilled and frozen, liquor, beverage and general merchandise categories.</p>
        
            <p>Gilmours general manager Cindy Chaimowitz said it was important to take action because many operators were facing closure.</p>
        
            <p>Some have also reported that their current trading conditions are the worst they have ever experienced.</p>
        
            <p>"Our price freeze is designed to provide immediate relief to these businesses, enabling them to keep their prices competitive and attract more diners."</p>
        
            <p>Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said the challenges the sector faced were among the most significant in years.</p>
        
            <p>While Countdown froze the prices of 300 products in 2023, neither Woolworths nor Foodstuffs has a price freeze for household customers at present. Gilmours is part of Foodstuffs North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Foodstuffs said it had updated its websites with the progress it had made since the Grocery Industry Competition Act was enacted. The Commerce Commission's grocery annual report is due soon.</p>
        
            <p>It said it had increased the number of products with "everyday low pricing" and had made shelf labels easier to understand.</p>
        
            <p>All members of the merchandising teams had received training in upholding the grocery supply code and it had undertaken work to introduce unit pricing ahead of deadlines.</p>
        
            <p>It said it had also kept the rate of price inflation below the Stats NZ rate for 24 of the past 27 months.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ data shows that food prices increased 0.6 percent year-on-year in July, down significantly from a peak of double-digit percentages last year.</p>
        
            <p>Prices dropped for fruit and vegetables, down 8.5 percent, and meat, poultry and fish, down 1.1 percent.</p>
