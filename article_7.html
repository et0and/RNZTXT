            <p>A recruitment firm says the era of large pay increases to retain workers is over, urging workers to consider other ways to improve their pay packet.</p>
        
            <p>The latest Robert Half Salary Guide indicates a third of about 500 workers surveyed were looking for a new job because their current role offered few opportunities to progress their career, with only 43 percent of workers committed to sticking with their current position.</p>
        
            <p>"There is restlessness in the New Zealand workforce, with a portion of workers eyeing an exit as a result of long-term career goals not being met at their current employer and mounting cost of living pressures pushing employees to a job with higher pay," Robert Half managing director Megan Alexander said.</p>
        
            <p>All generations in the workforce ranked limited career progression opportunities as the number one reason why they would consider leaving their role, with Gen Z (37 percent) and Millennials (36 percent) most likely, followed by Baby Boomers (32 percent) and Gen X (25 percent).</p>
        
            <p>"While financial compensation remains a key motivator for all employees, all generations take on a long-term view and recognise the importance of developing their skills to future-proof their career and set themselves up for promotions and continued professional growth," Alexander said.</p>
        
            <p>Money was a concern for about 22 percent of workers, who thought their pay was uncompetitive, with 18 percent needing a better paying job to meet living expenses.</p>
        
            <p>However, Alexander said employers were no longer offering large pay increases to retain staff.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand employers are being more conservative with their salary increases due to cost pressures on their side, so while pay is a top priority for most due to rising cost of living, professionals should reflect on whether the grass is actually greener when seeking a new role in the current market."</p>
        
            <p>However, about half (57 percent) of the surveyed office workers in New Zealand indicated they were likely to look for a new job this year, with 10 percent having done so in the first quarter of the year, 6 percent in the first half of the year and 37 percent planning on making a move before the year was out.</p>
        
            <p>The survey also indicated fewer workers (40 percent) at small- and medium-sized enterprises had no plans to leave their jobs, compared with 62 percent at large organisations.</p>
