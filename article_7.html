            <p>A broken pedestrian bridge across Auckland's Wynyard Quarter is set to reopen in December.</p>
        
            <p>The Wynyard Crossing bridge, linking the city centre to businesses in the Wynyard Quarter, has been stuck upright since March.</p>
        
            <p>Its closure has caused difficulties for businesses, with foot traffic re-directed via a 15-minute detour. A passenger ferry and pontoon bridge had been a temporary solution.</p>
        
            <p>Eke Panuku, the Auckland council agency responsible for repairing the bridge, said the complexity of works meant it could not confirm an exact date for the bridge's re-opening, but it was expected to be in December.</p>
        
            <p>"As the project team get further through the programme and gain more certainty around remaining tasks, they will be able to more accurately specify a completion date," a spokesperson for the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>There had been significant works off-site to repair the structure, and re-installation of mechanical parts and engine rooms was the next step.</p>
        
            <p>"The return of the physical structures, including the spans and engine rooms, will allow specialist technicians to begin the works to reanimate the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>"So while it might look like it's back and should be open, there will be a lot going on behind the scenes for the recommissioning in December to ensure long-term durability and reliability."</p>
