            <p>Two budget brands of peanuts are being recalled because they contain aflatoxins - a byproduct of mould - at higher-than-allowable levels.</p>
        
            <p>The recall affects specific batches of Value Pack roasted salted peanuts, and nuts and raisins; and Refill Pack roasted nut mix and raw nut mix.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said aflatoxins came from a group of moulds that grew on foods produced in hot and tropical climates.</p>
        
            <p>"Levels of aflatoxin in the New Zealand diet are usually very low and don't represent a health risk, however, consumption of food products with increased levels of aflatoxin over an extended period of time can be harmful."</p>
        
            <p>The recalled products had been imported. Although they underwent testing, they were released by the importer in error without confirming the results, Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>The products had been removed from stores and were not available overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Food Safety had received no notifications of illness, Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>The products affected by the recall were:</p>
        
            <p>- Value Pack (VP) Nuts and Raisins (400g), best before 29 September 2024</p>
        
            <p>- Value Pack (VP) Roasted Salted Peanuts (400g), best before 8 October 2024 and 15 October 2024</p>
        
            <p>- Value Pack (VP) Roasted Salted Peanuts (750g), best before 8 October 2024</p>
        
            <p>- Refill Pack brand Roasted Nut Mix (850g), best before 5 March 2024</p>
        
            <p>- Refill Pack brand Raw Nut Mix (850g), best before 5 October 2024</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who had bought any of the affected batches should not consume them and should return them to the place of purchase for a refund, Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>The affected products were sold at selected supermarkets throughout New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who had consumed the product and was concerned for their health should contact their GP or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for free advice.</p>
