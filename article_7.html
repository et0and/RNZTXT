            <p>Shop owners say their incomes have been decimated by poor planning from Auckland Transport on Onehunga Mall Road.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses on the suburb's busy main road said they were given just a week's notice that highly-disruptive footpath repairs, which began on Monday, would take more than three months.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of the footpath on both sides of the road have been blocked off, while a large sign warned drivers to expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>The manager of Onehunga's Vinnies Op Shop, Wanda Lis, said roadworks are preventing people from parking outside to drop off donations.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't get donations coming in and customers can't stop by, and our customers love us."</p>
        
            <p>Should the store suffer a significant loss of income due to the disruption, she said not only would staff and customers be affected but the Onehunga Foodbank it funds.</p>
        
            <p>"This shop has been part of the community for over 30 years. It will decimate us. It will kill us."</p>
        
            <p>She said better communication from AT with affected shops could help avoid devastation.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to be more aware of the impact on small businesses and charities like us. It is crazy they've blocked off so much of the road, both sides of the road, there's no parking, and they're okay with that. I don't think that's ok."</p>

            <p>Owner of iTi Espresso Bar, Logan Shilling, said once construction began he saw significantly less customers.</p>
        
            <p>"My main customers are car customers and the roadworks make it look like I'm closed. If I don't make enough to pay the bills - if I go [down] for three months in my sales it could put me out of business."</p>
        
            <p>But he said the Onehunga community rallied behind him after a customer posted about his cafe's situation in a community Facebook group.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely feel like I've lost a few regulars. My morning people haven't had time to come through with the road works. But I've got people coming in from New Lynn and all around here that I've never met before who didn't know I was here and it's been amazing. Greatest thing ever!"</p>

            <p>One customer told RNZ they came down to iTi after seeing the Facebook post, which received more than 4000 likes.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing the state of how a lot of small businesses have been going, especially after Covid, it has been important to me to support local rather than big chains. I saw the post and we were going down to Onehunga anyway, so we thought :'might as well check it out and grab a coffee'."</p>
        
            <p>Another customer said they also work at a small business and understand what Shilling is going through.</p>
        
            <p>"I know how not getting adequate business can take a hit to a person's family and income."</p>
        
            <p>Quality Meats 4 Less owner Richard O'Connor, said he understood construction needs to happen but that it is a concern for them during an already tough economic time.</p>
        
            <p>"Construction like this is happening all over Auckland and we're not the only business being affected. The timing is difficult and why does it take so long is the big question.</p>
        
            <p>"There doesn't appear to be a lot of work happening, which is really frustrating when you want them to get on with it and get it done."</p>
        
            <p>He said they are now offering a delivery service so locals don't have to fight the traffic to get their meat.</p>

            <p>Maungakiekie-TƒÅmaki ward councillor Josephine Bartley said she is concerned about the impact of ongoing construction.</p>
        
            <p>"It is vital for Auckland transport to communicate what the roadworks are for, how long it will take, because it needs to get done as soon as possible to minimise the effects on road users and especially the businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"They need to prioritise access to the businesses so people know that they are not closed."</p>
        
            <p>She said she had seen the enormous community support for iTi Espresso Bar and would be supporting the businesses.</p>
        
            <p>"I will myself get there to try these cheese scones which are apparently the best in Auckland."</p>

            <p>Auckland Transport told RNZ the construction period has now been reduced from thirteen weeks to nine weeks; six weeks for a section of the road between Trafalgar Street and Grey Street and three weeks for a section by Princes Street.</p>
        
            <p>AT spokesperson Alan Wallace said they communicated with businesses about how they could work around their delivery schedules and avoided the busy Christmas period.</p>
        
            <p>"Engagement was done with the Onehunga Business Association in June, along with some face-to-face engagement with businesses to get information around delivery schedules. Letter drop was done 24/06 to residents (in letter boxes) and business (given face to face) 7 days prior to the work starting, and an email with the Work Notification letter was sent to the business association to share with the businesses. The Onehunga Business association confirmed receipt of email and were happy to relay the information.</p>
        
            <p>"When the scope of works was changed Thursday 27th June - meaning we would be starting by the Trafalgar section - we emailed the business association, and they relayed the information to the businesses."</p>
        
            <p>Wallace said they were maintaining customer access to shops as much as possible.</p>
