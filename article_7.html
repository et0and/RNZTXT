            <p>Rising unemployment is another symptom of the economic stress businesses are under, say employers and manufacturers.</p>
        
            <p>June quarter unemployment rose to 4.6 percent - from a revised 4.4 percent - in the first quarter of the year.</p>
        
            <p>EMA head of advocacy Alan McDonald said the increased rate was not a surprise and reflected the record high volume of calls to its advice line service.</p>
        
            <p>"The struggles facing Kiwi businesses, with the number of requests for help from our members in the areas of restructuring and redundancy skyrocketing this year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of increasing headcount, we expect businesses to upskill their existing staff in the likes of health and safety and leadership courses while they wait for the economy to improve."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was little sign of an economic recovery with businesses expecting conditions to remain tough into next year.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite inflation falling and a growing expectation of an economic recovery, with lower interest rates, these changes will take a long time to filter though the economy," McDonald said.</p>
        
            <p>"The signs of an economic recovery are a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer spending, rising incomes, an increase in the GDP, and improved business activity. We have yet to see any of these indicators."</p>
        
            <p>McDonald said global economic conditions may further delay the expected economic recovery, including the upcoming US election and the threat of tariffs.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was also concerning that nearly 13 percent of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were currently out of employment, education or training.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an alarming statistic and suggests that job creation must be a priority for the government in the coming months, particularly among our young people."</p>
