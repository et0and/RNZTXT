            <p>Air New Zealand has reported a 39 percent drop in first half profit as demand constraints eased from the highs of last year.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the six months ended December compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>Revenue rose 13 percent, driven by increased capacity across the international network.</p>
        
            <p>The national carrier said demand has softened, particularly in domestic corporate and government travel since September.</p>
        
            <p>The previous year saw the airline experience far greater demand for travel compared to the number of seats it had available, leading to higher fares for passengers.</p>
        
            <p>"Inflationary pressures also continue to be felt. Non-fuel operating costs have increased around 5 percent or $100 million due to price inflation, which is on top of an increase totalling 15 to 20 percent across the last four years," the airline told the sharemarket.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was reviewing fares and capacity in response to the ongoing cost pressure.</p>
        
            <p>As the airline had previously indicated, the result came in at the lower end of its guidance range of $180 million to $230m, and included $45m of Covid-related credits, which the airline said was "highly unlikely to be redeemed".</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Greg Foran said the engine maintenance requirements had also seen its aircraft spend more time on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"While this is beyond our control, we are managing these issues with changes to our schedule and additional leased aircraft," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said it has also faced "unprecedented competition" in North America and was experiencing pricing pressure from United States carriers.</p>
        
            <p>The airline expected the second half of the financial year to be increasingly difficult, given the impact of its Pratt & Whitney engine maintenance requirements, economic risks, and softness in domestic demand.</p>
        
            <p>The company forecast full year pre-tax earnings to be in the range of $200m to $240m, compared to the previous year's $585m.</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth Barr head of research Andy Bowley said the result was in line with the investment firm's expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"Moderating yields on international segments, particularly North America, a growing cost base and lighter cargo revenue all weighed on performance," Bowley said.</p>

            <p>Air New Zealand also flagged delays in the arrival of new aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>It had eight Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order.</p>
        
            <p>"Boeing has now confirmed that the first of the new 787 Dreamliners is unlikely to arrive until at least mid-2025, which will delay delivery of our innovative new Skynest. The interior retrofit of our current 787 fleet remains on track," Foran said.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged the delays were "frustrating" but expressed confidence in the 787 aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>"I can tell you in the conversations I had with them at the highest level, it's pretty frustrating for them as well."</p>
        
            <p>Foran also said he was confident in Boeing, despite their recent issues, and said the airline always had staff at the production lines at Boeing and Airbus.</p>
