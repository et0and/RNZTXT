            <p>Advertised salaries are falling behind inflation as demand for workers continues to cool.</p>
        
            <p>Seek NZ Advertised Salary Index slowed slightly in the November quarter to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent in the August quarter.</p>
        
            <p>"The New Zealand labour market remains strong but has cooled in recent months," Seek country manager Rob Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>He added that annual growth remained strong at 5.1 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the strong growth advertised salaries are still not keeping pace with inflation, which is running at 5.6 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"For Kiwis feeling the pinch from the cost of living, this data confirms that advertised salaries are still growing rapidly, and one of the best ways to get a pay rise is to get a new job."</p>
        
            <p>Salary growth was strongest in Canterbury at 6.7 percent year-on-year.</p>
        
            <p>While all regions saw growth, the North Island, outside of Wellington and Auckland, recorded the lowest rate at 5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Healthcare and medical was the leader among industries with 8.7 percent salary growth.</p>
