            <p>Respiratory equipment manufacturer Fisher & Paykel Healthcare's full year profit fell 47 percent, despite a revenue gain of 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The company said the bottomline was adversely affected by three abnormal one-time items, with underlying profit up 6 percent when those items were excluded.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the year ended March compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>"After several years of changing demand patterns, we are pleased to have returned to a trajectory of growth," managing director Lewis Gradon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an impressive portfolio of products, strong relationships with our customers and the right infrastructure to meet our future needs."</p>
        
            <p>The hospital product group, which included humidification products used in respiratory, acute and surgical care, saw a 6 percent gain in revenue to $1.1b.</p>
        
            <p>The homecare product group, which included products used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and respiratory support in the home, saw revenue growth of 18 percent to $652.3m.</p>
        
            <p>Gradon said the outlook for the 2025 financial year, assumed no significant respiratory disease events, and was expected to see revenue in a range of $1.9b to $2.0b and bottomline net profit in a range of $310m to $360m, with a further improvement in gross margin.</p>
        
            <p>Net profit was hit by three abnormal items, including the a drop in the valuation of at Karaka, New Zealand, which was negatively impacted by its current zoning status, the higher interest-rate environment, and general development land market conditions, accounting for an adjustment of $98m.</p>
        
            <p>Net profit was further marked down by a change in New Zealand legislation removing tax deductions for the depreciation of buildings, resulting in a $19.3m tax adjustment.</p>
        
            <p>An underestimate of costs associated with a limited recall of Airvo 2 and myAirvo 2 devices manufactured before 14 August 2017 resulted in a $20m cost, rather than the earlier estimate of $12m.</p>
