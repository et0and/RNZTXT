            <p>Aged care and retirement village operator Arvida has posted an slight increase in net profit amid tough operating conditions and a slow housing market.</p>
        
            <p>Key numbers for the 6 months ended September compared with a year ago:</p>
        
            <p>"As the past few years have demonstrated, the need to remain responsive to market conditions is essential for continued business performance," Arvida chief executive Jeremy Nicoll said.</p>
        
            <p>A 12 percent increase in revenues was offset by a 14 percent increase in costs across the business, commissioning of new care centres, and investment in people and technology teams and systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Our ability to adapt as circumstances have required has enabled the business to grow while we have focused on restoring profitability."</p>
        
            <p>The gross value of sales rose 2 percent in the six-month period, with 285 sales including 102 new sales and 183 resales, with unit pricing up 4 percent on 2023's valuations.</p>
        
            <p>"In a challenging housing market both the volume and value of our sales exceeded the same period last year," Nicoll said.</p>
        
            <p>"The second quarter though to September was our best ever with a solid upswing in resales activity."</p>
        
            <p>The level of retirement units under application was 24 percent ahead of the same time last year and at record levels.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were early signs of an improving operating environment, with less uncertainty in the housing market and economic outlook, alongside a change in government policy for the aged care sector and business generally.</p>
        
            <p>Arvida operates 36 villages in the North and South Islands, with a mix of independent living, aged care, hospital and dementia units.</p>
