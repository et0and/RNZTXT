        <h2>Solar panels '100% the future', despite company going into liquidation</h2>
        <p>
It has become cheaper to own solar panels than lease them, like SolarZero offered, an advocacy group says.

            <p>It is potentially lights out for Aotearoa's largest solar power company, leaving some customers in limbo.</p>
        
            <p>And the government's asking questions about more than $100 million that has already gone from its Green Investment Fund to the company.</p>
        
            <p>SolarZero, which provides solar power systems, with no upfront costs but multi-year leases, has been put in liquidation.</p>
        
            <p>Employees have been advised that due to unsustainable operating losses, and liquidity constraints, the business cannot continue to operate.</p>
        
            <p>User advocacy group Rewiring Aotearoa's chief executive, Mike Casey, said solar remains the future, but the delivery model has moved on.</p>
        
            <p>Casey told Checkpoint the technology itself is "100 percent the future" and was the cheapest energy available to New Zealand households.</p>
        
            <p>Business models "come and go" and it was about getting the most affordable energy in human history to Kiwi households.</p>
        
            <p>Casey said SolarZero "put solar on the map" and accelerated installations in New Zealand, but a changing market and a decrease in prices meant its business model did not have a long-term future.</p>
        
            <p>These days, Casey said it was cheaper for households to own the panels and batteries, financing them on their mortgages rather than leasing them.</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealand was still far behind Australia in the update of solar panels.</p>
        
            <p>Where 35 percent of households in Australia had rooftop solar panels, just 3 percent of Kiwi homes had them.</p>
        
            <p>The average install in New Zealand was about five kilowatts, costing $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>In Australia, the average was 10kW, and about $20,000.</p>
        
            <p>Casey said New Zealand needed to fix the rules and regulations to inherit the "well oiled machine" that was the Australian solar industry.</p>
        
            <p>It was "unfortunate" the customer had lost the option of SolarZero but the right business model "will prevail in this country".</p>
