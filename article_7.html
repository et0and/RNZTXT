            <p>Chartered accountants' pay in New Zealand pales in comparison to Australia - particularly as they progress through their careers, new data shows.</p>
        
            <p>Chartered accountants Australia and New Zealand has released its latest remuneration survey.</p>
        
            <p>It shows pay lifted overall by the same 3 percent in Australia and New Zealand over as year.</p>
        
            <p>In Australia, that took members to a median total package of A$160,000, compared to NZ$144,200 here.</p>
        
            <p>Those elsewhere were doing even better - in the UK, they were earning GDP135,000, in the United States US$267,384 and in Singapore, S$144,200.</p>
        
            <p>Australian accountants in corporate roles were being paid a median A$191,975. Compared to NZ$167,671 for local roles.</p>
        
            <p>Chief financial officers were being paid a median A$303,750 compared to NZ$265,000 here.</p>
        
            <p>People starting out as provisional members were being paid A$87,360 in Australia and $76,735 in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The highest pay in New Zealand was in Auckland, followed by Hawke's Bay, which had a 9 percent year-on-year increase.</p>
        
            <p>Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand regions manager Charlotte Evett said it was positive that the survey showed chartered accounting was a well-paid profession.</p>
        
            <p>There was a big jump in pay when people had six to 10 years' experience, she said</p>
        
            <p>"It's as good profession to work in.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the lifetime of the survey we are seeing higher salaries in Australia. I don't think that's much of a surprise. It's a big powerful economy compared to us."</p>
        
            <p>She said there was less difference between pay in the early stagers of a person's career.</p>
        
            <p>"The really big difference is in those senior roles, the CEOs and general mangers earn a lot more in Australia. This year we've published the remuneration for members in the UK and US and they are bigger gruntier economies than Australia and they are getting paid even moreâ€¦ it's a function of a bigger engine room in the economy."</p>
        
            <p>She said there were not the same "heady increases" in salaries as recorded in the post-Covid, tight labour market.</p>
        
            <p>But the survey showed that people valued some non-financial incentives, particularly flexible working, she said.</p>
        
            <p>That meant businesses that wanted to retain talent but could not afford large pay increases could think about offering incentives such as working from home. People also wanted career development, and younger accountants in particular said they wanted to know where their careers might go.</p>
