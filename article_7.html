            <p>Stock markets in Asia plunged on Monday, following big falls last week by major indexes around the world.</p>
        
            <p>In Japan, the Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes were both down by more than 10 percent in afternoon trade.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after weak jobs data in the US on Friday sparked fears of a recession in the world's largest economy.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the yen has been strengthening against the US dollar since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week, making stocks in Tokyo more expensive for foreign investors.</p>
        
            <p>"The selloff was instigated by the sharp appreciation of the [yen] as global investors turned cautious on Japanese corporate earnings, especially that of exporters such as automakers," said Kei Okamura, a Tokyo-based portfolio manager at investment firm Neuberger Berman.</p>
        
            <p>The Japanese currency has strengthened around 9 percent against the US dollar over the last month.</p>
        
            <p>A stronger yen made Japanese goods more expensive, and consequently less attractive for potential overseas buyers.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan's main share index and South Korea's Kospi both fell more than 8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>India's main index the NSE Nifty 50 was trading1.8 percent lower and the ASX in Australia was down about 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down 1.4 percent, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange was little changed.</p>
        
            <p>Cryptocurrencies were also down. Bitcoin dropped to just over $53,000, its lowest level since February.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, stocks in New York fell sharply after official jobs data showed that US employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far fewer than expected.</p>
        
            <p>The figures raised concerns that a long-running jobs boom in the US might be coming to an end and drove speculation about when and by how much the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>Stock markets were already worried about high borrowing costs and unsettled by signs that a long-running rally in share prices, fuelled in part by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI), might be running out steam.</p>
        
            <p>Friday's decline in the Nasdaq brought the index down about 10 percent from its most recent peak - a fall known as a "correction" - that in this case has happened in a matter of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dropped 1.5 percent on Friday, and the S&P 500 ended 1.8 percent lower, after markets in Asia and Europe sank.</p>
