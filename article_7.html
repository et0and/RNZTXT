            <p>Woolworths New Zealand will give $250,000 in customer donations to support the Cyclone Gabrielle recovery in Tairāwhiti Gisborne and Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Of that, $100,000 will go to the Hawke's Bay Disaster Relief Trust, while $50,000 each will go to the Tairāwhiti Mayoral Relief Fund, Rural Support Trust, and the Federated Farmers Gisborne/Wairoa re-fencing and recovery fund.</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths NZ managing director Spencer Sonn said the money had been donated to the Countdown Food for Good Trust over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that the impact of Cyclone Gabrielle continues to be devastating for those affected, and the need for help will continue for years," Sonn said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are so grateful to our customers for providing these funds and we are very happy they can help with the ongoing recovery."</p>
        
            <p>Woolworths earlier gave more than $250,000 in customer donations in the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle as well as the January 2023 flooding in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, Woolworths NZ donated $450,000 in food and funds to help charities and organisations providing on-the-ground assistance and support to the most impacted communities.</p>
        
            <p>It also provided disaster relief support for its growers after Gabrielle hit, including $700,000 in cash grants.</p>
