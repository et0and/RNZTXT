            <p>The country's biggest supermarket operator wants to merge its various businesses into a single national co-operative.</p>
        
            <p>The boards of Foodstuffs North and South Island, which currently operate as separate co-ops, have proposed to merge the two, in order to remove duplication, simplify the business, and save costs.</p>
        
            <p>The two co-ops operate New World, Pak'N Save, Four Square, Raeward Fresh, On the Spot, Gilmours and Trents Wholesale.</p>
        
            <p>The co-ops said they were engaging with the Commerce Commission and seeking clearance to merge.</p>
        
            <p>If the merger gets approved, the chair and chief executive designates would come from alternate co-ops, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs South Island chairperson Russell McKenzie would chair the proposed new co-operative's board, and Foodstuffs North Island chief executive Chris Quin would assume the role as chief executive designate.</p>
        
            <p>"If the proposed merger proceeds, we'll continue to be a proudly 100 percent NZ owned co-operative with each store owned and operated by a local grocer," McKenzie said.</p>
        
            <p>He said all supply chain networks serving members and customers would remain the same.</p>
        
            <p>"What would change is the way we're governed and operated. By combining the very best ways of doing things from each co-op and forming one national business, we have an opportunity to reduce complexity, duplication and the additional cost that comes from running two co-ops.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultimately, this will make us more efficient and able to deliver more innovation and better value for New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>Each co-operative would hold a special general meeting in June next year, where members would vote on the proposal to merge.</p>
