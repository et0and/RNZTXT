            <p>Most of the country has been in the grip of an economic cold snap, but warmer conditions may be coming, according to a Westpac bank report.</p>
        
            <p>The roundup rates regional economies on a six temperature scale - between frosty and hot - but no region makes it out of the "cool" zone.</p>
        
            <p>"Economic conditions have remained chilly right across the country, with households and businesses in every region reporting ongoing challenges," Westpac senior economist Satish Ranchhod said.</p>
        
            <p>Four of the 11 regions surveyed, the top of the South Island and the West Coast, Bay of Plenty, and Northland rated frosty - the lowest.</p>
        
            <p>Five regions, Auckland, Wellington, the lower North Island, Canterbury, and Otago rated cold - the second lowest.</p>
        
            <p>Top ranked, with a cool rating, were Southland and Gisborne-Hawkes Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Ranchhod said the overall assessment was that "there's still a lot of pain out there".</p>
        
            <p>"Many families have been reining in their spending as cost-of-living pressures continue to bite. That's seen widespread falls in retail</p>
        
            <p>sales and particular weakness in the hospitality sector."</p>
        
            <p>"We've also seen continued softness in sectors like construction and manufacturing, with declines in both the amount of work being completed and forward orders."</p>
        
            <p>He said few firms were hiring, and many had not been filling vacancies or cutting staff through restructuring.</p>
        
            <p>But Ranchhod said the economy was showing signs of getting warmer, with the tone of responses changing from downbeat to encouraging, and the pace of price rises easing.</p>
        
            <p>"Perhaps the most notable change since our last survey was the sense that the worst is finally behind us."</p>
        
            <p>"A number of businesses said that the start of the Reserve Bank's interest rate cutting cycle was a welcome relief, and they're optimistic that the fall in interest rates will help to stoke demand over the year ahead."</p>
        
            <p>He said generally the South Island was less negative, because of improvement in dairying and horticulture, higher export prices, and higher tourist numbers.</p>
        
            <p>In contrast the North Island was generally more downbeat with weak spending and job losses.</p>
