            <p>A man who argued he was unjustifiably dismissed from a role he never started has lost his bid for compensation and reimbursement.</p>
        
            <p>Shaun Cavanagh was offered employment as a truck driver by Dynes Transport Tapanui in August 2023.</p>
        
            <p>He told the Employment Relations Authority that he accepted the offer but became unwell before he started and was later told the offer was withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>Dynes argued the offer was subject to conditions and they were not fulfilled.</p>
        
            <p>Authority member Philip Cheyne noted that Cavanagh initially responded to an advertisement for drivers.</p>
        
            <p>He attended an interview and had his driving assessed. There was some discussion about when he could start and both sides agreed he said four weeks.</p>
        
            <p>That same evening he was told to get a new employer form from his bank with his bank details and to supply his IRD information. A draft employment agreement was arranged and an offer generated.</p>
        
            <p>The letter of offer was conditional on a drug test, a receipt of a signed copy of the employment agreement and an ACC pre-employment claims history check.</p>
        
            <p>On 12 September, he provided a copy of that agreement to a lender to support a loan application.</p>
        
            <p>It was approved subject to the agreement being signed by both parties.</p>
        
            <p>That day, he was emailed by one of Dynes' general managers, noting his agreed start date was 20 September, when they would both sign the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>The manager said Cavanagh told him he would get a call from someone, which happened. He said he thought it was a rental agency and he told the person Dynes had made a conditional employment offer but he would not vouch for or be a referee for Cavanagh.</p>
        
            <p>Cheyne said it was likely this was the lender.</p>
        
            <p>But on the day Cavanagh was to start, he was unwell and his partner messaged the manager. He provided a medical certificate saying he was unfit to work for one week, but probably two - until 2 October.</p>
        
            <p>On 27 September, the manager messaged him to ask how he was. He sent another medical certificate that said he was likely to be fit to work from 9 November.</p>
        
            <p>Cavanagh was told by the manager that he was under pressure to fill the position and if he did there might be other options.</p>
        
            <p>Cavanagh asked him to hold his employment and said he was concerned his sickness would affect the opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>On 2 October, the offer was withdrawn. He was given details for another manager at Dynes who was looking for staff.</p>
        
            <p>On 7 November, a representative for Cavanagh raised a personal grievance claim of unjustified dismissal.</p>
        
            <p>Cheyne said to have been dismissed, Cavanagh had to be a employee. Cavanagh argued he was a person who intended to work and had been offered and accepted work.</p>
        
            <p>"The offer was conditional on Cavanagh's consent to and the result of a drug test," Cheyne said.</p>
        
            <p>"It had been anticipated that Cavanagh would provide his consent and be tested when he first reported for work. But he was unwell and never consented to or underwent a test.</p>
        
            <p>"The offer was also conditional on Dynes receiving a copy of the employment agreement signed by Cavanagh. Although Cavanagh picked up a copy of the proposed agreement, he did not return a signed copy of it to Dynes. Again, it had been anticipated that he would sign it when he reported for work on 20 September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"The third condition was for Cavanagh to arrange for a pre-employment ACC claims history check to be forwarded to Dynes prior to his employment start date. Cavanagh did not do so."</p>
        
            <p>Cheyne said he had also not signed the letter of offer to acknowledge it was conditional on the drug test.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not accept that the employment agreement had come into force. As he was never an employee of Dynes, Cavanagh cannot pursue a personal grievance against the company. His claim must be dismissed."</p>
