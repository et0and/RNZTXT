            <p>Takeaways and local eateries are bucking the downward trend as the cost of living crisis causes a big fall in revenue for restaurants.</p>
        
            <p>A report by the Restaurant Association revealed 76 percent of its members had worse or significantly worse profitability compared to the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>The takeaway sector, however, showed a 4.2 percent increase in year-on-year sales during the second quarter of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Other businesses to defy the odds were neighbournood eateries with 24 percent of respondents stating income was on par with or up on the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>Annual sales revenue of was $15.7 billion for the year ending March, a 5.8 percent increase on the previous year. The Association said there were ongoing difficulties especially in Auckland where revenue dropped 0.7 percent from the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said diners in the suburbs which had a strong local connection were finding success by building loyal customers bases that who value the community aspect of eating out locally.</p>
        
            <p>Established eateries with strong brands and businesses with a clear and unique offering were navigating the challenging landscape effectively, Bidois said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Restaurants were still facing staffing issues with 59 percent of employers describing it as "difficult or extremely difficult".</p>
        
            <p>While 78 percent of businesses are fully staffed, recruitment for senior roles also remains difficult.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to the state of mental health and wellbeing, the industry is also under strain with 54 percent of owners indicating a negative impact on their health, a huge boost from 42 percent in the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>Bidois said despite the challenges, the industry remains resilient and determined to navigate the rest of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"We've weathered tough times before, and while the trading environment remains difficult, we are prepared to face these challenges head-on and are focused on surviving until 2025 and beyond."</p>
