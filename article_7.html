            <p>The housing market cooled further in June, with prices and sales falling, while buyers have more options as listings continue to rise.</p>
        
            <p>The Real Estate Institute's house price index - a measure of the changing value of properties - fell 0.7 percent from a month ago, but rose just over 1 percent from a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>The national seasonally adjusted median price fell 1.3 percent from a year ago and was flat from May to be $770,000.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, prices rose 2.4 percent from a month ago and were up nearly 5 percent from a year ago, to a median price of $1.05 million.</p>
        
            <p>Sales counts fell 15 percent from a year ago, and the national inventory level increased 29 percent from a year ago, while listings rose 26 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The increased number of listings coming to market continues the trend we have seen all year, with high levels of choice for buyers nation-wide. The winter months do tend to see fewer people choosing to sell, and this year is no different," Real Estate Institute chief executive Jen Baird said.</p>
        
            <p>"Salespeople are seeing some properties come to market due to high interest rates, cost of living pressures and changing employment circumstances," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nationally, the median days to sell rose by one day to 48 days.</p>
        
            <p>Baird said there was a "notable decrease in buyer activity" and a "reduced sense of urgency".</p>
        
            <p>"As more listings come to a well-stocked market, those who are in the position to buy are taking their time to carefully select their ideal home," she said.</p>
