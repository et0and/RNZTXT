            <p>Households may find home insurance "increasingly unaffordable" due to higher premiums, while rising risks could lead to insurers refusing to cover some properties altogether.</p>
        
            <p>In an excerpt from its upcoming Financial Stability Report, the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) said residential insurance premiums "significantly outstripped general inflation over the past decade".</p>
        
            <p>It said it reflected higher construction cost inflation and higher reinsurance costs, as global reinsurers reassessed New Zealand's risk level.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also seen the insurance industry move towards greater use of risk-based pricing for residential dwelling insurance, meaning that the value of insurance premiums is more tailored to the specific risks a property faces (e.g. seismic or flood)," RBNZ director of financial stability assessment and strategy Kerry Watt said.</p>
        
            <p>Risk-based pricing was evident in certain areas, such as for earthquake risk in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"A long-term trend towards risk-based pricing will pose challenges for some property owners," Watt said.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ expected owners of higher-risk properties to potentially find insurance "increasingly unaffordable" and some properties "may see a withdrawal of insurance availability".</p>
        
            <p>But it said evidence suggested insurance remained available and insurance companies withdrawing insurance was rare, even for properties facing greater risks.</p>
        
            <p>"We're anecdotally already seeing some policy holders struggling with increased costs in insurance and also potentially in the future availability of insurance," Watt said.</p>
        
            <p>"Over time, risk-based pricing can provide a strong signal to encourage the proactive mitigation and lowering of exposure to risks, which can be beneficial for society's overall risk management," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the RBNZ said insurers, governments, home buyers and lenders should take action to improve their understanding of natural hazards to proactively manage affordability challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"Banks need to be conscious of the ongoing insurability of the properties they lend against, which will require more scrutiny in their lending decisions than currently," the RBNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>"Banks also need to pay closer attention to insurance coverage, as there is a risk that owners underinsure high-risk properties over time in the face of rising premiums."</p>
