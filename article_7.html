        <h2>Changes underway for media industry, but it's a messy process</h2>
        <p>
Media oversight and regulation is described as messy, and screen productions desperately need help.

            <p>The country's broadcasting and streaming landscape is set to shift, with the government proposing significant changes in a media reform discussion document.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the most debated proposals include merging public funding agencies NZ On Air and the New Zealand Film Commission; and introducing a levy on international streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus.</p>
        
            <p>Mandating that smart TVs and similar devices sold in New Zealand come pre-installed with local media service apps, such as TVNZ plus and Three Now; increasing captioning and audio description; and modernising professional media regulation have also been proposed in the five-point draft document unveiled this month by the government, which says the measures are necessary to support local content production and ensure the sustainability of the media industry.</p>
        
            <p>But will it really make a difference, and is it a good thing?</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see it being the big seismic change that I know a lot of other commentators have seen it being," media commentator and NZ Herald editor at large Shayne Currie told The Detail.</p>
        
            <p>"I think at the moment we are in a little bit of a messy spot in terms of our media oversight and regulation - this is actually part three of a three-part series of different legislation that the government is looking at.</p>
        
            <p>"Even within the coalition, there is disagreement. ACT doesn't like the Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, but New Zealand First does, and New Zealand First doesn't like the repeal of the Sunday advertising, but ACT is fine with that.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, we are seeing this messiness unfolding at both select committee and public debate ... there is no getting around it, these changes have to happen but it's all feeling a bit piecemeal.</p>
        
            <p>"And with the Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill being on hold, I question where we will be in 12 months' time and will we be any further down the track.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly, I do think that the proposed revenue from global streamers and TV platforms for local productions, that to me... I am really optimistic that might come through and will help our production sector."</p>
        
            <p>Currie describes the merger of NZ On Air and the Film Commission as a "no brainer".</p>
        
            <p>The government said merging NZ On Air, the agency responsible for funding local television, radio, and online content (including The Detail), and the film commission, which funds movies and short films, will create a more streamlined funding body.</p>
        
            <p>It believed this consolidation would make public funding more efficient, reducing duplication and allowing for better allocation of resources.</p>
        
            <p>"The media industry in New Zealand hasn't had a great run of proposed mergers in the past decade, that's for sure - both privately and in the public sector, with the most recent example of that being RNZ and TVNZ," Currie said.</p>
        
            <p>"But this one, to me, is a no brainer, and it shouldn't have any of the hurdles that the others had."</p>
        
            <p>Currie said change was needed because in its current state, the country's film and television sector was "on its knees".</p>
        
            <p>"There's been about 50 to 60 million dollars pulled out of that sector in terms of production in the last 12 months, that's a result of dropping advertising revenue and audiences transitioning to new platforms... and so we have seen a lot of producers out of work, same for camera operators.</p>
        
            <p>"Much like our newsrooms, the film and TV sector is on its knees."</p>
        
            <p>But he had hope for the future of the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"I am much more optimistic about the longer-term future, particularly as the economy bounces back in New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our filmmakers are renowned globally... whether you are Peter Jackson or a producer working a little more independently, they create this brilliant work. And we will always be a destination for film makers."</p>
