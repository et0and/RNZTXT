            <p>A recently launched app hopes to take away the time, stress and mental load of planning affordable days out in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Roam with Kids was created by Renata Wiles after she spent hundreds of hours exploring things to do in Auckland with her three-year-old daughter.</p>
        
            <p>She decided to document their adventures on social media, recommending places for other parents to take their own kids - some of which are not well known.</p>
        
            <p>With 25,000 followers on Instagram, 8000 on TikTok and 3000 app downloads, Wiles is hoping to expand and see the app cover the entirety of the country soon.</p>
        
            <p>Wiles told Afternoons it all began because she simply enjoyed getting out and about.</p>
        
            <p>"I have a now almost four-year-old, but I was a stay-at-home mum and we were just spending heaps of time getting out and about, going to all these cool places across Auckland and, I guess at just a hobby, I was sharing things on social media, on Instagram and TikTok, making little videos and the first one that really kind-of took off is when I shared about the Grey Lynn paddling pool."</p>
        
            <p>Wiles said she received a bunch of messages from parents thanking her for letting them know about the pool as they were unaware it existed.</p>
        
            <p>"I leaned into that and started sharing more and more recommendations of cool places we were finding and the response from other parents is just amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Wiles said the app shows an interactive map, where people can use filters such as change table or pram friendly to hone in on a location that may best suit their needs for a day out.</p>
        
            <p>It includes indoor playgrounds, outdoor parks and child-friendly cafes.</p>

            <p>Wiles said it was rewarding to know she was helping other parents.</p>
        
            <p>"My aim is really to save them time and stress and the mental load of planning, make it more enjoyable getting out for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>One of Wiles' top picks for playgrounds was My Wonderland - an indoor playground in Albany.</p>
        
            <p>"That's definitely a favourite of ours - we love going there."</p>
        
            <p>A top pick for cafes was The Parkhouse in Whenuapai.</p>
        
            <p>"We also love because they've got a really big outdoor playground and seating outside as well so you can sit, have your coffee or your lunch and see your kids in the playground which is always awesome."</p>
        
            <p>Wiles said a feature had recently been introduced on the app where users could submit their own favourite places to visit.</p>
        
            <p>The goal was to expand beyond Auckland - with plans for the app to cover all of New Zealand "soon".</p>
