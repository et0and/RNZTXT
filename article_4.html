            <p>An Auckland preschool has described the heartbreak of discovering their playground equipment had been stolen at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>About $5000 worth of slides, ladders and climbing equipment was stolen from Te Kōhanga Reo o Te Ngākau Mahana in Henderson sometime between last Friday evening and Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Staff arrived on Monday to discover the play sets were missing.</p>
        
            <p>"After Friday afternoon, everything was here and our tamariki were playing on it before they went home," said Kaiako Wiremu Paniora.</p>
        
            <p>"It was kind of a shock to come back on Monday to find it had been taken, because it hasn't happened here before."</p>
        
            <p>The kohanga was closed over the weekend, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unfortunate that it happened on the last week of kohanga," said Paniora</p>
        
            <p>"It was supposed to be a fun week for the tamariki, and they've been left without their playground, so it's pretty heartbreaking.</p>

            <p>"It's their equipment, it's their playground, and it's their free time,</p>
        
            <p>"We're pretty heartbroken that it's been taken."</p>
        
            <p>Wiremu Paniora said they had received donations from those wanting to help.</p>
        
            <p>"We're fortunate in the last week that we've had quiet a few koha given to us, in terms of money and offers from other ECE's, for kohanga, for playground equipment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not really asking that we get new equipment from other people, but we're very fortunate that they've offered and koha has come in, so we're very thankful for that.</p>
        
            <p>The burglary has been described as a "thoughtless act", by detective sergeant Anna Freestone from the Waitematā West Tactical Crime Unit, who said about 30 children had been left without outdoor play equipment.</p>
        
            <p>"The offender, or offenders, came into the centre on Smythe Road and removed several items," Freestone said.</p>
        
            <p>The estimated value of the items is about $5000, including bridges, blocks and a circular swing.</p>
        
            <p>"These aren't exactly small items and would have required a vehicle to transport them.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm asking anyone who saw something that stood out as odd or didn't look right, to contact us."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who was offered playground equipment to buy, or given as a gift, should be cautious, Freestone said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to hear from anyone that might find themselves in a situation like this, and they suspect it's the stolen equipment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty appalling that people would think to target such an important place such as a childcare centre."</p>
        
            <p>Freestone said she wanted whoever took the playground to "think about the children" and bring it back.</p>
        
            <p>Information could be provided by updating police online or by calling 105, reference the file number 241209/0008.</p>
        
            <p>Alternatively, information could be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
        
            <p>Another Auckland preschool had also been struck by thieves earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>An Ōtara Preschool had its windows smashed and property stolen during a break in at the weekend</p>
        
            <p>Police said thieves broke in sometime at the weekend, smashing nine internal windows.</p>
        
            <p>They also damaged a microwave and oven, and knocked computers to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Wiremu Paniora said they had to move forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel for [the children] because it's their equipment, and their playground," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their fun-time's been taken away from them, but we carry on, and that's what it is."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking anyone who may have seen something to get in contact.</p>
        
            <p>They said those who might be given playground equipment as a gift, or see it for sale should be cautious if they suspect it's stolen.</p>
