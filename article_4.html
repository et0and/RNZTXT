            <p>The upper North Island has been hit by heavy rain overnight, and the rain is expected to continue this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland and Waikato had seen the heaviest rainfall, with Waiuku in rural south Auckland recording about 30mm of rain overnight, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile up north: the rain that affected Auckland overnight moves away east of the Coromandel, but scattered heavy showers cross Northland from the west  pic.twitter.com/IJK68Uez33</p>
        
            <p>About 27mm of rain was recorded in the area between Hamilton and Pukekohe.</p>
        
            <p>Coromandel has also received about 10mm of rain over the past hour.</p>
        
            <p>The weather was expected as a low-risk thunderstorm had been forecast for the western North Island, from Taranaki to Cape Reinga, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Horowhenua, Wellington and the east coast would stay dry.</p>
        
            <p>While showers will be around today, cloud to our northwest represents steadier rain.This rain, some of it heavy with thunder, will impact much of the upper North Island tonight & tomorrow.Might be good to consider indoor plans. pic.twitter.com/grZtD8Lczp</p>
        
            <p>For the South Island, moderate thunderstorms have been forecast for Fiordland and Stewart Island, expected to bring up to 25mm of rain.</p>
        
            <p>Later in the day, North Otago and South Canterbury could also expect some thunderstorms.</p>
