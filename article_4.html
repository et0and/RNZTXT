            <p>A man who has spent 25 years in prison for the murder of west Auckland tyre-fitter Deane Fuller-Sandys has been granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Stone was imprisoned in 1999 for the murder, as well as the rape and murder of Leah Stephens.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Stone's conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal, alongside those of Gail Maney, Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen.</p>
        
            <p>The court ordered a retrial for Stone.</p>
        
            <p>Stone's lawyer Paul Wicks said: "The Court of Appeal declined to grant him bail pending delivery of its judgment and said that bail would be a matter for the High Court should a retrial be ordered."</p>
        
            <p>"An application for bail was filed in the High Court and he's been granted bail today with conditions," Wicks said.</p>
        
            <p>Deane Fuller-Sandys disappeared without trace in 1989 and for years he was believed to have drowned while fishing on Auckland's west coast.</p>
        
            <p>But after a cold-case investigation in the late 1990s, police accused Gail Maney of asking her associate Stephen Stone to kill Fuller-Sandys, in revenge for stealing drugs from her west Auckland home.</p>
        
            <p>The police case was that Fuller-Sandys was shot dead at that same Larnoch Road flat, in front of numerous witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>Maney and Stone were both found guilty of Fuller-Sandys' murder, and two other associates were found guilty as accessories after the fact.</p>
        
            <p>Maney spent 15 years in jail for the crime and was then put on life parole before her appeal was quashed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
        
            <p>The story of the murders is told in the RNZ/Stuff podcast Gone Fishing.</p>
