        <p>
Shallow magma means it is likely the eruption on White Island will continue, GNS says. Audio

            <p>An increase in sulphur dioxide emissions on Whakaari/White Island suggests magma is now at shallow levels, GNS Science volcanologists monitoring a minor eruption on the island say.</p>
        
            <p>The eruption at the volcano - off the coast of WhakatƒÅne - began on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>There has been volcanic activity on the island since May.</p>
        
            <p>Duty volcanologist Ery Hughes says shallow magma, or molten rock, can cause high temperature gas venting, which means it is likely the eruption will continue.</p>
        
            <p>But Hughes said there was no indication the activity will increase in magnitude and the chances of ash affecting the mainland was low.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science duty volcanologist Geoff Kilgour told Morning Report earlier today that the eruption was "very minor" and was only affecting the island itself and directly around it.</p>
        
            <p>The volcanic alert level remains at 3.</p>
