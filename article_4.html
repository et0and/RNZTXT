            <p>A bout of rain will be passed around the country like a football this week, as a cold front travels north on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures around the motu were set to drop, and a heavy rain warning was in place for Mt Taranaki. Heavy rain watches were also issued for the Taranaki and the Tararua Ranges.</p>
        
            <p>About 50mm of rain fell on Mt Taranaki overnight, while the Tararua Ranges had seen about 65mm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Clare O'Connor told Morning Report the North Island was in for a wet couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly this afternoon for those living along that northern coast from northern to eastern Bay of Plenty, we might see a few downpours along there. Then Tuesday, a little dry overall, but the rain does return to the North Island before then shifting back down to the South Island."</p>
        
            <p>Rain was also forecast for the South Island on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"The next couple of days are looking to dry out," O'Connor said.</p>
        
            <p>"But looking forward to the later half of the week, we do have another low approaching from the Tasman Sea which will bring rain again, at least to the west of the South Island."</p>
