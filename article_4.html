            <p>When Glenn Forsyth saw a dog on his rural driveway eating bread he'd put out for the birds he grabbed his gun and fired off a round.</p>
        
            <p>The slug struck the dog in the abdomen and it ran home yelping, where it collapsed in front of its owner.</p>
        
            <p>Now the 53-year-old Forsyth has been sentenced for killing the seven-year-old Catahuala, something he says he "deeply regrets".</p>
        
            <p>"My intention was to only scare it away," he said in a letter of apology to the dog's owner.</p>
        
            <p>At sentencing in the Tauranga District Court this week, the court heard the dog had previously been on his property, rifling around in his rubbish bins.</p>
        
            <p>After the shooting, its owner rushed the dog to a vet in Katikati, where it was given adrenaline and CPR.</p>
        
            <p>However it was unable to be saved, as the slug - which was lodged in its stomach - had caused "massive bleeding".</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth said he never meant to kill or hurt the dog. He had aimed at its feet and only wanted to scare it away.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter of explanation provided to the court, Forsyth said he'd seen the dog on his property in the months leading up to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>His letter said that, to him, the dog had appeared "malnourished" and "feral".</p>
        
            <p>The dog would get into his bins, tip them over, and rubbish would end up strewn across his driveway.</p>
        
            <p>He also explained that he had health challenges and anxiety at the time, which affected his state of mind.</p>
        
            <p>He had experienced "depression, anxiety and a sense of powerlessness".</p>
        
            <p>He wrote that while that was not an excuse, "these factors have contributed to the frustration that I felt on that day".</p>

            <p>Forsyth's letter of apology to the dog's owner said he deeply regretted his actions.</p>
        
            <p>"I have written to the dog owner expressing my sincere apologies for my actions and my condolences for his loss," Forsyth wrote to the court.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a mistake I very much regret and am sorry for."</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth's lawyer Christina Hatton told the court Forsyth had undergone counselling and said he was able to pay the $752.50 reparation sought.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Bill Lawson said he accepted Forsyth was remorseful.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clear that you understand the impact of your behaviour," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There were letters of support indicating Forsyth was "regarded highly" in his community.</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth had been willing to attend restorative justice, and while that could not happen for "various reasons", his willingness was something the judge took into account.</p>
        
            <p>However, Judge Lawson also told Forsyth, "this sort of ill-treatment of a dog with a firearm can often and sometimes does draw a sentence of imprisonment".</p>

            <p>Forsyth faced charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and the cruelty/ill-treatment of animals.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk of this type of behaviour is not just the risk to the community, discharging a firearm, but it's a risk to yourself... of being incarcerated," Judge Lawson said.</p>
        
            <p>However, taking on board Forsyth's acceptance of responsibility and clear remorse, the judge stopped short of a prison sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Lawson sentenced him to four months' community detention, with a curfew of 7pm to 7am.</p>
        
            <p>Forsyth was ordered to pay reparation of $752.50 for vet bills, and an order was made for the destruction of the firearm.</p>
