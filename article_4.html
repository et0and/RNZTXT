            <p>Councils and Waka Kotahi have changed their approach to a big road revamp in the Hutt Valley after a cost blowout.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, RNZ was first to report industry suggestions the RiverLink project's costs were ballooning from $700 million to over $1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Programme director Rod James denied that costs were likely to exceed $1 billion, but National Party MP and Lower Hutt resident Chris Bishop later confirmed the initial budget assigned by the previous Labour government would not be sufficient.</p>
        
            <p>The original alliance, formed to build a new bridge, highway interchange, stopbanks and train station, will now not deliver all the work.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, the regional council is taking over the stopbanks and river works.</p>
        
            <p>The Hutt City Council is doing the same for street works.</p>
        
            <p>The core bridge, highway and rail work will remain with the alliance.</p>
        
            <p>An update on costs has not been released.</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt mayor Campbell Barry said the programme - now called Te Wai Takamori o Te Awa Kairangi - would have long-lasting benefits for the region.</p>
        
            <p>
The initial budget for the project was $700 million, but MP Chris Bishop has confirmed that will not be sufficient.

            <p>"It makes sense for some aspects of the programme, such as local road improvements and streetscape works, that do not require direct integration with the major works, or with flood protection works, to be overseen by the council's inhouse experts," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will also enable the council to manage delivery and timing in a way which offers an affordable, best value for money solution."</p>
        
            <p>The alliance will have responsibility for the grade-separated State Highway 2 Melling interchange and Melling Bridge over the Hutt River.</p>
        
            <p>It is also promising "new and improved" walking and cycling paths.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi regional relationships director Emma Speight said there was more work to do to compete the alliance negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>"Strong partnerships are instrumental to delivering the integrated parts of the programme, and we're working to deliver a safer, more efficient and resilient transport system for the people of the Hutt Valley."</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington chair Daran Ponter said the regional council's in-house flood protection team would have responsibility for the stopbanks and river works.</p>
        
            <p>That move had been made in the best interest of ratepayers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The experts could deliver "affordable flood defences" that would integrate with the other projects, Ponter said.</p>
        
            <p>The team was "well equipped to protect Lower Hutt communities from the extreme weather events and floods predicted from our changing climate".</p>
