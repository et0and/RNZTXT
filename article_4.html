            <p>There is a high likelihood raw sewage has leaked into Wellington Harbour due to a broken pipe, Wellington Water believes.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider first responded to the break after reports of the slip near the BP station on State Highway Two between Wellington City and Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>The 150mm wastewater main lies in a steep gully above the petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>A geotechnical assessment on Wednesday identified that a joint had become disconnected on the pipe, with crews hoping to complete the repairs on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Sucker trucks have been in place on the site since midday Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water told RNZ it was still waiting on water sampling results, but said it was likely any sewage leaked into the harbour would be untreated.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council, the local regulator of water, has been notified.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider said it was working as quickly and safely as possible, while minimising the impact on communities and the environment.</p>
        
            <p>It could not yet say how much raw sewage could have leaked into the harbour or what broke the pipe.</p>
