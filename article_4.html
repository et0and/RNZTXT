            <p>Whangārei was awash with rainbow flags, sequins and colour on Sunday as the city hosted its second Pride Parade and Gayla.</p>
        
            <p>Several hundred members of Northland's rainbow community and their allies marched in a vibrant procession from Pohe Island across the landmark Te Matau ā Pohe bridge to Pūtahi Park, for an afternoon of celebration MC'd by drag stars Hugo Grrrl and Kerry Berry.</p>
        
            <p>Banners carried during the almost hour-long parade carried messages such as "Out and Proud", "Trans-form the World" and "Born this Way".</p>
        
            <p>Even police joined the festivities in a patrol car decorated with bold rainbow stripes.</p>
        
            <p>Gayla entertainment included dance, drag acts and a catwalk competition, plus a circus skills zone for kids run by Dargaville-based Circus Kumarani.</p>

            <p>There were no incidents and a solitary protester left the park before the parade arrived.</p>
        
            <p>The inclusive event, hosted by Whangārei Proud, was first held last year to boost pride and visibility among Northland's rainbow community.</p>
        
            <p>Cory Fernmoor, one of the organisers, said the parade and gayla would be back next year, "even bigger, better and gayer".</p>
