            <p>Taking laptops and liquids out of carry-on bags is now a thing of the past for passengers travelling internationally from Auckland Airport.</p>
        
            <p>From today, security lines will now use will use Computed Tomography (CT) scanning machines, which create 3D images of bags in real-time.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the machines will speed up security lines, while maintaining strong security measures.</p>
        
            <p>"Creating a more efficient and seamless travel experience is important for holidaymakers and businesses, enabling faster movement through our airports and reducing the risk of flight delays," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a great example of innovative technology being used to reduce barriers and deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders. Maintaining strong security measures at our airports is critical, and this technology ensures this."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport accounts for 75 percent of New Zealand's international departures.</p>
        
            <p>International travellers departing from Christchurch and Wellington have been able to leave laptops and liquids in their carry-on since last December.</p>
        
            <p>The machines will be rolled out at domestic airports across the country by the end of this year.</p>
        
            <p>Rules around volume limits in containers will not change.</p>
