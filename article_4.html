            <p>New Zealand's national carrier has advised passengers who had travel plans to and from Nouméa to put them on hold until mid-December due to the ongoing uncertainty in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Monday, Air New Zealand said it has extended its suspension of Auckland-Nouméa service, citing security fears for passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The national carrier ceased flights between Auckland and the French territory's capital, Nouméa on 15 June, amid violent civil unrest.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said it had planned to resume flights on 28 September but has now prolonged the suspension until 14 December.</p>
        
            <p>General Manager International Jeremy O'Brien said "pockets of unrest" continue in New Caledonia and "safety is priority".</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that this will be disappointing for customers who have travel plans to and from Nouméa and we apologise for the disruption this causes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a decision we have taken lightly, but as there are still pockets of civil unrest, safety is our number one priority."</p>
        
            <p>The airline said customers booked directly with Air New Zealand to travel to Nouméa will have their flights automatically held in credit.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to limited options and continued uncertainty in the region, customers will not be rebooked on flights to Nouméa via alternative services."</p>
        
            <p>Customers can also opt to receive a full refund on their booking, the airline said.</p>
        
            <p>It is advising customers booked through a travel agent should contact them directly to discuss the options available to them.</p>
