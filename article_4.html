            <p>The death of a man on Waiheke Island in Auckland last month is not being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Lee Perry was found in the water on 15 November and police had initially been treating his death as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Chris Allan said police were making enquiries on behalf of the Coroner, and continuing to look into how Perry's vehicle crashed and burnt out.</p>
        
            <p>Police were treating this, and his death, as two separate incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Perry's family has been advised of the development and were being provided with support, Allan said.</p>
