            <p>A freedom camping advocate says more and more working people are having to live in cars and vans due to the cost of living and rising rental prices.</p>
        
            <p>Median rental prices increased nearly 30 percent from October 2019 to August 2024, according to TradeMe's rent price index.</p>
        
            <p>One woman who ran several online pages about freedom camping said many working people were contacting her saying they were considering moving into a van or a car as they could not afford to rent.</p>
        
            <p>Others said the government's changes to emergency housing criteria had made living in their vehicle a more viable option.</p>
        
            <p>In the latest in RNZ's Crunching the Numbers series, we spoke to kiwis living on four wheels or in a tent.</p>
        
            <p>Jono Davis and his partner Kathy have been on the road for a few months now, living in their van across Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>They lived in a house in Kawerau for seven years, but once the landlord sold it they were left without many options.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the rentals that are out there now are beyond your reach, if you're in a situation like us."</p>
        
            <p>So instead of renting they decided to move into a van they had recently bought.</p>
        
            <p>It was not big - there was just enough space for a bed and a few essentials, including a fridge, toilet and fresh water.</p>
        
            <p>Jono had tried the van life before - but he said this time around it was a shock to see the number of homeless people driving into freedom camping spots after dark to sleep in their cars.</p>
        
            <p>"They kip down for the night, and leave early in the morning as if they're heading off to work sort of thing.</p>
        
            <p>"And I gotta think - what sort of life is that? You're trying to make ends meet, trying to get somewhere in life, you're working hard and you can't have a roof over your head. That's rough."</p>

            <p>Jono was on a supported living payment because he was blind, and his partner Kathy was on the jobseeker benefit after recently getting a business diploma.</p>
        
            <p>She was looking for an accounting job, but said once she found one they would likely stay living in their van to save money.</p>
        
            <p>Recent government changes to emergency housing criteria, required people to make "reasonable attempts" to find other housing and pay their contribution or risk losing their benefit for 13 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Kathy said this meant emergency accommodation was not an option for them.</p>
        
            <p>"Why would you go into a motel, sit there for a week, apply for houses that you can't afford then potentially lose what measly amount you're getting? There's no logic to it."</p>
        
            <p>The lifestyle had put a strain on her and Jono's relationship at times, she said, but they were now in a happy routine.</p>

            <p>Wellington woman Teiti Nepia decided to camp in a tent last summer, biking to work each day, after struggling to find a rental where she worked as a chef in the affluent suburb of Island Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"For a small studio, so that's not a one bedroom flat even, but a small studio will start at $400 upwards. I just couldn't afford that. That would have been over 60+ percent of my income at the time."</p>
        
            <p>She wanted to "peacefully resist the high cost of living" and what she said were unsustainable rent prices - while teaching people how to freedom camp responsibly.</p>
        
            <p>It was a challenge - Nepia said even basic things like finding somewhere to have a shower each day kept her busy.</p>
        
            <p>She made the decision out of necessity, but as someone who loved the outdoors, she also enjoyed the connection to the whenua.</p>

            <p>"I love waking up to sunsets and I love sitting on my swag and watching the sun go down. So it's beautiful when you're living out there the force of nature is actually stunning."</p>
        
            <p>Nepia filmed the experience and made a documentary, called HOME - a feeling of belonging.</p>
        
            <p>But after five months living outside, working and making the documentary she became exhausted and got sick - she now lived in social housing.</p>
        
            <p>Bette Cosgrove was a freedom camping advocate and the admin of several Facebook pages about the lifestyle.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm getting more and more people messaging me saying, 'oh look I have to live in my vehicle now, what do I do about these freedom camping laws?'... and I never had that before."</p>
        
            <p>Changes to freedom camping rules brought in last year meant camper's vehicles needed to be self-contained - but homeless people were exempt from this.</p>
        
            <p>Neither local councils or the Ministry of Social Development kept an accurate record of the number of homeless people living in vehicles.</p>
