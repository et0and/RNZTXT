        <h2>Watch: 'Hectic' truck blaze on SH1</h2>
        <p>
Fire and Emergency crews have now mostly contained the blaze on State Highway 1 at Waipapa Bay, north of Kaikōura, on Friday afternoon.

            <p>A large truck fire along a major South Island highway is causing a lengthy wait for motorists and holidaymakers.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) crews have now mostly contained the blaze on State Highway 1 at Waipapa Bay, north of Kaikōura, on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the scene, where flames and billows of smoke were stemming from the truck's trailer, shortly after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>SH1 was subsequently closed as crews from Kaikōura and Seddon fought the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were still on scene later in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The road had since been reopened with traffic management in place.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch man James Mackie, who had been traveling south with his family, told RNZ he first spotted fire in scrub alongside the highway, before discovering the flaming truck.</p>
        
            <p>"I jumped the fence and got into a paddock and got a side view of the truck.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty hectic, I was standing about 50 metres away but the heat was unreal."</p>
        
            <p>The truck cab was able to disengage from the trailer and the driver was uninjured, Mackie said.</p>
        
            <p>Contents from the truck, such as smiley face balls, hula hoops and frisbees could be seen strewn across the road and shrub, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were starting fires in the dry shrubs.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver was unaware it was lighting fires ... that's what we noticed first."</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said motorists should expect delays to continue and to follow instructions of emergency services.</p>
