            <p>The re-opening of State Highway 1 over the Brynderwyns has been pushed back to the end of June - adding another seven weeks to what was supposed to be a nine-week closure.</p>
        
            <p>The highway had been due to reopen on 13 May after extensive slip repairs and road strengthening on the south side of the Brynderwyn Hills.</p>
        
            <p>However, those plans were scuttled by two new slips on 26 and 30 April.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi infrastructure delivery manager Mark Kinvig said the project had been on track until that point.</p>
        
            <p>He said the agency was aware how difficult the highway closure was for Northland businesses and communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority has been to undertake geotechnical and safety assessments to determine the best option for stabilising the hillside and getting State Highway 1 Brynderwyn Hills open as quickly as possible," Kinvig said.</p>
        
            <p>"While our plan is to reopen at the end of June, if there's a significant amount of unexpected rain, or further instability is found, that could delay the reopening timing."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA remained committed to completing the work as quickly as possible to ensure a safe and reliable road over the Brynderwyns in the short to medium term, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Digger operators were working from a platform at the top of the slips, removing soil from the ridgeline to reduce the risk of further slips.</p>
        
            <p>That would allow fallen soil and trees to be safely removed from the bottom of the slips.</p>
        
            <p>Kinvig said the team was working seven days a week, weather permitting, to remove up to 55,000 cubic metres of earth at Kauri Tree Corner, where the slips occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"We are maximising the number of trucks, diggers and workers on site to ensure the soil removal is a continuous operation, utilising daylight hours, to get it clear.</p>
        
            <p>"We have built in contingency for poor weather, however the ground conditions remain unstable and continue to be actively monitored by staff and GPS sensors. There is a risk of further slips until we complete the stabilisation works."</p>
        
            <p>Three detours are in place for traffic between Northland and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The east coast route, via Waipū's Cove Road, is for light traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Paparoa-Oakleigh Road, just west of the Brynderwyns, is open to all traffic except heavy trucks in the HPMV (high productivity motor vehicle) class.</p>
        
            <p>HPMVs have to use State Highways 12 and 14 around the west coast.</p>
        
            <p>Even once the repairs to SH1 over the Brynderwyns are complete, the road is expected to last only another seven to 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition government has committed to building a new, four-lane highway around the Brynderwyns within 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, work is continuing on the other section of SH1 in Northland closed by major storm damage.</p>
        
            <p>The highway through Mangamuka Gorge, south of Kaitāia, closed in August 2022 and is expected to reopen by the end of this year.</p>
