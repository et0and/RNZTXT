            <p>The Hawke's Bay Regional Council (HBRC) is under fire for failing to carry out its functional role over the past four years.</p>
        
            <p>A damning review released Wednesday found major shortfalls in the regional council's flood protections during Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Shortfalls like underestimating flood risk, not including data from historic floods, no hazard mapping for 'super events', no trigger warnings for river levels, ad-hoc and unclear communication with Civil Defence and weak planning rules that led to houses being built in known flood risk areas.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa Mayor Craig Little says the report's 47 recommendations are things that should already be in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Really this is what HBRC, regional council, should be doing. So I guess therefore they've failed. It's not good reading for them and they're fundamental functions they should be doing.</p>
        
            <p>"We're saying it's the last 3 to 4 years they've really failed. They need to take this seriously now and start doing what they should be doing and keep to their core functions. I wouldn't be looking at any flowery stuff as they have a lot of work to do," Little said.</p>
        
            <p>He said residents were angry there had been no empathy shown from HBRC over the recent flooding in Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>"That's all it would've have taken a 'hey look we don't know what's happened but we're really sorry' and they just can't say that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Esk Valley resident Daniel Gale agreed. He wanted to see more action from authorities and talked to the panel for the Independent Flood Review on Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>"My main concern was lack of trigger points, a lack of evacuation plans, and I spoke extensively about the Esk River Mouth and the land surrounding it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to see most of our concerns validated, however we want to see action. We've lost faith as a community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Gale's message to the regional council was clear.</p>
        
            <p>"Get out of your office, come and see us... and act."</p>
        
            <p>The HBRC said it has already begun work on 22 of the recommendations and will discuss the other 25 at a council meeting next month.</p>
        
            <p>"Although a lot of people may not see it, a lot of work has been done for our communities impacted and we will continue to do so," Regional Council chair Hinewai Ormsby said.</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ asked her whether there would be an apology made over the findings in this latest review, this was her response:</p>
        
            <p>"Our review was not about HBRC causing a flood... the first few lines were around this being largest flood in New Zealand on record... it's an extraordinary event, one of a scale and magnitude we've never seen...</p>
        
            <p>"Our aroha goes out to everyone that was impacted, that's really at the heart of it, that's really what we want to say," she said.</p>
