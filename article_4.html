            <p>A man accused of murdering a woman in her Blenheim home last month can now be identified as her son.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched after Jennifer Phyllis Sheehan was found dead at her property in Blenheim on the morning of November 25.</p>
        
            <p>Her son, Paul Thomas Armon, a cleaner of Blenheim, was arrested shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>The police charge sheet lists the date of the alleged offence as 22 November.</p>
        
            <p>The 55-year-old entered no plea when he appeared via audio-video link in the High Court this morning.</p>
        
            <p>He was granted interim name suppression at an initial brief appearance in the Blenheim District Court before name suppression lapsed unchallenged today.</p>
        
            <p>Sheehan's family said after she was discovered that they had been left feeling "shocked and utterly lost for words".</p>
        
            <p>Her nephew, Jarrod, paid tribute to Sheehan in a post online, saying he was "angry" and "confused, but mostly sad".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm shocked and utterly lost for words about what has happened to my Aunty Jenny," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jarrod said he still "can't comprehend" what happened and "probably never will understand" how it could happen, "especially in Blenheim".</p>
        
            <p>He described Sheehan as having an "infectious laugh".</p>
        
            <p>"Mainly I'm sad for my kids, who she loved and treated like her own grandchildren... I genuinely felt the love she shared for our kids and that's something I will never forget," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jarrod said he felt "robbed of time that I'll never get again". He said he would think of Sheehan every time he hears a song by Elvis and smile when something "quirky reminds me of her".</p>
        
            <p>"I hope to remember her stories so she continues to live through them and we can laugh for many years to come," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Armon's lawyer Rob Harrison said detailed psychiatric reports would be needed to assess his fitness to plead or stand trial, which was scheduled for August 2026.</p>
        
            <p>He would enter a plea at a case review scheduled for 28 March.</p>
