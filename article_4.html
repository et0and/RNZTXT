            <p>Lines company Vector is continuing to work to fix several power outages across central Auckland, including one caused by a helium balloon on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Vector said an outage in Grey Lynn was due to a balloon coming into contact with the power lines.</p>
        
            <p>It said crews are on-site to assess and safely restore power.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff earlier reported residents on Cockburn St in Grey Lynn heard a loud bang before the electricity went off.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, some Aucklanders in the Newmarket and Grafton areas were without power earlier on Friday afternoon. Vector said all customers in Newmarket have had their power restored.</p>
        
            <p>Vector said crews are repairing an underground cable fault in Grafton, with a small number of customers without power until it if fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Aucklanders heading away this afternoon for the region's long Anniversary weekend can expect a slow exit from the city.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA's website warned of congestion and delays on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>For people heading south, by late afternoon it was taking about an about longer than usual to get from the city to Bombay. While a breakdown on State Highway 1 at Manurewa meant one southbound lane was blocked.</p>
        
            <p>For people heading north, holiday congestion that had built up to noticeable levels shortly before noon on Friday, meant it was taking longer than usual to get from the city to Wellsford, NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>North of Gisborne, State Highway 2 was closed at Ormond, near Waipaoa Road, after a serious crash about 1.10pm, but had reopened by 4.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>One person was critically injured, while three others were also taken to hospital in serious or moderate conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy traffic was also expected in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty during the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>And several large music events were planned for Tauranga, Taupō and Whitianga, which were likely to add to congestion on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>In Waikato, regular closures of a section of State Highway 1 to allow asphalting work to be carried out between Tīrau and Putaruru were paused for the long weekend, and would begin again on Tuesday 28 January.</p>
