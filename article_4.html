            <p>The number of children becoming susceptible to measles is growing by about 1000 a month, according to public health experts.</p>
        
            <p>The figure has been highlighted in a briefing paper by the Public Health Communication Centre, a group of leading doctors and public health researchers.</p>
        
            <p>Childhood immunisation rates are stuck on about 82 percent, and for years have been below the 95 percent needed for population-wide immunity.</p>
        
            <p>That means the proportion of unimmunised people in the population is continuing to grow.</p>
        
            <p>It has resulted in a vaccination rate so low in children under 8 that it has reduced the level of herd immunity whicn helped slow the spread of the last epidemic, in 2019, the briefing said. Even then, hundreds of children were hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions were now "primed" for a big epidemic, the briefing authors said.</p>
        
            <p>They were very similar to the big epidemics of the 1980s and 1990s, with the added danger that there were now more unprotected young adults.</p>
        
            <p>Doctors at the centre renewed their calls for an urgent school and preschool-based immunisation campaign, and checks at the border.</p>
        
            <p>Health minister Shane Reti in January said he was increasingly worried about the possibility of a measles outbreak in New Zealand. Reti said immunisation had been identified as one of the government's health targets, and it would be a high priority.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, pharmacists have been given the ability to vaccinate under-5s.</p>
        
            <p>The government has not implemented pre-school vaccination programmes nor checks at the border.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora/Health NZ has said it has a said it had a national response plan ready to go if an outbreak occurred, including an incident response team, which was mobilised six times in 2023 because of cases which came over the border.</p>
