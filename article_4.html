        <h2>Why Wednesdays have become the favourite day at school</h2>
        <p>
By letting students spend a whole day each week working on vocational projects and electives, Papakura High School has started to see big improvements in student attendance and engagement.

            <p>Every Wednesday at a South Auckland school, students can forget about reading writing and maths, and instead spend their time making jewellery, weightlifting, barbering, broadcasting or one of many other options.</p>
        
            <p>By letting them spend a whole day each week working on vocational projects and electives, Papakura High School has started to see big improvements in student attendance and engagement.</p>
        
            <p>In the two years since introducing the scheme, the number of chronically absent students has dropped by 34 percent, the lowest it has been since before Covid.</p>
        
            <p>Papakura High School student Tama has been hard at work on piece of contemporary Māori art - it drew inspiration from reggae colours and featured the word 'Mana' in carved wooden lettering.</p>
        
            <p>He enjoyed getting to work with his hands on a Wednesday more than his normal schoolwork.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh I love it - break away from math. I hate math, but I love it," he laughed.</p>
        
            <p>Tama was hoping to sell the finished project online and reckoned he would be able to get about $1500 for it on Facebook marketplace.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if he was sure it would sell for that much money, he was confident.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, because it's Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Papakura High School's attendance statistics showed there was a 34 percent decrease in chronic truancy, defined as students whose average attendance was less than 70 percent, since 2023.</p>

            <p>Tumuaki Tuarua or deputy principal at the school Rebecca McGrath said the project system had helped those at-risk students the most.</p>
        
            <p>"The students who you may consider the more disengaged from regular learning - they are the students who are here every Wednesday."</p>
        
            <p>Another student who preferred practical learning over sitting in a class was Grayson. He has been spending his Wednesdays learning how to make jewellery.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to cut it out, polish it, sand it down and everything to make it look like an earring so it's all good to wear.</p>
        
            <p>"I just find this more funner, and more for my brain to learn with stuff like this - tools and stuff."</p>

            <p>For the students who love a good yarn, there was the Kura FM project, where they practiced being a radio announcer.</p>
        
            <p>Kylie said being a part of this project meant he looked forward to school on Wednesday every week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's nice having normal classes four days a week, and then you're looking forward to Wednesday because you have a different class, and your mates might be there."</p>
        
            <p>"The people they bring in to teach you different stuff, they can be nice too, and learning different career paths for you that's cool too."</p>
        
            <p>He saw radio as a possible career in the future, but had an unorthodox plan for how he would go about it.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't tell anyone this, I might start a pirate station. I'd probably be holed up somewhere where they can't find me, playing soul music from my basement."</p>

            <p>McGrath said the improved attendance and engagement on Wednesdays flowed through to the other days of the week, as students built relationships with teachers and other students.</p>
        
            <p>The school's average attendance had increased from 70 percent in term three last year, to 77 percent this year.</p>
        
            <p>Last month Associate Education Minister David Seymour revealed a new strategy for lifting school attendance rates, including potential fines for parents whose students are regularly absent.</p>
        
            <p>But McGrath did not believe that punishment was a good strategy for lifting attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the problem with focusing too heavily on punitive is it breaks relationships. And right now we are in a crisis. I don't think we're in a crisis of attendance, I think we're in a crisis of relationships."</p>
        
            <p>And for aspiring woodworker Tama, the Wednesday project helped him develop skills he hoped to use in a future career as a carver or carpenter.</p>
