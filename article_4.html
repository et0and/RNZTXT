        <p>
The fact that police do not hold her DNA does not necessarily mean she was from overseas, a detective inspector says. Audio

            <p>Police have a DNA profile of the woman found dead in Gulf Harbour last week, but are yet to identify her.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tim Williams said the DNA obtained by police did not match anyone in their records.</p>
        
            <p>The fact that police did not hold her DNA did not necessarily mean she was from overseas, he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"The police hold DNA from those that we interact with and obviously a lot of our public don't interact with the police, so it's not unusual that we don't have a DNA profile from this victim.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to work with our overseas counterparts including Interpol to see if that can provide some answers."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said police were hopeful the DNA would ultimately help determine the victim's identity.</p>
        
            <p>Police believed that the woman may be Chinese, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority remains on confirming their identification and results of further examinations and tests are still pending."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said police were looking at what type of clothing the woman was wearing and the rubbish bags that her body was wrapped in but would not be drawn on whether or not they could be purchased in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Overseas Police and Interpol have been contacted to help with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police received almost 100 phone calls from members of the public trying to help them with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Officers are still reviewing those tips and CCTV footage, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched after a fisherman found the body wrapped in plastic bags on 13 March by the Gulf Harbour ferry terminal.</p>
        
            <p>Police have released of the blue pyjama bottoms and a light-coloured singlet with an emblem, that she was wearing.</p>
        
            <p>"The very nature of this discovery means this is a complex investigation - and it will take time," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"In saying that, the community can continue to be reassured that police are committed to holding the person, or persons, responsible to account."</p>
