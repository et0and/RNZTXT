During disasters like Cyclone Gabrielle, cellphones become a vital way to gather information, but won't be much use without working phone towers.

            <p>A working cellphone can be the difference between life and death during a natural disaster.</p>
        
            <p>When cellphones failed to transmit emergency alerts in 2019 wildfires in California, the state ordered telecommunication companies to have 72 hours of backup power to cellphone towers in high-risk places.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, hundreds of towers went without power for two days when Cyclone Gabrielle smashed the power grid two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>But for most towers, battery back-up lasts just a few hours, with arguments still raging over whether batteries, generators or some other backup would be better.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact, it seems to have fallen off the radar a little at the government level... and that's really worrying for our businesses and our communities," says Hawke's Bay's regional economic development agency head Lucy Laitinen.</p>
        
            <p>Every respondent to a recent survey put upgrading infrastructure at the top, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A study commissioned by her agency and other Hawke's Bay business leaders seven months ago called for 48 hours of battery back-up.</p>

            <p>"It's sitting there, waiting for someone to action that," said Shayne Walker, a board member on the development agency.</p>
        
            <p>The main cyclone inquiry stated 10 months ago that investment in longer-lasting cell site batteries was wanted, but government direction on the standards was needed.</p>
        
            <p>But no standards have been forthcoming - and there are concerns that batteries were not even the answer.</p>
        
            <p>The messages from government have been unclear to many - a few weeks ago, officials in a short email told 40 councils and companies the government's work to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure was being stopped, with no indication why or what might replace it.</p>
        
            <p>The threat remains of a mass power cut taking out cellphone towers in a big disaster, even though the towers themselves may be okay, as happened at hundreds of towers in the North Island during Gabrielle and other big storms in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Things are somewhat better now - newer technology means the batteries can last a bit longer than the 4-8 hours seen during Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Laitinen and Walker said there was more talk than action. Walker led local efforts to restore cellphone coverage during Gabrielle, nabbing a chopper to fly a 1.5-tonne generator in to Wairoa.</p>
        
            <p>"It was the first request from council to deal with the cellphone tower in town," said Walker, of Māori Growth Partners.</p>
        
            <p>Officials frequently failed to prioritise communications, even obstructing efforts to get fuel to generators to re-power cell towers, multiple official inquiries have found.</p>
        
            <p>So engineers who wanted to fly in to power up outlying towers, such as at Tutira, to restore the cell network, turned to Walker.</p>
        
            <p>"The number one thing was communication."</p>
        
            <p>Since the storms, local people had taken the initiative, buying their own generators and Starlink satellite links.</p>
        
            <p>"If our communities aren't safe then we've got to do something else about it," said Walker.</p>
        
            <p>California's 72-hour backup power mandate has faced industry pushback over costs and how to do it.</p>
        
            <p>Paul Brislen - a spokesperson for big telcos in New Zealand - said the local pushback was not about the cost, which the Hawke's Bay study estimated could be $700m for big batteries nation-wide, but that other technology like solar was better.</p>
        
            <p>"What we are saying to the government is if you want to mandate a particular approach to back-up power, you need to mandate that so we can invest in that," Brislen said.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were not hearing what they needed.</p>
        
            <p>"We want some clarity and we want some direction right across the board from the civil defence... local council, all the way through central government."</p>
        
            <p>The telcos have sought changes to consent rules to allow bigger batteries, which the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is working on.</p>
        
            <p>Generators were the other option used a lot during Gabrielle, but this was also constrained.</p>
        
            <p>A few key towers have permanent backup generators, but there are strict constraints around fuelling, refuelling and maintaining these.</p>
        
            <p>Hylton Read struck the limits during Cyclone Gabrielle. He needed to get to the generator running his company's transmission tower, serving multiple FM stations on a hill outside Havelock North.</p>
        
            <p>The scramble over what to do about a slip on the road was made worse when "we lost all our cell phone coverage, so I couldn't contact people", Read said.</p>
        
            <p>He went to the Civil Defence centre, where a guard would not let him in - "fair enough," he said - but hooked him up with the owner of a truck and a digger.</p>
        
            <p>"The chap I had with me, he said to him, 'Here's the keys, just take it and do it', so that was a big relief."</p>
        
            <p>The hands-on of local heroics contrasted with MBIE's approach, which is mostly hands-off.</p>
        
            <p>"Telecommunications networks are owned and operated by private companies, therefore the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure sits with the network operators themselves," the ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>But it has recently helped put 24-hour backup batteries at 44 towers run by the Rural Connectivity Group, along with six hubs. There is also funding to boost 50 more.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere during Gabrielle, many cell towers relied for a power reboot on having portable generators flown in. Telcos have spent a million dollars on buying more portables since the storm.</p>
        
            <p>It is not the comprehensive response the North Island Severe Weather Event inquiries envisaged.</p>
        
            <p>"Who is going to build back better?" asked Walker.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely needs to be clearer."</p>
