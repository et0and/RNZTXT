            <p>Protesters picketed a Queenstown wastewater plant as they called on the council to scrap plans for treated sewage discharged into a local river.</p>
        
            <p>Last week Queenstown Lakes District councillors were briefed behind closed doors about dumping more than 12,000 cubic metres of treated effluent into the Shotover River.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Nikki Gladding revealed the confidential plan, accusing the council of secrecy.</p>
        
            <p>The protest near the plant started hours before the council was due to go public with the plan.</p>
        
            <p>Their signs include 'Toot not to Pollute' and 'Save Our Rivers', prompting a cacophony of honks from drivers.</p>

            <p>One local resident said the council should be ashamed of lack of transparency as he only found out about the plan when the whisteblower councillor spoke out.</p>
        
            <p>He said he wanted to see councillors swim in the river if they believed the dumping of effluent wouldn't impact river quality.</p>
        
            <p>
The protest moved to line the road entering the Shotover Wastewater Treatment Plant.

            <p>Protesters outside the plant chanted "QLDC, we don't need your secrecy", ahead of the council hosting a media stand up.</p>
