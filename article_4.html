            <p>A neighbour told RNZ he had heard shouting and looked out his window to see a man lying in the road.</p>
        
            <p>The people in the house had only been at the address for a few weeks, he said, and there had been fights and conflict there.</p>
        
            <p>Another local person said he had rushed to help a nurse who stopped to give assistance to the the injured man, and gave his T-shirt to her as she tried to staunch the bleeding.</p>
        
            <p>He said he saw no evidence of gang membership on the man who succumbed to his injuries and died at the scene.</p>

            <p>Earlier a resident said the neighbourhood was quiet, but had its share of petty crime, and the property was a "known party house" with "gang-related stuff in there".</p>
        
            <p>Investigators were loading equipment into the property, RNZ's reporter at the scene said.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic outside the house was building up as locals slowed to look down the cordoned off driveway, and local children were riding their bikes past the scene on their way to school.</p>
