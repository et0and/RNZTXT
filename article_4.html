            <p>A ban on outdoor fires has been put in place for parts of Marlborough from Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A prohibited fire season came into place for the Marlborough South zone at 8am on Wednesday 10 January until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>The ban will also suspend any previously granted outdoor fire permits.</p>
        
            <p>Declaring the prohibited season, Fire and Emergency's Marlborough group manager Chris Hayles said there was a very high fire danger due to the hot dry weather.</p>
        
            <p>"Fires will start and spread very easily and could be extremely difficult to contain," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The public should check any old fires to ensure they are fully extinguished, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rake the area out and apply water.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a lot more dry material around than last year. Avoid any activity that is heat producing in dry areas, for example welding, grinding, or parking vehicles in long dry grass."</p>
        
            <p>The Marlborough South zone encompasses all land in the Marlborough District to the south of the Wairau River, including the flat land from the Eastern side of State Highway 1 from Tuamarina to Rarangi. It also includes Department of Conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who wants to check whether their property sits within the southern zone can do so by visiting the [www.checkitsalright.nz checkitsalright website] and entering their address.</p>
