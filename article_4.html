            <p>Fire crews have extinguished a blaze on Auckland's Māngere Mountain.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after another scrub fire on Saturday night destroyed three hectares of vegetation and took several hours to put out.</p>
        
            <p>The second fire broke out about 3.15pm, but Fire and Emergency said it had now been extinguished.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson earlier said the blaze was burning through a grass area measuring 30 square metres.</p>
        
            <p>Three fire trucks were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, 19 crews fought the fire that broke out Saturday just before 9.30pm.</p>
