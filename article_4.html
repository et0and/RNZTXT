            <p>A change in funding for Tauranga's civic precinct, Te Manawataki o Te Papa, could save ratepayers $1million a year in interest.</p>
        
            <p>The $306m precinct in the city centre will include a library and community hub, civic whare (public meeting house), exhibition gallery and museum.</p>
        
            <p>The commission applied to fund the $151.5m ratepayer portion of the project through an Infrastructure Funding and Financing levy.</p>
        
            <p>The levy proposal was rejected by Housing Minister Chris Bishop in June because he said it was important the incoming council had their say on it.</p>
        
            <p>Now the council will apply to the Local Government Financing Agency (LGFA) to fund the $151.5m.</p>
        
            <p>The LGFA provides a lower interest rate than an IFF levy, which would enable $1m yearly interest savings.</p>
        
            <p>Borrowing through the LGFA was possible because the government and funding agency are looking at increasing the debt limits, potentially up to 350 percent of revenue, for high-growth councils.</p>

            <p>Mayor Mahé Drysdale said using the Local Government Financing Agency was cheaper and provided more transparency than the levy because the debt was on the council's books.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was "very uncomfortable" with the levy because ratepayers could have been locked into a higher fixed rate for the next 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>The need for an IFF levy was "forced" on the commission because of the lack of head room with the council debt limit, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said the LGFA funding was a "very good solution".</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be cheaper and ultimately we'll save our ratepayers' money over time."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said the council had an important role in investing in and revitalising the CBD, said.</p>
        
            <p>There were significant risks to ratepayers if the council decided to pause or change the project, including losing $50m invested in the precinct build if it was stopped, he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was over $1b in private investment in the CBD as the council's desire to reinvigorate the area had given them confidence, Drysdale said.</p>

            <p>Councillor Rick Curach said he didn't want to cancel the project, but he wanted to delay it subject to community consultation, and definitive answers from project partners to make a responsible decision based on community views.</p>
        
            <p>Curach said it was largely a "vanity project" and he didn't buy into the value of it.</p>
        
            <p>He said he wasn't convinced of the cost to delay or cancel the project and raised concerns about the affordability of it for ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Rod Taylor said there was the potential for reputational damage if the council altered or stopped the project.</p>
        
            <p>This could be from their iwi partners, council staff who had worked on the project for years and from the private developers investing in the CBD, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What would it say about us if we stopped this project?"</p>

            <p>Deputy mayor Jen Scoular said the council needed to make sure it was adding value for the people of Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>"Are we progressing a project which they have been consulted on and has been there has been very positive feedback about?"</p>
        
            <p>Te Manawataki o Te Papa was consulted on in 2022, with 72 percent of respondents wanting the full precinct to be built.</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said there was an opportunity cost and money spent on a project couldn't be spent elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>"As we go forward it is important that we understand that, and we are prioritising the projects that we need in order to deliver for our people.</p>
        
            <p>"I am confident that the project as it stands right now at about $306 million is currently on time and on budget."</p>
        
            <p>The remaining $154.5m for the precinct would be funded from grants, development contributions and selling surplus council assets.</p>
