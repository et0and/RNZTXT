            <p>Wairarapa locals are outraged after hundreds joined a boy racer event over the weekend that turned violent.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd threw fireworks, bottles and rocks at police during the car meet on a rural road near Masterton - smashing the back window of a police car.</p>
        
            <p>Six people were arrested, two cars were impounded and others received infringement notices and licence suspensions.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there were not available to speak to Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>But Masterton District Council mayor Gary Caffell said the "rather horrific scenes" were "really disappointing" for the community.</p>
        
            <p>Caffell congratulated police on how it handled the incident and said officers did a "great job" bringing it to an end.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report the community was lucky to get away with nobody being seriously injured or killed as "that could've happened".</p>
        
            <p>Caffell said a major concern with such events was the amount of spectators they drew that "egged on" the drivers.</p>
        
            <p>He said those watching were complicit and should be fined, too.</p>
        
            <p>"What needs to be done is that we need to get really tough.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been encouraged by the words of the police minister that he's going to get tough on this sort of anti-social behaviour, so, you know, those are the sorts of things that need to be looked at.</p>
        
            <p>"What we need is to completely remove these sorts of incidents away from our communities. Unless we get tough, unless we [bear] down, not only on those who are racing but those who are watching them, then it's not going to happen."</p>
        
            <p>Waipā District Council and Christchurch City Council have introduced bylaws to restrict boy racing in its areas.</p>
        
            <p>Caffell said he was interested in looking further into what the councils had done to see if it was something his area could implement.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that councils have difficulties in getting bylaws or in making bylaws that handle these situations.</p>
        
            <p>"Anything that can be done in that regard, I'm really in support of so we will certainly be looking at what other councils are doing."</p>
