            <p>State Highway 1 through the Brynderwyn Hills, between Kaiwaka and WaipÅ«, has been reopened after heavy rain caused slips onto the road.</p>
        
            <p>The day-long closure came just a month after the highway's long-awaited reopening after extensive damage caused by flooding in 2023 was repaired.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said the highway reopened on Saturday evening and a temporary 30km/h speed limit was in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Crews have been hard at work on-site all day clearing slip material brought down by heavy rain early this morning," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"NZTA will continue monitoring the hill for any more movement to ensure it remains safe for road users.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank our contractors for the great work to clear the slip material, and we thank road users for their patience while this work was completed."</p>

            <p>The route is Northland's main connection with the rest of the country.</p>
        
            <p>There was a detour in place earlier for cars and other light vehicles detour via Nova Scotia Drive, Cove Road, Garbolino Road, and Kaiwaka-Mangawhai Road.</p>
        
            <p>In an earlier statement, NZTA said the detour was not suitable for trucks; instead, they needed to detour via State Highway 12 and SH14.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been advised by our council partners that Paparoa Oakley Road is unsuitable for freight at this time as there has been a significant under slip on the road."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA advised drivers to check road and weather conditions before they travelled.</p>
