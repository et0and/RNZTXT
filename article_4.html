        <h2>Aggressive pest plant discovered in Hawke's Bay</h2>
        <p>
The plant can prevent native species from establishing and block drains, causing flooding.

Senegal tea, a pest, forms rounded bushes up to 1.5m tall and usually puts down roots on the edge of waterways.

            <p>Senegal tea, an aggressive pest plant native to South America, has been found in Hawke's Bay for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council said the plant was first identified in water samples from Te Awa Mokotūāraro | Clive River.</p>
        
            <p>It said the species spread quickly, damaging environments and preventing native species from establishing, and could block drains, causing flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Catchment management lead biosecurity Matt Short said the regional council was surveying waterways to work out if the plant had travelled.</p>
        
            <p>"Senegal tea becomes dormant over winter and dies back to its roots, then re-sprouts in spring.</p>
        
            <p>"With the plant already dying back in places, it's important we use this small window to identify the scale of the spread."</p>
        
            <p>He was asking for the public's help to try and halt its spread by cleaning their gear thoroughly.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking everyone using these waterways - whether you're on a boat, a jet ski or walking on the berms - please check your gear and equipment for any weed fragments and leave them at the site, clean your gear thoroughly, then leave it out to dry before using again.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the 'check, clean, dry' method provides us with the best chance to help stop the spread."</p>
        
            <p>The regional council would finalise a control and management plan, with a goal of slowing the spread and removing the weed, when the survey was done.</p>
