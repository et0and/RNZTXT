        <h2>Fireworks season not fun for Aotearoa's pets - insurer</h2>
        <p>
Fireworks can be terrifying to dogs and cats because their superior hearing makes bangs sound louder and closer, a pet insurance company says, ahead of Guy Fawke's Night.

Pet are known to have much better hearing than humans - so random bangs, crashes and explosions from fireworks can be especially frightening to them.

            <p>Fireworks can be terrifying to dogs and cats because their superior hearing makes bangs sound louder and closer, a pet insurance company says, ahead of Guy Fawke's Night.</p>
        
            <p>PD Insurance, which specialises in pet insurance, has had several claims related to pets and fireworks, including dogs hit by cars while fleeing in panic and horses being badly tangled in fences, the company's chief operating officer Michele Le Long said.</p>
        
            <p>Some fireworks incidents involving pets could end in their death, or mean the pet has to be euthanised.</p>
        
            <p>However owners can take measures to keep their pets safe, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She recommended creating a safe space for pets, inside.</p>
        
            <p>Ideally this would be in the dark - with the flashes from the fireworks blocked - and, enclosed and filled with comforting things.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ Concert - partnering with the SPCA - will be broadcasting its first ever Concert for Animals programme on Guy Fawkes night, 5 November, from 6pm to midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the music - which includes classical and soft rock - was chosen because of its use in animal research, and because it was likely to be "soothing, cheerful, slow and a good pitch for pets, SPCA scientific officer Dr Alison Vaughan told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Fireworks went on sale on 2 November and sales end on 5 November, although most councils allow fireworks to be let off any time of year on private property.</p>
        
            <p>As the weekend before this year's Guy Fawkes Night draws to a close, a Fire and Emergency New Zealand spokesperson said so far it had been relatively calm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire brigades throughout the country had been preparing for a busy few days during the firework sales period.</p>
        
            <p>They pleaded with people to especially be careful not to light fireworks in high risk conditions,</p>
        
            <p>"If it is windy and dry in your area, don't light them ... Many parts of the country are drier than normal for this time of year," FENZ community education manager Tom Ronaldson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd rather people didn't buy fireworks - but if people are going to purchase fireworks, then before lighting them they should always check it is safe to do so by visiting [www.checkitsalright.nz checkitsalright.nz], clicking on fireworks and then checking it's all right to light."</p>
        
            <p>And anyone planning to light fireworks can find a list of how to do so safely on the FENZ website.</p>
