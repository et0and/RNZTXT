            <p>A restricted fire season is in force for the Otago Lakes region, with the danger of forest fires likely to reach very extreme in the coming week.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the zone covers Queenstown and Wanaka. They now join Central and Upper Waitaki regions in having fire restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>It means anyone wanting to light a fire in the open air will need a permit.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Otago district manager Phil Marsh said the risk of danger from forest fires was likely to increase from this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"This coming weekend and into the start of next week we are looking at a potential 'spike' period where forest fire danger will likely reach 'very extreme' in Lakes, Central and Upper Waitaki," Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"For that reason, we have made the decision to move Lakes into a restricted fire season."</p>
        
            <p>The restrictions are in place until further notice from Fire and Emergency.</p>
