            <p>Residents and staff at an Auckland transitional housing community are shaken after a shooting overnight, its manager says.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to reports of gunfire in two suburbs on Wednesday night, and were still looking for those responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 10.30pm, a gunshot rang out on Ahuwhenua Crescent in Onehunga, leaving a fist-sized hole in someone's garage door.</p>
        
            <p>The complex was run by the Monte Cecilia Housing Trust.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, chief executive Vicki Sykes said they were aware of the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>"Understandably, both residents and staff are feeling shaken by this event," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our primary concern at this stage is the safety and wellbeing of our community, so we are working closely with the police to provide them with all assistance possible for their investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Sykes said they wanted to thank the community for their support and understanding.</p>
        
            <p>She said they remained dedicated to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>Dani was in the complex on Wednesday night, visiting her sister at the house neighbouring the incident.</p>
        
            <p>She described hearing a loud bang.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a massive bang like a massive shot. At first we thought it was just like metal or something like that but once we came outside, the neighbours came up and said there were men with rifles who had shot through the garage of next door," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the incident was completely out of the ordinary for the area.</p>
        
            <p>"My sister's been here for almost two years, this is the first time, and I just happen to be here, that this incident has happened."</p>

Gun shots were fired through the window of a house on Haddon Street in Māngere East.

            <p>Half an hour after the Onehunga shooting- more gunfire was heard.</p>
        
            <p>This time at a property on Haddon Street in Māngere East, about 10 minutes' drive away.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple bullet holes could be seen in a window.</p>
        
            <p>A nearby resident told RNZ the shooting was worrying.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just out of the blue," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially if you have kids, young kids, it does kind of worry, what's happening in the community."</p>
        
            <p>Police forensic teams were busy at both locations.</p>
        
            <p>It was not known if the two shootings were connected, but police urged anyone with information on either incident to get in touch.</p>
