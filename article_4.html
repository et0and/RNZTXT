            <p>About 200 people have gathered in Whakatāne to mark the fifth anniversary of the Whakaari White Island eruption, which killed 22 people.</p>
        
            <p>Affected families, iwi, police, and firefighters attended a dawn karakia.</p>
        
            <p>It was held beside Te Hau Tutua Park, where those gathered can see the island.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was Lillani Hopkins, who had just boarded the boat back to Whakatāne with her father when the eruption happened.</p>
        
            <p>She told First Up fear set in along with the realisation others were still on the island as the ash cloud rolled towards the sea.</p>
        
            <p>The boat sped round the ash cloud and headed to the bay where they had docked, and she and her father began giving help.</p>
        
            <p>For years she had little recollection of the couple of hours they spent treating and triaging people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's only been in last couple of years meeting with the survivors and the people that we treated have I been able to piece together most of the things that have happened - because they remembered me doing things or me saying things or me sitting with them."</p>
        
            <p>She is still triggered by the smell of ash and sulphur, and was initially reluctant to explore the outdoors again - but that had changed. "There's no way of knowing what's going to happen and I'm going to live my life in fear of something big happening."</p>

            <p>Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell and Police Commissioner Richard Chambers attended the ceremony,</p>
        
            <p>Prayers were led in several different faiths before reflections and the the dropping of pōhutukawa flowers into the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>At noon, the families, along with dignitaries including Mitchell, Chambers and Whakatāne mayor Victor Luca, will meet at Te Mānuka Tūtahi Marae for a pōwhiri.</p>
        
            <p>Victim's families, who have travelled from Australia and Britain, will be given an opportunity to speak.</p>

            <p>At 2.11pm - the time Whakaari began to erupt five years ago - there will be a minute's silence followed by speeches, after which the families will be given an opportunity to speak.</p>
        
            <p>At 4pm, a design for a new memorial at the heads will be unveiled by Harawira's brother, sculptor Peter Harawira.</p>
        
            <p>The brother of Hayden Marshall-Inman, a tour guide who died in the eruption, said the anniversary day of 9 December has forever changed for his family and those of others killed.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Inman said efforts to support first responders, and a recent fundraising concert for a Whakaari memorial, has helped him cope with the grief.</p>
        
            <p>"An amazing concert in honour of all those both lost and those that were involved around the rescue and recovery and the support. I drive a few things around raising funds for our first responders and the like. that's I guess the positive way I try to channel my energies around grief."</p>
