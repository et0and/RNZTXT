            <p>Thermal drone imagery has shown the moment the stricken ferry Aratere was pulled from the shore after nearly 24 hours grounded.</p>
        
            <p>The Interislander ferry ran aground about 10pm Friday due to an apparent steering failure on a freight-only sailing.</p>
        
            <p>None of the 47 people on board - eight truck drivers and 39 crew - were injured.</p>
        
            <p>Aratere was refloated on Saturday night on the high tide.</p>

            <p>KiwiRail chief executive Peter Reidy earlier said ballast was drained from the ship and other weight transferred to raise the bow.</p>
        
            <p>"(Port Marlborough) tugs were then able to rock the vessel away from the shore."</p>
        
            <p>The ship's own engines were used to propel it into deeper water.</p>
        
            <p>The thermal drone imagery, shot by Skyworks, showed the Aratere moving smoothly away from the shore, while tugs Maungatea and Monowai pulled from the stern.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough mayor Nadine Taylor said the refloating was a team effort.</p>

            <p>"The speed of the response on site on Friday night is to be commended and many stayed throughout the night to assist," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Council has particularly appreciated the close working relationship with Port Marlborough as part of the response effort and the use of the two tugs that proved they really could - the Maungatea and Monowai.</p>
        
            <p>"This response was a team effort of professional and capable mariners and emergency responders who have achieved a wonderful outcome."</p>
        
            <p>The Aratere returned to its berth in Picton on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said the council would continue to work with KiwiRail, Port Marlborough and Maritime NZ on the next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"Oil spill booms will be placed around the Aratere once docked as a precautionary measure to ensure any environmental risk is mitigated," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the immediate response is over, council's coastal scientists will also conduct environmental surveys to assess any impact to the site."</p>
