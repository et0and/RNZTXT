            <p>Gisborne residents will soon get their say on whether alcohol licensing rules should be relaxed within the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Rehette Stoltz opened Wednesday's Sustainable Tai Rāwhiti meeting by saying the Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) was "an issue close to everyone's hearts".</p>
        
            <p>The current LAP, adopted on 27 June 2024, requires no new licences, except for restaurants or cafes and special licences, to be granted within 150m of sensitive sites such as churches, schools and marae.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, councillors wanted to relax the rules. However, public consultation had only looked at making the policy stricter.</p>
        
            <p>At Wednesday's meeting, councillors adopted a draft LAP amendment for public consultation that will begin in March.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne residents can choose between excluding the CBD from the sensitive sites restriction or keeping the current policy.</p>
        
            <p>The amendment would also allow the district licensing committee to consider exemptions for the sensitive site rule to new licence applications for premises outside the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>The amendment aims to "reduce perceived barriers to licensing within the CBD and encourage hospitality business investments and development", according to the report discussed by councillors.</p>
        
            <p>After adopting the current policy, councillors directed staff to create a targeted review of the policy's sensitive sites rule and to explore additional options so the public could provide feedback.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne District Council conducted early engagement on the rule during October and November last year.</p>
        
            <p>It received 62 submissions and over 1067 votes through its "participate" platform and Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>Of those, 82 percent of respondents opposed the retention of the rule, while 18 percent wanted it to stay.</p>
        
            <p>According to the report, the survey link was emailed to iwi, hapū, the Police, the National Public Health Service, the Licensing Inspectorate, 126 existing licensees, 25 Churches, 127 learning institutions and 94 individuals who had made submissions during the current Policy review.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff conducted a hui on 16 January 2025, with the "tri-agency" - representatives from the police, the National Public Health Service and the Chief Licensing Inspectorate - to discuss the options for reviewing the sensitive site rule.</p>
        
            <p>The tri-agency preferred to maintain the status quo.</p>
        
            <p>During the meeting, councillors debated whether to delegate the activities regarding the submissions, hearings and deliberations to a hearing panel that would make recommendations to the council on adopting the amendment.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Larry Foster and Colin Alder suggested it should be a full council meeting as it was an important topic.</p>
        
            <p>Bylaw Submission Hearing panel chairman and councillor Tony Robinson suggested having the hearings committee as the panel, with special appointments for councillors who wanted to be involved.</p>
        
            <p>"The beauty of the hearings committee is we have the assistance of staff to refine the submissions... rather than [councillors] all having to do that mahi on the day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Stoltz said the hearings committee would decide on the recommendation to the council, but the full council would make the final decision.</p>
        
            <p>Sustainable Futures hub director Jo Noble said if a councillor had shown a high level of predetermination on the topic it may put "a slight question mark" on them being on the panel.</p>
        
            <p>Foster responded: "Well, that would rule me out."</p>
        
            <p>The council decided to have the hearings committee as the panel at the hearing, with the addition of Colin Alder, who asked to be involved.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson resigned from his position as a councillor on Thursday morning. The other members are Foster, Debbie Gregory, Aubrey Ria, Teddy Thompson and Nick Tupara.</p>
        
            <p>Larry Foster was taken off the committee.</p>
        
            <p>Public consultation begins in March, with hearings and deliberations in April/May and the potential adoption of the new rule in May/June.</p>
        
            <p>The specific dates are yet to be confirmed.</p>
