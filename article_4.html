            <p>An Air New Zealand flight was aborted moments before take off from Christchurch Airport Monday morning after a bird strike.</p>
        
            <p>The plane was due to depart for Brisbane shortly after 6am, but abruptly halted it's take off.</p>
        
            <p>Ben Anderson was a passenger on the flight. He said everything was normal as the plane initially accelerated.</p>
        
            <p>He estimated the plane was just 30 knots away from lift off when he heard a bang.</p>
        
            <p>"Then suddenly on the brakes, front wheel down, and we're full reverse and we're coming to a stop, one wheel sort of skidding a little bit you definitely felt and eventually came to a stop."</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were later told birds had struck both engines, Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said flight NZ207 followed standard procedure after experiencing a suspected bird strike.</p>
        
            <p>"Our engineering teams are required to complete a full aircraft inspection before the aircraft can return to service."</p>
        
            <p>Bird strikes were frustrating but not uncommon, Morgan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Aircraft are designed with this in mind, and our pilots are fully trained for a bird strike scenario."</p>
        
            <p>The flight to Brisbane was cancelled, as was NZ272 from Brisbane to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Most customers were expected to travel Monday on alternative services, Morgan said.</p>
