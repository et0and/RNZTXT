            <p>Police around the country have been kept busy dealing with illegal street racers.</p>
        
            <p>In Canterbury overnight three people were arrested, 15 vehicles impounded and 260 infringement notices issued.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Canterbury District Commander Lane Todd said it seemed like some groups had not got the message that police are taking action against them.</p>
        
            <p>"We've said it before: these events are dangerous and can put lives at risk. We will be taking necessary action against those who are causing harm on our roads and in our communities."</p>
        
            <p>Another 36 cars were pink- or green-stickered due to compliance issues. Green stickers mean a car can be driven away, but must be checked as soon as possible; pink-stickered cars are not allowed to be driven at all.</p>
        
            <p>Hornby councillor Mark Peters said the late-night car meets were noisy and kept residents up at night.</p>
        
            <p>"As much as anything. It's the antisocial behaviour and attitudes that go with it. They normally do it in the dead of night when residents are trying to get some precious shut-eye and noise travels, and it causes a lot of disturbance."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said Hornby was a popular area for street racers because it was industrial.</p>
        
            <p>In Lower Hutt and Wellington, police said antisocial road users were intercepted before they could get established at 10 separate locations. Sixty-nine infringement notices were issued. Two vehicles were impounded over "driver licencing matters", and four due to unpaid fines.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve vehicles were stickered, and one person was arrested for disorderly behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Recent behaviour from antisocial road users has been particularly concerning, and we aren't going to tolerate it," Acting Wellington District Commander Nick Thom.</p>

            <p>And in Manawatu, where the Eagle helicopter was deployed, seven people were arrested or summonsed at vehicle gatherings. Five vehicles were impounded, 14 stickered and more than 100 infringement notices were issued.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two people were arrested in Palmerston North after fleeing and driving through city centre at more than double the speed limit. The 20-year-old driver faces several charges, including exceeding breath alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Annoyed residents were urged not to take matters into their own hands.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Sandra Venables said the Eagle helicopter would be responding to any congregations of drivers in the mid and lower North Island, and motorists would notice more patrols on the roads. She said anyone who witnessed suspicious, unlawful or dangerous activity should contact the police as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>But Venables said they should not intervene themselves, because it could put them in danger.</p>
