            <p>A person has been critically injured by someone fleeing police south of Auckland on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic cameras spotted a stolen car travelling on Dominion Road just before 1.30 this afternoon, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>The driver fled at high speed and on the wrong side of the road after police approached.</p>
        
            <p>He was tracked by the Eagle helicopter travelling on the Southern motorway out of Auckland, at one point avoiding road spikes set by police.</p>
        
            <p>As he tried avoiding a second set of spikes near Pōkeno, the driver swerved into the opposite lane and crashed head-on into another vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Both the driver and the other motorist suffered critical injuries and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>SH2 is closed in both directions between Avon Road and Koheroa Road, and diversions are in place.</p>
