            <p>"While I acknowledge that the mayoralty is a public role, I would appreciate being given some space and privacy for the next few months, while my family and I come to terms with what lies ahead of us.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that so many in our community have had their lives impacted by cancer, and that you will understand some of what we are going through."</p>
