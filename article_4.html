            <p>Contact Energy says it will cover the fixed daily line charges for its customers who were impacted by widespread power cuts in Northland and the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>Last week more than 100,000 people were left without power after a Transpower pylon fell when contractors removed too many nuts from bolts connecting the tower to a base plate.</p>
        
            <p>Contact said more than 20,000 of its customers were impacted by the outage.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it's about doing the right thing. We have a responsibility to keep the lights on, and when our customers are impacted by incidents out of their control, we need to step up and do the right thing," said chief executive Mike Fuge.</p>
        
            <p>Starting from Thursday, Contact's Northland and Far North customers would receive a text message, or email, advising them of the refunds.</p>
        
            <p>The refunds would be automatically included in their next bill.</p>
        
            <p>Contact said its main priority for now was making sure its customers were fairly compensated.</p>
        
            <p>Any claim processes would be followed up "in the coming months".</p>
