            <p>Three workers at Auckland International Airport are facing charges after Customs seized methamphetamine with a potential street value of nearly $22 million.</p>
        
            <p>Customs and police said after spotting suspicious activity at the airport, they found workers had taken a container off a flight from Malaysia earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>It had 58 kilograms of meth inside.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, five Auckland properties were searched and cocaine and other items were found.</p>
        
            <p>Customs investigations manager Dominic Adams said the case sent a clear message to trans-national and serious organised crimes that Customs was always on the lookout for suspicious behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Customs has zero-tolerance for anyone taking advantage of their privileged security access and we will not hesitate to prosecute those caught abusing it," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tom Gollan said it highlighted how important it was for Customs, police and the airport to work together to "stamp out insider threats".</p>
        
            <p>The three men were arrested and appeared in the Manukau District Court on 12 March.</p>
        
            <p>They were facing multiple charges for the importation of methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine for supply and were remanded in custody.</p>
