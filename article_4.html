            <p>The police say a knife found at the scene of a fatal mass brawl in Gisborne is being analysed.</p>
        
            <p>Two people died, and three were hospitalised but have since been discharged from hospital in the 100-person melee on Lytton Road late last month</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Dave de Lange said a number of items, including the knife, have been sent to Environmental Science and Research.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, aged 25 and 29, are set to appear in the Gisborne District Court for bail hearings later this month.</p>
        
            <p>They have both been charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and the police say they continue to review the charges against them.</p>
        
            <p>No one has been charged yet for the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>The police have renewed their call for anyone with footage of the fight that night to contact them.</p>
