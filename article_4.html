            <p>Dozens of humpback whales were spotted by volunteers who gathered in Kaikōura for the annual whale count.</p>
        
            <p>The Great Kaikōura Whale Count looks at how many humpback whales are migrating between feeding grounds in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica and breeding grounds in a more tropical climate.</p>
        
            <p>It also doubles as a tourism boost for the coastal town, which attracted people from 15 countries, at an otherwise quiet time of year.</p>
        
            <p>The whale count brought together 156 volunteers from South and North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Kaikōura Ocean Research Institute Inc (KORI) director Jody Weir said 51 humpback whales were sighted over a two week period, from 27 June to 10 July.</p>
        
            <p>Sperm, blue and southern right whales were also observed.</p>
        
            <p>Southern right whales once gave birth to their calves off the coast of Kaikōura in their hundreds, until whaling nearly wiped them out.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years only half a dozen newly born southern right whale calves have been observed in the area, Dr Weir said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you wipe out a whole group of individuals, no-one is around to remember that Kaikōura is a good place to have your calf.</p>

            <p>"So, in a sense the Great Kaikōura Whale Count is a way of welcoming them back."</p>
        
            <p>She said whales were important to the ecosystem of the ocean and restoring whale numbers could help to restore some balance.</p>
        
            <p>"Whales eat and move great distances in the water column and they leave their poop behind, which feeds the bottom of the food chain.</p>
        
            <p>"We are learning more about the moving of carbon and how the impact of climate change is affecting the movement of whales and the ocean ecosystem."</p>
        
            <p>Microscopic phytoplankton plants feed off the nutrients left behind in whale poop, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Although this year's count was over a shorter period, Dr Weir said it continued the trend of a growing number of whales being observed.</p>
        
            <p>She said 80 humpback whales were observed in the first year, but it was over a much longer period.</p>

            <p>"Overall, it helps to connect the community with the marine life and gain a greater understanding of whale life off our shores."</p>
        
            <p>The whale count was first held in 2020, when local tourism operators WhaleWatch and Dolphin Encounter were out of action due to Covid.</p>
        
            <p>It was held for three years, but did not happen last year due to a lack of funding.</p>
        
            <p>A community initiatives grant from the Kaikōura District Council has allowed KORI to offer internships to help plan and run events this year, including the whale count.</p>
        
            <p>It allowed KORI to run events during the fortnight to raise awareness of whales.</p>
        
            <p>KORI is now looking for funding to run the whale count again next year and has set up a Givealittle page.</p>
        
            <p>"Every year people say they wish they knew about it sooner, but we can't advertise it until we have funding sorted."</p>
