            <p>Auckland's mayor says more work is needed to prevent faults after a pipe burst left thousands of residents without water.</p>
        
            <p>A broken water main on Thursday caused up to 3000 people to go without water in Henderson, Henderson Valley, Glen Eden, Oratia, Kauriland, and McLaren Park.</p>
        
            <p>The water supply was restored on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Wayne Brown said as part of their response, Watercare reached out to customers including those who registered as needing priority assistance and aged care facilities, to offer additional support.</p>

            <p>While it was good the incident was resolved quickly, said Brown, it was not ideal when infrastructure issues affected residents.</p>
        
            <p>"One of my policies has been to fix infrastructure and while we're making progress, there's still a lot to do.</p>
        
            <p>"The Watercare Charter and agreement between me and the government will mean Watercare delivers better for Aucklanders and ensure it can undertake investment in Auckland's vital drinking water and wastewater infrastructure to meet growth and environmental standards, deliver reliable and safe water service and therefore mitigate against incidents like this in future."</p>
