            <p>Thousands of people on an Australian cruise ship have been turned away from New Zealand shores because the vessel did not meet biosecurity standards.</p>
        
            <p>P&O runs a 13-day "Kiwi Adventure" voyage, taking passengers from Sydney, sailing around New Zealand and stopping at different cities.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Biosecurity New Zealand said there were concerning levels of biofouling on the vessel named "Pacific Adventure".</p>
        
            <p>Northern regional commissioner Mike Inglis said the operator sent photos showing the ship had high risk organisms growing on it that could pose a risk to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He said P&O attempted to clean the hull and specifically the areas of concern in recent days, however, abandoned this due to bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the company said the ship left Sydney on Monday for a hull cleaning in the waters near the Bay of Plenty as per biosecurity requirements.</p>
        
            <p>But it said the poor weather made it too dangerous for divers to clean the hull underwater and the cruise ship did not gain clearance to enter Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Underwater cleaning opportunities in the Pacific were extremely limited and could only be completed offshore.</p>
        
            <p>The biosecurity authority says the Australian cruise ship turned away from New Zealand waters had high risk mussel and oyster growth.</p>
        
            <p>Inglis said bioflouling is a major threat with almost 90 percent of all exotic marine species and growth already in New Zealand having arrived on international vessels.</p>
        
            <p>"Our biosecurity rules are in place to protect us against pests such as exotic caulpera which can impact New Zealand's environment, unique marine ecosystems, aquaculture industry, and economy".</p>
        
            <p>Inglis appreciates it is difficult to clean a ship hull, particularly when it is often dictated by the weather.</p>
        
            <p>He said Biosecurity New Zealand is working closely with cruise lines to ensure vessels arrive clean this summer.</p>
        
            <p>"Biosecurity New Zealand staff visited Sydney earlier in the year and met with Carnival [umbrella company to P&O] to reinforce our requirements and has continued to meet and engage regularly with the cruise operator and others in preparation for the new season", Inglis said.</p>
        
            <p>P&O said the cruiseship was now on its way to Tasmania instead.</p>
        
            <p>It said guests were notified prior to departure that there could be changes to the itinerary, "due to New Zealand's strict biosecurity requirements".</p>
        
            <p>The almost 2800 guests had been offered additional compensation in light of the change of voyage.</p>
