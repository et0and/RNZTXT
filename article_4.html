            <p>Police have launched an investigation after a firearms incident in Hobsonville last night where two people were shot.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called at about 11.20pm after two people arrived at a hospital with gunshot wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Both received serious injuries and remain in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour to Hobsonville Park said she heard a loud gunshot at around 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>She then heard shouting and screaming and what sounded like a car taking off.</p>
        
            <p>She said they noticed a cordon had been put in place at 9am Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The incident has been very scary for her family.</p>
        
            <p>She said police have not spoken to them.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour said the cordon was set up on most of Memorial Park Lane at about 5am.</p>
        
            <p>Police had now left the area and the cordon has been removed.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in a statement they were trying to establish what had occurred and who was responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information which might be helpful was asked to contact them online or via the 105 service, quoting job number P061040388.</p>
        
            <p>Information can also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
