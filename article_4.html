        <h2>South Auckland doctor's clinic boosts security to keep staff, patients safe</h2>
        <p>
Crime and anti-social behaviour is spreading from Queen St to town centres outside Auckland city centre, a family clinic doctor says.

            <p>A family clinic in the south Auckland suburb of Papatoetoe says it has had to step up security measures amid ongoing disturbances in the area.</p>
        
            <p>At the weekend, a jewellery store owner was hospitalised after a robbery at his store in the same suburb.</p>
        
            <p>He was repeatedly hit in the head with a hammer before his son chased the assailants off with a sword.</p>
        
            <p>Fires near the clinic, public drunkenness, urination, and littering were causing concern for Papatoetoe Family Clinic co-owner Dr Karl Cole.</p>
        
            <p>"Overnight, there are people sleeping in cars, blocking the path," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And on the street outside, lots of begging and people sleeping on the street.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's not just Queen Street having the issues that happen on the news, it's happening around all sorts of town centres, and this is one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Cole said the clinic had installed security doors and gates to keep staff and patients safe.</p>
        
            <p>"The last few years we're just making sure there's no one's going down the alleyways or none of the nurses walk to cars by themselves," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"During the weekends, we're careful [...] the front door's got special close-behind-it locks so the staff can go out to where the visible carpark area is.</p>
        
            <p>"And the back area, where we're seeing the Covid patients, the kind of 'red zone', has got a side entrance, and we've had a gate put on there that automatically shuts," said Cole.</p>
        
            <p>Cole said another gate had been installed between the red-zone and interior of the clinic, and was fitted with cameras.</p>
        
            <p>Cole said his clinic did not have cash or drugs to steal, and felt the frustration of past issues had gotten better, though worries still remained.</p>
        
            <p>"I do feel for the jewellery stores and the dairies," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They really are in a difficult situation."</p>
