        <h2>Civil Defence ready for revamp in wake of Cyclone Gabrielle</h2>
        <p>
A committee charged with making changes is intent on trusting "local voices" and building collaboration across the region.

            <p>Hawke's Bay Civil Defence is set for a three-year overhaul, with the aim of improving the region's response to emergencies.</p>
        
            <p>A new strategy was created off the back of the March 2024 independent review into the region's response to Cyclone Gabrielle, which made more than 70 recommendations for improvement.</p>
        
            <p>The plan, known as the Transformation Strategy, is set to be officially adopted at a public meeting of the Hawke's Bay Civil Defence Emergency Management Group Joint Committee - which represents Hawke's Bay's five councils and local iwi - at the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>The committee said in a statement: "Our community is at the heart of our civil defence system".</p>
        
            <p>"For our new strategy to be truly transformational, we need to focus on building stronger connections, we need to trust and empower local voices, and we need to enhance collaboration across the region - and that's what we're going to do."</p>
        
            <p>The independent review, led by former Police Commissioner Mike Bush, was tasked with identifying opportunities to improve resilience for future events.</p>
        
            <p>It found the region was not well prepared for Cyclone Gabrielle, and the "worst case scenario" was not planned for.</p>
        
            <p>Plans lacked operational detail, the system set good people up to fail, and CDEM staff were overconfident about their readiness on the basis of prior emergency event.</p>
        
            <p>The committee accepted all of the findings when it was released, and committed to a complete overhaul.</p>
        
            <p>A significant amount of work had already been done, including the establishment of 53 community emergency hubs across the region, and another 41 in progress.</p>
        
            <p>More than 700 coordination centre staff, volunteers and partner agency representatives had completed initial emergency management training.</p>
        
            <p>According to the joint committee statement: "The strategy includes a complete review of all HBCDEM infrastructure and assets, with business cases for investment submitted as part of the 2027 local government Long Term Plan consultation process.</p>
        
            <p>"This will include the investment required to ensure the civil defence system has the necessary emergency management plans to enhance local and regional preparation for emergency events, and that these plans are supported by clear roles and responsibilities."</p>
        
            <p>Once adopted, implementation of the strategy would be led by recently appointed HBCDEM transformation director Matt Boggs, who joined on a fixed-term basis in August 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The plan would be tabled at the HBCDEM Joint Committee meeting on 27 January.</p>
