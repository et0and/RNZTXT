            <p>Police say there are more people of interest after they found the vehicle they believe was involved in the Stoke Valley murder of 82-year-old Ian David Moller.</p>
        
            <p>The silver Mazda Atenza - found by police - was seen on CCTV footage travelling on Stokes Valley Road and George Street just after the third fire at the Hanson Grove block of flats.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were speaking to the owners of the vehicle - registration LKA609.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said police were asking for anyone with information, CCTV or dashcam footage of the vehicle or its occupants to get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>"We are yet to contact a number of people within the community who we believe know details of the three arsons and Mr Moller's murder, including why these offences were committed and who is involved.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask them, and anyone else with information, to come forward and speak with us before we knock on their door."</p>

            <p>A homicide investigation was launched in November after Ian David Moller, 82, was critically injured and died four days later.</p>
        
            <p>The fire that killed Moller was the third alleged attack on Hanson Grove in the space of a month. The first took place on 10 October, another on 14 October, and the third on 5 November, all during the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police have arrested four people over Moller's murder and the fires.</p>
        
            <p>They said all have name suppression and are due to appear in the Wellington High Court on 4 April.</p>
