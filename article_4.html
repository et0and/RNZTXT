            <p>A Russian oligarch is the new owner of the former Ashburton District Council building.</p>
        
            <p>Havelock Development Limited, a company that has Alexandre Germanovitch as a director, recently purchased the site for $2.3 million.</p>
        
            <p>The company was registered in November.</p>
        
            <p>Germanovitch also owns the 1198-hectare Mt Potts Station and associated lodge in the Rangitata Valley.</p>
        
            <p>It was purchased in 2011 for $3.7m following Overseas Investment Office approval.</p>
        
            <p>The businessman also bought one of the grandest but run-down mansions in Devonport in Auckland in 2013 and embarked on a major renovation.</p>
        
            <p>Germanovitch now owns a slice of central Ashburton after the purchase of the three-storey former council administration building and 5059 square metres of land, which was settled on Friday.</p>

            <p>Ashburton council chief executive Hamish Riach said settlement had been expected at the end of January, but was brought forward by agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"The paperwork has now been completed and the new owner will no doubt release plans for the site when they are ready."</p>
        
            <p>The $2.3m sale price will offset the cost of the $63.2m Te Whare Whakatere, Ashburton's library and civic centre which opened last year.</p>
        
            <p>The council sold the former public library building for $1.1m last year to CBR Properties Limited, which plans to renovate the building into a boutique hotel.</p>
        
            <p>It also sold two relocatable buildings for $160,000.</p>
        
            <p>The project also received $20m from the government's shovel-ready infrastructure programme.</p>
        
            <p>That reduces the total build cost of the building for the ratepayers to under $40m.</p>
