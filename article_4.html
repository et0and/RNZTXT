            <p>Seven people had to be rescued after a fire broke out at one of Auckland's West Coast beaches this evening.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency confirmed they were notified of the blaze on Anawhata Beach just before 5.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Eight firetrucks, three helicopters, and multiple support vehicles were called out to the blaze. Fire and Emergency said the fire was now controlled, and firefighters will return at 6am tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving NZ (SLSNZ) also confirmed that Piha surf lifeguards successfully rescued seven people after they were trapped by the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>At about 7pm, police and fire staff contacted SLSNZ, requesting support to extract people stranded at Anawhata Beach.</p>
        
            <p>Surf lifeguards on three inflatable rescue boats and two rescue water crafts picked up the trapped people from the beach and returned them safely to Piha at about 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, a Piha resident said she could see smoke from the Anawhata fire from her home.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw a helicopter with a bucket fly over and local [fire] crews are there now."</p>
        
            <p>A fire also broke out southeast of Bulls in the Rangitikei District on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said a call about the blaze in Parewānui came in at about 4.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>Ground crews and two helicopters were at the scene, and the fire is now 75 percent contained.</p>
        
            <p>Crews will remain on the site of the fire in Parewānui overnight.</p>
