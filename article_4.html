            <p>Indians are now New Zealand's biggest immigration group, and the third largest ethnic group in the country. But their own government is warning them to stay away. </p>
        
            <p>Indian immigration to New Zealand has been going on for more than 100 years, but in the past 25 years it has been synonymous with exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>The stories come thick and fast - dozens of Indian men living in squalid conditions, their promised jobs amounting to nothing; nurses training for and gaining Kiwi qualifications only to find there are no jobs; paying tens of thousands of dollars for visas charged by extortionists; forced to work long hours on little pay in restaurants and on building sites.</p>
        
            <p>The situation has become so bad that the Indian government is warning nurses not to come to this country, unless they have a genuine job offer.</p>
        
            <p>Health authorities were not hiring because of budget cuts; there were changes to the qualification system; and nurses were getting rejected for being on visitor visas.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian High Commission also warned nurses to refrain from paying agents who promised "guaranteed" jobs.</p>
        
            <p>In January, India's External Affairs Ministry issued an advisory on the rise of unregistered recruitment agents who charged exorbitant fees.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry advised prospective migrants to seek jobs overseas through registered recruitment agents.</p>
        
            <p>Malkiat Singh, a licensed immigration advisor, told The Detail that New Zealand's pathways to residencies were outdated.</p>
        
            <p>"We can create pathways of residence where they are given clear indication to migrants that these are the skills we need and here is a simple pathway to follow. At the moment the pathways are too hard," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Malkiat believed that this was leading to migrant exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>"If we evaluate our education policies and immigration policies, there is a clear disconnect. And we have a clear opportunity with Erica Stanford leading both these ministries," Malkiat said.</p>
        
            <p>But he also suggested that some exploited migrants understood that someone was playing the system, and were willing to risk the consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"That determination to settle in New Zealand is so strong, they would agree or comply with exploitative arrangements, because the stakes seem so high."</p>
        
            <p>There was also a social stigma in India tied up with returning home, and being branded as a failure.</p>
        
            <p>"They have left their homes and lands with the hope of a better future for their kids, for their families. This is the reason they say yes to being exploited .. but it doesn't have to be that way."</p>

            <p>Exploitation is nothing new - it's something the Indian community in New Zealand has been dealing with for many years.</p>
        
            <p>And ever since the introduction of the Accredited Employer Work Visa in 2022, the situation has worsened.</p>
        
            <p>Sudesh Jhunjhunwala, chief executive of Sudima Hotels and Hind Management, is one person helping to pick up the pieces of broken promises.</p>
        
            <p>"To me that's causing human misery .. it's like you are taking part in slavery, and anyone who sees that and keeps quiet, I think you are equally complicit," he says.</p>
        
            <p>He experienced first-hand the dark side of such schemes when, as the manager of two hotels he was offered $10,000 (per letter) to write a job letters of work promises.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so upset that this person would even think of calling me up for something like that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He has employed three exploited migrants as chefs or other hotel workers, including chef Sujith Gaha, who told The Detail that migrants should be aware of their rights.</p>
        
            <p>Jhunjhunwala is one of the senior business leaders in the Indian community in New Zealand who wants to see change happen when it comes to migrant worker exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>He emphasised the importance of stable immigration policies to curb migrant exploitation.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't be chopping and changing the rules all the time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have jobs for everyone. It made a very small difference in the number of people exploited. I was only able to save three of them but there's so many other people who are exploited so badly."</p>
