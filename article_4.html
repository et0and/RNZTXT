            <p>Passengers of the LATAM flight which took a dramatic dive say the company is keeping them in the dark about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner suddenly lost altitude on a flight from Sydney to Auckland - sending passengers flying around the cabin and injuring 50.</p>
        
            <p>The plane had been scheduled to continue on to Santiago, Chile on Monday night. But that flight was cancelled and instead a replacement plane left on Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Nervous passengers boarded the flight last night still not knowing what caused the terrifying mid-air nose-dive.</p>
        
            <p>One passenger spoken to before they departed said they'd been given food and accommodation, but no explanation.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody asked anything, if we were ok, they just said ok lets go to this hotel, pick up your luggage and see you tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Another passenger, Bruna, was not impressed with the airline's communication.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very poorly, like very poorly because a lot of people said they were at the hospital and no one told them where to go and there was no one from the airline there."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was "not confident" about boarding the replacement flight. "I mean, it's hard to get on (another) plane for 11 hours."</p>
        
            <p>Robert Stuart was meant to be on the cancelled flight from Auckland to Santiago and was glad he wasn't on the plane from Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah I don't think I would have liked that at all, that would have probably put me off flying for a little bit."</p>
        
            <p>LATAM said in a statement an investigation was underway into the "strong shake".</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Accident Investigation Commission and Civil Aviation Authority said the incident occurred in international airspace and Chile's Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil would lead the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement Boeing said it was ready to support an investigation if requested and its thoughts were with the passengers and crew.</p>
