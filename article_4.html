            <p>A freshwater scientist says it will take up four days of fine weather to reduce the risk to swimmers from sewage runoff after heavy rains last week.</p>
        
            <p>More than 20 beaches were closed around the Auckland region due to contamination over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in Wellington there were 17 beaches that had an "unsuitable for swimming" warning, according to the Land, Air, Water Aotearoa website.</p>
        
            <p>This included popular beaches such as Scorching Bay, Lyall Bay and Seatoun Beach.</p>
        
            <p>The Cawthorn Institute's Roger Young said the weather, combined with neglected infrastructure, was leading to high levels of bacteria and virus's in beaches and waterways.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been runoff from those urban areas [so] there's the risk of bacteria and viruses ... getting washed into the waterways and increasing that risk of illness for swimmers.</p>
        
            <p>"If we get a patch of good weather for three or four days I think things should be back to more normal situations and the risk of swimming at most sites should be reduced.</p>
        
            <p>Young said swimmers should check with their local council for closures in rain-affected areas.</p>
