            <p>Police are hunting a Black Power member considered dangerous and under the influence of drugs.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Senior Sergeant Aaron Crawford said Whangārei Police were appealing for information on the whereabouts of Toa Pitman, 42.</p>
        
            <p>He was wanted for an alleged "violent" family harm incident on Tuesday - and had several other arrest warrants for other offending.</p>
        
            <p>Crawford said he was considered dangerous and should not be approached.</p>
        
            <p>"Pitman remains a serious threat to his victim, and it is a priority for our staff that he is taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>"He has a propensity to use violence, and he is believed to be under the influence of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>"We advise the public to not approach Pitman but call police on 111 immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Crawford said police came across Pitman's car in Kamo on Wednesday but he failed to stop and a chase began.</p>
        
            <p>"Pitman stopped his vehicle and evaded police on foot after the pursuit ended in Otangarei.</p>
        
            <p>"During the incident, police discharged a sponge round towards Pitman."</p>
        
            <p>Pitman was not located after this and inquiries were ongoing to find him.</p>
        
            <p>People were asked to call police on 105 or give information online.</p>
        
            <p>Information could be given anonymously through Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
