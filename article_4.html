            <p>Six people have been arrested for a serious assault which took place in Pukekohe in September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The victim was allegedly involved in a disorder outside The Longkeeper bar and sustained a broken jaw in two places, which required surgery, Detective Senior Sergeant Simon Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>"At around 12.20am on 2 September, an officer was driving along King Street when he noticed a person on the ground surrounded by a group of people," Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>"It quickly became clear a fight had taken place and a person had been seriously injured."</p>
        
            <p>Police have spent the past six months investigating.</p>
        
            <p>The six people arrested are aged between 19-23.</p>
        
            <p>They were charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and will reappear in Pukekohe District Court later this month.</p>
