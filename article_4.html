            <p>The brother of All Black great Jonah Lomu is accused of being involved in a methamphetamine ring that imported thousands of dollars worth of the drug into New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>John Makatoa Lomu, the former All Black star's younger brother, appeared at the Manukau District Court on Friday where his court ordered name suppression lapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The 46-year-old, together with Silila Vaivai, face charges of importing and possessing methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>They face further charges of importing and possessing an unknown class-A drug.</p>
        
            <p>They have pleaded not guilty to all charges and elected trial by jury.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Nick Webby set a date for the pair to be back in court in October.</p>
        
            <p>Lomu and Vaivai are both on bail.</p>
        
            <p>Lomu declined to talk to Stuff as he left Court and hid his face with his black hoodie.</p>
        
            <p>The offending is said to have happened in August and September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>John and Jonah played rugby league together as children in Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, John Lomu told Niu FM that Jonah got him his first car when he was still in school.</p>
        
            <p>Jonah Lomu, aged 40, died from a heart attack in November 2015 following a long struggle with kidney failure.</p>
        
            <p>The rugby superstar played 63 tests for the All Blacks between 1994 and 2002.</p>
        
            <p>In his eight years, mostly in the number 11 jersey, he scored 37 tries.</p>
        
            <p>Lomu's prowess on the wing was helped by his size and speed and his ability to attack was unrivalled.</p>
        
            <p>A highlight of his career came in the 1995 World Cup semifinal against England in South Africa when he ran straight over and through England's full back Mike Catt.</p>
