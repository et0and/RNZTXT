            <p>Kiwis are being asked to keep an eye out for feathered friends this weekend, as this year's New Zealand Garden Bird Survey gets underway.</p>
        
            <p>Each year since 2007, bird-watchers have sat down for an hour and note which species they see in their backyard, and how many.</p>
        
            <p>The data helps researchers discover trends in bird numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"It's especially beneficial to have higher participation for detecting when a regional trend is different to the national trend," Manaaki Whenua / Landcare Research senior researcher Dr Angela Brandt said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's especially important this year as we've noticed house sparrows, goldfinches and chaffinches are actually declining from a moderate to a rapid rate over the five-year period.</p>
        
            <p>"Adding another year of data will help us understand if this trend is continuing, or if 2023 was an anomalous year for bird counts."</p>

            <p>If you need help telling sparrows apart from kererÅ«, the survey website has a handy identification guide - with both images and recordings of the sounds each species makes.</p>
        
            <p>"If bird populations are changing significantly, it's an alert that something is either working, for instance predator control, or something might be going wrong," Brandt said.</p>
        
            <p>"There could be an increase in predators or changing temperatures could be reducing food and shelter."</p>
        
            <p>The data collected in New Zealand also contributes to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.</p>
