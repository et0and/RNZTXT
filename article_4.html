            <p>Christchurch City Council has announced it is resigning from Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ).</p>
        
            <p>Councillors at a meeting today decided to no longer be part of LGNZ, after its annual membership costs rose by more than $20,000.</p>
        
            <p>The decision came after a report was presented at the meeting about renewing the annual membership subscription for the association, which represents the interests of councils around the country. The annual cost for Christchurch is $163,254.75 plus GST for the 2024/2025 year.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors voted to put the unspent budget for this year towards elected member professional training, workplace support services and parliamentary engagement.</p>
        
            <p>The report to council said a number of the reasons for remaining a member were not readily quantifiable.</p>
        
            <p>"Being a member of an organisation such as LGNZ provides the benefit of collective advocacy but with reduced influence on the policy and advocacy positions. Alternatively, by not being a member council may consider it can advocate more effectively and specifically on the issues important to the communities of the city and district, doing so as the South Island's largest city."</p>
        
            <p>The report stated the annual membership fee had increased since last year, as members now had full access to Ākona, LGNZ's professional development learning platform, which had been optional in previous years.</p>
        
            <p>It said the risks in leaving LGNZ would be the potential to be isolated within the sector, to find it challenging to have Christchurch's voice heard in isolation by the sector body, and to convey the council's views effectively to the government.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbouring district Selwyn mayor and LGNZ president Sam Broughton made a deputation, urging the Christchurch City Council to remain a member.</p>
        
            <p>"Your contribution LGNZ, to the way that local government functions across the country, to the way the government thinks about local government, it is important that you are in the tent and working with us."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were several key reasons for staying, including the regular LGNZ conference which was last held in Christchurch in 2023 and was due to be held in the city again, which brought an estimated $1.2 million into the economy and additional support to the hotel and hospitality sector.</p>
        
            <p>Research showed LGNZ's street-light-dimming programme could save the city $500,000 by working with electricity providers and it was keen to help the council implement that, Broughton said.</p>
        
            <p>LGNZ's professional development learning platform Ākona could also result in savings, with development courses for staff otherwise costing anywhere from $2000 to $20,000 to deliver, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Broughton said continued membership would show unity with the rest of the South Island, as there were often conversations among other councils as to whether Christchurch was with them, or above them.</p>
        
            <p>"You are the biggest, you hold the most sway, you are able to attract attention, a lot of the press stories are around what happens for Christchurch City Council and the Canterbury Mayoral Forum has been really clear that we should be doing things together."</p>
        
            <p>But many councillors said they thought the council could get better value by advocating directly with government and delivering their own training for staff.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Melanie Coker said she was concerned about the myopic view she had heard around the council table.</p>
        
            <p>"Isn't it best to work together with other councils or are we trying to send them all a big F you, we don't care about working with you.</p>
        
            <p>"If that's the case I am very disappointed with those who vote to leave LGNZ today."</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Phil Mauger said the council had been faced with having to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages for staying part of LGNZ and resigning.</p>
        
            <p>"What our resignation now means is that the council will be able to advocate for the issues that directly impact and are important to the communities of Christchurch and Banks Peninsula as the South Island's largest city and the second largest city in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Mauger will now give notice of the resignation in writing to LGNZ.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2023, Auckland Council voted to leave LGNZ after Mayor Wayne Brown used his casting vote when the votes were tied 10-all.</p>
