        <h2>What you need to know about the Dragon Boat Festival</h2>
        <p>
The festival - celebrated in China for more than 2000 years - is a mixture of two things NZers love: food and sports.

            <p>Monday's Dragon Boat Festival is a mixture of two things that New Zealanders love: food and sports.</p>
        
            <p>Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month each year, the festival offers households in China and beyond an opportunity to enjoy a variety of zongzi (sticky rice dumplings).</p>
        
            <p>The dumplings are packed with glutinous rice and a wide variety of savoury or sweet fillings, including red dates, pork and salted eggs.</p>
        
            <p>Their taste and aroma of zongzi conjure up memories of childhood. Stores overflow with mountains of bamboo leaf packages, with some outlets hanging them in clusters in the window.</p>
        
            <p>Almost everyone, it seems, is busy making, selling, buying and eating the seasonal delicacy.</p>

            <p>At this time of year, families in China hang calamus and mugwort in their doorways to ward off evil spirits and bad luck.</p>
        
            <p>People typically wear colorful silk threads and drink realgar wine (an alcoholic drink made from cereals) to guarantee good health and peace.</p>
        
            <p>As the name suggests, the festival also features vibrant dragon boat races on rivers across China, an activity that participants and spectators enjoy in equal measure.</p>
        
            <p>The Dragon Boat Festival, also known as the Duanwu Festival, is one of China's oldest celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the festival has been celebrated since the Warring States period in China (475-221 BC), making it more than 2,000 years old.</p>

            <p>Shrouded in ancient rituals, it has been recognized as a World Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p>
        
            <p>The festival has several theories about its origin, but most believe that it can be traced to the death of an ancient Chinese poet named Qu Yuan.</p>
        
            <p>Apparently devastated by the fall of his homeland - the state of Chu - to the invading Qin army, Qu Yuan drowned himself in Miluo River.</p>
        
            <p>Locals launched boats to find him, throwing rice wrapped in leaves into the river to prevent fish from eating his body.</p>
        
            <p>Although Qu Yuan's body was never found, his memory lives on in the dumplings and dragon boat races that are a pivotal part of the festival.</p>
        
            <p>The festival also symbolizes a love for life and a desire to enjoy a better future.</p>

            <p>The fifth lunar month is an important period of time for farmers in China.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures start to rise in early summer and rainfall increases, with the resulting heat and humidity making poisonous creatures such as snakes, scorpions and centipedes more active.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, many families in China clean and disinfect their houses during the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
        
            <p>Family members use the time to take herbal baths and wear fragrant sachets to ward off evil spirits and keep illness at bay.</p>
        
            <p>The Dragon Boat Festival is more than just a holiday - it is a cultural celebration filled with nostalgia and age-old traditions that protect people from ill health and bad luck.</p>
