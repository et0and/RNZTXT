            <p>There were highly charged scenes in the Hamilton District Court this afternoon as whﾄ］au of an 8-year-old boy who died after a violent altercation threatened the man accused of murder when he appeared in the dock.</p>
        
            <p>The boy died in hospital on Sunday night of fatal injuries that police say were inflicted during the altercation at a house in Bader just before 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>He has been named on social media by a relative as Zahquiel John Thomas Patrick Taipeti.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City field crime manager Inspector Darrell Harpur said a 37-year-old man was taken into custody at the scene and police launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>This morning police said they had charged the man with murder and two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>The assault charges related to serious and moderate injuries suffered by two adults at the house, who were also taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City field crime manager Inspector Darrell Harpur said the man was taken into custody at the scene and police had launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not seeking anyone else in relation to what happened, however will remain in the area as they continue a scene examination and further inquiries."</p>
        
            <p>The man was scheduled to make his first appearance in court today at 10am. But by 3pm - when he was called and did not appear - several people in the public gallery became vocal about the delay.</p>
        
            <p>One man told the court they had been waiting all day for the accused to appear.</p>
        
            <p>Community Magistrate Ngaire Mascelle told the group the man had not yet been assigned a duty lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>When the group, which included a child and other young people, complained further, she said they would have to leave the court if they could not settle down.</p>
        
            <p>They left expressing their frustration at the system but returned when the man, who has interim name suppression, appeared just before 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>As the court process began, tensions boiled over in the public gallery and one man stood and yelled at the accused.</p>
        
            <p>The man then left the court calmly while other whﾄ］au wept quietly.</p>
        
            <p>The accused man stood in the dock a blue boiler suit.</p>
        
            <p>Police opposed media applications to photograph the man because they said it would be prejudicial to their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The community magistrate remanded him in custody until his next appearance in the High Court at Hamilton on 17 September.</p>
        
            <p>At the house at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, washing could be seen hanging on the line in the back yard. A child's bike, barbecue and an old fridge were among items strewn in the front yard.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours said loud music and parties could often be heard coming from the house, with a man doing renovation work nearby saying he had been warned the house was used by a gang.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour said she knew the family but would not comment, saying the family had requested she not say anything.</p>
        
            <p>A furniture removal truck also sat in the driveway of the home.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day a relative announced Zahquiel's death on Facebook with "great sadness and heartbreak" and paid tribute to him.</p>
        
            <p>She said the boy was the baby brother to an older sister, and that his mother had died at an earlier time.</p>
        
            <p>"Rest in the arms of mum our boy," she wrote. "Rest in eternal love MyBro."</p>
        
            <p>His father was named in court documents as one of the other alleged victims of the altercation and the woman said he was stable in hospital and was to undergo surgery today.</p>
        
            <p>She said family were waiting for the release of Zahquiel's body so they could take him home to Whakatﾄ］e.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said her heart went out to the family.</p>
