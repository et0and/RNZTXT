            <p>A specialist paramedic has again denied needing to be pushed to continue towards Linwood Islamic Centre after the Christchurch terror attack.</p>
        
            <p>But Dale Muller admits he should have tried harder to get more information on what they were facing.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the inquest into the 51 worshippers murdered during the March 2019 shootings heard a St John Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) pulled over for more than six minutes while travelling to the Linwood Avenue mosque.</p>
        
            <p>The terrorist shot and killed seven people at Linwood, after shooting dozens more at Al Noor Mosque, about seven kilometres away.</p>
        
            <p>An Australian police officer in the vehicle with the SERT paramedics earlier told the Coroners Court he and a New Zealand Armed Offenders Squad member had to convince the paramedics to continue on to the scene of the second shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Muller, one of the SERT paramedics, denied he needed convincing and said they pulled over to put on their protective equipment and get more information about the incident from the police radio.</p>
        
            <p>He was also trying to find out if Linwood was where they should go, Muller said.</p>
        
            <p>Today, deputy chief Coroner Brigitte Windley questioned Muller further about the six-minute stop and asked if he tried to get on the radio or was simply listening in and hoping to hear the information he wanted.</p>
        
            <p>Muller told her he could not recall attempting to get on the radio but said it was "extremely busy".</p>
        
            <p>"There was a manhunt going on in the city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To put it in context ... we are a small part of their big team.</p>
        
            <p>"When they are active trying to get an offender, we are apprehensive about interrupting their extremely busy radio time to say, 'excuse me where would you like us to go?'."</p>
        
            <p>But the coroner said it seemed as if Muller was doing himself a disservice.</p>
        
            <p>"You're a valuable asset in these situations so I'm sure police would be more than happy for you to interrupt and ask, 'where would you like us?'."</p>
        
            <p>Muller agreed.</p>
        
            <p>In hindsight, it would have been "much better" if he had been more active on the radio to gather the information he wanted while they were still driving, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He told Windley he was passive in his gathering of information - but that would suffice in any other situation.</p>
        
            <p>Muller again denied to the court that he needed to be persuaded to continue to the Linwood Avenue mosque.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest will examine the following 10 issues over six weeks:</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
