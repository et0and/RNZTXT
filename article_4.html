            <p>A scrub fire at the Tekapo Military Training Area has been contained overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The fire which grew to 200 hectares broke out just before 11.30am on Tuesday, after the Defence Force carried out a planned ammunition disposal.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said at its last patrol at 3am on Wednesday, there was no sign of fire.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were due to carry out another patrol at first light.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Fire and Emergency is urging Cantabrians to avoid lighting fires over the next few days with forecast temperatures of up to 30 degrees, and gusty northwesterly winds.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews are back fighting a large vegetation fire that's spreading though a Waikato conservation area.</p>
