            <p>The protest against the Treaty Principles Bill turned into a party after te Hīkoi mō te Tiriti left Parliament and headed to Waitangi Park for music, kai, and a bit of a rest.</p>
        
            <p>Tens of thousands protested at Parliament yesterday afternoon, before about 2000 people descended on Waitangi Park, where the sun was shining as live music played.</p>
        
            <p>People were camped out on the lawn and food trucks were crammed up, ready to feed a hungry horde.</p>

            <p>People RNZ spoke to said they were proud of what they had achieved.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm really proud of our country, like our community, all coming together and doing all of this to save our treaty and what is right," said Meikura.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like we've definitely made history. Especially internationally, everybody is talking about Hana [Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke] and her haka, and that inspired us all to do what we're doing now, to come together as one," said Serenity.</p>

            <p>Treaty Principles Bill architect David Seymour stood in front of protesters outside the Beehive to acknowledge the hīkoi yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>But he later told Checkpoint he did not think it was representative of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>About a million New Zealanders whakapapa Māori, he said, with seven of them in Cabinet, three in the ACT caucus, and "about 0.2 percent who are out in front of Parliament right now".</p>

            <p>Seymour said his Treaty bill created a country of individuals with equal rights, regardless of race, religion or other background, "because you're human, you have basic rights and that message is resonating very strongly".</p>
        
            <p>Those that took part in the hīkoi had a lot to say about Seymour, and his bill.</p>
        
            <p>Tamati suggested instead of banning Seymour, instead of gang patches.</p>
        
            <p>New laws banning gang patches come into effect on 21 November.</p>

            <p>Tukaki said it had united a lot of people, "especially our Māori people with our Tangata Tiriti whanau. And yeah, just if they try to divide us, it backfired, because now we're more stronger than ever I feel".</p>
        
            <p>All parties other than ACT have committed to voting the bill down at the second reading, which would stop it from passing into law.</p>

            <p>Lagi hoped the parties stuck to that commitment.</p>
        
            <p>"We will hold you to account through your words - and actions speak louder than your words - so we will watch with anticipation to see if those words actually come through in the actions of the party."</p>
        
            <p>The Bill has now been sent to select committee for six-month public hearing process.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions are open until 7 January.</p>
