            <p>MetService has issued a severe weather watch for the Wairoa District, with stormy weather expected to hit the region on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain and thunderstorms were most likely in the afternoon and evening, the forecaster said.</p>
        
            <p>The watch could be upgraded to a warning later.</p>
        
            <p>It was in place for the area east of Lake Waikaremoana and Gisborne south of the city from 4pm Monday until 6pm Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>About 17,000 campers are currently in Gisborne for the Rhythm and Vines festival, which ends on New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>The area has just been hit by a month's worth of rain and high winds on Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 9am Monday, the MetService issued a severe thunderstorm watch for eight hours from 1pm for Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, Tararua, Wairarapa, Marlborough, and Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>"These thunderstorms will generate localised downpours up to 50mm/hour, and possibly large hail (or significant accumulations of hail).</p>
        
            <p>"Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles."</p>
        
            <p>It warned there could be flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas near streams, rivers or narrow valleys.</p>
        
            <p>Potential flooding, slips and poor visibility would make driving conditions hazardous, MetService said.</p>
