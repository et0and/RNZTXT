            <p>A man who allegedly fired a weapon during a fight near Wellington Hospital Wednesday has been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old was located at an address in Hawera and arrested without incident about midday Friday, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The suspect will be charged with discharging a firearm with intent to intimidate and will appear in New Plymouth District Court tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Searches of three Hawera addresses are underway, and a shotgun believed to have been used has been located, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Another man was arrested this week over the incident, and was taken into custody for allegedly threatening the other person involved with a machete.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said the altercation began shortly after 5pm on Wednesday outside a motor lodge across the street from the hospital when a person was threatened with a machete by a person driving a white Ford Ranger.</p>
        
            <p>The threatened person then grabbed a firearm and along with another person, jumped into a grey Mitsubishi Colt and drove into the hospital car park, opposite the emergency department's entrance.</p>
        
            <p>The firearm was then discharged during a confrontation, police said.</p>
        
            <p>There was no risk to patients or staff during the incident, Te Whatu Ora said.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries will continue in order to identify and speak with others involved in the incident, including the man in the Mitsubishi Colt at the time of the shooting, police said.</p>
