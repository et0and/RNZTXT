            <p>Player welfare advocates are defending rugby's safety record after the tragic death of a senior club player in east Auckland at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Father-of-three Cory Heather suffered a severe brain injury during an under-85 kilogram club game at Beachlands on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He died a day later in hospital, surrounded by friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Rugby Foundation is coordinating support for both the man's whanau and players and officials rocked by the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old was in action for Beachlands Maraetai in their game against Patumahoe at Te Puru Park when he sustained the head injury.</p>
        
            <p>He was then airlifted to Auckland City Hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Rugby Foundation is a charity that does safety research and campaigning and states it has helped 117 badly injured players over the years.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Lisa Kingi-Bon said its immediate focus is looking after those affected.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tragic event.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a day-by-day process but we're solely focused on the family, those clubs, match officials and the rugby family at large, which demonstrates that rugby takes care of its own."</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances of the fatal injury were not yet known but it was reportedly caused by an accidental knee to the head.</p>
        
            <p>Kingi-Bon said a full investigation would take place but it was too early to speculate on the potential upshot.</p>
        
            <p>"The instant focus on the family and the players, but in due course a proper investigation will occur.</p>
        
            <p>"It's way too early to even start assuming this, or guessing that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very clear process to try and ascertain what happened, but we know there is no foul play."</p>
        
            <p>Before this latest tragedy, a dozen New Zealand rugby players had died on the field, more than half linked to heart-attacks between 2017 and 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Five more players have suffered fatal injuries on the field, linked to head or spinal-related damage.</p>
        
            <p>The last player to die from a head injury was 19-year-old Wellington colts player Daniel Baldwin in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>A coronial investigation into the death - released in 2020 - did not make any recommendations for things that could be done in future to stop similar tragedies.</p>
        
            <p>Former New Zealand Rugby Foundation chair Gerard van Tilborg touched on the uphill battle the game's administrators had around "head trauma and concussion", in its 2022 annual report.</p>
        
            <p>"The pressure in the area to find ways to minimise risk whilst continuing to encourage people to play this great game is obvious.</p>
        
            <p>"The public perception is negative despite the clarity of evidential scientific proof either way."</p>
        
            <p>Kingi-Bon said as terrible as the tragedy was, severe head-related injuries on the rugby field remained rare.</p>
        
            <p>"There are 147,000 registered rugby players in New Zealand, our first injured player is on record from 1966.</p>
        
            <p>"There's risk in everything in life."</p>
        
            <p>The foundation said only one traumatic brain injury reported to ACC had been linked to rugby over the past five years.</p>
        
            <p>Kingi-Bon defended rugby as a code when it comes to player welfare.</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby gets a bad wrap, because it's rugby.</p>
        
            <p>"But at the end of the day, as a code, we do a lot and we do more than most, in terms of keeping our players safe and constantly being proactive in terms of searching for good solutions."</p>
        
            <p>Both New Zealand Rugby and the Counties Manukau Rugby Union (CMRFU) said they were working with the Foundation to offer support to both the club and the man's family.</p>
        
            <p>CMRFU chief executive Chad Shepherd said the union's "heartfelt thoughts and condolences were with Cory's family, loved ones, team-mates and the Beachlands Maraetai Rugby Club at this extremely difficult time".</p>
        
            <p>The Te Puru Park fields have been closed until Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki carry out a whakawātea and perform a tikanga over the space during the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittlepage had raised nearly $90,000 for the man's partner and three children as of Monday night.</p>
