            <p>Wellington City Council has green lit $2 million of extra funding to fix 880 leaky pipes over summer and autumn.</p>
        
            <p>In November, Wellington Water briefed city councillors to indicate it had extra capacity to fix the infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>However, to do the work the water provider would need more money added to its annual budget.</p>
        
            <p>The council agreed to an amendment that supplies an additional $1m in funding if Wellington Water is able to provide assurances that ratepayer money is being used wisely.</p>
        
            <p>It requires Wellington Water to provide reporting data on the work, including details like address of leak, date reported and the date it was fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Council officers would be authorised to release a further $1m in operational funding for leak repair to the water provider if, by 15 March, the initial $1m has been fully utilised and Wellington Water has provided the reports as signalled in Thursday's decision.</p>
        
            <p>The extra funding will be sourced from borrowings.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau said they knew many Wellingtonians would be concerned about the potential water shortages heading into summer.</p>
        
            <p>"This extra funding will help deal with that problem. With 45 percent of the water in the region - 41 percent in Wellington City - being lost to leaks we need to fix as many leaks as possible."</p>
        
            <p>But Whanau said as a council they needed to make sure they delivered value for money for ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"This is why the amendment seeks to ensure that WWL [Wellington Water] can provide us with details as to how and where the extra funding is spent."</p>
        
            <p>The extra funding will be sourced from borrowings.</p>
        
            <p>It follows recent reporting that Wellington Water is working with emergency agencies to deal with potentially critically low water levels this summer.</p>
        
            <p>The capital is currently under level 1 water restrictions, meaning households can only use sprinklers every second day.</p>
        
            <p>But, due to warmer weather and leaky pipe infrastructure, the water provider is preparing for level 4 restrictions - that would see all outdoor residential use for water banned.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water has also recently advised the region's councils they would need $30 billion over 30 years to deliver their recommended programme of work.</p>
