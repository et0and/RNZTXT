            <p>Wellington police have ended the order for all officers to carry guns after a fatal gang shooting in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary order for police to be armed rather than just have weapons in their vehicles had been in place since a 39-year-old man was shot dead in the suburb of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>The victim is believed to be Albert Enoka, who was reportedly a member of the Tribesmen gang and a former president of the Rebels Motorcyle Club's Christchurch chapter.</p>

            <p>Police are still hunting for the shooter, who they say also has gang affiliations.</p>
        
            <p>The man is about 30 years old and described as large with full facial tattoos. He was wearing dark clothing and was with at least two associates.</p>
        
            <p>Police said while people should not approach the man, they did not believe there is a risk to the wider public.</p>
        
            <p>They are asking for any witnesses to come forward and are appealing for sightings of a black 2008 Mercedes saloon, registration KRP453.</p>
