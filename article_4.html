            <p>Flights have resumed at Wellington Airport this morning after low fog cancelled nearly 40 flights on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Despite clear skies, some delays persist.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday 29 Air New Zealand flights and six Sounds Air flights were prevented from taking off or landing due to low fog at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Wellington Airport said the fog had cleared and flights were now able operate normally.</p>
        
            <p>But they said there could be flow on disruptions from Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The airport recommended passengers check directly with their airlines for updates.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said the weather disruption meant a number of its aircraft were out of position this morning.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result, a number of flights out of Wellington this morning were cancelled," chief operating officer Alex Marren said.</p>
        
            <p>Marren said Air New Zealand was actively working to rebook customers, but due to limited availability, some may not be able to travel for a day or two.</p>
        
            <p>Marren said customers no longer wish to travel or who couldn't find a suitable flight would be able to hold their fare in credit.</p>
