            <p>Three people have been charged with kidnapping and manslaughter in relation to the death of a woman found wrapped in plastic in Auckland's Gulf Harbour seven months ago.</p>
        
            <p>The body of 70-year-old Chinese woman Shulai Wang was found in a black rubbish bag in the water in Gulf Harbour on 12 March, but her identity wasn't revealed until October.</p>
        
            <p>A man and two women have now been charged with her kidnapping and manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>The trio were arrested at an Ōrewa address on Thursday morning, acting detective inspector Tim Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the people arrested, a 37-year-old man and 36-year-old woman faced additional charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice and providing false immigration information.</p>
        
            <p>The man also faced a single additional charge of failing to carry out obligations under the search and surveillance act.</p>
        
            <p>The second woman, 61, did not face additional charges beyond kidnapping and manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>The trio were in custody and would appear in North Shore District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>It had taken thousands of hours of investigation work to get to this place in the investigation, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Police had been helped by NZ Customs and Immigration NZ to piece together who Wang was and what happened to her.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation was far from over, Williams said, and police were working with Chinese officials to keep Wang's family updated.</p>
