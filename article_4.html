        <h2>Animal activists demand greyhound racing shut down after three deaths in a week</h2>
        <p>
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says he personally backs a ban, but ultimately it is a decision for Racing Minister Winston Peters.

            <p>Animal charity SAFE is calling for an immediate ban on greyhound racing after the deaths of three dogs in a week and the temporary closure of a track.</p>
        
            <p>Racing was suspended for five weeks at Manukau Stadium on Thursday by Greyhound Racing New Zealand (GRNZ) because of a "concerning increase in injuries" that required "immediate intervention and further investigation".</p>
        
            <p>Races were relocated to Cambridge while international experts assessed the South Auckland stadium, the body said.</p>
        
            <p>However, SAFE head of investigations Will Appelbe said the temporary closure only shifted the risk of injuries and deaths to other racetracks.</p>
        
            <p>"The injuries witnessed at this particular track are appalling, yet sadly, they are not uncommon within the confines of this industry," Appelbe said.</p>
        
            <p>"Injuries and deaths keep piling up, no matter the track. The government must recognise the urgency of this issue and intervene decisively."</p>
        
            <p>He said the deaths of three racing dogs between 11 and 18 March underscored the urgency of the issue.</p>
        
            <p>They included Big Time Punga, who died suddenly after a race at Manawatu Raceway, Palmerston North; Thrilling Spiral, euthanised after sustaining a compound fracture in the right leg at Manukau Stadium; and Uhlan Bale, who died due to blood clots following a spinal fracture at Addington Racetrack in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Appelbe said there had been 2371 injuries, including 250 fractures and 22 deaths since September 2021, when the industry was put on notice over repeated failures in improving animal welfare.</p>
        
            <p>He claimed the industry's self-regulation was failing, and called on Prime Minister Christopher Luxon to ban greyhound racing to protect the health and welfare of the animals.</p>
        
            <p>Asked about the deaths at the post-Cabinet media briefing on Monday afternoon, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the ban would be "something for the Racing Minister [Winston Peters] to consider".</p>
        
            <p>The government had not yet had any discussions or made any decisions on the matter, but Luxon said he was personally "aligned with where the previous government was heading".</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a lot of sympathy about actually where the future of greyhound racing goes, as per the previous government. They'd undertaken a review, there was a discussion about should it go ahead or not.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm supportive of the previous government's position, which was actually there are serious concerns around the future of that industry.</p>
        
            <p>"[But] until we have a Cabinet conversation about it fully - which we haven't, it hasn't been a priority in our first 100 days - we'll get there and we'll have that conversation there."</p>
        
            <p>But GRNZ said while it was saddened and disappointed by the euthanasia of Thrilling Spiral, it did not agree with a ban and the rate of raceday euthanasia had reduced significantly in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2018/19 racing season, there were 67 raceday euthanasias, a spokesperson said. In the past two seasons, there were seven in each year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is due to the animal welfare measures that GRNZ has put in place and continues to put in place."</p>
        
            <p>GRNZ said it did not know where SAFE's figures came from, assuming they were based on stand-downs after races, many of which were precautionary.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said every serious injury on its racetracks was reviewed by a GRNZ serious injury review committee, and its serious injury figures were reported to the minister of racing and subject to independent review by the Racing Integrity Board.</p>
        
            <p>GRNZ also said it was the only racing code in New Zealand to rehome animals with career-ending injuries, and during the past 18 months it had implemented an injury reduction strategy.</p>
        
            <p>Last May, GRNZ introduced a revised set of welfare standards setting out the minimum standards for the care and welfare of greyhounds.</p>
        
            <p>"GRNZ will continue to put animal welfare at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that our sport deserves to maintain its social licence to operate.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to make ongoing positive improvements across the industry with our standards of animal welfare to ensure that greyhound racing has a long and sustainable future in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon and Labour leader Chris Hipkins both agree Greyhound racing should be banned during last year's election campaign.</p>
