        <h2>42,000 at Parliament during 'extraordinary' hīkoi</h2>
        <p>
By mid-afternoon today 42,000 people gathered at the Parliamentary precinct and the surrounding streets, police say.
</p>
        
            <p>More than 42,000 people gathered as the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti overflowed from Parliament's grounds and onto nearby Wellington streets.</p>
        
            <p>Eru Kapa-Kingi told the crowd "Māori nation has been born" today and that 'Te Tiriti is forever'.</p>
        
            <p>ACT leader David Seymour was met with chants of "Kill the bill, kill the bill" when he walked out of the Beehive for a brief appearance at Parliament's forecourt, before waving to the crowd and returning into the building.</p>
        
            <p>The Treaty Principles Bill architect, Seymour, says he supports the right to protest, but thinks participants are misguided and have a range of different grievances.</p>
