        <h2>Changing speed limits back may cost $25m in Auckland alone</h2>
        <p>
The government's order to move speed limits back up comes with a hefty bill, Auckland Transport says.

Setting up variable speed limits around schools, which would lower speeds only during pick-up and drop-off times, is estimated to cost $16.7 million around Auckland.

            <p>Auckland Transport estimates it could cost up to $25 million to meet the government's new speed rule to increase speed limits on roads where it has been lowered and put in variable school speed limits.</p>
        
            <p>The Minister of Transport signed the speed rule into law last month, ordering speed limits be reversed to their pre-2019 levels by 1 July next year, and introducing variable speed limits around schools a year after that.</p>
        
            <p>General manager of transport safety Teresa Burnett told the Auckland Transport board on Tuesday that speed limits on 1800 local roads will need to be increased.</p>
        
            <p>The majority of those - 1760 - are in neighbourhoods with schools in the area, where limits were lowered from 50km/hr to 30km/hr.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport estimates that reversing speed limits could cost $7.5m - made up of changing signs and road markings in reduced speed areas.</p>
        
            <p>Setting up variable speed limits around schools, which would lower speeds only during pick-up and drop-off times, is estimated to cost $16.7m.</p>
        
            <p>Another $450,000 will need to be spent on advertising, informing people of the speed changes.</p>
        
            <p>Burnett told the board that no new funding was allocated from the government to cover reversing speed limits, and the cost will have to be covered by Auckland Transport.</p>
        
            <p>Board member and councillor for the North Shore Chris Darby asked if there was any ability to refuse to reverse speed limits.</p>
        
            <p>The board was told it was not a "lawful option" available to Auckland Transport, and there was no room for consultation on whether to carry out speed limit increases.</p>
        
            <p>But, under the new speed rule legislation, there was an option to set new speed limits of 40km /hr in town centres, but that would have to be applied for after 1 July next year.</p>
        
            <p>Burnett noted it would be logistically difficult to change speed limit signs and road markings by 1 July 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Guidance on managing speeds under the new rule from NZTA is still to come.</p>
