            <p>Philip Polkinghorne's DNA was detected on bloodstains found throughout the retired eye surgeon's Auckland home, a jury has been told.</p>
        
            <p>The 71-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Pauline Hanna in 2021 and staging her death to look like a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>DNA analyst Timothy Power told the High Court in Auckland that Polkinghorne's DNA was found on at least three bloodstains, including on a handrail near the garage door.</p>
        
            <p>"A partial DNA profile was obtained from the sample, 'partial' meaning that DNA results were obtained at some but not all of the DNA sites we tested," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Where results were obtained they corresponded with Mr Polkinghorne's reference sample."</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne's lawyer Ron Mansfield KC asked if the DNA could have already been present on the handrail before the blood appeared.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite being called a probable blood stain, we can't attribute any of the DNA detected to the probable blood in that sample," Power said</p>
        
            <p>"You can't tell us that the DNA is in the probable blood or in the handrail itself?" Mansfield asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Correct," Power responded.</p>
        
            <p>Part of the Crown's case was that Polkinghorne's behaviour was influenced by methamphetamine use.</p>
        
            <p>Former drug analyst Cameron Johnson had tested six separate samples of white crystalline powder found hidden throughout the Upland Road home.</p>
        
            <p>The largest quantity of drugs was found in a drawer in the ensuite bathroom.</p>
        
            <p>"[The crystals weighed] 18.0 grams, they contained methamphetamine and a purity test was also done which was 80 percent methamphetamine," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Another substance called eutylone was also identified.</p>
        
            <p>"[A bag of] off-white crystalline powder contained eutylone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Eutylone is what would be called a controlled drug analogue."</p>
        
            <p>Eutylone is a synthetic drug with a similar appearance and structure to methamphetamine.</p>
