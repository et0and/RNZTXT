            <p>A fight in Wellington Zoo's capybara enclosure ultimately caused the death of its hugely popular capybara Luna.</p>
        
            <p>Te Nukuao Wellington Zoo recently shared the news of Luna's death in an email to customers, leaving Dia as its sole capybara.</p>
        
            <p>Acting wildlife director Nick Dunn said the rodent had been sick for several weeks with chronic gut problems and diarrhoea, but she had been getting treatment and was stable.</p>
        
            <p>But Luna required blood tests, which meant removing her from her enclosure and giving her anaesthetic.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortuantely with this species, the are notoriously difficult - when you take one out of the group and have to put it back they can become quite aggressive towards each other," Dunn said.</p>
        
            <p>He said as a result, they only remove one from the herd if it ws absolutely necessary, which it was in Luna's case.</p>
        
            <p>"We got Luna the anaesthetic which she woke up from nicely, but unfortunately on the re-introduction - although it seemed like it was all going well - the girls had a bit of a fight," Dunn said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rodents have big old teeth and Dia caused a number of wounds on Luna that she was unable to survive."</p>
        
            <p>He said normally the robust, thick-skinned animals would be easily able to heal from such injuries, but because Luna had been unwell, it was too much for her to overcome.</p>
        
            <p>While the zoo was still awaiting the blood test results, Dunn said it had confirmed Luna's condition was not infectious.</p>
        
            <p>He said capybara have an extremely complicated gut microbiome.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortuantely for Luna, there was something out of balance in her intestinal tract and we're trying to get to the bottom of what that was."</p>
        
            <p>The results are due back in the first few days of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Since the news of Luna's death, the zoo had received a huge outpouring of support from the public, which Dunn said showed just how loved she was.</p>
        
            <p>"The keepers get very close to the animals they work with, and every animal we lose is a big loss. But Luna was very special to them, as well as to our visitors," Dunn said.</p>
        
            <p>"Capybara are hugely popular; they're sort of a viral sensation and everyone who's met Luna in one of our close encounters feels particularly close to her - and our other capybara (Dia).</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a real show of support from our community, which we'd like to thank everyone for, very much."</p>
        
            <p>Dia was also receiving extra attention and support from the mammals team, because capybara were herd animals.</p>
        
            <p>"She's eating well, she's behaving quite normally, she's still engaging with the keepers for her trianing and everything else, so at the moment she's looking ok."</p>
        
            <p>But Dia will not have to remain alone for very long.</p>
        
            <p>Plans have been underway for a while for Wellington Zoo to introduce a male capybara to the enclosure as a mate.</p>
        
            <p>But those plans had to be put on hold when Luna got sick.</p>
        
            <p>"We were going to be breeding with our females here, but the loss of Luna means we've only got Dia now," Dunn said.</p>
        
            <p>"So the plan is we'll be bringing in a male in from Brooklands Zoo in New Plymouth, his name is Fernando. Fernando will come in and we'll introduce those two and they'll form their own little herd here."</p>
        
            <p>Dunn said he hoped Fernando and Dia can be introduced within the first few weeks of January.</p>
