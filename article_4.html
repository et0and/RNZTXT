            <p>A prisoner on a hunger strike is in Waikato Hospital in a serious condition after almost two months without food.</p>
        
            <p>Brad Flutey was in Spring Hill Corrections Facility after he was found guilty of a number of charges stemming from the anti-mandate protest including not wearing a mask in a bottle shop in WhangƒÅrei during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He is yet to be sentenced after protracted delays caused by Flutey being absent from several court appearances.</p>
        
            <p>According to the lawyer who represents Flutey, Sue Grey, he has been on a hunger strike since July because he was "aggrieved" at the charges that landed him in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Grey said he Flutey was now trying to end his 57 day hunger strike, but it was a complicated process as he was in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>Before being admitted, Flutey lost 29 kilograms, had been vomiting blood and was dehydrated, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was still able to speak with family," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Although in hospital where he could be better monitored, Grey said family and friends were concerned, as his condition could change quickly.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Corrections general manager Scott Walker confirmed a prisoner had been taken to hospital on Thursday afternoon after he refused to eat food.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said the prisoner was in a non-critical condition and Correction's priority was his wellbeing and safety, as well as encouraging him to resume eating as per the plan that has been developed by the medical team, in consultation with Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand staff.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate this is a difficult and distressing situation for the man's family and we will continue to ensure they can maintain close, ongoing contact with him."</p>
        
            <p>Walker said frontline staff have consistently demonstrated that they take their duty of care for the man "extremely seriously".</p>
