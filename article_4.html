            <p>Fire and Emergency says the threat of toxic fumes from a boat shed fire in Hamilton has gone.</p>
        
            <p>Eight fire trucks helped tackle the large blaze at its peak on Wednesday, and the fire was put out about 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out at 5.30pm at the building on Te Rapa Road and a large cloud of smoke drifted towards Rototuna and Chartwell.</p>
        
            <p>An emergency mobile alert was sent to warn residents to stay inside with their windows and doors closed to avoid the smoke.</p>
        
            <p>This warning was lifted just after 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigators will be at the scene on Thursday.</p>
