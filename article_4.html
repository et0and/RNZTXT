            <p>The union representing Wellington train staff aren't ruling out a full strike if today's industrial action doesn't work.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington train passengers were being advised to find another way to travel today as passengers may face disruptions, as staff begin work-to-rule industrial action ahead of contract talks.</p>
        
            <p>Rail and Maritime Transport Union spokesperson Todd Valster told Morning Report the staff today would work to the master roster which should mean "minimal" disruption.</p>
        
            <p>Unless TransDev overreacted and cancelled services, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The master roster should work but there may be some disruption.</p>
        
            <p>"The action is legitimate action and they're trying to make a point to the employer."</p>
        
            <p>The union couldn't rule out a full strike, which would see most services cancelled, if they weren't successful on Tuesday, Valster said.</p>
        
            <p>Staff were "trying to do their best" not to disrupt passengers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But they were unhappy with proposed changes to their employment conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink said workers had voted to take all breaks and not work overtime or accept alterations to their shifts.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Samantha Gain said passengers should plan ahead, because train services could be cancelled or delayed at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>She said limited bus replacements would be available for cancelled trains.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Regional Councillor Thomas Nash told Morning Report he encouraged both parties to negotiate in good faith.</p>
        
            <p>"We hope things will be okay but I do think if you can avoid using the train today that would be good day to do it until we know more about how the service is going to run, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've got a situation where your workforce taking their breaks as planned, and deciding not to do overtime, suddenly puts you at risk of your public services not running then maybe we're running things a little to close to the bone."</p>
        
            <p>TransDev Wellington declined to be interviewed on RNZ' Morning Report. </p>
