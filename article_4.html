            <p>Two people are dead after a fiery two-vehicle crash in Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>The crash at the intersection of Mountain Road and Boylan Road on State Highway 3 in Eltham was reported to police at 5.50am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The senior sergeant at the scene, Andrew Russ, said there was one person in each car.</p>
        
            <p>He said police were still working on getting the victims' bodies out of the cars, and would then be able to confirm there had been no further deaths.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement earlier on Wednesday, police said "multiple people" had died, but officers were still working out how many people had been in the car that caught fire.</p>
        
            <p>"Inquiries to determine the occupancy may take some time and an update will be issued when possible.</p>
        
            <p>The car which set alight was already "fully involved" when firefighters arrived on scene, Fire and Emergency NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>UPDATE 10:20AMSCU is investigating this crash and the road is likely to remain CLOSED for several hours. SB to detour via Rotokare Rd, Fraser Rd, Austin Rd, Ngarongo Rd, Ohangai Rd onto SH3. NB to detour via Skeet Rd, Lower Hunter Rd, Eltham Rd, Bridge St, and back onto SH3. ^AP https://t.co/klQ0z5vzAD</p>
        
            <p>Assistant area commander Clive Lennox said crews from HƒÅwera and Eltham responded.</p>
        
            <p>"They secured the scene, checked on the vehicles and extinguished the car that was on fire."</p>
        
            <p>Police said diversions were in place at State Highway 3 and Dalziell Road for northbound traffic and State Highway 3 and Rotokare Road for southbound traffic.</p>
        
            <p>"The road is expected to remain closed for some time while a scene examination is conducted.</p>
        
            <p>"An investigation into the cause of the crash is under way."</p>
