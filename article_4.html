            <p>Hundreds of people took to Napier's streets in protest on Sunday, campaigning against cuts to the city's after-hours health services.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ initially proposed to remove Napier's overnight urgent care service and replace it with a tele-health model.</p>
        
            <p>After a public backlash the government decided it would not do that, announcing on Friday that the service at Napier Health on Wellesley Road will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Simeon Brown says Napier residents will receive more comprehensive care such as access to nurse prescribers, plus overnight medical support from a doctor via telehealth.</p>
        
            <p>But residents are outraged that the new service does not include an on-site doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Protest organiser Sally Davenport told RNZ they were desperately hoping the government will listen.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to do something - this is way not acceptable, particularly as we were totally and utterly cut off during the Cyclone. It's just wrong," she said.</p>
        
            <p>About 250 people marched gathered in central Napier on Sunday in protest, including local mayors, patients and nurses. They marched to Napier Health and formed a human chain outside.</p>

            <p>The crowd was filled with all ages, from young families to elderly in wheelchairs. Among them was Raelene Wood, with her mother Isobel. Both women were worried about losing the ability to see a doctor in Napier after hours.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really concerning, I've had to use it a few times over the years - you have to pay through the nose but to know you will see a doctor. A telehealth doctor or whatever they are proposing is not good enough," said Raelene.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Kirsten Wise agreed.</p>
        
            <p>"I doubt there is another city in this country where they don't have a GP overnight urgent care service," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Wise said the government was falling well short of assurances made when Napier's hospital was closed in 1998.</p>
        
            <p>"There were promises made, a commitment made, about the level of health care services we would have here in Napier, but those are slowly disappearing.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually want a commitment to increase all health services - outpatient clinics, specialist clinics - to the level originally promised," said the mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Something Patient Voice Aotearoa chair Malcolm Mulholland, who helped organise the protest, also wanted to see this.</p>
        
            <p>"My message to the government would be - be open, honest and transparent - tell Napier what they can and cannot expect, and is there any hope of them getting a GP overnight?" he said.</p>
        
            <p>The new changes include:</p>
        
            <p>But New Zealand Nurses Organisation kaiwhakahaere Kerri Nuku said those services will have limitations for prescribing.</p>
        
            <p>"What we are wanting is people face to face at either the calibre of a doctor or a nurse practitioner," she said.</p>

            <p>The health minister said it was a good solution for Napier.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only will the existing service be retained, Health New Zealand has agreed to enhance the overnight service so that Napier residents can receive more comprehensive care such as access to nurse prescribers, plus overnight medical support from a doctor via telehealth," said Brown.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a significant improvement on the status quo and means that the local community will have access to a better service, delivered from Napier Health at 76 Wellesley Road, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Brown.</p>
        
            <p>He said urgent care is not emergency care, which is provided for at Hawke's Bay Hospital.</p>

            <p>Health New Zealand spokesperson David Warrington said in a statement that it was committed to ensuring communities had access to sustainable and effective health services, including urgent after-hours care.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important to clarify the health services available and reassure the Napier community of our ongoing efforts to enhance healthcare services across our region."</p>
        
            <p>The merger of the afterhours services of City Medical and The Doctors Napier meant their service began operating from one location at Napier Health, with a new closing time of 8pm (instead of 9pm) from 1 March.</p>
        
            <p>Since 1 March, Health NZ said it's been bridging the gap by starting its overnight nurse provided after-hours service an hour early, from 8pm to 8am (instead of starting at 9pm).</p>
        
            <p>He said the overnight service would be enhanced with the addition of a nurse prescriber and online support from a doctor.</p>
        
            <p>He also disputed claims that Napier's health services have been reduced.</p>
        
            <p>"Health NZ has actively increased investment, including purchasing the Napier Health building last year. This acquisition reinforces our commitment to the community and allows us to adapt services to evolving needs.</p>
        
            <p>"Napier Health does not provide emergency department-level care. It's important to distinguish between urgent care and emergency care. Urgent care addresses non-life-threatening conditions requiring timely medical attention. People needing emergency care should go to Hawke's Bay Hospital or call 111," he said.</p>
