            <p>A student living in a University of Auckland hall of residence is being treated in hospital after it was confirmed they had meningococcal disease.</p>
        
            <p>The university was working with the Auckland Regional Public Health Service to manage the case and identify any potential close contacts of the student, a Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Three people who have been sharing an apartment with the student were most at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, no further cases of meningococcal disease have been confirmed in that group.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk to the wider University of Auckland community is therefore considered low."</p>
        
            <p>The university wished the unwell student a speedy recovery, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Its priority remained the health, safety and well-being of all its staff and students.</p>
