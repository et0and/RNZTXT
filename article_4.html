        <h2>Halting of emergency coordination system won't affect disaster response - minister</h2>
        <p>
The work, which looked to share information across the emergency services, has been dropped due to public service cuts.

            <p>The halting of an emergency database coordination project will not affect the government's ability to prepare for and respond to natural disasters, a minister says.</p>
        
            <p>The Mateparae inquiry, the main review of the response to Cyclone Gabrielle, recommended that a system be built to share a common operating picture, so responders had a better overall grasp of threats and resources.</p>
        
            <p>That recommendation had been made several times over the years.</p>
        
            <p>Land Information New Zealand had, since 2021, been building a prototype system for sharing its emergency databases across police, Fire and Emergency, Civil Defence and other groups - but dropped it after reviewing its budget amid the public sector cuts ordered by the government.</p>
        
            <p>The office of Minister for Land Information Chris Penk said the project was only ever a pilot and it was not LINZ's role to develop a common operating picture. Instead, that was something that Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell was looking at.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to not to progress the project does not affect the government's ability to better prepare for and respond to emergencies," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Minister Mitchell's work and any possible development of a common operating picture is separate to the work that LINZ was carrying out and is unaffected by LINZ's decision to discontinue development" on a common operating datasets for emergency management, or CODEM system, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>LINZ spent $50,000 over three years from baseline budgets to come up with a CODEM demonstrator.</p>

            <p>Penk's office said this was to show how users could access geospatial datasets online from a single point. It did not have any emergency warning capability.</p>
        
            <p>"It was never intended to go beyond this step unless dedicated funding was secured," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"The CODEM project wasn't mandated by government and the decision to discontinue it was an operational decision by LINZ."</p>
        
            <p>Budget changes did not affect LINZ's core function of providing geospatial information to support emergency responses, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>LINZ has provided such information in 10 storms since 2020, including Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary Day floods, its records show.</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, a core finding of the Mateparae inquiry, and others into the lethal storms last year, was that coordinated information - and thus, coordinated action - was lacking.</p>
        
            <p>"The inquiry heard that a lack of situational awareness and timely, complete, and consistent information contributed to problems with the immediate management of the response in some areas, exacerbated by the lack of a common operating platform," it said in April 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Though LINZ is the country's leading geospatial public agency, the 164-page Mateparae report did not mention it at all, and 'LINZ' did not appear in the report's long list of acronyms.</p>
        
            <p>LINZ told RNZ that the pandemic spurred on its CODEM project.</p>
        
            <p>"There was willingness across key emergency response agencies for improved and coordinated geospatial information, systems and capability across government during an emergency event," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2021, LINZ led discussions with (the National Emergency Management Agency) and geospatial specialists from emergency response agencies on their common operating picture requirements."</p>
        
            <p>NEMA, the National Emergency Management Agency, has had few geospatial resources of its own up to this point.</p>
        
            <p>Penk's office said the government took emergency management very seriously and the Budget had committed more than $1 billion for cyclone relief, resilience, and emergency preparedness.</p>
