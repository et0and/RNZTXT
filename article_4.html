            <p>A central Auckland retailer is facing charges after a police operation unwrapped the distribution of stolen goods.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation, which was ongoing, resulted in a search warrant being executed at a convenience store in the city late on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>In the process, more than 50 blocks of chocolate were recovered after being stolen from a city supermarket earlier in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Central area commander Inspector Grant Tetzlaff said police had been investigating a series of thefts recently.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff in the city have been keeping a close eye on the wider picture of those involved in the initial offending, but also where these products are ending up.</p>
        
            <p>"Enquiries have led to the search warrant being carried out late on Friday."</p>
        
            <p>A 42-year-old man was set to appear in court on charges of receiving stolen property.</p>
        
            <p>The actions of a "few small retailers" was "disappointing", Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"This behaviour simply continues a cycle of offending and means their industry colleagues are likely to be targeted and victimised in their businesses."</p>
        
            <p>Buying stolen goods is a criminal offence.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message to retailers is that they should be more aware if they are being approached to buy product at very low prices," Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are being approached to buy at bargain-basement prices, you could be dealing in stolen merchandise."</p>
        
            <p>Any such approaches should be reported to police.</p>
        
            <p>The arrest comes off the back of ongoing efforts to target retail crime offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past six months we have laid hundreds of charges for theft at central city businesses."</p>
        
            <p>The operation is continuing, and Police anticipate investigations into theft of other items will lead to arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"We are following some lines of enquiry, and we cannot rule out laying further charges over the initial thefts or those involved in receiving stolen goods," Inspector Tetzlaff says.</p>
        
            <p>As for the man facing charges, he is expected in the Auckland District Court on 7 June.</p>
