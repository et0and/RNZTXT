            <p>The Olympic Pools in Auckland is investigating after two men were found unconscious in a swimming pool at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had to be resuscitated by staff and a visiting doctor on Saturday evening after they got into difficulty at the Olympic Pools and Fitness Centre in Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>The two men - believed to be in their 20s and 30s - remain in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Olympic Pools director Peter Rust said the men appeared to be free divers who were practising holding their breath under water.</p>
        
            <p>They were told not to do that by lifeguards, he said.</p>
        
            <p>They were looking at what happened, as well as reviewing the rules for free divers training at the pools, Rust said.</p>
