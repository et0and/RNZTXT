            <p>Two runners have been rescued after getting lost in Tararua Forest Park on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The pair was training for an upcoming event and had run from Waiohine Gorge in Wairarapa on a 32km circuit, but lost their way while descending from Mt Neil and became stranded in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>They called for help about 7.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Anthony Matheson said Hawke's Bay Rescue helicopter delivered a Police Land Search and Rescue team to the nearby Mt Cone.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were found an hour after the helicopter landed, about 1000m altitude and several hours' walk from the nearest road.</p>
        
            <p>"They were lightly equipped, and sub-zero temperatures were forecast for overnight, so time was of the essence in finding them."</p>
        
            <p>The cold pair were found sharing a survival blanket and were flown out of the park before it began to rain, Matheson said.</p>
        
            <p>They were assessed by a paramedic but did not require further medical attention.</p>
        
            <p>Police urged members of the public to be prepared when they went running or tramping: "Forests like the Tararua Forest Park can be harsh and unforgiving during the colder months".</p>
        
            <p>Matheson said those thinking of heading out should choose a trip suitable for their abilities, understand the weather, share their plans, and prepare for an unexpected night out by packing warm clothes, extra food, and a distress beacon.</p>
