            <p>A New Zealand-led taskforce has made a successful drug bust of 260 kilograms of narcotics, worth $87.8 million, from a boat off the coast of Oman.</p>
        
            <p>It included 50kg of heroin and 210kg of methamphetamine, and brings the total value of drugs seized by the Combined Task Force 150 since New Zealand took command in January to NZ$480m.</p>
        
            <p>The crew of the United States Coast Guard Cutter Emlen Tunnell observed "suspicious activity" by a ship 400 nautical miles southeast of the Oman coast.</p>
        
            <p>When they boarded the vessel, they discovered the narcotics, which were seized and then destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Royal New Zealand Navy Captain Dave Barr, acting Commander of CTF 150, said this bust was a testament to the expert seamanship of the USCGC Emlen Tunnell, operating in challenging waters.</p>
        
            <p>"The waters in this area are full of legitimate fishing and trading vessels so it's important to get this part right and accurately identify those vessels that are likely to be carrying narcotics," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A big part of our mission is to deter smugglers, so that those legitimate operators can continue to navigate freely to carry out their business."</p>
        
            <p>He said while the amounts seized might seem like "a drop in the pond", so far they had prevented almost half a billion New Zealand dollars-worth of product from doing harm.</p>
        
            <p>"Will there be more smuggled? Of course there will. We can't stop it all, but in a nod to our key partners from India, as Mahatma Ghandi is famous for saying - you may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results. So we'll keep trying, and we'll stop what we can."</p>
        
            <p>CTF 150 was one of five operational task forces under the Combined Maritime Forces based in Bahrain, focussed on drug smuggling in the Middle East.</p>
        
            <p>Royal New Zealand Navy frigate HMNZS Te Kaha was set to join the taskforce this week, conducting similar patrols.</p>
