            <p>Possible thunderstorms could darken much of the south on Christmas Day, and people in Hawke's Bay and Gisborne have been issued a heavy rain warning for Boxing Day onwards.</p>
        
            <p>A severe thunderstorm warning was issued for the Selwyn and Ashburton areas until 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there were severe thunderstorms moving south which may be accompanied by torrential rain.</p>
        
            <p>For the latest warnings, see MetService's rolling updates.</p>
        
            <p>The fresh weather warnings came following earlier forecasts of showers or rain during Christmas Day for much of the country, with a collection of mayors saying the wet forecast wouldn't be enough to dampen Christmas Day celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecasters issued the Heavy Rain Warning, for a period from early morning Boxing Day, for Gisborne-Tair훮whiti, and Hawke's Bay north of Napier.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 130mm of rain is expected to fall, and possibly more in localised areas, and thunderstorms are possible. It said that means there is potential for streams and rivers to rise rapidly, as well as flooding and slips.</p>
        
            <p>A thunderstorm watch was also issued during Christmas Day for parts of the South Island until 8pm on the 25th. It includes inland Canterbury, north and inland Otago, Dunedin, Southland, Clutha, Fiordland, and the Southern Lakes District, which could expect downpours up to 40mm an hour.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned people in these areas to be on the lookout in case of worsening weather conditions.</p>
        
            <p>For Christmas Day, rain was expected to arrive in the morning along the western side of the South Island, and extend eastwards in the afternoon. In the North Island, rain was forecast for during the afternoon, for the western parts, and to reach the rest of the North Island later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Whang훮rei's mayor Vince Cocurullo is undeterred by the Christmas Day forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"I take everything that the MetService says with a pinch of salt," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are times when they say it's going to rain and then it's beautiful sunshine, and there are times when they say there'll be beautiful sunshine and then it rains."</p>
        
            <p>He said Whang훮rei had welcomed an influx of visitors over the Christmas period, a relief after years of roading woes through the Brynderwyn Hills.</p>

            <p>"There's a lot of people coming up north, as I live on the state highway I can see a lot of people travelling north," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the past four years we've had quite a few upsets so this year having a clean road up to the north is really great."</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara District mayor Craig Jepson was similarly optimistic.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas is a day when it doesn't matter what the weather [is like], you can enjoy it and enjoy your friends and family," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounds like it'll be nice in the morning so I think people will work around the weather, hit the beach, have a swim, freshen up in the morning and then tuck into a bit of Christmas food and cheer in the afternoon so one way or another they're going to have a good day, I think."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, regions on the east coast including Gisborne would enjoy the best weather New Zealand could offer.</p>
        
            <p>MetService predicted Gisborne would reach a high of 28 degrees on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>"We are loving every moment, if there's one place in the country that deserves the best weather it is Gisborne," mayor Rehette Stoltz said, referencing the devastating 2023 storms.</p>
        
            <p>"Things are definitely looking up, we have done so much and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved... Everyone deserves a wonderful break this summer and the beautiful weather coming our way is an absolute bonus and so well deserved."</p>

            <p>She said the town was thriving over the Christmas period, with Rhythm and Vines to follow.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been in and out of town for the last two days, and it is buzzing with great energy. I have met up with visitors from out of town, we are seeing lots of visitors coming to our place because they all know it's the best weather in the country," Stoltz said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic, we need everyone to support us and help us bring our economy back to what it was before the horrendous 2023, and we can only do that if people come and visit us and support our local businesses."</p>
