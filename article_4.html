            <p>A man has been charged after attempting to escape police by opening a plane's emergency exit door during take-off at Auckland Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed a 28-year-old man was apprehended after jumping from the door and landing on the tarmac, injuring himself in the process on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>He was attempting to escape police custody while onboard the flight, police said.</p>
