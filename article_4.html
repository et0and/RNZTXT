            <p>A reported sighting of fugitive father on-the-run Tom Phillips and his children was not the group, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were seen dressed in camouflage on State Highway 4 about 8.30pm on Sunday, about 100m south of the Tikitiki Road intersection with Mapara North Road, Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The sighting was reported to police who confirmed on Wednesday evening someone from the group had come forward and confirmed they were not Tom Phillips or his three children.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had received a number of calls from the public regarding the sighting and had since confirmed the sighting was not Phillips or his children.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank members of the public who contacted us following the appeal, and the initial caller who reported the sighting.</p>
        
            <p>"We rely on information from the public to assist in our search and active investigation, and we ask anyone who sees Maverick, Ember, Jayda, or Tom to please contact police."</p>
        
            <p>A search has been on for Phillips and his three children Jayda, 11, Maverick, nine, and Ember, eight, since December 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Their location is unknown, but police believed they were hiding out in Western Waikato within Marokopa, or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>In October, a video captured by teenage hunters north of Awamarino showed a man followed by three children in wet-weather gear carrying camouflaged backpacks.</p>
        
            <p>In the footage - which police described as a "credible sighting" of Phillips and the children - the group could be seen trekking through rough, overgrown terrain before disappearing behind a hill.</p>
        
            <p>Police launched a three-day hunt using helicopters and officers on the ground, but were criticised for their slow response, with some questioning why they did not use drones, search dogs and heat-seeking devices.</p>
        
            <p>The children's mother - who was estranged from Phillips - had also spoken out on the police response, pleading with the public to provide information and telling Mata Reports' Mihingarangi Forbes she had been abused by online trolls.</p>
