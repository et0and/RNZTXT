            <p>A prisoner that escaped Waikato Hospital after allegedly assaulting two corrections officers and carjacking a vehicle has been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified of a person escaping custody at around 12.30pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The 25-year-old managed to break free from custodial staff during an offsite specialist medical appointment, before reportedly stealing a car from hospital parking and fleeing, detective inspector Darrell Harpur said.</p>
        
            <p>A manhunt began with the Eagle helicopter tracking the offender until ground staff successfully spiked the vehicle on Cambridge Road, Leamington around 3.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>The car came to a stop off Cambridge Road about five minutes later, before the man was taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>He is now due to appear in the Hamilton District Court on Saturday, and is facing a number of serious charges.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a rapidly evolving incident, and I would like to commend staff who swiftly formulated and executed a plan to locate and arrest the man involved before further people were brought in harm's way," Harpur said.</p>
