            <p>Hastings Police believe they may have solved a case of wandering gnomes which has left a number of local gardens without their beloved curios.</p>
        
            <p>Officers discovered an array of animals, gnomes, fairies and other creatures in the garden of a suspect they were visiting after receiving a tip off.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said, on entering the property, officers came face to face with a stolen elephant gnome in the centre of the suspect's room.</p>
        
            <p>A woman has been charged three counts of burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the large number of items recovered meant there could be more victims and they urged residents in the St Leonards area - whose garden ornaments had mysteriously disappeared - to get in touch.</p>
