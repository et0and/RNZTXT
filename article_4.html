            <p>An agreement to restore the Oriental Bay Band Rotunda has been terminated, with Wellington City Council looking at other options.</p>
        
            <p>The council-owned landmark has stood empty for more than a decade. It is earthquake prone and requires significant strengthening work.</p>
        
            <p>Strengthening work began in 2021 after Wellington City Council signed a long-term lease with the construction firm McKee Fehl and its sister company Cheops Holdings, which specialises in developing historic buildings.</p>
        
            <p>But RNZ reported in January that nothing had happened on the site for more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Cheops Holdings managing director Maurice Clark said that was because they had not found a restaurateur willing to take it on.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said it and Clark mutually agreed to terminate the development agreement and lease for the rotunda.</p>
        
            <p>"Council is now in discussions with other parties with regards to developing the site. Further details are currently unavailable due to the commercially sensitive nature of these discussions."</p>

Originally built as a bathing pavilion in 1938, the Oriental Bay Band Rotunda housed several restaurants and bars from the 1980s until it was found to be quake prone.

            <p>Clark said although the decision to end the agreement was mutual, he was "disappointed" as they had been making some progress on finding a tenant and investor for the rotunda, and had "strong interest" when the council decided to cancel.</p>
        
            <p>Lambton Ward councillor Iona Pannett was also disappointed the agreement had been scrapped, and wanted to see to council go back and negotiate a new agreement with Clark.</p>
        
            <p>"Maurice is one of the best heritage developers in the country. He's done some amazing work and really he probably just needed a bit more time because it's such a tricky site," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Pannett said the issues with the rotunda also highlighted the need for reform to the building act.</p>
        
            <p>"We do need a pragmatic way forward on costs around strengthening earthquake prone buildings."</p>
