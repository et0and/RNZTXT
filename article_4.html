            <p>A famously ugly shoe is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to safety, data shows.</p>
        
            <p>So far this year, ACC has paid out nearly $2 million to people with 'fall related' claims involving jandals, high heels and Crocs alone.</p>
        
            <p>The total number of Croc-related accidents in the year to September has already surpassed 2023's figure, up to 128 from 109.</p>
        
            <p>The number of jandal-related accidents is decreasing, while high heel accidents have remained steady over the past four years, the data shows.</p>
        
            <p>Losing balance or skidding on foot was the most common way for people to sustain injuries in both jandals and Crocs.</p>
        
            <p>A twisting movement was the most common way to be injured wearing heels - 70 people were injured in this fashion over the past nine months.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, at least 10 people were "struck by a person or animal" while wearing Crocs, jandals heels, causing a significant enough injury to require ACC.</p>

            <p>For the year to date, more than $1.3 million has been paid in active costs relating to the 495 people who needed to recover from jandal accidents.</p>
        
            <p>While some people might need more assistance than others, that cost about $2700 on average per jandal accident.</p>
        
            <p>For high heel injuries, about $472,720 was paid out, and for Croc-related accidents, $63,797 was paid out.</p>
        
            <p>The number of people hurt while wearing Crocs tripled between 2022 and 2023, while the cost to ACC of treating those injuries doubled.</p>
        
            <p>On the numbers and costs alone, the humble jandal appears to sustain the most damage to the wearer.</p>
        
            <p>High heels come in second, with Crocs climbing the ranks to third.</p>
        
            <p>ACC said the data for this year was not definitive.</p>
        
            <p>When people hurt themselves, they had options to describe on the form how it happened.</p>
        
            <p>"This field is not mandatory to complete and not every client does so. Also, when the field is completed, there is considerable variation in the way accidents are described."</p>
        
            <p>That meant there could be a much larger number of people who had footwear-related injuries who had not noted the type of footwear on the form.</p>
