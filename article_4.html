        <p>
The cancellation comes after the ferry hit a wharf and twice lost power in the past month.

            <p>A sailing of the Bluebridge's Connemara ferry has been cancelled yet again.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said a return freight sailing between Wellington and Picton had been cancelled on Sunday night due to engineering checks in port taking longer than expected.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the same ferry lost power on one of its engines in Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Just over three weeks ago it lost power and drifted for hours in the Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the Connemara also hit and damaged fenders on Waitohi Wharf in Picton while berthing.</p>
