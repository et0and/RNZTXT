            <p>Musician Tiki Taane has surprised lunchtime crowds in Christchurch with a free concert on one of the city's trams.</p>
        
            <p>The tram set off from the Worcester Street depot and looped the CBD, while Taane performed an acoustic set and acted as tour guide, pointing out city sights.</p>
        
            <p>Taane wore a conductor's hat and passed around percussion instruments to people on the tram, who won a competition to ride along with him.</p>
        
            <p>Smiling office-workers, shoppers and tourists took photos on their phones as he passed by singing hit songs including Always On My Mind and covers of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Bob Marley's No Woman No Cry.</p>
        
            <p>He started with special ditty called Jammin' on a Tram.</p>
        
            <p>Taane told RNZ he had played at a huge number of venues but it was his first time performing on a tram.</p>
        
            <p>"I love being able to do really cool things like this, it's really unique. I'd love to see who else could be a part of it as well. All the musicians who want to get involved, it's very very cool," he said.</p>

            <p>Christchurch couple George and Emily found out they had won tickets to join the ride just after they had dressed their 12-week-old baby in a Tiki Taane onesie.</p>
        
            <p>George said he was a huge fan of Taane.</p>
        
            <p>"It was epic. I love Always On My Mind, it's a great song. It was such a cool experience, it was unique and had great vibes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Taane's "tram jam" was held in conjunction with Christchurch's Electric Avenue musical festival Saturday 24 February.</p>
