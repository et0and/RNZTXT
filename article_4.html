            <p>Emergency service agencies are building a joint strategy to stop fires being lit after a spate of blazes in Wairoa and Mohaka over the past three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>At least five fires have been reported over the past few weeks with fire crews still working to extinguish one started on Tuesday night near Ngamotu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Police say it is believed to have been deliberately lit with three others being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>A second fire began on McIvor Road on Wednesday morning and inquiries into its cause are ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Police and Fire and Emergency New Zealand were meeting on Thursday to develop a joint response to them.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ Hawke's Bay district manager Glen Varcoe said emergency responders were concerned about the fires and the impact they would have on the Wairoa community.</p>
        
            <p>"Having fires in the community can cause a lot of anxiety, especially as our investigators have determined most of these fires to be suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>"These fires have also taken up a lot of time and resources for our people."</p>
        
            <p>He said five different brigades and two helicopters had fought the fire on Tuesday night - with three of those crews later attending a blaze on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We want whoever is responsible to be caught.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone with information should contact the police."</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Mark Moorhouse said police were very concerned about the risk posed to life and property in what was already looking like a dry spell for the region.</p>
        
            <p>"Any person found deliberately lighting fires will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."</p>
