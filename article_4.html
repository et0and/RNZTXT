        <h2>Woman left with life-changing injuries after crash now educating others</h2>
        <p>
Bridie Young was only 18 when a crash left her unable to eat, walk or talk. "I had to learn everything all over again."
</p>
        
            <p>In July 2021, Bridie Young was in a car crash that left her with life-changing injuries.</p>
        
            <p>She was in a coma for seven weeks. She had fractured five of her vertebrae, broken her ribs, suffered a collapsed lung, and sustained five fractures in her pelvis. Worst of all, she had a traumatic brain injury.</p>
        
            <p>She was only 18 years old.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't eat, or walk, or talk, so it was like I was reborn," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to learn everything all over again."</p>
        
            <p>Young was a passenger in a car with two other people after celebrating her best friend's birthday.</p>
        
            <p>All of them, including the driver, had been drinking beforehand.</p>
        
            <p>The car hit a tree on California Drive in T≈çtara Park, Upper Hutt, just after midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Her dad, Gordon Young, said that many people did not think about the consequences of driving dangerously.</p>
        
            <p>"You all do silly things when you're young, and quite often you get away with it, but there's that one time you don't," he said.</p>
        
            <p>She said her life took a turn for the worse.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so irresponsible," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I often will feel down, and sad over, well, mourn the loss of what could've been my future."</p>
        
            <p>Young is now helping to educate other people about the consequences of driving dangerously.</p>
        
            <p>She tells her story to young people, including those going through the youth justice system.</p>
        
            <p>She currently gives presentations at the Wellington Central and Porirua Police Station every second month.</p>
        
            <p>She has also given a presentation at Evans Bay Intermediate School, and is booked to do more at other schools across the region.</p>
        
            <p>Brain Injury Association Wellington liaison officer Cheryl Hollis said it had a really big impact on the young people who listen to her.</p>
        
            <p>"When they arrive, they're really not engaged, they have their arms folded, but as soon as Bridie starts talking, these kids are, like, straight away, forward in their seats, really engaged with Bridie," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Young was able to pursue the dreams she had before the accident.</p>
        
            <p>"My dream job was to work with the police," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In a way, I'm doing exactly that."</p>
        
            <p>Youth Services Officer Sergeant Brendon Ronald said everyone was amazed by her.</p>
        
            <p>"She does amazing work, giving back and trying to pass on the message," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"She might not be a police officer, but she's doing a great job in preventing kids from further offending.</p>
        
            <p>"Kids who have come through the system multiple times for driving offences have realised the danger involved, and have said themselves that it's a bit of a wake-up call."</p>
        
            <p>Young said she had gone from feeling worthless, to having a purpose in life.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'm able to be that person to spread the word, or tell people how it is, I will gladly be that person," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I am that person that could potentially save someone's life."</p>
