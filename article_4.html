            <p>Wairarapa councils are set to receive $8 million from the government to help with flood protection, including money for relocating houses.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell says last year's severe weather has highlighted the need for greater flood resilience across the region.</p>
        
            <p>The money will be split between five separate projects, but the bulk of it will go to protecting homes in TÄ«nui, about 40km east of Masterton.</p>
        
            <p>The $4.8m will go towards helping homes identified by the Masterton District Council as being directly impacted by the severe weather.</p>
        
            <p>The improvements could include raising the home, reinforcing a bund wall or moving the dwelling to a more suitable area on the property.</p>
        
            <p>Of the fund, $1.25m will be for upgrading the early flood warning systems, including engineering assessments and stilling well improvements at critical flood warning sites.</p>
        
            <p>And $1.3m will be for protecting properties on Cockburn Street in Masterton from inflows of sewerage in heavy rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>A bund will be designed and built around about a hundred properties in the Flat Point settlement on the east coast of the Carterton District Council, $350,000 will be given to this work.</p>
        
            <p>Also, $411,000 will go towards stabilising the edge of the Motuwaireka Stream at Riversdale to avoid further erosion.</p>
