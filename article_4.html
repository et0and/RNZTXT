            <p>Experts are concerned changes to content moderation and an end to third-party fact checking on social media platform Meta will leave users open to abuse and disinformation.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive of the company which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, Mark Zuckerberg, announced a number of big changes on Tuesday which would significantly alter the way content is moderated, including getting rid of fact checkers and replacing them with user-generated "community notes," similar to Elon Musk's platform X.</p>
        
            <p>Zuckerberg himself acknowledged a "tradeoff" in the new policy, noting more harmful content would appear on the platform as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Community notes will allow users to add context and corrections, rather than allowing subject matter experts working as part of certified, regulated agencies to check and flag false information.</p>
        
            <p>Researcher for the now wound-up Disinformation Project, Dr Sanjana Hattotuwa, said it would be catastrophic for countries outside the US.</p>
        
            <p>"To take away fact checking will have - and I want to say this very, very clearly - catastrophic consequences in Meta's largest markets which are outside the US, in countries like India and the Philippines, where the platform has been historically associated with significant offline violence."</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, pulling back on content moderation would remove protection for vulnerable and often targeted groups such as Māori, the rainbow community and women.</p>
        
            <p>"You can now see things that were not allowed in the past, such as denigrating, dehumanising speech, calling women objects and objectifying them, all of that is now permissable."</p>
        
            <p>He said Meta was unlikely to receive pushback on the change from the incoming Trump administration, but it raised questions for users in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It is an open question as to whether public service broadcasters, brands which have brand trust associated with them, LGBTQIA+ communities and activists, but also elected officials in liberal democracies, whether any of them should be using these kinds of platforms which are now openly associated with [...] significant harms against particular individuals, communities, languages and communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Senior lecturer in philosophy at Waikato University, Dr Joseph Ulatowski, said abandoning all fact checking was a mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't possibly know everything about many different things," he said. "There's just too much information out there for us to know.</p>
        
            <p>"Given we can't know all of these different things [...] there have to be others out there who know a great deal about certain things to share with others."</p>
        
            <p>He said the move was deeply political, with proponents of fact checking tending to reflect the left side of the political spectrum.</p>
        
            <p>Proponents of community notes tended to lean right, more in favour of leaving individual users to make up their minds, rather than relying on advice from experts.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, that political divide was less intense, but there were still a number of contentious issues which could become inflamed by disinformation.</p>
        
            <p>He said the optimistic view was that relying on community notes would mean people who disagreed would engage with each other, and the facts would surface - but in reality, it would mean the removal of quick and easy access to reliable evidence and information.</p>
        
            <p>"That is a deep concern for the civilised world," he said. "Mis- and disinformation will continue to circulate [...] and it may even be the case that it becomes widely accepted. That's deeply problematic in a knowledge-based economy."</p>
