            <p>Main roads in and out of the capital will be cut off this week and next, due to a number of maintenance-related road closures.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington road users will need to start "planning ahead", and take back roads, NZTA has said.</p>
        
            <p>The highway's southbound lanes will be closed for two nights - Sunday, 2 February and Monday, 3 February, between 9pm and 4.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Transport Alliance manager Roxanne Hilliard said the middle lane of the highway must be resurfaced.</p>
        
            <p>Detours were available - light vehicles should take the Johnsonville southbound offramp and detour to the city via Johnsonville, Khandallah, and the Ngaio Gorge.</p>
        
            <p>Those travelling to the Hutt from SH1 would need to take the SH58 detour via Transmission Gully, but this was not suitable for heavy vehicles because of a height restriction on the Johnsonville underpass.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy vehicles must use SH58 to Haywards Hill and then State Highway 2 to get to the city.</p>
        
            <p>"These detours are longer, so drivers should allow for extra travel time," Hilliard said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's urban motorway will be closed to northbound traffic overnight between Karo Drive and Ngauranga Interchange for road resurfacing, for the five nights between Sunday 9 February and Thursday 13 February.</p>
        
            <p>All northbound on and off ramps will also be closed.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers should detour along, Willis St, Customhouse/Waterloo/Aotea Quay, and then Hutt Rd.</p>
        
            <p>In the city, the motorway will be closed to southbound traffic between the Terrace offramp and Vivian St as the Terrace tunnel undergoes its annual building warrant of fitness.</p>
        
            <p>The detour is via The Terrace offramp and Ghuznee/Victoria/Vivian Streets.</p>
        
            <p>Hilliard said "over 30,000 vehicles use this section of State Highway 1 daily, so it's crucial that it's regularly maintained".</p>
        
            <p>"Crews will resurface around five lane kilometres of the northbound lanes between Aotea Quay onramp and the Ngauranga Interchange," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since December, around 2.5 lane kilometres of this section of highway has already been resurfaced and we still need to resurface a further 2.5 lane kilometres this season.</p>
        
            <p>"These resurfacing works will make this stretch of road much smoother and safer as it is currently in poor condition."</p>
