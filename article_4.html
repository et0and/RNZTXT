            <p>The man who died outside a property in the Wellington suburb of Northland has been named as Simon Bird.</p>
        
            <p>He was found outside a property in Albemarle Road on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>His death remains unexplained and police are investigating.</p>
        
            <p>Bird was the vice-president of the Wairarapa Racing Club.</p>
        
            <p>The club's general manager, Matthew Sherry, said the club was in shock following the loss of their vice-president.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a club stalwart and and loved by many," Sherry said. "He will be sorely missed."</p>
        
            <p>Sherry said Bird lived and worked in Wellington but had lived in Wairarapa for many years.</p>
        
            <p>He said Bird was a person that "lit up the room".</p>
        
            <p>Family member Christina Bird announced the death on behalf of the family on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with heavy hearts and sadness that our family announce the sudden passing of Simon Bird. A fiercely loyal, kind, and funny person, he will be missed beyond what words can explain," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are still many questions surrounding his death, that we the family, still do not have answers to. We therefore request time and patience, as we come to terms with this loss, and please know that we will update when we can."</p>
        
            <p>Police said a scene guard would stay in place for a few days at the Wellington property where Bird was found.</p>
        
            <p>Condolences have flooded through on Bird's social media post.</p>
        
            <p>"We could not believe it," one said.</p>
        
            <p>"Words can't express the feelings. Tears take the place of words," said another</p>
        
            <p>"I truly loved Simon's loyalty, his kindness, creativity and his spontaneous sense of humour. He is such a great guy and always there if you needed him. I'm totally shocked hearing of his passing."</p>
        
            <p>Others spoke about working with Bird, both at the Tauherenikau Racecourse and in banking jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Bird was a staff member at The Co-operative Bank.</p>
        
            <p>"Simon Bird has been a valued and popular member of The Co-operative Bank's finance team since 2011. His knowledge, humour and genuine caring for others on the team were always evident. We will miss him tremendously. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time," said chief financial officer Bevan Miller.</p>
        
            <p>Another described him as loyal and empathetic.</p>
