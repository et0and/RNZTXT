            <p>The Central Otago District Council will start closing several public toilets overnight after vandals caused more than $37,000 worth of damage.</p>
        
            <p>There were 59 cases of vandalism in the past year.</p>
        
            <p>The Pioneer Park toilets in Alexandra were the most frequently targeted, with 17 cases of vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Tim Cadogan said it "beggars belief that people think it is OK to damage public facilities".</p>
        
            <p>"Regrettably, the actions of a very few are causing significant cost in repairs and impact on convenience in partial closure of facilities for everyone else".</p>
        
            <p>Only the damage from one incident, at the Lode Lane toilets in Cromwell, was able to be repaired through an insurance claim.</p>
        
            <p>Repair costs for the toilets had exceeded the council's repairs and maintenance budget by $10,621.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV cameras were installed at Pioneer Park in March and police had been able to identify the suspects from a subsequent break-in.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were "working with those concerned", the council said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Property and facilities manager Garreth Robinson said some toilets would be closed overnight to reduce the frequency of the vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>They were:</p>
        
            <p>They would be closed from 8pm in wintertime and 10pm during daylight saving time, reopening by 7.30am.</p>
