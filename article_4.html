            <p>More big-name artists could be heading to Auckland now that Eden Park has been given the go-ahead to host more concerts.</p>
        
            <p>The stadium has been given permission by Auckland Council to host up to 12 concerts annually, double what is currently allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Since it began hosting concerts in 2021, the stadium had been limited to six acts a year.</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park chief executive Nick Sautner said the stadium's resource consent application had significant public support.</p>
        
            <p>Of more than 2000 public submissions, 94 percent were supportive of allowing more concerts, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The change, beginning in January 2025, would bring more international acts to Auckland and increase economic benefits for the city, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the stadium hosted more than 160,000 people at three sold-out Coldplay concerts, with 60 percent of fans travelling from outside of the city.</p>
        
            <p>"The economic benefit from these three concerts alone is expected to reach tens of millions," Sautner said.</p>
        
            <p>Bars and restaurants would also benefit from the decision, Hospitality New Zealand chief executive Steve Armitage said.</p>
        
            <p>People travelling from across the country to see international artists at the stadium gave Auckland businesses a significant boost, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A North Shore pub he spoke to told him they saw business increase by 400 percent the week Coldplay was in town.</p>
        
            <p>Danny Upton, the restaurant operations manager at Full Time Sports Bar, was also pleased.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of places have really been struggling and more concerts will be great for all the hospitality businesses in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Concerts this year had dramatically increased foot traffic for the Kingslander, duty manager Whetoi Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>Shona Tagg, who is the spokesperson for the Eden Park Residents Association, said 91 percent of its members felt more concerts would be great for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to have Eden Park on our doorstep. People have moved here because of its closeness to Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"Our members tell us it brings vibrancy to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of them attend events at Eden Park and they want to see it used more."</p>
        
            <p>Concerts at the venue are now also able to finish at 11pm, instead of the earlier permitted time of 10:30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Shows still cannot happen on a Sunday that is not followed by a public holiday and noise limits remain in place.</p>
