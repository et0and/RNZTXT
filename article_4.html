            <p>Police officers used their own vehicles to take people shot at Christchurch's Linwood Islamic Centre to hospital because they knew ambulance resources were limited, an inquest has heard.</p>
        
            <p>One of the victims, Musa Patel, was shot running towards his wife during the terror attack at the mosque on 15 March 2019, following the massacre at nearby Al Noor Mosque.</p>
        
            <p>One of the first Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) members to arrive in Linwood Avenue after the shooting told the Coroners Court he knew ambulances would be tied up at Al Noor.</p>
        
            <p>He said that meant police had to start evacuating injured worshippers from Linwood themselves, although some people were too badly injured to move.</p>
        
            <p>"We used police vehicles â€¦ a dog handler took a child away himself, so we were using whatever resources we had to transport people as quickly as we could," he said.</p>

            <p>Family lawyer Kathryn Dalziel questioned why Musa Patel - one of the 51 shaheed - was not immediately taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The AOS member said he recalled Patel but did not know which police officer was looking after him at the time and was unsure why he could not be moved.</p>
        
            <p>"He was one of several people critically injured," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The AOS member said he would have been comfortable for ambulances to come to the scene from 2.09pm, when police were satisfied people were no longer in danger, if they had been available.</p>
        
            <p>Two specialist St John staff members arrived at the mosque with the AOS around 2.21pm.</p>
        
            <p>One ambulance also arrived later in the response.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking directly to deputy chief Coroner Brigitte Windley, the AOS member said his response on the day would not have changed had more ambulances been available.</p>
        
            <p>He said he still would have evacuated people using other means if he thought it was going to be quicker than waiting for ambulances to arrive to take them to hospital.</p>

            <p>Constable Coral-Ann Bowler was one of the first to arrive at Linwood Islamic Centre following reports of a shooting at the mosque.</p>
        
            <p>She became emotional describing the horror she encountered when she arrived in Linwood Avenue minutes after the attack that left seven people dead.</p>
        
            <p>"As I approached the driveway, I felt sick. I thought there was a very good chance I was going to be shot or seriously injured," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She told the Coroners Court she could hear people yelling for help and saw a group of men walking towards her.</p>
        
            <p>"They looked stunned and were pointing back up the driveway. They were yelling that they needed help, they were yelling they need an ambulance."</p>
        
            <p>As she walked up the driveway, Bowler said she saw two people lying on the ground who appeared to be dead.</p>
        
            <p>She said other officers and Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) members arrived soon after her, but many of them did not have guns and were not in uniform.</p>
        
            <p>Bowler told the court she was unhappy when officers asked for both of her weapons, hesitating at first because she did not know exactly who they were.</p>
        
            <p>"I was very unhappy about this as I was left with no way to defend myself or the public and at that point, we believed there were multiple active shooters," she said.</p>
        
            <p>While standing at a cordon, Bowler said she was approached by someone from the mosque who had taken a video that showed worshippers on the mosque floor and people who had been shot.</p>
        
            <p>She was later shown a video of the terrorist's livestream on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't believe it was real. It looked like a video game," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Bowler told the court none of her training had prepared her for the situation she faced that day.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think any training could equip you for what happened that day," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another policewoman also became upset describing the aftermath of the Linwood shooting.</p>
        
            <p>She said she felt uneasy when a white van approached a cordon, because police still believed there were multiple shooters in the Christchurch area.</p>
        
            <p>The officer said she began to lift her rifle into a ready position when a Caucasian man yelled out the driver's window: "I agree with what they have done, I support it".</p>
        
            <p>The policewoman told the court she was shocked by his comments that "enraged" people waiting near the cordon.</p>
        
            <p>She said she reported the remarks over the police radio and another officer ran after the van.</p>
        
            <p>The officer told the court she had been trained in hate crime but could not recall if it was before or after the terror attack.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest will examine the following 10 issues over six weeks:</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
