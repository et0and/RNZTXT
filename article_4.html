            <p>Police are investigating a string of cash fare boxes stolen from buses in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink said there had been four recent reports of robberies and thefts of fare boxes from bus drivers - all along the same route in the Hutt Valley.</p>
        
            <p>The thefts appeared to be linked, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink senior manager Matthew Chote said the bus drivers involved were unharmed.</p>
        
            <p>"Fare box crime on the Metlink bus network is incredibly rare," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the introduction of electronic ticketing to our bus network in 2008, less than 5 percent of Metlink bus fares are currently paid in cash."</p>
        
            <p>Kinetic New Zealand commercial director Nigel Piper said driver safety was at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"What I've said to council, is I think one of the biggest things they can do to improve driver safety is to remove cash off the buses.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the way the economy is at the moment, people are desperate."</p>
        
            <p>Chote said Greater Wellington Regional Councillors may consider extending the networks cashless services in the near future.</p>
