            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau wants to show the government they should have nothing to worry after the council voted on its amended long term plan.</p>
        
            <p>A marathon six hour meeting on Tuesday saw fiery debate and discussion between councillors trying to save their key projects from the chopping block.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting was triggered after councillors voted last month to not sell the council's 34 percent stake in Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>The sale was part of the council's long term plan which had been passed in June, meaning it needed to be amended.</p>
        
            <p>The changes saw Local Government Minister Simeon Brown install local government practitioner Lindsay McKenzie on the council as an observer.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors ended up passing over 20 amendments to the paper that their staff initially put forward, which identified $558 million worth of savings via rescoping and axing projects.</p>
        
            <p>One of the projects up for being rescoped was the $113m Golden Mile upgrade - a former Let's Get Wellington Moving project that is part funded by NZTA.</p>
        
            <p>It will see private cars banned between Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place and offer walking and cycling improvements.</p>
        
            <p>Council officers suggested the project could be halved with the council just going forward with the Courtenay Place upgrades - but Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau convinced councillors to vote in favour of the full project.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors have given the Begonia House in the botanic gardens a lifeline through an amendment that states the future of the building will be assessed after a review of it next year.</p>
        
            <p>Projects that were rescoped or axed included bus priority funding, the cycleways programme which will be cut back by $40.7 million and upgrades for facilities at Otari Wiltons Bush.</p>
        
            <p>Just prior to voting today Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau made mention of the government and its Crown observer.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's show the government that we've done this successfully and that our wonderful observer Lindsay over there has nothing to worry about, we've got this."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Tony Randle tried to get an amendment overline that would have seen the Golden Mile project capped to $40 million - but that proposal failed to get over the line.</p>
        
            <p>Randle said the council still could not make a hard decision.</p>
        
            <p>"We keep spending money on things like the Golden Mile Project."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Rebecca Matthews fired back at Randle after his claim the council could not make hard decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"When the deputy mayor was in tears because she voted against an amendment to restore our cycleway funding which she stood for council to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"Voting against the things you hold dear is the hardest thing."</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's amendments will now go to a vote on 17 December, after which the amended long term plan will be prepared for public consultation early next year.</p>
