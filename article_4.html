        <h2>Crackdown on scammers leads to cutback in victim numbers</h2>
        <p>
A multi-agency operation has uncovered a large network of scammers from the UK and Australia operating in New Zealand.

            <p>The Department of Internal Affairs says a recent crackdown on scammers has decreased the number of reported victims by more than 80 percent.</p>
        
            <p>DIA spokesperson Joe Teo said Operation Cargo uncovered a large network of phone scammers and seized more than $100,000 in equipment, cash and other luxury items in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"This time last year we noticed a significant amount of scam messaging going around [claiming to be] banking messages, overdue payments, [and] toll payments," Teo said.</p>
        
            <p>The department had worked with police, Customs, CERT and telecommunications providers to track down the scammers.</p>
        
            <p>"We worked really closely with the telecommunications sector to identify common numbers associated with these scam messages and where these people were located," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We uncovered a trans-national organised crime syndicate operating in New Zealand coming from the UK and Australia working at a level of sophistication that we've never really seen before."</p>
        
            <p>The gang was using specialised software to send tens of thousands of scam messages every week.</p>
        
            <p>"We're talking about people's life savings being pulled away from them through these scam messages or social engineering," Teo said.</p>
        
            <p>"Anywhere from as little as $5000, which would be a lot of money for low income families, through to hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
        
            <p>Since the operation began in May through to the end of December, Teo said authorities executed 12 search warrants and seized $35,000 in SIM cards and hardware, $10,000 in luxury items like handbags, and $56,000 in cash.</p>
        
            <p>Those seizures were a fraction of the estimated $3.6 million New Zealanders lost to cyber crime in the final quarter of 2023 but the crackdown did lead to a reduction in the number of scams reported to authorities, Teo said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen a [more than] 80 percent reduction, and it keeps going down," Teo said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the height of it [we received] 53,000 reports a month, and we saw that number starting to decrease quite dramatically to about 4000 a month [today].</p>
        
            <p>"Those numbers are just a sample... the tip of the iceberg, to be honest. In terms of the true scale of what these people are operating at, we're not 100 percent sure."</p>
        
            <p>However, Teo expected new scams to keep popping up and said Operation Cargo would continue.</p>
        
            <p>"What we'd like to think is - working in collaboration with our partnering agencies and industry bodies, with new technology coming on board, new mechanisms - that we'll be able to identify new people sending scam messages out and get onto them a lot quicker," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will continue on, we're in the phase where we are now monitoring the situation and keeping a watchful eye on other people who have popped up."</p>
