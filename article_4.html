            <p>A lawyer who spun a "spider's web" of a property deal has tried to win his way back into the legal fraternity by implying that Prime Minister Christopher Luxon supported his comeback.</p>
        
            <p>Former lawyer John Dorbu was struck off in 2011 after he called a High Court judge a racist, attacked the credibility of a former member of the Law Society and misled an Australian court about the trouble he was facing in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was the orchestration of a complex property conspiracy involving a $1 million building in Auckland's CBD that made up the bulk of the charges against him.</p>
        
            <p>After his client signed a deal to sell the building on Anzac Ave, an offer was received from an overseas buyer that was $122,000 higher.</p>
        
            <p>The seller tried to cancel the contract and offered the first buyer $30,000 to walk away, but the first buyer refused and placed a caveat on the property to protect their interest.</p>
        
            <p>Dorbu then tried to void the sale by transferring the seller's shares and their mortgage in an attempt to undermine the caveat so his client could accept the higher offer.</p>
        
            <p>A court would later label Dorbu's scheme a "spider's web". The original buyer spent nearly $300,000 on legal bills to try to keep the building he thought he had bought.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in May, Dorbu decided his nearly 15-year exile should end and applied to the Law Society for the return of his practising certificate.</p>
        
            <p>"I am a new person now," he told the Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal, which struck him off in 2011.</p>
        
            <p>Dorbu now calls himself James McConnor after legally changing his name in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>As part of his application for a practising certificate, he referred to an alleged conversation with Luxon and submitted an affidavit saying that "our discussions on faith and aspirations were profoundly inspiring".</p>
        
            <p>However, in its ruling released last week, the tribunal said: "There is no indication that the Prime Minister knows of, or supports, his application. We are unimpressed by a suggestion of support when there is none".</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister's Office confirmed to NZME that Luxon had no knowledge of McConnor's application.</p>
        
            <p>McConnor conceded during his hearing that various other lawyers he name-dropped as potential mentors would probably have been surprised to hear he'd used their names in his support. His application was not supported formally by any other lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr McConnor asks us to give him the chance to prove himself. But we cannot experiment," the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of fronting up to those things where he had been criticised in the past, Mr McConnor avoided and obfuscated them.</p>
        
            <p>"We formed the view that he would prefer to close his mind to this uncomfortable material, and for the rest of the world to do likewise."</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal said McConnor failed to face up to his past wrongdoings and "fudged" his answers to them by saying "the past wasn't me".</p>
        
            <p>In particular, they were concerned he was currently attempting to sue Auckland Transport and Baycorp for defamation after he was fined $150 for driving in a bus lane.</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever the rights and wrongs of the litigation, it has the appearance of hubris and disproportionality about it, both traits that concern us."</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, the tribunal found this was "not a borderline case" and said it would be unsafe for the public and the reputation of the profession for McConnor to be re-enrolled.</p>
