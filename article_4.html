        <h2>Sophia Crestani inquest: Locking doors, covering floors normal for parties, witness says</h2>
        <p>
A partygoer says her flat also took measures to protect their property when hosting parties, like tenants of The Manor did ahead of Sophia Crestani's death.

            <p>A partygoer has told an inquest into a fatal house party that it was normal for students to block off rooms or put plastic wrap down to protect their belongings.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago student Sophia Crestani, 19, died during a stairwell pile-up at an overcrowded flat party at The Manor in October 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest into her death is underway in Dunedin and is set to run for the rest of the week.</p>
        
            <p>Tenants earlier confirmed they blocked off other exits at The Manor, sealed up doors, and put plastic on the floors ahead of the fatal party.</p>

            <p>A partygoer, who has name suppression, said her flat took similar measures of locking doors and protecting the floors when hosting parties.</p>
        
            <p>In her first statement, she said the party "wasn't heaving with people" when she arrived shortly before 10pm, but "you had to push your way through".</p>
        
            <p>She recalled dancing with her friends including Crestani and going behind the barriers to the DJ decks.</p>
        
            <p>The party changed once she and a friend got part-way down the stairs.</p>
        
            <p>People started swaying, falling and being pulled back up, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There were screams and I could just see a pile of people."</p>
        
            <p>It looked like 10-15 people, she said in her first statement.</p>
        
            <p>Her second statement described a crush of people like sardines, but not a pile or anyone on the floor.</p>
        
            <p>She told the inquest that her second statement, given in March 2020, might have been impacted by the discussions about the tragedy, the trauma and the time lapsed.</p>
        
            <p>In both statements, she recalled seeing one of The Manor tenants near his room, calling to him and him pulling her into his room, where she tried to call the friend she was separated from.</p>
        
            <p>In the tenant's statement, he said he did not leave his room or remember her in his room.</p>
        
            <p>She said she saw the police out of the window in the tenant's room and left the house.</p>
        
            <p>She started screaming and crying when she saw someone being resuscitated outside but she did not know it was Crestani, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She was cross examined about noise complaints saying she remembered other students having their speakers seized following noise complaints.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
