        <h2>Will a Kiwi win this year's Melbourne Cup fashion stakes?</h2>
        <p>
Claudia Campbell thought she'd be looking after the dogs while her glam mum and sister went to the Melbourne. Then she discovered she was a contender.

            <p>In 2023, Waikato florist Claudia Campbell felt like Cinderella, working while she watched her little sister Eleanor win top fashion honours at the Melbourne Cup. This year, she's one of two New Zealanders picked to line up for the prestigious race day event.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell and Gisborne financial analyst Laura Williams are the only pre-selected international finalists for the Best Dressed and Best Suited categories. They'll be hosted by the Victoria Racing Club for a week of Fashion on the Field events and will line up against competitors chosen on the day for the grand final of the fashion contest, which takes place on Oaks Day on 7 November.</p>

            <p>Campbell said it was "such a big surprise" to learn she was a Best Dressed finalist, particularly because she thought she would be staying home and helping with the family's doggy daycare business while her mother and sister went to Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>She said she largely owed her place as a digital finalist to her mother Anna, who found her olive and gold dress in an online sample sale.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to be honest, I'm just the model. I just wear whatever I'm told."</p>
        
            <p>Anna Campbell said she knew the dress's earthy colours and geometric pattern would suit Claudia, who is "very artsy". Pirongia milliner Monika Neuhauser crafted the on-trend toque-style hat using some vintage veiling from her own stash. The rest of the accessories - Steve Madden shoes, a Forever New clutch and Anna's own vintage Givenchy earrings - came from the family's collection.</p>
        
            <p>While Campbell has tasted fashion success before - in 2013 she won the Ned Prix de Fashion at Ellerslie Racecourse, which earned her a spot in the semi-finals at Flemington - she said dressing up for Melbourne Cup week would be a bit of a change to her usual look.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now I'm wearing Doc Martens, baggy jeans and an apron. It'll be great to have a week of nice nails and not have to worry about them being ruined by doing flowers."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Gisborne financial analyst and farmer Laura Williams is hoping that a foot injury will not hurt her chances in Melbourne. Williams, who said she's "a bit addicted" to fashion in the field events, sheared off the back of her heel after accidentally standing on a piece of metal last week.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm such a klutz, this is so like me. I just have to hope that it heals in time."</p>
        
            <p>Her outfit - a custom-made three-piece trouser suit topped with "a big standout" circular hat by milliner Claire Hahn - has earned her a place in the 'Best Suited' section. Williams thrifted and hand-painted shoes to match the suit, then dug around in her wardrobe for the rest of her accessories, which include a pocket watch and some horse head buttons from her husband's riding jacket.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said she wanted her look to embody the 'Brat summer' trend popularised by English singer-songwriter Charlie XCX.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not quite Brat green, but that was a real inspiration for me."</p>
        
            <p>Hers is not the only suit she has organised for the week, either. Williams has put a lot of effort into choosing outfits for her farmer husband, Jack.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't often get to dress him up but he's been such a yes man. We're both really excited, this is a 'once-in-a-lifetime' thing."</p>
