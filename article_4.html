            <p>A major audiology chain of clinics kept an Auckland man's personal details for over six years, then lost them to criminal hackers.</p>
        
            <p>The man - Russell - says he is "flabbergasted", and worried he will be a target of scams and identity theft.</p>
        
            <p>On top of that, Bloom Hearing Specialists told Russell there was too much data stolen to be able to tell him just what of his had been nicked.</p>
        
            <p>Russell is one of thousands of customers that Bloom has warned of the ransomware attack.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter, it said it might have lost insurance, banking, health, social welfare and the Ministry of Social Development client details - and it understood this was bound for the dark web.</p>
        
            <p>The large company was attacked in July, ascertained in late August masses of data was stolen, and has since alerted thousands of patients.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand your name and address was included in the data which has been stolen by the threat actor," Bloom wrote to Russell.</p>
        
            <p>"It is likely that your date of birth and contact details and/or gender was also included."</p>
        
            <p>But "due to the volume and complexity of the datasets stolen, it is not practicable for us to confirm if, or the extent to which, any additional types of data/personal information stolen by the threat actor relate to you".</p>
        
            <p>Russell told RNZ he only tried out a Bloom hearing aid for a week after his hearing loss due to industrial exposure was identified, and ACC accepted the claim.</p>
        
            <p>He went with another company's aid in the end and gave Bloom's back.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never really been a customer," he said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Since I haven't been with them for six-and-a-half years, they should have deleted my data."</p>
        
            <p>He now felt vulnerable to scammers himself, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't recall how much information they got from me," Russell said of Bloom.</p>
        
            <p>"They may have requested my bank account number as security, or credit card details as security ... and also whether they had all my ACC details."</p>
        
            <p>Hacks and cyber attacks were par for the course, but this was different.</p>
        
            <p>"People can have data breaches ... it's nasty out there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These things can happen. But Bloom should have never had my data for such a long period of time."</p>
        
            <p>He expected there would be large numbers of people like him, since so much data from past patients' had been kept.</p>
        
            <p>It was a breach of privacy law as he understood it.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe that Bloom can only keep my data for as long as it's necessary for their business."</p>
        
            <p>Principle 9 of the Privacy Act states an organisation should not keep personal information for longer than it is required for the purpose it may lawfully be used.</p>
        
            <p>Russell said he would consider complaining to the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
