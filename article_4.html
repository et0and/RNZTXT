        <h2>Council's 'gold-plated option' for beach accessway to cost $2.3m</h2>
        <p>
One councillor is calling the plan at New Plymouth's most popular swimming beach too expensive and a burden on ratepayers.

            <p>A proposed $2.3 million accessible path to New Plymouth's most popular swimming beach is the "gold-plated" option, too expensive and a burden on ratepayers, according to a district councillor.</p>
        
            <p>The money has been set aside in the draft, long-term plan to provide access between Beach Street and Fitzroy Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>The new accessway would have two entrances at Beach Street and walkers, cyclists and wheelchair users would be able to get to the reserve below and beach beyond via a series of steps or ramps.</p>
        
            <p>The project would replace a set of wooden steps coming to the end of their life and a steep concrete path that is no longer being maintained.</p>
        
            <p>District councillor Max Brough - who co-owns a business at Fitzroy Beach which would potentially benefit from improved access - said the project's goals could be achieved at fraction of the cost.</p>
        
            <p>"Well that's a nonsense number, an absolute nonsense number. If you look at the drawings, we've gone for the gold-plated option," Brough said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you want to do things for the community and there's not enough money to go around you have to be a little bit practical about how you spend it. These are all things that need doing, but do we need to spend $2.3 million on a cycleway at Fitzroy Beach?"</p>
        
            <p>For $300,000, council could put in a perfectly good asphalt or concrete path down the side of the hill, Brough said.</p>
        
            <p>During the summer peak season, the 81 marked car parks and 25 vehicles spaces on grassed areas quickly fills up, meaning many visitors had to park on Beach Street.</p>
        
            <p>People parked on the road who use a mobility scooter, wheelchair or have children in pushchairs currently get to the beach via narrow road shared with vehicles as do cyclists arriving via Beach Street.</p>

            <p>Council chief executive Gareth Green said the aim was for the new path to be wheelchair and bike accessible.</p>
        
            <p>"And by doing that it means that we are able to secure some funding from the New Zealand Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi. So, 51 percent of the cost of those steps will be funded by NZTA.</p>
        
            <p>"The actual design has been scoped on that basis and the cost has come out from that scoping work, but the actual design will be re-looked at before the project commences.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't necessarily call it gold-plated. I would say it's a plan that has been designed to achieve the scope that's been agreed upon which allows for bicycle and wheelchair use."</p>
        
            <p>Green said he had faith the NZTA funding would still be available under the new government.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm as confident as I can be. Again, things are changing at the moment as you are aware, but yeah, as confident as we can be at this point."</p>

            <p>Max Brough did not share the chief executive's confidence NZTA would part fund the project.</p>
        
            <p>"They attract that level of funding from the government if it passes the criteria. Given that the transport minister has put a pause on cycleways as we know them, I have some serious reservations that this project would actually fit the bill or not.</p>
        
            <p>"Right now, the messages coming out of Wellington is that money and cycleways are not two things that join up."</p>
        
            <p>One resident, Mike, who was out walking his dog at Fitzroy Beach, was not impressed with the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounds a tad over the top. A waste of money. Upgrade the steps for sure, but there's another accessway up the road for either mobility scooters or whoever else. If it was coming out of my pocket, I wouldn't do it."</p>
        
            <p>Council will meet to adopt a draft long term plan consultation document to go out for public consultation in February.</p>
        
            <p>In March, public feedback will be sought before the 10-year plan is adopted by council in June.</p>
