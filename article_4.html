            <p>Warning: This story discusses details of sexual abuse.</p>
        
            <p>A girl has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression after she was sexually assaulted by an Auckland man who played a Rohan prince in The Lord of the Rings.</p>
        
            <p>Paris Howe Strewe, 48, of Titirangi, was this week sentenced to 43 months imprisonment after he was found guilty of sexual violation and three representative charges of indecently assaulting a child aged under 12.</p>
        
            <p>Howe Strewe appeared in the trilogy's second film, The Two Towers, in which he played Théodred, prince of Rohan.</p>
        
            <p>The girl, who was 10 at the time, wrote in her victim impact statement she has panic attacks and will "scream and cry" most nights because of the abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been called a liar, a b**** and I've been told everything that happened to me wasn't true," she said in the statement, which was read in court by her father.</p>
        
            <p>A summary of facts obtained by the Herald said on 1 May, 2021, the girl was attending a friend's birthday party in Laingholm and was playing with other children at the rear of the property near a fire pit.</p>
        
            <p>Howe Strewe sat next to her and indecently assaulted her multiple times, the summary says. The victim told Howe Strewe to stop and moved away from him.</p>
        
            <p>The next day she visited Howe Strewe's Titirangi home for a play-date with his stepchildren.</p>
        
            <p>She was sitting on a couch playing video games with another child when Howe Strewe entered the lounge and sat on the couch between the two children, obstructing the other child's view.</p>
        
            <p>He sexually violated the victim, telling her, "don't tell anyone", the summary says.</p>
        
            <p>She told her family what had occurred when she arrived home the next day and police were alerted.</p>
        
            <p>The girl has described the harrowing reality of surviving the sexual abuse and the fears she has about seeing Howe Strewe again.</p>
        
            <p>Her father told the court on one occasion she saw him parked outside her school.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to go to a different school just so I can feel safe."</p>
        
            <p>In his victim impact statement, her father said she was made to grow up faster than any 10-year-old should.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever she closes her eyes she sees this man and what he did to her."</p>
        
            <p>He said his daughter lives in a "constant state" of anxiety and blames herself for the stress the situation has caused their family.</p>
        
            <p>Wishing he could have been there to stop it brings him to tears, the father said.</p>
        
            <p>Whenever he wants to give his daughter a hug, he has to question himself about whether it will trigger her PTSD.</p>
        
            <p>He also read the girl's mother's statement, which outlined how she lies awake at night worrying about how the "horrific and selfish" abuse has impacted her child.</p>

            <p>The Herald has confirmed that Howe Strewe was initially charged with sexual offending against two children in January 2022. A charge relating to one alleged victim was subsequently withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>He pleaded not guilty. His first trial was abandoned in June 2023 when the jury could not reach a verdict. A retrial was undertaken on the remaining four charges.</p>
        
            <p>Howe Strewe, who is now a carpenter and had not appeared in court previously, declined to comment when spoken to by police.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with three representative counts of indecently assaulting a child aged under 12, and one of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth charge of sexual conduct involving another alleged victim aged under 16 was withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>Howe Strewe defended the four remaining charges but was found guilty on all counts.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded on bail for sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>In court on Tuesday Howe Strewe's lawyer John Munro sought a 15 percent sentence discount for his previous good character.</p>
        
            <p>Munro said his client had no prior convictions and had submitted 15 letters of support from people including his partner, family and stepchildren.</p>
        
            <p>During his submissions, Howe Strewe, who was wearing a blue T-shirt, held his head in his hands and at times massaged his temples.</p>
        
            <p>He later sat with his head resting against the wall and his eyes closed.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Simon Lance said the three representative counts of indecent assault carry a maximum of 10 years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Sexual violation holds a maximum of 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Lance set a starting point of four years and three months in prison, but granted Howe Strewe a 15 percent discount for his previous good character.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously you don't get credit for a guilty plea."</p>
        
            <p>He said a report writer noted Howe Strewe had "no remorse" and "no empathy, and had described what occurred as a "crock of s***".</p>
        
            <p>His risk to others was assessed as medium to high.</p>
        
            <p>With the 15 percent discount added, Judge Lance landed on a sentence of 43 months' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>Howe Strewe was also added to the child sex offender register.</p>
        
            <p>His 2002 role as Théodred is his only known appearance in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.</p>
        
            <p>Film website IMDB says he also worked as a lighting and camera assistant on the Niki Caro-directed feature film Memory & Desire.</p>
