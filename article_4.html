            <p>Pay rates for elected council members hinder local government's ability to attract and retain qualified councillors, a district mayor says.</p>
        
            <p>The Remuneration Authority this week set an average pay rise of 3.7 percent for mayors and councillors from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>Rangit카kei mayor Andy Watson said Rangit카kei District councillors who did not have chairing responsibilities were paid under $30,000 a year.</p>
        
            <p>"At that level, the sorts of people you could well attract are retired or it's a top-up to their financial position.</p>
        
            <p>"People join council not for the money and we should value that.</p>
        
            <p>"But when council is a substantial business with turnover of multi-millions of dollars and very long-term views required, then you need the very best you can possibly get."</p>
        
            <p>He said people with the skills required were often practitioners in their own professions and councillor pay rates could not compensate for the loss of time in their own businesses.</p>
        
            <p>The new pay rates for mayors, councillors and community board members were released on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Watson said they did not adequately reflect councillor responsibilities and workload.</p>
        
            <p>"The mayor's salary is more than adequate but I do worry about the salaries for elected members."</p>
        
            <p>
A councillor with no chairing responsibilities will be paid $29,690, up from $28,631, in new pay rates set by the Remuneration Authority.

</p>
        
            <p>Watson's salary has been set at $125,219, up from $120,751.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Dave Wilson will receive $40,802, up from $39,346. A councillor with no special responsibilities will get $29,690, up from $28,631. Chairs and deputy chairs of committees will be paid up to $38,576, up from $37,200.</p>
        
            <p>Taihape Community Board chair Peter Kipling-Arthur will receive $9630, up from $9287, and members $4815, up from $4643.</p>
        
            <p>R훮tana Community Board chair Charlie Mete will be paid $4720, up from $4552, and members $2360, up from $2276.</p>
        
            <p>Watson said council meetings often took half a day. For northern councillors in particular, travel time effectively meant taking a full day out of their own businesses.</p>
        
            <p>For some councillors, council work occupied most of their time.</p>
        
            <p>"Attending meetings is just a fraction of the responsibilities.</p>
        
            <p>"The workload has increased dramatically because central government has pushed new roles and responsibilities onto local government, whether it be roading, climate change or responding to submissions."</p>
        
            <p>Despite this, the amount of money councils had to carry out these tasks had remained relatively static.</p>
        
            <p>"The pressures are very high, especially in these financially challenging times."</p>
        
            <p>Watson, who has notched up 20 years in Rangit카kei as an elected member, 11 of them as mayor, said there were always submissions during the Long-Term Plan process claiming councillors were overpaid.</p>
        
            <p>He said 0.9 percent of his council's budget is allocated to mayoral and councillor salaries.</p>
        
            <p>"What organisation would pay under one percent of the total business they're running?"</p>
        
            <p>He said there were other anomalies, such as elected members not being eligible for KiwiSaver employer contributions.</p>
        
            <p>"That in itself is poor and a poor message."</p>
        
            <p>Critique and abuse, particularly on social media platforms, had increased significantly.</p>
        
            <p>"To an extent, you're answerable to social media. People don't understand what is required of modern-day councillors, or the scale of the job and how much it has increased over time.</p>
        
            <p>"I absolutely applaud the people who take on a role in local government. Monetary return is not why they do it, but it should be part of the discussion."</p>
        
            <p>However, communities first needed to value the commitment made by local government representatives.</p>
        
            <p>"The abuse they receive is unwarranted. It's getting much, much worse. The last election we saw quite a turnover of councillors and mayors, and when you talk to those who left, a lot of it is about exactly that."</p>
        
            <p>Remuneration Authority chair Geoff Summers told Local Democracy Reporting the new rates were decided using a system that ranks councils by size, according to population, total assets, total expenditure, socioeconomic deprivation indices and a complex weighting process. They were also aligned with the public sector.</p>
        
            <p>A councillor's salary can range from $14,274 in the Chatham Islands to more than $100,000 in Christchurch and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>For a mayor, the salary can range from about $59,000 to more than $300,000 in Auckland.</p>
