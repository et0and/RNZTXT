            <p>Octogenarian Welsh singer Tom Jones is heading to the green, green grass of Napier's McLean Park for a rare New Zealand concert next year.</p>
        
            <p>Jones, 83, will headline the Harvest Moon concert on 6 April 2024. He is the first international act to perform at the renowned sports ground. Gin Wigmore and The Magnificent Seven, a group of Kiwi musicians that includes Jordan Luck, Peter Urlich and Eddie Rayner, will also play at the day-long festival.</p>
        
            <p>Napier mayor Kirsten Wise said she was "personally very excited and thrilled for our city" that Jones would be playing at McLean Park.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a concert the whole community will get behind."</p>
        
            <p>In a career spanning 60 years, Jones has sold more than 100 million records and performed around the world. He's also dabbled in acting and been a coach on reality talent show The Voice UK.</p>
        
            <p>While this will be his first concert in Aotearoa since 2016, Jones has continued to make music in his later years. He may be best known for his early work, such as 'Delilah', 'What's New Pussycat', 'It's Not Unusual' and The Green, Green Grass of Home', his 2021 album, Surrounded By Time was positively reviewed by critics who praised his "chameleonic" ability to move between genres.</p>
        
            <p>Presale tickets are available from 21 November, with public tickets available the next day.</p>
