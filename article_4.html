"These decisions will place the most significant restrictions on New Zealanders movements in modern history," then-PM Jacinda Ardern said in announcing our first Covid lockdown.

            <p>On 23 March 2020, then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced New Zealand's first nationwide lockdown as part of a four-tier alert level system.</p>
        
            <p>"Our plan is simple; we can stop the spread by staying at home and reducing contact," Ardern said at the time. "Now is the time to act.</p>
        
            <p>"Cabinet met today and agreed that effective immediately, we will move to Alert Level 3, nationwide. After 48 hours - the time required to ensure essential services are in place - we will move to level 4."</p>
        
            <p>"These decisions will place the most significant restrictions on New Zealanders movements in modern history. Non essential businesses in New Zealand, must now close. All bars, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries, playgrounds - any other place where the public congregate, must close their face to face function.</p>
        
            <p>"In short, we are all now preparing as a nation to go into self isolation."</p>
        
            <p>The entire country would remain at Alert Level 4 until 27 April 2020, with Auckland and Northland remaining in lockdown longer than other parts of New Zealand.</p>
