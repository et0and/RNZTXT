        <h2>Demolition of Blenheim's former art gallery, Clubs building begins</h2>
        <p>
The former Millenium Art Gallery is an earthquake risk and no longer safe, while the council has been unable to lease the former Clubs building.

            <p>The demolition of Blenheim's former art gallery and the Marlborough Clubs building is set to begin this week.</p>
        
            <p>Both buildings are owned by the council - the Millennium Art Gallery building on the corner of Seymour and Alfred Streets, and the Marlborough Clubs building at 6 Russell Terrace.</p>
        
            <p>The former art gallery, which was also home to Blenheim's public library at one stage, was constructed in 1958 and after several conversions became home to the gallery in 1999.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor David Croad said the building posed an earthquake risk and it was no longer safe. With the new library and art gallery now complete, the time was right to remove the old building.</p>
        
            <p>Council purchased old Marlborough Clubs building in 2017 for $1.33 million, as the land had strategic development opportunities. Despite working with several commercial organisations and potential developers who had expressed interest in the site since its purchase, none had been able to realise their aspirations, Croad said.</p>

            <p>The council voted in September to demolish the former Clubs building after being unable to lease it.</p>
        
            <p>"The site continues to have great potential as a hotel or residential development, amongst other possible uses, which would create wider economic benefits for Blenheim and Marlborough," Croad said. "Clearing the site will better allow its potential to be realised."</p>
        
            <p>Demolition will take place in two phases for both buildings, beginning with asbestos removal.</p>
        
            <p>Scaffolding was in place so the roof of the Millennium Gallery could be removed, starting Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Both demolitions will be funded from council's Forestry and Land Development Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>It was due to be completed by mid-December. The future of both sites, is wasyet was to be determined.</p>
