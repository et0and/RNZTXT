        <h2>Long Covid warning: 'Silent organ damage is a real problem'</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Public health experts are urging the government to protect people from Long Covid, which they say could have already affected a quarter of a million New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>A new Public Health Communication Centre briefing out on Thursday says the government must develop and implement a Long Covid strategy.</p>
        
            <p>Massey University public health research Professor John Potter said the risk of Long Covid after an Omicron infection remained about 10 percent, and sufferers could be mildly impaired to severely disabled.</p>
        
            <p>The briefing also says Long Covid can also lead to a 'substantially increased' risk of sudden death and 'silent' damage to cells and organs which can lead to later illness.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly the silent organ damage is a real problem, we think, for future development of disease. When you're young and healthy, you can take a certain amount of damage to the system without it showing up.</p>
        
            <p>"But as people age, their capacity to buffer against that particular set of damage might decline and we might see increased risk of other symptoms, particularly heart, lung, brain, emerging in people's fifties and sixties."</p>

            <p>He said some estimates suggested that as many as 400 million people worldwide - about five percent of the global population - have Long Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"Essentially every organ in our bodies can be involved in clinical Long Covid, and it can impact people of all ages, sex, and ethnicities. It reduces quality of life and can cause loss of ability to work and, in some cases, severe disability. This is a large burden of illness for our communities, healthcare system and the economy."</p>
        
            <p>Co-author Assoc Prof Amanda Kvalsvig from the University of Otago said New Zealand children were highly exposed to Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that infection and reinfection, even when mild, is linked to cell and organ damage that may harm their future health. More needs to be done to protect our children, and the first step is ensuring that our schools are safe."</p>
        
            <p>The NZ government's response to Long Covid had been "inadequate", said co-author University of Otago's Prof Michael Baker.</p>
        
            <p>"We have all the tools we need to protect people against Long Covid, including using proven public health measures to reduce exposure to the virus when indoors, and regular vaccination to reduce progression to Long Covid.</p>
        
            <p>"The critical need is government leadership, with a coordinated, evidence-informed strategy that is resourced and implemented. This response would have many benefits including preventing other respiratory infections, improving our pandemic preparedness, protecting health, and maintaining productivity."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, Health Minister Simeon Brown said Covid-19 and Long Covid were now being managed as part of a 'business as usual' healthcare response, with the primary care sector largely taking the lead in patient care.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, patients with Long Covid are cared for in the same way as people with other chronic conditions. This is largely through primary care, but they can be referred to specialist care when required.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the Ministry of Health continued to undertake evidence briefs, the most recent being around the way symptoms present in patients.</p>
        
            <p>"This is to help clinicians in dealing with the complex issue of diagnosis as there is no definitive test to diagnose Long Covid. Officials have advised they will keep me updated with the latest evidence on Long Covid and other conditions."</p>
