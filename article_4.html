            <p>More than 500 jobs are gone at Kāinga Ora, with the housing agency confirming its latest round of cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora on Thursday confirmed plans to axe a further 310 roles, 46 of which were vacant. That was slightly less than the 321 it proposed in September.</p>
        
            <p>It takes the total number of roles disestablished this year to 540.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora chief executive Matt Crockett said the job losses announced today were a result of merging its urban planning, housing delivery and construction teams into one, called the housing delivery group.</p>
        
            <p>"This new group supports our reduced social housing delivery volumes and the use of our new Housing Delivery System - a delivery operating model proven to increase our reliability, speed and capability when building homes," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The new structure would be implemented by the beginning of February.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work with our housing delivery partners throughout to ensure all contracted work progresses as usual."</p>
        
            <p>But the Public Service Association said social housing faced an uncertain future.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora has been a success story, housing thousands of families in new builds - now we have no plan B," national secretary Duane Leo said.</p>
        
            <p>"The need is not going away, and we have no detail on how the gap is going to be filled by community housing providers."</p>
        
            <p>People losing their jobs were critical to the planning, design and construction of social houses - like architects, technical advisors, project coordinators, urban designers, spatial planners, and quality assurance experts, he said.</p>
