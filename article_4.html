            <p>Three teenagers have been arrested in Auckland over the stabbing of a supermarket security guard.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a group of 13- and 14-year-olds were allegedly stealing from the New Lynn store on Totara Avenue at about 6.30pm on Sunday and a security guard was stabbed when she confronted one of them.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to hospital but was not seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>"The injury has penetrated the security guard's vest and into her torso," WaitematƒÅ CIB detective senior sergeant Megan Goldie said.</p>
        
            <p>"She was transported to hospital and thankfully hasn't suffered any serious injuries; however this would have been an extremely frightening incident for the victim and we are providing her with support.</p>
        
            <p>"The violent behaviour on display last night was totally unacceptable, directed toward someone who was just doing their job."</p>
        
            <p>Charges were now being considered.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for LynnMall property manager Kiwi Property confirmed the security guard was one of their staff.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware of an altercation on Veronica Street, New Lynn on Sunday 18 November," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"A LynnMall security guard was providing assistance, however, sustained a minor knife wound as a result. The security guard received prompt medical treatment and is receiving support."</p>
        
            <p>They said the individuals involved in the incident had been trespassed.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Security Association chief executive Gary Morrison said it showed offenders were becoming more brazen.</p>
        
            <p>"The age of the offenders is obviously a concern, and it just further reinforces our concerns around the safety of security staff while providing services.</p>
        
            <p>"The need to make sure they've got appropriate [protective gear], in this case stab vests."</p>
        
            <p>The latest incident was part of a concerning trend, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Covid we've seen an increase in the use of aggression, and that's both verbal and physical, [and] we've seen a feeling of entitlement from offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly an increasing situation and a worrying situation."</p>
        
            <p>Morrison said he was working with the ministerial advisory group for retail crime to increase the powers of security staff.</p>
        
            <p>"[We want] security staff to have the power to, for instance, retrieve property or detain offenders."</p>
