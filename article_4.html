        <p>
Wellingtonians appear to have ducked further water restrictions for now - thanks to household efforts to save water and "cooler weather".

A sprinkler ban remains in place in Wellington, but the threat of level 3 restrictions which would mean a ban on all outdoor water use has dropped.

            <p>Wellingtonians appear to have ducked further water restrictions for now - thanks to household efforts to save water and "cooler weather".</p>
        
            <p>In January, Wellington Water issued an urgent plea for residents to cut back, warning the region was at risk of level 3 restrictions (a ban on all residential outdoor water use) within one to three weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's director of regulatory services, Charles Barker, said the region had made it through "a tricky summer", and the likelihood of moving to level 3 - including a ban on all residential outdoor water use - had dropped.</p>
        
            <p>"Today we have run the numbers again and what this shows is that the hard mahi of the community has really paid off with the likelihood of moving to level 3 dropping down to 16 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into summer, there was a genuine risk of tighter water restrictions, and we called on the public to play their part.</p>
        
            <p>"We've managed to avoid level 3 restrictions, and this has reinforced what we already knew - that Wellingtonians want to do the right thing and can work together to make sure there's enough water for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Level 2 restrictions - including a sprinkler ban - remain in place due to low river levels.</p>
        
            <p>However, the chance of moving to level 4 restrictions (a ban on all outdoor water use, two-minute showers and limits on laundry) was now "a very remote possibility of 5 percent", thanks to the forecast for April, as long as demand remained manageable.</p>
        
            <p>"We anticipate being able to safely reduce from level 2 to level 1 once more steady rain fills up the catchments over the next few weeks," Barker said.</p>
        
            <p>"This means that we still do have to continue to keep an eye on our water use and avoid any major spikes in demand over the next few weeks."</p>
        
            <p>About 45 percent of Wellington's drinking water is currently lost to leaks.</p>
        
            <p>Barker said Wellington acknowledged the "frustration" about the requests to conserve water in view of the problems with leaky pipes.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to assure Wellingtonians that we are committed to working with our council owners to deliver a more resilient water network and we are out there every day finding and fixing leaks."</p>
        
            <p>Its leaks dashboard (updated on Wednesday March 13) showed there were 221 leaks fixed this week, and 878 in February.</p>
