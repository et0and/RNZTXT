            <p>Growing up, historian Claire Dinhut dreamed of one day hosting a food travel show in the style of Anthony Bourdain.</p>
        
            <p>Now, as Condiment Claire, she shares fun food facts, recipes and her own adventures with almost 1 million followers on TikTok.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of arriving in New Zealand for the launch of The Condiment Book, she tells Mihingarangi Forbes about her gratitude to the platform and why dijon mustard is her ride-or-die.</p>
        
            <p>After graduating from university, Dinhut was on the right track to becoming a Bourdain-style food TV host. She was in Mexico City filming the pilot of a show about how grandmas around the world make the best food, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.</p>
        
            <p>Back home in California, with her show cancelled, Dinhut was approached by a streaming platform seeking a TV host. But their interest soon evaporated when they discovered her only followers were friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>Although she'd never thought of working in the social media realm before, Dinhut realised that to do the work she was passionate about she had to jump in.</p>
        
            <p>"It's still a very odd thing for me to wrap my head around, but nowadays just having a following really gives you legitimacy almost more than education."</p>
        
            <p>Although social media is "weird", Dinhut says that without TikTok she'd never have been given the opportunity to write and publish The Condiment Book last year.</p>
        
            <p>The food category of condiments - which includes dips, sauces, dressings, salts, spices, and butter when added for flavour - appeals to her for its sustainability and versatility.</p>
        
            <p>Not only can you make your own condiments from produce that would otherwise go to waste, Dinhut says, they can transform tired leftovers into what tastes like a whole new meal.</p>
        
            <p>Glass jars with hard-to-reach scrapes of sweet spread or nut butter left over on their walls can become a pre-flavoured container for a chia seed pudding, yoghurt bowl, marinade or salad dressing.</p>
        
            <p>A glass jar of mustard near its end can become the starting point for a salad dressing or a pre-seasoned vessel in which to shake up some eggs you then scramble or in which mash up some chickpeas for homemade hummus.</p>
        
            <p>While Dinhut will eat yellow American mustard on a hot dog or New York pretzel, dijon is her absolute favourite mustard and all-time favourite condiment.</p>
        
            <p>As a child there was always a jar on the dining table, she says, and now the taste delivers immediate comfort when she's feeling a little homesick on her travels.</p>

            <p>Currently exploring the tastes of Australia, including the restaurant chain Fishbowl and the frozen yoghurt chain Yo-Chi, Dinhut will soon be heading to Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Here she'll appear at the (sold-out) launch of The Condiment Book in Auckland on Wednesday, hopefully sample some feijioas, and investigate Māori cuisine.</p>
        
            <p>She's also keen to follow up on some of the many foodie recommendations her Kiwi followers have sent through.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been to this corner of the world before, and to be able to share that with people who don't have the ability to travel is really special.</p>
        
            <p>"I love getting comments and messages being like 'You allow me to travel from my couch'. That's why I do this. It makes me so incredibly happy to have these authentic experiences and learn about these different places firsthand and not gatekeep that to myself."</p>
