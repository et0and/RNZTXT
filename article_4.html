            <p>Police are investigating the death of a man after a Whangārei house fire they say is suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Four fire crews were called out to the blaze in the suburb of Tikipunga on Monday where a car was also found ablaze.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said another fire involving a car happened just before 5am in the same suburb.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the house on Thomas Street about 3.09am.</p>
        
            <p>After the fire was put out by FENZ crews a man was found inside the property, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite efforts from first responders, the man had received critical injuries, and sadly died at the scene," Detective Inspector Al Symonds of Northland CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were making enquiries into the circumstances of the fire, which was being considered as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Symonds said the community could expect to see an increased police presence today.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have been at the address overnight speaking to a number of witnesses who were in the area at the time of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene guard has been in place this morning while a scene examination was commenced, and this will remain in place today as our enquiries continue."</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem and formal identification of the victim would be carried out over the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>Police appealed for anyone who was in the area, or had information, to get in touch.</p>
