            <p>Waiuku College says police will have a visible presence outside the school today after email threats sent the Auckland high school into lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Waiuku College principal Stuart Kelly said police did not believe there was a risk to the school but would be there as a reassurance for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been informed by the police that they are investigating the reason why we had to go into lockdown, that is ongoing," he said</p>
        
            <p>"They have informed us that there is, in their professional opinion, no risk to the school and or community but will have a presence outside our school.</p>
        
            <p>Police told RNZ in a statement while they "will not specifically be conducting foot patrols tomorrow, police will be deployed to the area in the case where police attendance is required."</p>
        
            <p>A second school, Rutherford College, also received threats although it did not close or go into lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they would continue to liaise with both schools and provide updates where possible.</p>
