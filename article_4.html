            <p>The mother of a man murdered 27 years ago says she is incredibly grateful that her son's case has been reopened.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched in December 1998 after the body of 25-year-old David John Robinson was found on a remote West Coast beach near Ross.</p>
        
            <p>His body was believed to have been found about 10 days after he was killed.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman police have reopened the cold case and have been canvassing the West Coast's Kakapotahi area this week.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, David's mother Joan said she remains very hopeful for a positive result.</p>
        
            <p>But she asked for privacy for herself and her family as the investigation continues.</p>
