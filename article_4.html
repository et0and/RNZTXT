            <p>The man who died after what police describe as a "gang-related disorder incident" in Whakatāne has been named.</p>
        
            <p>Tuterangi Moeke, 27, was taken to hospital with life threatening injuries about 9.40pm on Sunday and pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation to piece together what happened leading up to his death.</p>
        
            <p>Police previously said initial indications suggested there was a gang-related disorder incident before Moeke died.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Lew Warner said police understood recent events had caused a feeling of angst in the tight-knit community.</p>
        
            <p>"Police want to reassure residents we are working hard to hold anyone responsible to account.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will be conducting high-visibility reassurance patrols across the region in coming days."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who has information on what happened in the lead up to Moeke's death can contact police on 105, either by phone or using 'Update Report' online, referencing file number 231211/5404.</p>
