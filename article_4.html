            <p>Police used CCTV footage - including from the prime minister's official residence - as evidence in a murder trial under way in the High Court in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Carolyn Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume, and Pania Ella Waaka have all pleaded not guilty to the murder of Rau Tongia, who was found dead at a house in Karori in December, 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt-Weston has pleaded not guilty to additional charges of an accessory after the fact to murder, and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth person was due to go on trial but has not appeared due to health issues.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleges in the hours before Tongia's death he assaulted Weston and his death was a revenge killing.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, police presented to the jury a series of CCTV footage they had collected from traffic cameras, local businesses, home security cameras and even the prime minister's official residence, Premier House.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has previously said he was not living there due to the building's condition.</p>
        
            <p>The footage tracks two cars travelling in the city including one of them to Tongia's address, and shows some of the accused get in and out at different places in the city.</p>
        
            <p>Police and neighbours say officers were called to Percy Dyett Drive about 1.30am after Tongia was said to have assaulted Weston, and a second fight occurred after police had left.</p>
        
            <p>In footage earlier in the evening, police had identified Phoenix Colvin driving the car.</p>
        
            <p>Colvin was sentenced in 2022 in relation to Tongia's death.</p>
