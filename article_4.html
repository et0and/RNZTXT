            <p>Fire and Emergency says four homes had to be evacuated during a fire next to State Highway 1 in Northland's Brynderwyn Hills on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Wildfire specialist Rory Renwick said the blaze, which raced through a hectare of grass and scrub, was brought under control around 5pm by six fire trucks and a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters would be working from the side of the highway for a few more hours as they put out all remaining hot spots, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Travellers should continue to take alternative routes around the Brynderwyns if possible, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known what started the fire just before 3pm.</p>
