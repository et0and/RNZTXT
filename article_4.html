            <p>Work to unblock a sewage pipe in Gisborne has stalled due to heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors have been working to clear pipes in the suburb of Mangapapa after garden waste was dumped into a manhole, forcing the council to open an overflow valve into the Taruheru River.</p>
        
            <p>A ban on swimming and fishing in the town's rivers and beaches was in place over the past two days, and was expected to last for a further three days.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson from Gisborne District Council said their crew had located the blockage, but had to abandon work due to the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The sewer was now in flood with more rain expected tonight.</p>
        
            <p>It may take two to three days before work can resume, and they will re-evaluate the situation on Friday. Then they will decide whether to resume work over the weekend, the spokesperson said.</p>
