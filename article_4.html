            <p>New speed limits have been imposed on Te Oneroa-a-Tōhe Ninety Mile Beach as part of a new safety plan being rolled out this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Vehicle speeds are now limited to 30kmph within 200 metres of beach access points, and 60kmph elsewhere along the famous stretch of Far North coast.</p>
        
            <p>Te Oneroa-a-Tōhe Beach Board chairwoman Lisa McNab said the new limits would help keep locals and visitors safe, as well as protect wildlife and the spiritual pathway Te Ara Wairua.</p>
        
            <p>The move came amid growing concern around the motu about the danger to people, bird life and shellfish from vehicles on beaches.</p>
        
            <p>Signs setting out the enforceable new limits were put up just before Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The beach was previously regarded as an open road with a 100kmph limit.</p>
