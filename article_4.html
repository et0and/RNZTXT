            <p>One person has died after a fire at a housing block at Burnham military camp, just outside of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said they were called just after 2am on Wednesday, and the housing block was well ablaze when crews arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Forty firefighters worked to contain the blaze, which was extinguished by mid-morning. Crews remained on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said paramedics treated four patients and took three to Christchurch Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>One person was in a serious condition and two in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police and New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) confirmed one person died. Officers were on-site, guarding the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Burnham Camp Commandant Major Julie Richardson said they could not comment at this stage whether the four burnt houses were occupied by NZDF personnel.</p>
        
            <p>While housing at Burnham Military Camp was owned by the NZDF, some was occupied by NZDF personnel and some was tenanted by non-NZDF personnel. Houses occupied by non-NZDF families were managed through commercial property managers.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the whƒÅnau who have lost a family member, and all of those impacted by today's fire," Richardson said.</p>
        
            <p>Support was being provided to all those affected, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the fire was yet to be confirmed but police said inquiries were ongoing.</p>

            <p>Firefighters have also extinguished a house fire in Rangiora, north of Christchurch, in Waimakariri District.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ were called to the scene about 4am and found the property ablaze. The house was unoccupied at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The house on Southbrook Road is connected to a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The property had been searched by police investigating the death of Richard Leman, whose body was found in his car parked in a garage in Tyler Street in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze was under control, but firefighters were still working to fully extinguish the fire, FENZ said.</p>
