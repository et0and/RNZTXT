            <p>A parole hearing for convicted murderer Scott Watson has been adjourned to allow the Parole Board to hear more detail from psychologists about his risk of reoffending.</p>
        
            <p>It is the fifth attempt at parole for Watson, who has been in prison for the murders of Ben Smart and Olivia Hope since June 1998.</p>
        
            <p>The two young people disappeared during New Year's celebrations in Marlborough Sounds in 1998. Watson has maintained his innocence since their disappearance and has said he never met the pair.</p>
        
            <p>At his last two parole hearings in 2021 and 2020, the board said Watson's refusal to admit his crimes prevented him from undergoing the psychological treatment he needed, leaving him at an undue risk to the community.</p>
        
            <p>At the most recent hearing on Friday, Parole Board panel convener Sir Ron Young said psychological reports over the past four years varied between showing Watson was at very high risk to a low risk of reoffending.</p>
        
            <p>There had been a very large number of psychological reports done on Watson during his 26 years in prison, those up to November 2021 said he remained at a high, or very high risk of violent reoffending, Sir Ron said.</p>
        
            <p>In September 2023, a further report from Corrections assessed Watson as being at medium risk, while a private psychologist's report assessed him at low risk.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Ron said that was a "potentially confusing array of various assessments over quite a short period of time" and the board wanted clarity as to Watson's risk of reoffending.</p>
        
            <p>He asked the psychologists who authored the reports to come before the board to answer questions, so the various views on risk could be reconciled.</p>
        
            <p>The board also sought a report on the work Watson had done in prison with a psychologist.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is expected to be held in September, while Watson's case will be heard in the Court of Appeal next month.</p>
