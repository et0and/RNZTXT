            <p>An active front, preceded by a strong northerly flow, is forecast to move northwards over the South Island today.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said the west saw the wettest of the weather, with Heavy Rain Watches continuing for the Westland District south of Whataroa until 12pm with possible thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>"I think, it's going to be a wet story in that western coast."</p>
        
            <p>There was a strong wind warning in place for Stewart Island and Southland overnight. Although that has now expired, a Strong Wind Watch remains across the Canterbury High Country until 1pm, with severe northwest gales reaching 130kmh possible in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>"But still a pretty windy story up through parts of particularly the Canterbury High Country, down towards parts of inland Otago and even here in Wellington as well."</p>
        
            <p>It could be a rough journey for those using the ferry crossing today with winds reaching 100kmh across the Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>But there is good news for the top of the motu, he said, as the front starts to weaken as it makes its way north later today.</p>
        
            <p>"The winds should start to ease off once we head in towards the afternoon, the front doesn't make much headway towards the northern parts of the country."</p>
