            <p>Four people have been taken into police custody following reports that a person was threatened with a firearm in the Wellington settlement of Makara.</p>
        
            <p>The police said there are still no reports of any injuries and cordons remain in place on Makara Road, between Makara Model School and the Takarau Gorge Road intersection.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a house just before 2pm and the Armed Offenders Squad was deployed as precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were taken into custody earlier this afternoon and another person was taken into custody after officers searched the property for others.</p>
        
            <p>A resident near the intersection says she spoke to police at the cordon, but couldn't see anything as most of the houses are set back from the road.</p>
