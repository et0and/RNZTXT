            <p>Auckland Council is expected to vote on whether or not to approve two proposals for a new stadium development at its Governing Body meeting on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Four different proposals were put forward, including a 50,000-seat facility at Quay Park favoured by New Zealand Rugby, a sunken stadium which could fit 70,000 at Bledisloe Wharf or a 55,000-seat venue at Wynyard Point.</p>
        
            <p>A revamp of the existing Eden Park stadium was also on the cards, which included putting a roof over the grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Stadium working group chairperson councillor Shane Henderson said only the proposals for a revamped Eden Park and the downtown stadium, known as Quay Park, would be recommended for approval.</p>
        
            <p>Quay Park would meet residents' desire for a central city based stadium option, while also being an exciting urban development opportunity, Henderson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Eden Park redevelopment option was also exciting, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got a history and a current record of really delivering for Aucklanders."</p>

            <p>If it was approved, bidders would have to do a feasability study of the development at their own expense, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The feasbility studies could take months, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That will come back from assessment and then we'll take it from there."</p>
        
            <p>After that, it would be a matter of the Governing Body deciding between the two options.</p>
        
            <p>Henderson said the two unsuccessful waterfront proposals were on land which council already had plans for.</p>
        
            <p>"Bledisloe has port activity ongoing that we've already consulted on, Wynyard Point has a park development that has been long promised to the community and to Aucklanders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a land use issue, that's the main thing there."</p>
