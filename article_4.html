            <p>Old rivals will open a new era with basketball's inaugural Trans-Tasman Throwdown.</p>
        
            <p>Over five days in May the Tall Ferns and Tall Blacks would play Australia's Opals and Boomers over three double header games split between Australia and New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The new initiative got New Zealand's top women's players back on a home court for an international game for the first time in more than five years.</p>
        
            <p>The last time the Tall Ferns played in New Zealand, November 2019, they won their Olympic qualifier against South Korea in Auckland, but failed to progress to the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
        
            <p>Since then the Tall Ferns had played more than 20 times - including twice against the Opals - with games hosted in countries like Jordan, Australia, Turkey and Serbia.</p>
        
            <p>In their last meeting with the Opals in the 2023 FIBA Women's Asia Cup in Sydney, the Tall Ferns lost the bronze medal game.</p>
        
            <p>The Opals are Olympic bronze medalists and are currently ranked world number two so it would be a tough match-up for the 26th ranked Tall Ferns who were still without a permanent coach.</p>
        
            <p>Australian Natalie Hurst filled the coaching role on an interim basis after Guy Molloy stood down in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>The Opals last played in New Zealand in 2015 and it had also been nearly a decade since the Boomers were in Aotearoa.</p>

            <p>The Tall Blacks and Boomers last played in 2021 in an Asia Cup Qualifier in Cairns, with a New Zealand roster without any New Zealand-based players due to quarantine restrictions during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>The Boomers had a winning record over the Tall Blacks, including the last time they played which they won 81-52 in Tall Black legend Mika Vukona's last game.</p>
        
            <p>In February 2020, the Tall Blacks ended an 11-year losing streak against their trans-Tasman rivals with a 109-98 win in the opening game at the Asia 2021 qualifiers.</p>
        
            <p>Basketball New Zealand chief executive Dillon Boucher said the "the rivalry between our two countries is unmatched" and he was looking forward to hosting Australia again.</p>
        
            <p>Boucher's Basketball Australia counterpart Matt Scriven wanted the series to mark the return to clashes between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>"The arrival of the Trans-Tasman Throwdown series is a testament to the rise of the game in both Australia and New Zealand. There's a strong history of basketball in both regions and like Australia, Aotearoa is currently driving and enjoying a boom of their own.</p>
        
            <p>"We want the inaugural series to set the foundation for a tradition that fans, players and teams will embrace, and we look forward to introducing a new era of rivalry between Australia and New Zealand basketball."</p>
        
            <p>The series starts in Adelaide on 7 May before heading northeast to the Sunshine Coast on 9 May culminating in the final game in Hamilton on 11 May.</p>
