            <p>Police are warning Bay of Plenty motorists to expect disruptions on Friday, as gang members attending a tangi make their way through the district.</p>
        
            <p>Western Bay of Plenty area commander Clifford Paxton said the tangi was for the father of a prominent Mongols gang member.</p>
        
            <p>"Bay of Plenty police will be monitoring the tangi and procession in Waitangi, Te Puke, due to take place around midday."</p>
        
            <p>Paxton said there could be disruption on the road as attendees made their way there from Tauranga and other areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Police advise those attending that we will not tolerate any unlawful activity, and this will be met with enforcement action where it is identified."</p>
        
            <p>Police would follow up on offences if they were unable to take enforcement action, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police wouldn't comment on specific numbers expected at the tangi, but said gang members from across the Bay of Plenty and out of the district were expected to attend.</p>
