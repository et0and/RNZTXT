            <p>An Auckland man who had his leg amputated after being pinned against a power pole by a car while walking says he has seen the best of humankind while recovering.</p>
        
            <p>Pawanjit Singh Ghatora has undergone five surgeries and has been in hospital since 1 February, after he was hit by a car while walking with his father along a street in Te Atatū.</p>
        
            <p>Despite his right leg being amputated above the knee he said he was "thankful" for the care he received from his community and hospital staff.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm still healing, but I'm doing good - the pain comes and goes and I've been transferred to North Shore Hospital from Auckland, so with the help of my family I can go outside and look at the lake.</p>
        
            <p>"I try to keep myself positive."</p>
        
            <p>Ghatora said he remained conscious after being hit by the car, despite his right leg being pinned between it and a concrete street pole.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember falling down on the ground and looking at the sky, I knew my leg would be gone.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone came to help me so quickly there was an off-duty police officer and off-duty paramedic nearby and the ambulance was there very fast, I was taken care of very well."</p>
        
            <p>Ghatora said he was even enjoying the hospital food.</p>
        
            <p>"My wound is healing well and once it's healed, hopefully, I will be able to stand on my left leg.</p>
        
            <p>"Since this happened I've experienced that most people are good. Everyone came forward to help me."</p>
        
            <p>Ghatora came to New Zealand from India in 2019, and due to the Covid-19 lockdown, ended up being apart from his family for over two years.</p>

            <p>During that time, he took up running and recently completed a half-marathon.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm quite hopeful I can get a prosthetic at some stage and that in the long term I will be able to run again. That's my goal."</p>
        
            <p>Ghatora's old boss started a Givealittle to help with medical and living costs for him and his family - so far it had raised over $57,000.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm overwhelmed," Ghatora said, "it takes pressure off my family, my wife has been off work since it happened and we have a mortgage to pay so this will really help us along with paying for future rehabilitation."</p>
        
            <p>In terms of the car which hit him, Ghatora said he did not want to spend time blaming the driver.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got to look into the present, not the past, I just had to let it go for my own healing.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no point grieving for the past or regretting it, it's up to the police to take care of the rest."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed police were anticipating to lay charges in relation to the crash on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Once these charges have been laid there will be a court appearance later this month," the spokesperson said.</p>
