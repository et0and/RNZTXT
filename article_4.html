            <p>Air Vanuatu has cancelled all of its international flights until Sunday, and later flights are under review as it considers voluntary administration.</p>
        
            <p>Amon's holiday with his wife was planned for April 2020, but then the Covid pandemic hit. They got airline credit and were meant to go in September 2023, but they had a baby, so it was postponed to May 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He told First Up the airline did not contact him about his cancelled flight, instead he said, "Simon Dallow told me" on the 6pm news.</p>
        
            <p>On 9 May 2024, Morgan Kelly, Justin Walsh and Andrew Hanson of Ernst and Young Australia (EY Australia) were appointed Voluntary Liquidators of Air Vanuatu (Operations) Limited (In Liquidation).</p>
        
            <p>The liquidators are now in control of the business and will conduct safety and maintenance checks before the resumption of normal operations.</p>
        
            <p>The only other option that worked for Amon was via Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"A flight going through Brisbane which would take about 43 hours to get there. It was the only thing available with a long stay in Brisbane and then going there and then on the way back as well, more than 20 hours."</p>
        
            <p>He was only going for four days, most of which would be spent inside an airport. It would also cost about $4000 more.</p>
        
            <p>So they decided to cancel the trip and plan another one for another time.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody goes to Fiji. I was really amazed by Vanuatu because of the culture and the language ... I really wanted to go there.</p>
        
            <p>"But now it's not going to happen and also I'm going to have to regroup because I'm a poor student with a wife on maternity leave," Amon said.</p>
        
            <p>Board of Airline Representatives of New Zealand executive director Cath O'Brien said it was still an emerging situation.</p>
        
            <p>She recommended passengers sit tight, await news from the airline or the administrators, and not travel to the airport.</p>
        
            <p>The airline's voluntary liquidation is not just affecting holidaymakers. About 1458 seasonal workers are stranded in New Zealand with visas soon to expire.</p>
