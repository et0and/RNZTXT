            <p>Crews remain at the site of a scrub fire in Christchurch's Port Hills.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency wildfire manager Tim Mitchell told Morning Report there was one flare-up overnight.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution, a couple of helicopters were on standby.</p>
        
            <p>A Waka Kotahi spokesperson said the southbound lane of SH76 around Port Hills Rd and Chapmans Rd opened at 9pm on Monday, the northbound lane remains closed.</p>
        
            <p>"Christchurch always can be a bit of a fickle place this time of year in terms of winds changing direction during the day but at the moment [with] clear skies, calm conditions, [it is] good to be able to get on top of that early this morning," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>Reasonably regular rain meant there was a fair bit of green vegetation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's actually not looking too bad for this time of year."</p>
        
            <p>This was a timely reminder that fires could happen at any time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, generally low fire risk conditions across the country but low risk doesn't mean no risk so really important people heed what's happened on the Port Hills yesterday."</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said people needed to prepare their own property for fires and assess the risk.</p>
