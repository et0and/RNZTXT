            <p>Originally intended to be in place for just four years, the exhibition featuring ultra-realistic figures of seven World War I servicemen and a nurse 2.4 times their life-size, had already been extended twice since its 2015 opening.</p>
        
            <p>With this latest extension, the statues would have been on display for 17 years by the time the exhibition closes in April 2032.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa chief executive Courtney Johnston said public interest in the war memorial was not slowing down.</p>
        
            <p>"The success of Gallipoli has been more than anyone could have ever expected," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Johnston said the museum wanted to offer the immersive experience for as long as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We have visitors who come [to the exhibition] over and over again.</p>
        
            <p>"I see so many visitors come out of the exhibition deeply affected. It's a scale of war that is hard to imagine and it hits people hard."</p>
        
            <p>Johnston said they expected the exhibition to reach five million visitors this year.</p>
        
            <p>"This has been Te Papa's most successful exhibition, possibly the most successful in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We're at 4.8 million visitors now, so I expect this year we'll tick over to five million people who've been through Gallipoli."</p>
        
            <p>Wētā Workshop co-founder Sir Richard Taylor, who was involved in the exhibition's creation, said it was one of the most seminal moments in his career.</p>
        
            <p>"We wanted to share a deep respect to the memories of the men and women who served and sacrificed so much - on a scale that they deserved."</p>
        
            <p>"We are incredibly thankful knowing that the exhibition is being extended, so that future visitors to Te Papa will continue to gain a deeper understanding of this critical moment in New Zealand's history, and so that young Kiwis who served in this campaign are never forgotten."</p>
        
            <p>The exhibition would be closed from Monday 21 July to Friday 12 September for maintenance and upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>Once it re-opened, the museum would be offering a new guided tour experience twice daily, which could be pre-booked online from Monday 4 August 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Visitors to the exhibition between 1 May and 30 November would also be able to enter a draw for an 11-day trip to Türkiye for two people, valued at $15,000.</p>
