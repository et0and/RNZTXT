            <p>Auckland Transport is back-tracking on Karangahape Road's bus-only lanes, opening them up to all traffic on weekends and weekday mornings.</p>
        
            <p>The agency put in the two bus-only lanes, alongside two traffic lanes, in November last year.</p>
        
            <p>In their open business report for this month, the agency said it recognises the weekend is an important time for businesses.</p>
        
            <p>Jamey Holloway from the Karangahape Road Business Association said it had long opposed full-time bus lanes and had extensively consulted with Auckland Transport (AT) on the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"We're really happy that they've had a bit of a re-think and had a chance to look at how the bus lanes are working and when they're needed, and when they're not. We will welcome the changes."</p>
        
            <p>Holloway said having more access to drop off and pick up goods during weekends and mornings will help productivity flow on Karangahape Road.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just gonna make a whole lot more, park and pop in, loading and servicing, function a lot better."</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland needs to have public transport that functions well - busses are a huge part of that. We need a mix."</p>
        
            <p>The lanes will no longer be bus-only on weekends and will only operate in the evenings between 3pm and 7pm on weekdays.</p>
        
            <p>One lane will operate on weekday mornings between 7am and 10am.</p>
        
            <p>AT infrastructure and fleet specification manager Edward Wright said they have met several times with local businesses and the Karangahape Business Association since November.</p>
        
            <p>"While the bus lanes on Karangahape Road are effective and there is a need for them on weekends, we have listened to the local businesses and heard their concerns," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, we are working to reduce the conflict with the bus lanes and cars turning left into Howe Street."</p>
        
            <p>Wright said the bus lane operating hours will be reviewed again before City Rail Link opens.</p>
