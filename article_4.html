            <p>A rural ManawatÅ« early childhood centre facing closure over alleged curriculum violations will remain open for now after court action was filed, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>Country Kindy, between Feilding and Palmerston North, was to have its licence cancelled by the Ministry of Education from 5pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>However, it is understood its doors will remain open after court action has been taken seeking to overturn the ministry's move.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry said the centre was issued a provisional licence last year but failed to comply with some of the conditions of this.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, however, the Early Childhood Council, which represents more than 1300 early childhood centres, spoke out against the move as heavy handed.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Simon Laube last week said the council was working frantically on extending that timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>The centre has 22 children enrolled.</p>
        
            <p>Laube last week said if the closure went ahead those children would have to find other early childhood centres to attend.</p>
        
            <p>A well-attended public meeting showed there was community support for Country Kindy.</p>
        
            <p>While it was disputed that there were curriculum violations, Laube believed if there were, the ministry should work with Country Kindy to fix such problems rather than cancelling its licence.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education last week said Country Kindy was placed on a provisional licence in September because of 17 "non compliances" with early childhood regulations and rules.</p>
        
            <p>Since then Country Kindy has failed to comply with seven conditions of the provisional licence, including "curriculum and governance" and "management criteria and regulations".</p>
