            <p>Police are asking the public for any information regarding a Feilding man that has been missing for two years.</p>
        
            <p>In late March 2023, Stephen Ryan was reported missing having last been seen on the the evening of Tuesday 28 March after he was dropped off at an address in Feilding.</p>
        
            <p>The then-40-year-old was wearing a red cap, white singlet, blue track pants and jandals.</p>
        
            <p>Since that time, no credible sightings of Stephen have been reported, and there have been few investigative leads available for police to follow up.</p>
        
            <p>Detective sergeant Joe Salisbury said police were hoping there was someone who had information about what happened to the man.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly frustrating, not to mention heartbreaking, for Stephen's family not to know what has happened to him.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have continually reviewed this matter and followed up any available avenues of enquiry, and we still very much want to solve this for Stephen's family."</p>
