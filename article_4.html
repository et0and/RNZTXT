        <h2>Napier man takes on insurer over hike - and wins</h2>

"Where does this stop?" Philip Dol said as his premiums went up from $2000 to $8000. Audio

            <p>A Napier man who got his insurance premiums reduced after he challenged a council flooding hazard map is calling for greater transparency on where insurers get their information from.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Dol said premiums for his house in the suburb of Te Arawa went up from $2000 a year to more than $5000 after Cyclone Gabrielle. His latest premiums were quoted at just shy of $8000.</p>
        
            <p>Dol - who has experience in the engineering sector - was able to work out the Hawke's Bay Regional Council had not included key information about his property, which had been elevated to a higher level than a neighbouring suburb, in its hazard maps.</p>
        
            <p>He told Nine to Noon's Kathryn Ryan that his home premiums had been stable for many years before Cyclone Gabrielle, when they had "quite a substantial increase".</p>
        
            <p>"That led me to think - where to from here? It's $8000 now. Is it $10,000 next year? And where does this stop?"</p>
        
            <p>Dol said he contacted his insurers, asking how the premiums had been calculated.</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>The insurer told Dol his property was in a high-risk area for flooding, and new mapping had shown it was also at risk of coastal inundation.</p>
        
            <p>But when he examined the maps, Dol noticed only a small portion of his driveway was in the high-risk zone.</p>
        
            <p>"I live on a small cul-de-sac, so there was many, many houses that were affected by a very small portion of their property, and that got me thinking, that can't be right."</p>
        
            <p>The local council required properties in new subdivisions to have a raft of mitigations around seismic, geological and landslide risks, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, Dol had taken extra precautions for his own property - raising his foundations and adding a large stormwater sump - and presented this to the insurer.</p>
        
            <p>When challenged, the insurer said Dol should contact the regional council to change the maps, in which case they would review the premium.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, the newly developed area in which Dol lived was taken off the flood hazard maps, as were more than 200 homes and retirement units in a nearby subdivision.</p>
        
            <p>Not satisfied, Dol pressed further - and the insurer reduced his premium by $880.</p>
        
            <p>Dol said there needed to be greater transparency for all consumers about the information insurers were using to make decisions about premiums.</p>
        
            <p>"I find it really hard as a ratepayer to understand that through infrastructure investment - or potential lack of, through the years - that we're getting a double whammy. We're getting insurance premiums increased, as well as our rates increased to pay for those investments.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of people out there struggling financially with all these bills going up and working really hard ... to get ahead. [With] some of these pressures, it dawned on me, OK I need to take a stand here and get some answers."</p>
        
            <p>Dol accepted insurers were under pressure with the added financial risks of climate change, but the mapping and data they based premiums on needed to be accurate, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're increasing someone's premiums by double, what are they actually getting for that? Because two years ago I was getting the same service ... that I am now, so what's changed for that extra money we've been charged?"</p>
        
            <p>Kathryn Ryan asked Dol if the issue was that different councils were responsible for hazard mapping and building consents, and whether that information was readily available.</p>
        
            <p>"Absolutely. It needs to be totally up to date," Dol said.</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear whether other properties in his subdivision would be eligible for premium discounts, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no real clarity here... I was getting nowhere with my insurer and that's why I decided to band together because if more voices are talking, and pushing, you usually get an outcome."</p>
        
            <p>The 200 houses were likely to be "the tip of the iceberg" around New Zealand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Insurance and Financial Services Ombudsman Karen Stevens told Nine to Noon Dol's situation was part of a wider issue of the data behind insurers' decisions.</p>
        
            <p>Consumers had the power to challenge insurance premium increases arising from natural hazard mapping, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Natural Hazards Commission - which took over from the Earthquake Commission on 1 July - had a portal showing every area in New Zealand and the hazards they faced.</p>
        
            <p>But not all of that information was up to date, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just about earthquakes; it's about landslips, it's about volcanic activity, tsunami, storm inundations - all of these things now are being regarded as high risk."</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury earthquakes were the trigger for such risk-based pricing, and subsequent natural disasters had also led to increased premiums, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know it's a big issue because we get a lot of people coming to us with that complaint."</p>
        
            <p>So who was to blame for the inaccurate mapping: regional councils or insurers? And whose information should be used to set premiums?</p>
        
            <p>Premiums were historically based on individual factors, such as home renovations - or lack thereof, Stevens said.</p>
        
            <p>That had changed with climate change, however, and insurers now relied on a raft of information, including local body mapping.</p>
        
            <p>But this could be challenged, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The start is for all consumers to understand their risk and look at what is now on the natural hazards site.... It's all colour and it's just laid across a map, and doesn't take into consideration individual risk mitigations.</p>
        
            <p>"If you know you don't have a hill [at risk of landslips] behind you, but you're still a pink or an orange, it's time to actually stand up and say something, and take the same action that Phil has taken."</p>
