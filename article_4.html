        <h2>Smelly substance on Napier beach likely from wastewater</h2>
        <p>
The test results confirmed it was consistent with a discharge of animal byproducts, and aligned with a discharge from the council wastewater treatment plant.

At least two dogs became sick after eating the substance at Haumoana beach.

            <p>A fatty, smelly substance found on a beach south of Napier last month likely came from a Hastings District Council wastewater outfall, council has confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Previous test results showed the substance found on Haumoana beach on 1 December was a waste byproduct from animal or food processing, and also contained hydrocarbon.</p>
        
            <p>At least two dogs became sick after eating it.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council contractors had been working on the outfall the previous day when they noticed "solid material discharging on the surface", the regional council said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Contractors were undertaking annual maintenance of the outfall which involves flushing of this structure.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a consented activity as part of maintaining the wastewater treatment plant and outfall."</p>
        
            <p>The test results confirmed it was consistent with a discharge of animal byproducts, and aligned with a discharge from the Hastings District Council wastewater treatment plant, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council agreed that was probably the case.</p>
        
            <p>"It is difficult to prove and there are other scenarios, however this does seem the most credible," said three waters manager Steve Cave.</p>
        
            <p>"While our processes for this work are set out in our resource consent and were strictly followed, council is keen to see how we can improve."</p>
        
            <p>It was not abnormal for animal byproducts to be found in the wastewater system, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hastings District Council has a trade waste component, which is essential in a district that has such reliance on the processing of primary product, so it is not surprising to find it in the waste stream."</p>
        
            <p>The councils said they were working together to avoid it happening again.</p>
