            <p>An active front is forecast to sweep up over southern and central New Zealand bringing heavy rain and strong winds heading into the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued an orange heavy rain warning for the Westland District from 9pm this evening, and for Buller and parts of Tasman from early morning Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It said the Westland District, especially near the glaciers, could experience a significant, short duration of heavy rain on top of recent downpours in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities are closely monitoring the Waiho River in preparation for the wet weather.</p>
        
            <p>The West Coast Regional Council said last week's deluge shifted the Waiho River, and 95 percent of its main channel is now flowing into the Tartare Stream.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a wind warning was in place for the Canterbury High Country from midnight.</p>
        
            <p>There were also multiple heavy rain watches in place for Saturday, including for the Taranaki, the Tararua Range, the Canterbury High Country, Southern Lakes, and Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned there also strong wind watches for the Wairarapa, Wellington, Southern Lakes, Westland and Fiordland.</p>
