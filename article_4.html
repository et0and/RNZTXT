            <p>Two sisters from Hawke's Bay have shocked the competition at an international martial arts championship, taking away three gold medals and one silver between them.</p>
        
            <p>The Florida International Taekwon-do championship in Ocala, Florida attracted talent from Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, United Kingdom, Mongolia, and the USA.</p>
        
            <p>Sisters Vana Smith, 6, and Pippa Yule, 14, attended along with their family, including their mother, Kirtsen Yule.</p>
        
            <p>Vana made an impression in her world stage debut, competing first out of the New Zealand squad.</p>
        
            <p>Coach Ben Evans said she won gold in the patterns category and silver in sparring, beating a "taller, older, and higher-ranked blue belt".</p>
        
            <p>Evans, who is also president of the NZ International Taekwon-do Federation, said Vana displayed discipline and masterfully executed her routines in a way others her age could not do.</p>
        
            <p>"She worked really hard back home. She has good discipline and I guess at the end of the day, she just followed the plan," Evans said.</p>
        
            <p>"It really set the tone for New Zealand. You know, our youngest competitor literally cleaned up on her patterns."</p>

            <p>Vana said she wasn't nervous. "No, I was excited to go," she said.</p>
        
            <p>When asked if she found it hard going up against the girl with the blue belt, she said, "no, I kicked her".</p>
        
            <p>Her older sister, Pippa Yule, also impressed the judges, winning gold in patterns and sparring for her category.</p>
        
            <p>She beat another New Zealand boy to secure the win.</p>
        
            <p>"There were some tough competitors. I was quite nervous," Pippa said.</p>
        
            <p>Evans said like her younger sister, Pippa displayed strength and poise</p>
        
            <p>"The main thing for me is her drive," Evans said, "she never, gave up. Even just with the training, everything that I would put her through, she would never argue, she would never have an attitude about it."</p>
        
            <p>The sisters were among 13 competitors from the ITF Taekwon-do Centre in Hastings who travelled for the event.</p>

            <p>Pippa is hoping her next international competition will be in Italy in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Their mother, Kirsten Yule, said it was an amazing experience being by her daughters' side as they took home gold after starting the sport only 15 months prior.</p>
        
            <p>"I think pride was probably an understatement. There's not really any words that you can use to explain how just how amazing they had done with such a short amount of time of being part of taekwondo and just their achievements in that short time has just been unreal."</p>
        
            <p>Evans, who wasn't able to coach them in person, felt a similar way.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me feel proud, our training methods are not the usual training methods that everyone would think, so what it means to me is that what we're doing is working.</p>
        
            <p>"Our kids are improving and I'm pleased that even on the international stage our kids can succeed."</p>
