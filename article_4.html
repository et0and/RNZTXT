            <p>While playing with Shihad is like "riding a dragon" whenever they get on stage, front man Jon Togood, says the time is right to call it quits.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand rock legends kicked off their final tour last week headlining Rock the Bowl in New Plymouth, after the band announced they would be hanging up their guitars in November, after nearly 40 years, ten studio albums, and 18 music awards.</p>
        
            <p>The emotions associated with saying farewell haven't kicked in yet, Togood told Summer Times.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we've got to the emotional part yet, the last show is going to be in Wellington, which is our hometown where we sort of formed and learned how to be a band.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that'll be emotional. But all we're concentrating on is making sure every show is off-the-chain amazing."</p>
        
            <p>The tour takes in New Zealand's main centres as well as sold-out shows in Australia, he says, and the reaction from fans so far has been "pretty ecstatic".</p>
        
            <p>"We've put a lot of effort into making sure that the show is top notch and making sure we play at least a song from every album, and usually it's two.</p>
        
            <p>"And so, it's pretty comprehensive sets, there's going to be something for everybody."</p>
        
            <p>The band all had families later in life, making life on the road incompatible with the demands of parenting, Togood says.</p>
        
            <p>"The idea of being away from my six-year-old and nine-year-old for eight months a year, it's just not what I want to do, and the other guys are in similar positions.</p>
        
            <p>"And we never do things by halves. When you release an album, you really do need to be on the road for at least eight to 12 months of a year. That's what it takes. And I just, I don't think any of us wants to do that."</p>
        
            <p>Not that the love of playing has dimmed over the years, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"We love playing in this band. We like writing music with this band that still sounds really fresh to me, and every time we get on stage, it's like riding a dragon, it's just so much fun."</p>
        
            <p>Toogood plans to continue with his solo career, and keep working with the New Zealand Music Commission once the tour finishes, something he's been involved with for a decade.</p>
        
            <p>"Working in high schools, working with talented kids who want careers in music. I just go in and help them with song writing, help them with whatever they want to know, really.</p>
        
            <p>"I find that quite inspiring and if I can help some young, talented person, avoid a few of the pitfalls that we fell in, you've got to make mistakes, that's all good. I let everybody know that. But if I can help get rid of some of those ones that you don't have to go through."</p>
        
            <p>His main advice for the next generation? Put in the hours.</p>
        
            <p>"Just write and write and write and play and play and play. And there's no quick way to get good at anything. You've got to do the hours."</p>
        
            <p>Shihad's final tour Loud Forever runs until March.</p>
