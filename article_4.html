        <h2>Port Hills fire forces cancellation of Crankworx Summer Series</h2>
        <p>
"Extensive damage to the courses and ongoing safety concerns on the site" make it impossible for the event to go ahead, organisers say.

            <p>The Port Hills fire has forced the cancellation of a major mountain biking event.</p>
        
            <p>Crankworx Summer Series was to be held at Christchurch Adventure Park from 1-3 March.</p>
        
            <p>However, the fire - which started on 14 February and has since burnt through 650 hectares of land, including some of the adventure park - has put paid to the event, organisers have announced.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time, the situation remains in the hands of the fire service and the full extent of the impact on the Port Hills, [Christchurch Adventure Park], and surrounding areas is yet to be fully determined," Crankworx wrote in a statement on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with a heavy heart that we must announce the complete cancellation of Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite exhaustive efforts by the Crankworx team, the [adventure park] crew, and our friends at ChristchurchNZ, we have been left with no choice due to the extensive damage to the courses and ongoing safety concerns on the site, making it impossible to proceed with the event as planned."</p>
        
            <p>Crankworx was "deeply saddened" by the decision, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and support remain with the teams on the ground who are tirelessly engaged in firefighting, assessment, and containment efforts."</p>
        
            <p>The post encouraged people to support the Christchurch Foundation's Port Hills regeneration efforts.</p>
        
            <p>Crankworx Rotorua would go ahead as planned from 16-24 March, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for your patience and understanding, while we navigate these uncertain times."</p>

            <p>Christchurch Adventure Park general manager Anne Newman said the decision was "disappointing, but understandable".</p>
        
            <p>The park had been "hugely excited" about hosting the international event, but fully supported the Crankworx team's decision, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Safety of participants and the public must come first.</p>
        
            <p>"We feel for the athletes from near and far who were preparing to attend the event but know that they, too, will appreciate the difficult but unavoidable decision that Crankworx has made."</p>
        
            <p>Staff at the park were "fully focussed" on preparing the park to reopen to the public as soon as possible, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once again, we thank the emergency responders for their tireless and ongoing work."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the park's chairperson Maurice Noone said the damage to the park was not as extensive as that from the 2017 fire.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] will likely see the park fully reopen with all current attractions within the next few months."</p>
        
            <p>The park was devastated by the 2017 fire and it took almost a year before it was able to open again.</p>
        
            <p>One person died in that fire and 11 homes were destroyed.</p>
