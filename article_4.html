            <p>The search for a swimmer missing from a Christchurch beach has been suspended for the night.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Southshore Spit soon after 3pm Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Sumner said its volunteers had been stood down and police would decide whether to resume the search in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions were challenging, with overcast weather, poor water visibility, and a swell up to 1.2 metres, it said.</p>

            <p>"The first Coastguard Sumner rescue vessel, Hamilton Jet Rescue, launched at 3:37pm, followed by Blue Arrow Rescue at 3:55pm. Their jetski, Bruce Dawn Rescue, was also actively involved in the search.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a total of 10 volunteers onboard the three rescue vessels that conducted a search offshore between Southshore Spit and Sumner Beach.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition to the teams on the water, five volunteers were working in incident management roles, coordinating search efforts and patterns in collaboration with local Police Search and Rescue (SAR)."</p>
        
            <p>The outgoing tide and wind-driven swell further complicated search efforts, the agency said.</p>
