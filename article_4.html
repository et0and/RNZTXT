            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation after a man was shot dead in Grey Lynn, Auckland last night.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said emergency service were called to Tuarangi Road at 6.49pm Thursday after reports of a gun being fired.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found with critical injuries and despite first aid being administered, he died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Three others were also seriously injured and remain at hospital where they are being treated for gunshot injuries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said the people involved knew each other and police did not believe there was a wider risk to the public.</p>
