            <p>The man accused of murdering Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao has been warned several times by the judge over the nature of his questions to a Crown witness.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao, 53, is representing himself in his High Court trial at Christchurch after sacking his defence counsel last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown is arguing that Cao murdered Bao on the day she vanished - 19 July, 2023 - after arranging to meet her at a home for sale in Hornby.</p>
        
            <p>As the trial entered a fourth week on Monday, police digital forensic analyst Joshua Locke resumed his evidence from Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Locke examined the cell phones of both Bao and the murder accused.</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination, Justice Lisa Preston warned Cao several times, about either the relevancy of his questions, repetition of previously asked questions and asking questions that were beyond the scope of the witness.</p>
        
            <p>Locke himself also quipped at the relevancy of questions relating to the procedures of the police investigation team.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know how this is relevant to the evidence I'm giving," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Preston took an early adjournment to discuss "a matter" in chambers.</p>
