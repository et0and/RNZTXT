            <p>A shallow 4.8 earthquake felt in Wellington Monday night hit the fault-riddled Cook Strait, GNS science says.</p>
        
            <p>Geonet says the short, sharp quake struck at 11.38pm and was centred 15 kilometres south-west of Wellington, at a depth of 13 kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>GNS science advisor Jon Ristau told Morning Report earthquakes of this size in Cook Strait are not unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"Cook Strait itself is riddled with faults that have been mapped by NIWA so earthquakes in this region are not uncommon at all."</p>
        
            <p>Ristau said he felt it in Upper Hutt, though it wasn't strong.</p>
        
            <p>"But I can imagine people in Wellington probably got a pretty good rattle."</p>
        
            <p>There was a 2.5 magnitude aftershock shortly after the initial quake and a few smaller aftershocks, he said.</p>
        
            <p>More than 17,000 reports were received from people who felt the shake, according to the GeoNet site.</p>
