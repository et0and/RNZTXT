            <p>Transpower says it has made progress raising a temporary tower in Northland, but it has been unable to fully finish the operation.</p>
        
            <p>A pylon fell near Glorit earlier this week, causing region-wide outages that impacted tens thousands of residents.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower's general manager of grid delivery, Mark Ryall, said crews had worked throughout Saturday on the new tower, which would restore one of two 220kV circuits to the region.</p>
        
            <p>However, they had been unable to complete the transfer of all the conductor wire to the tower before dark.</p>
        
            <p>"It is complex and challenging work and we have encountered delays that mean we weren't able to complete the work before it got dark and the weather deteriorated," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"To ensure the crews can complete the work safely the final works will be delayed until tomorrow morning."</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was in place for Northland, north of WhangƒÅrei, from midnight Saturday to midday Sunday and downpours were expected throughout the night.</p>
        
            <p>Ryall said crews were still on track to meet Transpower's Sunday deadline.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank Northland communities for their continued patience. I know it makes a big difference to our crews putting in the hard work on the ground."</p>
        
            <p>There was sufficient electricity supply to meet Northland's weekend demands through existing 110kV circuits while the 220kV circuit was restored, he said.</p>
