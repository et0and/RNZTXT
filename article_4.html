            <p>The victim of a recent hit-and-run in Wellington lay seriously injured in the middle of a dark road for up to an hour, before being found by a rideshare driver.</p>
        
            <p>The man was crossing Old Porirua Road near his home in Ngaio, sometime between 4.45am and 5.45am on Sunday 21 April when he was hit, says Detective Rosanne Rix from the Wellington serious crash investigation unit.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver failed to stop or call for help, leaving the man lying in the middle of a dark road," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A rideshare driver found the victim and managed to wake him.</p>
        
            <p>"While the driver offered to call an ambulance, the victim was unaware of how serious his injuries were and instead asked to be taken home.</p>
        
            <p>"He was later transported to hospital and spent several days being treated for his injuries."</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked the rideshare driver - or anyone who knows who he is - to contact them.</p>
        
            <p>"By stopping to help, the rideshare driver has prevented the victim from being struck by any other vehicles, but may also have information that helps us build a picture of what occurred," Rix said.</p>
        
            <p>Police also want to hear from anyone with information about the incident or footage.</p>
