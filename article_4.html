            <p>There have been 6636 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the past week, and seven further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as epidemiologist professor Michael Baker says New Zealand is at its highest peak for the virus in 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>There were 282 cases in hospital as of midnight on Sunday, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-day rolling average of cases was 948. Of the total new cases in the past week, 4338 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>Epidemiologist professor Michael Baker on Monday told RNZ's First Up one in three people were still contagious five days after testing positive.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the recommended isolation period now only being five days, Baker suggested people still getting a positive Covid-19 test wait to test again on day 6 or 7 before going back into society.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the ministry reported 6146 new cases of the virus and 19 further deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"The biology hasn't changed," Baker said, but there was more pressure for people to go back to work and school.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said he would like to see money in this week's Budget going towards the Covid-19 response.</p>
        
            <p>It was important for health and productivity that the government continued to fund booster shots, RAT tests and the anti-viral medication.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as people had to pay for these, low income households would miss out.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said it had to remain fair and equity had to be maintained.</p>
