            <p>Police have continued to enforce the law that bans the display of gang patches in public places in what they are referring to as Operation Nickel.</p>
        
            <p>The first arrest was made just three minutes after the the Gangs Act 2024 came into effect on Thursday, and 12 arrests were made on the first day alone.</p>
        
            <p>Gang members have warned that the ban may lead to violence, but police and government were adamant the ban would work and make people safer.</p>
        
            <p>In the last 24 hours, police have reported multiple new breaches of the law and made several arrests.</p>
        
            <p>Police conducting a road checkpoint on Mount Wellington Highway about 10pm on Friday noticed a passenger wearing a Head Hunters supporters sweatshirt.</p>
        
            <p>The man had no known gang links but the sweatshirt was seized and the man was bailed to appear in Auckland District Court on 28 November.</p>
        
            <p>Around 5.25pm on Friday, police in Whakatāne noticed a vehicle was missing its front bumper on Bridge Street.</p>
        
            <p>The driver was a 28-year-old member of Black Power and was allegedly wearing a Black Power cap, police reported.</p>
        
            <p>When they approached the man, he had changed his cap to a plain one.</p>
        
            <p>When police asked the man about the the original cap, he handed it over and was arrested.</p>
        
            <p>A further two people were taken into police custody in Eastern Bay of Plenty for displaying gang insignia: a 21-year-old Black Power member and a 52-year-old with gang associations, police reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested a patched Black Power member wearing a Nomads baseball cap in Cuba Mall about 12.45am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The 27-year-old was due in court on 28 November on a gang insignia charge, and on a charge of possessing instruments for methamphetamine use.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday morning, Hastings police saw a man walking along Southampton Street wearing a sweatshirt with a Mongrel Mob symbol.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old Mongrel Mob member was arrested and he was due to appear in court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before 9am in New Plymouth yesterday, a shoplifting report was made through retail crime prevention platform Auror, with the offender identifiable and wearing clothing with Black Power-related insignia.</p>
        
            <p>A search warrant was obtained, and the 51-year-old man was arrested inside a store in Waitara later that afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in court on 27 November, police reported.</p>
        
            <p>Also on Friday, a 35-year-old Mongrel Mob member was seen by police running north on High Street in Dannevirke wearing a Mongrel Mob shirt.</p>
        
            <p>He was due in court in Dannevirke on 27 November, police reported.</p>
        
            <p>Later on Friday in Marton, a woman was seen wearing gang clothing.</p>
        
            <p>Police established that she had just been released from prison and was wearing the same clothing she had worn going in.</p>
        
            <p>She was given a warning, police reported.</p>
