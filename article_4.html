        <h2>Empty Loafers Lodge building a 'stark' reminder of failure and tragedy</h2>
        <p>
Members of the community gathered quietly before dawn on Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of the Loafers Lodge blaze, which killed five men.

            <p>An empty, burnt-out building in central Wellington is a haunting and "unhelpful" reminder of a fatal fire that occurred there a year ago, a community leader says.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the community gathered quietly before dawn on Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of the Loafers Lodge blaze which killed five men.</p>
        
            <p>Liam Hockings, Kenneth Barnard, Peter Glenn O'Sullivan, Melvin Parun and Michael Wahrlich died - and nearly 100 others were made homeless - in the fire which occurred in the early hours of 16 May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Their families, other survivors, emergency responders, council representatives and Te Āti Awa and Taranaki Whanui members, gathered on the corner of Hutchinson Road and John Street - just metres away from the abandoned hostel - to unveil a memorial plaque and plant a kōwhai tree in remembrance of the victims.</p>

            <p>Wellington City Missioner Murray Edridge said the fire at the privately-owned building was a "catastrophe" he and many others could not forget each time they passed it.</p>
        
            <p>He said immediate decisions needed to be made about whether the four-storey accommodation block was demolished or renovated.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the wish of the community would be that the building is demolished, but others will make that decision," Edridge said.</p>
        
            <p>"It sits there as a stark reminder of what happened, without any of the hope or the belief that it can be better than it was.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think the reminder it creates in this community, is very unhelpful."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City mayor Tory Whanau agreed, saying she wanted to see the site demolished and replaced with affordable accommodation for the community.</p>
        
            <p>Edridge was disappointed that 12 months on, building standards had not been sufficiently upgraded.</p>
        
            <p>Loafers Lodge did not have a fire sprinkler system - it was not required to by law - and some residents reported difficulty evacuating that night.</p>
        
            <p>While the blaze prompted a Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment review of similar buildings, and Housing and Construction Minister Chris Penk today announced another review of fire safety regulations, Edridge said he was not satisfied progress had been made.</p>
        
            <p>"Inevitably fires will happen, but the ability of people to evacuate buildings, the ability to not suffer the loss that these families and these residents suffered, is really important," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The still autumnal setting for the memorial event was a jarring counterpoint to the chaos that occurred around the corner a year before.</p>

            <p>Former Loafers Lodge resident John Slade said he could not forget the fire - which had engulfed the top floor of the building shortly after he left for work at Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"I went to work and next minute I walked up to where the helipad is and I looked across and saw all the flames going everywhere, going all over the place."</p>
        
            <p>Slade said that night upended his life, as well as his partner's, Aroha Slade, leaving them without their possessions for many months.</p>
        
            <p>Aroha Slade was on the first floor of the building when she heard the alarms, but when she tried to get out of one door, she found it locked.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember the first bell going off - I didn't worry about that - but the second one I woke up and that's when I got up and helped everyone else out.</p>
        
            <p>"But I couldn't get out - they had locked the doors."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was pleased to attend the memorial event, but that it also brought back difficult memories.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sad - sad to come back, to see that our loved ones are gone."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington resident Andrew Barriball said he attended the service out of respect for those who struggle to find permanent accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>"When the system fails and there's not enough sprinklers, or there's not enough care and attention to fire [safety], people will lose their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that Loafers represents a commitment from the councils to not cut corners, to not be persuaded by building owners that they'll get it fixed next week, because next week never comes."</p>
