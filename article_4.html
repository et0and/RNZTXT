            <p>For seven years, Nyree Smith has lived with deadly pancreatic cancer. Her goal now isn't her own survival, but to save others.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the stats, Nyree Smith should be dead.</p>
        
            <p>But for seven years, she's beaten the odds.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know why I am still here... I question, why isn't someone studying me," she says.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to be studied. If I could help... if there is something I could do that would help someone else, of course I would want to be studied. In fact, I shouldn't really say this, but I have offered my oncologist my tumours after I die - take them, study them - I have had scans since before I was diagnosed so they can manifest a study of how my cancer has developed."</p>
        
            <p>But will specialists take her up on the offer?</p>
        
            <p>"No, don't have the money. But Australia want them."</p>
        
            <p>Smith was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer seven years ago, in September 2017. She had no symptoms, just a new "pushy doctor", who insisted on her getting a full checkup.</p>
        
            <p>Her cancer is normally among the deadliest - from diagnosis to death is four to nine months, on average.</p>
        
            <p>But Smith is, somehow, defying those odds.</p>
        
            <p>She is in stage four, meaning it is terminal, but she is still full of life and on a relentless mission.</p>
        
            <p>"If I can save one life, if I can get one person with a stomach ache to go to their GP and go 'I need further tests please' and we save a life, then I have survived this long for a reason ... because I can't work out why, I can't work out why I am still here."</p>
        
            <p>On average, 15 New Zealanders are diagnosed with a gut cancer every day - that's nearly 6000 every year.</p>
        
            <p>There are seven gut cancers, and pancreatic is one of the deadliest.</p>
        
            <p>Awareness and early detection are crucial. And that's what this month - Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month - is all about.</p>
        
            <p>"My legacy is saving a life, getting more awareness out there... actually, I'm not doing this for a legacy... I'm doing it for now, for the moment, to get it out there. I don't want to bang on about it but if I can help someone be their own advocate when they go to their GP, and it saves them from going through what I'm going through ... then that's my legacy."</p>
        
            <p>To raise funds and more awareness, Smith has helped organise The Enchanting Hidden Gems Matakana Garden Tour on 21 November. Tickets are limited but still available.</p>
