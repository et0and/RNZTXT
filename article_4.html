            <p>Commuters faced frustration on Monday morning as Auckland Transport reminds people returning to work after their Christmas break that buses are replacing trains.</p>
        
            <p>It said the rail network was closed this month for what it described as critical upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>Buses are replacing trains while KiwiRail upgrades more than 110 sites to prepare for the City Rail Link.</p>
        
            <p>Express bus services are replacing rail on the Eastern, Southern and Western Lines.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport director, public transport and active modes Stacey van der Putten said the agency acknowledged that having the rail network closed was frustrating, but the work needed to be done.</p>
        
            <p>"When City Rail Link opens in 2026 people across Auckland will benefit, with more frequent trains that are more reliable, easier connections across the city and big cuts in journey times."</p>
        
            <p>She said most train services would resume on January 28, with all services back by February 3 - including electric trains running for the first time from the upgraded Pukekohe Station.</p>
        
            <p>"KiwiRail is getting a huge amount of work done while there are less people needing to travel for school and work," van der Putten said.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers on the roads in the Onehunga and Penrose areas could also expect delays, with more trucks on the road carrying freight that would normally be on trains to and from the Southdown freight hub.</p>
        
            <p>To minimise congestion, the rail freight trucks were following designated routes and traffic would be actively managed by the Auckland Transport Operation Centre, including traffic light priority for trucks to keep traffic flowing. </p>
        
            <p>Some commuters waiting for the replacement buses on lower Queen Street expressed their frustration, but others said they understood the need for upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>"It's inconvenient, but I can appreciate they're trying to make improvements... So hopefully it'll be better in the long term," Auckland worker Miranda said.</p>
        
            <p>"It does take slightly longer to get to work, [so] hopefully it isn't longer than a month."</p>
        
            <p>The next multi-week closure was set to coincide with Easter, running between the 12-27 April.</p>
        
            <p>Another commuter, Harry, said he had to adjust his schedule to make up for the longer bus trip.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely have to leave earlier from home just to get to work on time, wake up a bit earlier," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean it's an inconvenience, but it'll go by quite quickly... hopefully."</p>
