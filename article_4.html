            <p>Christchurch's mayor has taken it upon himself to shift an abandoned double trailer unit following months of inaction by his council.</p>
        
            <p>The Press reported Aranui residents had complained to the council 20 times about the now graffitied trailer blocking views from their homes for eight months.</p>
        
            <p>"I just hate it. Every morning when you come out of the house it's right in your face - it's absolutely massive," local man Paul Gallagher told the paper.</p>
        
            <p>In a video post to social media on Saturday, Phil Mauger was seen hooking the unit to a truck before towing it down Cuthberts Road, out of sight of neighbouring residents.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger said he took action after nothing was done.</p>
        
            <p>"I read in the paper this morning that residents on Cuthberts Road have had to put up with this trailer blocking their view for eight months," he wrote on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought bugger that, so borrowed a truck and have popped out there today and moved it down the road away from homes. I'll leave it to staff to deal with it now."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City Council has been approached for comment. A spokesperson told The Press it was a "fairly complex" matter the parking compliance team was looking after.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger's family has owned building and transport company Maugers Contracting in Christchurch since 1970.</p>
        
            <p>He stepped aside as director a year before he became mayor.</p>
