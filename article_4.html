            <p>Strong winds and a dry winter have resulted in 17 fires in 15 days in the Otago region, Fire and Emergency says.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters had been battling a scrub fire in Waitaki since Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Incident Commander Bobby Lamont told Morning Report there might be a few hot spots but it was largely under control.</p>
        
            <p>"We're pretty confident with the work that we've done over the last 48 hours, we're pretty comfortable to have everything contained."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency would do a final walk over Monday before leaving the site, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said there had been 17 fires in the region in the last 15 days.</p>
        
            <p>That was down to a number of factors including strong winds, little rain, and the high flammability of grasses and scrub that were "frost cured" - dried out over a dry winter.</p>
        
            <p>Those things were normal at this time of year, but the winds were starting earlier than normal, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In springtime we do tend to see these things anyway and it catches people out."</p>
        
            <p>People planning controlled burns should check the long range forecast, especially the wind, and the checkitsalright.nz website had more information, Lamont said.</p>
