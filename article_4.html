            <p>Dunedin residents are being warned to take care when handling sandbags as the city begins the recovery process after destructive floods last week.</p>
        
            <p>Nine homes were red-stickered after the city was pounded with more than two months' worth of rain in less than two days.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Council said sandbags could either be returned to the collection points, or left on the kerb for teams to collect over the week.</p>
        
            <p>People should wear gloves while handling them, not tip out the sand and treat as contaminated material, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Council teams would also be working to catch up on kerbside rubbish collection during the week.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty local roads remain closed across Dunedin, but State Highway 88 to Port Chalmers had reopened on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In the Clutha District, the Coast Road was closed to Toko Mouth due to the serious risk of further slips as it was deemed extremely unstable.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Dunedin City Council has asked the West Harbour community and the Otago Peninsula, from Rotary Park to Portobello, to voluntarily conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>Water restrictions are also in place for Outram and Waikouaiti including Karitane and Hawksbury.</p>
        
            <p>A precautionary boil water notice now covers West Harbour from Ravensbourne to Deborah Bay, but excluding St Leonards.</p>
        
            <p>Resident who need fresh water can collect them it tankers in Roseneath, Sawyers Bay Presbyterian Church car park and Port Chalmers Back Beach car park.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, people covered by the Richardson South Rural Water Scheme and Kaka Point are being asked to urgently conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>A conserve water notice has also been put in place for the Glenkenich Rural Water Scheme and the Waikaka township.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in Stirling and Benhar Townships and the South Bruce Rural Water Scheme (including Cherry Lane) are also under a boil and conserve water notice.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone using water from their tap for consumption (including teeth cleaning and washing fruit and vegetables) should boil it for one minute before it is used.</p>
