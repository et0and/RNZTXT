            <p>Two men have been arrested after reports of an assault at a motel in the suburb of Greenlane in Auckland on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police with dogs descended on the Abelia Inn in Green Lane West around 11am.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they were called after it was reported a man had been assaulted.</p>
        
            <p>Two men were arrested and police were considering charges against them.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured during the incident.</p>
        
            <p>About a dozen armed police officers were outside the motel, a worker at a neighbouring motor lodge told RNZ.</p>

            <p>The worker said police had told them it was not safe to be outside and to stay indoors.</p>
        
            <p>A man working at another nearby business, said he couldn't see the inn from his office, but noted there were "often" police turning up there.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not surprising to me - it's used as emergency housing and there's often issues," he said.</p>
