            <p>Police say a woman reported missing in Christchurch is safe and officers no longer have concerns for her welfare.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Wednesday said they had serious concerns for Ping Lyu, 41, who was last seen in Stewart Street near the inner-city on Saturday 25 May.</p>
        
            <p>She was visiting from China, had no known relatives in New Zealand and did not speak English.</p>
        
            <p>Police set up a blue specialist search group tent in the front yard of an apartment in the street on Wednesday morning, where two officers stood guard.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, police said Ping Lyu had been located.</p>
        
            <p>"Christchurch police have received information regarding the whereabouts of a woman visiting New Zealand from China, who we appealed for sightings of yesterday," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of the information received, police have established the woman is safe and there are no longer concerns for her welfare.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank all those who contacted us as a result of our appeal for information."</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday police said their main concern was that no-one had seen or heard from Lyu since Saturday afternoon and it was possible she was travelling independently around the country.</p>
