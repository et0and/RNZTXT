            <p>Two men, both 21, have been arrested for fleeing police on Pioneer Highway in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>One of the men was already on the police radar with a warrant for his arrest, Inspector Ashley Gurney said.</p>
        
            <p>He was spotted in a car on Pioneer Highway about 2.30pm, but the driver continued on despite police attempts to stop them.</p>
        
            <p>About 10 minutes later, the car hit a pedestrian on Pitt Street and drove towards Tremaine Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily the pedestrian was not seriously injured. A police unit stopped and attended to the person, and remaining units followed to Tremaine Avenue," Gurney said.</p>
        
            <p>Spikes were then deployed on Seddon Street and Tremaine Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>One man was arrested when the car finally halted at Amberley Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>The other man was found at a property on Clarke Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>Police were considering charges for both men.</p>
        
            <p>"Fleeing driver events are volatile, unpredictable, and high risk to everyone involved," Gurney said.</p>
