            <p>A 50-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a 51-year-old who died after being found seriously injured on the side of a Northland highway.</p>
        
            <p>Police recently launched the homicide investigation into the death of the man in Waimamaku on 1 August.</p>
        
            <p>He was found seriously injured on the side of State Highway 12 and died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>That same day, police said officers secured a nearby property and seized a vehicle believed to be involved in the homicide.</p>
        
            <p>That vehicle is a 2024 white double cab Toyota Hilux with a large black bull sar on the front and flat deck on the back.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Natalie Syddall said police were working hard to piece together the events leading up to the man's death.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were speaking with a person of interest early on, who we have since charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not seeking anyone else in relation to this matter and would like to reassure the community that this appears to be an isolated incident."</p>
        
            <p>Police still wanted to hear from anyone who was travelling on the highway on 1 August between 7.45am and 8.45am.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists who have dashcam footage are also sought.</p>
        
            <p>Pople wanting to contact police about the investigation should reference 'Operation Number' or file number 240801/3234.</p>
        
            <p>The 50-year-old was scheduled to appear in Kaikohe District Court on Friday, charged with murder and failing to carry out obligations in relation to a computer search.</p>
