            <p>More than 2000 volunteers have spent the day packing 31,000 boxes to go to families in need this Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>The small community initiative, Christmas Box, began in 2001 and see thousands of boxes full of food delivered in time for 25 December.</p>
        
            <p>Olivia Huang is a solo mother who will be benefiting from the initiative, only just affording to put food on the table for her and her 8-year-old son.</p>
        
            <p>Huang said: "We drive past McDonald's to go home every day from school and my son asks me if we can go there, because his friends have McDonald's parties there. I don't know how to explain that if we do, we won't be able to eat the next day. Sometimes I buy him a cheeseburger and go without food.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm so grateful for New Zealanders helping me in my time of need. I'm just shocked and lost for words that people who don't know us would reach out their hands to us."</p>
        
            <p>
The boxes contain about 20 items of food - including staples and treats.

            <p>At the Auckland packing location on Saturday morning, volunteer and organise Tu Edwards told the 700-strong crows to "pack out each box with aroha - as if it was being packed for your own family".</p>
        
            <p>Christmas Box spokesperson Rebecca So'e said hardship statistics had become worse across New Zealand and one in five children were living in "food scarcity".</p>
        
            <p>"We know a lot of families are dreading an empty table and feelings of failure as a parent this Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"Donating a Christmas Box not only means a family has a meal to look forward to, it removes a lot of stress and worry and tells that family that someone sees them and cares about them. We see so many families break into tears when they receive a Christmas Box and see someone cares about them."</p>
        
            <p>
The boxes will be sent out up until Christmas.

            <p>So'e said Life Community could not do it alone. She was calling for Kiwis to donate $40 towards a Christmas Box to help families in need.</p>
        
            <p>"None of us can meet this need on our own, but together we can bring help and hope to families in need this Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>All boxes are able to cater for up to six people and contain about 20 items of food - including staples and some treats.</p>
