            <p>One person has died and another is seriously injured after a crash south of New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>Police say two vehicles - which RNZ understands were both trucks - collided on Egmont Road in Hillsborough just after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>One person died while being taken to hospital, and another has serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Egmont Road is closed while the serious crash unit examines the scene.</p>
