            <p>About 60 people are combing Canterbury's Greenpark area as they follow new leads in the search for real estate agent Yanfei Bao.</p>
        
            <p>Bao has been missing since 19 July last year, and despite extensive searches of Christchurch and surrounding areas over the past 12 months, the 44-year-old's body has never been found.</p>
        
            <p>A 53-year-old Chinese national, Tingjun Cao, has been accused of her kidnapping and murder, with a trial date scheduled for October.</p>
        
            <p>The search on Tuesday involves more than 60 people and is centred around land near the intersection of Hudson Road and Clarks Road.</p>

            <p>The farmland has been previously searched, but recent information team prompted the investigation team to return to the location.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene of the search said they could see more than a dozen police cars and a van.</p>
        
            <p>In the distance, a couple of police officers could be seen working along a row of macrocarpa trees. One of them had a rake.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said police were continuing to act on leads and information received, and initiate search activity accordingly.</p>
