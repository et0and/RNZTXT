            <p>The person accused of murdering a man whose body was found in a burnt out car in Hastings in March can now be named as Chalton Mason Lawson.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Te Tini Reweti's body was found in the car in Flaxmere on 26 March.</p>
        
            <p>Lawson was charged with murder and wilful damage later that week, and was granted interim name suppression, which has since lapsed.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old is due to appear at the High Court in Napier on 21 June.</p>
        
            <p>The police have not said how Reweti died but described the act as "abhorrent".</p>
        
            <p>They are continuing their investigation, and want to speak to the occupants of a light coloured vehicle seen on Stock Road and Irongate Road, in Flaxmere between 7.30pm and 9pm on 26 March.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe they may have seen the vehicle Patrick was found in," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>A death notice posted by Reweti's family described him as a humble soul, and a devoted father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, and friend to many.</p>
        
            <p>He was laid to rest at Poupatatē Marae in Manawatū.</p>
