Fire and Emergency crews have been at the scene on Thursday dampening down hot spots.

            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has visited the Port Hills fireground in Canterbury as crews work on dampening hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Incident Commander Dave Key said crews put in a big effort this week to eliminate most of the hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>The state of emergency, which was in place since the wildfire tore through hundreds of hectares of forest and scrub last week, was lifted on Wednesday.</p>
