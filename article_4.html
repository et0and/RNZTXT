            <p>Another two people have been arrested on Friday in relation to an aggravated burglary at a Michael Hill jewellery store in Whakatﾄ］e on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Four people fled the scene in a vehicle yesterday following the burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Police spiked the vehicle they were travelling in, which stopped on Stanley Road after a pursuit.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested at the scene, while the two other men in the vehicle, aged 21 and 22, fled on foot into steep bush.</p>
        
            <p>Eastern Bay of Plenty Area Commander Inspector Nicky Cooney said because of the dangerous location and concerns for the men's safety, a large-scale search was launched, involving officers, a dog unit and Search and Rescue teams.</p>
        
            <p>The police Eagle helicopter which has an an infrared camera, night vision equipment and a spotlight, also flew to the search area from Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the significant search effort, the pair weren't located," Inspector Cooney said.</p>
        
            <p>However, just before 8am today, when a person called police to report two men walking through a paddock off State Highway 2 in Taneatua.</p>
        
            <p>"As police arrived, the men again fled on foot into bush.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite them crossing a river, a police dog unit tracked their scent and led officers to where the men were hiding."</p>
        
            <p>One of the men was treated at the scene for a dog bite.</p>
        
            <p>Police have since charged all four men with aggravated burglary, Cooney said.</p>
        
            <p>They appeared in the Whakatﾄ］e District Court this morning and were remanded in custody to reappear on 22 May.</p>
        
            <p>"The public have played a significant role in this successful result, and we want to extend our appreciation to members of the community for their assistance and the information they provided," Cooney said.</p>
        
            <p>She said staff at Michael Hill were being offered support.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was the latest in a string of burglaries and robberies targeting the jewellery chain.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, a group of five thieves made off with jewellery from Michael Hill in a brazen smash and grab attack at Auckland's NorthWest Shopping Centre.</p>
        
            <p>In January, a young person was arrested after an armed robbery at the Michael Hill store in Silverdale Mall on the Hibiscus Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Just a day before the Silverdale incident, Bayfair Shopping Centre in Tauranga had been evacuated after a robbery at the Michael Hill store there. Police said a fog cannon went off and the offenders fled the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"I am also proud of the efforts of our police staff, who swiftly detained two suspects, and embarked on a search for two more people in hazardous bushland.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this was an unsettling and distressing incident, but this incident shows the lengths we will go to protect our community."</p>
        
            <p>Police would still like to hear from anybody who witnessed the incident or may have video footage from the incident.</p>
        
            <p>They can be contacted on 105, or online, using "Update Report".</p>
        
            <p>The file number is 240502/9091.</p>
