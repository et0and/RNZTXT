            <p>The body of a five-year-old boy missing near Gisborne has been found in a farm pond near his home.</p>
        
            <p>Khyzah went missing from his home in the rural Hangaroa district of Gisborne and had not been seen since about 2pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Specialist search teams, rescue dogs, a helicopter and up to 300 people from the area were involved in searching for him.</p>
        
            <p>The pond was about 100 metres from his house.</p>
        
            <p>The police dive squad spent about an hour searching before he was found.</p>

            <p>His family were sobbing and keening as they walked his body across a paddock after he was found.</p>
        
            <p>Khyzah's father yelled out "I've lost my f***ing son" as he nearly fell, but he was held up by whānau.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of people surrounded the grieving family as they lifted Khyzah's stretcher up and carried him down the driveway to his home.</p>
        
            <p>The family have requested privacy to mourn.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, RNZ reporter Alexa Cook told Checkpoint the area where Khyzah went missing was a "really rough part of the country".</p>
        
            <p>"It's beautiful but it is steep, it's gnarly, there's lots of big high hills, low gullies, lots of ponds and rivers and waterways that can all be pretty treacherous for a little five-year-old autistic boy," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said people from Wairoa, Gisborne and even a busload of people from Tolaga Bay had turned up for the search on Monday.</p>

            <p>Tai Rāwhiti area commander Inspector Darren Paki said it was a sad end to a huge search effort.</p>
        
            <p>"This is obviously not the outcome we, the searchers, and the community were hoping for," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to thank everyone in the community who has contributed to this effort, whether it was actively searching, or simply providing kai and kind words.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a wonderful tight-knit community here and we see the best of it in situations like this."</p>
        
            <p>Paki said Khyzah's whānau would be offered appropriate support as they came to terms with what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Khyzah's death will be referred to the coroner, he said.</p>
