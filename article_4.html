        <h2>Watch: Arthur Easton's family speak for first time in public plea</h2>
        <p>
Easton's children are appealing for justice for their father whose murder "sucked a lot of joy out of our lives".

            <p>Arthur Easton's children are appealing for justice for their father whose murder four decades ago "sucked a lot of joy out of our lives".</p>
        
            <p>Easton's death in 1985 lead to the wrongful conviction of Alan Hall, whose conviction was overturned in 2022. Three people charged with perverting the course of justice during Hall's case will go on trial in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>In October, police announced a $100,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and successful conviction of the person responsible for his death, as part of the reinvestigation into the case.</p>
        
            <p>In the family's first public statement, Easton's son Patrick said the family knew there were people who had knowledge that could help.</p>
        
            <p>"We are here to ask for help, and to get justice for our father," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He taught us to always do the right thing and he would have loved to see and be part of the lives of his eight grandchildren and soon to be five great grandchildren."</p>
        
            <p>His father's death had "sucked a lot of joy out of our lives", he said.</p>

            <p>Arthur Easton was one of six children who grew up in Waitara, Taranaki before a career in telecommunications led him to Auckland with his wife and five children.</p>
        
            <p>His daughter Marie described her father as a "good man with a great smile and sparkling blue eyes".</p>
        
            <p>"He was a good father and worked hard to provide what we needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Fun was based around the simple things in life - going to the beach, barbecues, family and good friends," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad was always interested in what we were doing and what was happening in our lives - he was always there to talk to."</p>
        
            <p>It would be a relief to see the person responsible for her father's death found.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think we will ever fully recover from this but knowing who did this would hopefully give us some answers and some closure.</p>
        
            <p>"Please do the right thing and come forward."</p>

            <p>Detective Inspector Warrick Adkin of Counties Manukau CIB, said police had received more than 20 calls and emails with information since the reward was announced.</p>
        
            <p>The reward would remain in place until 24 January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not too late to come forward. Our team is committed to finding the person responsible and holding them to account, so we can provide the Easton family the answers they deserve."</p>
