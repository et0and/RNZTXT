            <p>Lorde is known to release music on solstice and this year is no different.</p>
        
            <p>On this winter solstice (summer solstice for the US), Charli XCX has announced a 'Girl, so confusing' remix with the New Zealand artist.</p>
        
            <p>Lorde teased a snippet of the track on her Instagram story earlier today.</p>
        
            <p>In it, she sings: "Well honestly I was speechless / when I woke up to your voice note / You told me how you've been feeling / Let's work it out on the remix."</p>
        
            <p>Fans have been anticipating a collaboration between the two artists for years.</p>
        
            <p>"Charli XCX and Lorde finally doing a song together is like the second coming of Christ for gay people," one X user wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"GIRL SO CONFUSING FT LORDE CHANGED MY LIFE THANK YOU MOTHER," another wrote.</p>
        
            <p>Charli XCX has previously spoken about Lorde inspiring the original song, saying she was "super jealous" of Lorde's success when she was younger.</p>
        
            <p>"She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick. You create these parallels and think, 'Well, that could have been me.' But it couldn't have because we're completely different people."</p>
        
            <p>Fans have noticed the similarities and will often greet the artists with a running gag - deliberately mistaking Charli for Lorde and vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>In the remix, both Charli and Lorde go verse for verse on feeling insecure about their girlhood - from being scared to feature in pictures to yearning for female friendships while being simultaneously threatened by it.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, the 360 singer released her sixth studio album Brat, which Lorde praised, writing, "There is NO ONE like this bitch."</p>
        
            <p>The Girl, so confusing remix marks a trend of Lorde announcing music on solstice - her last album Solar Power was announced on summer solstice of 2021. A year later on the same date, she released the music video for The Path.</p>
