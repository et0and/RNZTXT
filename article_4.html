            <p>Wellington City Council is closing its temporary Arapaki Library and Service Centre on Manners Street from September 27.</p>
        
            <p>The council's Chief Operating Officer James Roberts said the closure is the result of a cost-cutting decision made during the recent 2024-2034 Long-term Plan deliberations.</p>
        
            <p>Temporary library services will continue at the Te Awe site on Brandon Street, but tasks such as paying rates, parking fines or dog registration will have to be done online.</p>
        
            <p>Cash payments for rates and water, encroachments and public health invoices, as well as parking infringements, can also be made at selected NZ Post outlets. </p>
        
            <p>"For people looking for a warm space and somewhere to go, we are working with our facilities and on-the-ground staff in this area. Te Pokapū Hapori community space and Te Wāhi Āwhina further down on Manners St are two nearby options," Roberts said.</p>
        
            <p>Library items on loan from Arapaki after it closed could be returned to other Wellington City Libraries branches.</p>
