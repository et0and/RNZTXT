        <h2>Why a New Zealand nut butter has been launched into outer space</h2>
        <p>
The New Zealand nut butter has been launched into space on a recent six-month mission after NASA asked the company to create a space rocket-approved product last year. Audio

            <p>One Wellington peanut butter company has gone where no Kiwi food company has gone before.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, nut butter brand Fix & Fogg was approached by NASA with a request to create a space rocket-approved product.</p>
        
            <p>After months of working with the space agency to find the perfect delivery and storage pouch, Fix and Fogg's nut butter was launched into space on a recent six-month mission.</p>
        
            <p>Fix & Fogg co-founder and chief executive Roman Jewell told Nights it was not something they thought would ever happen in "our wildest dreams".</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something we were looking for, I wouldn't even know how to go about contacting NASA and connecting with them on this sort of level but this is a really organic, natural tale," he said.</p>
        
            <p>As it happened, a fan of Fix & Fogg in New Zealand was sending jars overseas to friends and family, one of whom was an American astronaut.</p>
        
            <p>"This astronaut, as we've been told, fell in love with the product and it became a part of their daily routine," said Jewell.</p>
        
            <p>"[They] then got selected to go onto a mission up to the International Space Station and that's when NASA got in touch asking if we could supply the crew for that mission."</p>
        
            <p>Jewell explained that astronauts were away for six months which was a really long time.</p>
        
            <p>There are more than 200 different food items that are flown up to the station for each mission and within that there is leeway to include a few personal items.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important for morale, for mental well-being. There's only a few other people up there with them so if you can get those little nice moments up there, where food can be one of them, it's a really nice thing for them."</p>
        
            <p>It was a "massive privilege" and "mind-blowing" to be included in the astronaut's comfort food preferences, said Jewell.</p>
        
            <p>But sending a food product into space definitely had its hurdles.</p>
        
            <p>The whole process of creating a space-worthy version of Fix & Fogg's nut butter took about six to seven months, said Jewell.</p>
        
            <p>He said initially they had no idea whether they could deliver what NASA wanted or anything about the requirements for sending products up to space.</p>
        
            <p>"We jumped through all the wrong hoops first," he joked.</p>
        
            <p>"I naively thought that we could just send NASA our product and they would look after it ... so I sent them glass jars because that's what we have."</p>
        
            <p>"We got a pretty stern no on that one."</p>
        
            <p>NASA wanted to prevent risk of breakage as much as possible and sharp bits of glass in zero gravity was far from ideal, said Jewell.</p>
        
            <p>In the end, Fix & Fogg settled on a 275g soft and lightweight plastic pouch with an extra wide nozzle.</p>
        
            <p>Jewell hoped they would be able to continue working with NASA in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"We've built the relationship with the [NASA] food lab, they've tested, they've vetted our product ... and made the launch.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to think we've proven ourselves and that we can be trusted to work with again.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the feedback from the crew was good and that they enjoyed the experience of having the nut butter in space.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to think maybe NASA's eyes have been opened a bit wider and they'll look down this part of the world more for food."</p>
