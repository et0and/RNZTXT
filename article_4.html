            <p>A budding photographer and stargazer gave up on sleep in favour of a stunning Aurora Australis.</p>
        
            <p>While most of us were tucked up, the Southern Lights put on a show across the south coast of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Harrington-Lines parked up in Island Bay and was surprised at just how good it was.</p>
        
            <p>"I got an alert from the Glendale app, which is a really good app for anyone who's keen on aurora-hunting. I got there at about 9pm and it said there was an orange alert, which is always a good sign.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was at 9pm and I got to Island Bay probably around 10pm, and then at about 10.45pm it really kicked off."</p>

            <p>He set up his camera looking south, and knew he was going to get something right away.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't expecting anything amazing. It's like, the fourth time or fifth time I've captured auroras on camera, but [these are] definitely my favourite photos."</p>
        
            <p>Harrington-Lines, relatively new to space photography, said he missed out on the May aurora because of cloud cover.</p>
        
            <p>There were reports this one could be seen as far north as Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really clear. There was probably at about 12 o'clock a little bit of low cloud on the horizon kind of going across, but that looked really cool in the photosâ€¦ this was definitely the biggest I've seen."</p>
        
            <p>Usually, particles from solar flares bounce off the Earth's magnetic field, but when there is a severe eruption, they can penetrate the ionosphere and interact with gases around the magnetic poles - causing the ribbons of colour.</p>

            <p>Spaceweather.com said Sunday's geomagnetic storm was level G3 (out of a maximum G5).</p>
        
            <p>He was not keen to out again Monday night to get some more snaps after being out until 3am, staring up into space.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if I'm up for another late night."</p>
