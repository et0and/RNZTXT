        <h2>An alternative approach to berm plantings</h2>
        <p>
Most councils in Perth encourage residents to plant their grass verges - in contrast to New Plymouth where a woman faces a $1000 fine.

            <p>Allowing homeowners to plant berm gardens improves social cohesion and brings communities together, according to an Australian researcher.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth woman Alana Brough faces a $1000 fine with an additional $50 added every day if she doesn't remove a fruit and vegetable garden she planted in her berm.</p>

            <p>But a senior lecturer at the University of Western Australia's school of agriculture and environment, Natasha Pauli, said research she had done over almost a decade showed improved community well-being was "an accidental consequence" of allowing "verge gardens" as they were called in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"So the research that we've looked at is predominantly around low growing vegetation. So typically that's 70 centimetres and below and almost all of our local governments here in Perth - 30 out of 31 - actually allow residents to plant low growing vegetation on the verge in accordance with the local guidelines.</p>
        
            <p>"There are also a number of incentive programmes as well, where people can apply for funding to get plants to put on their front verge."</p>

            <p>Dr Pauli, an environmental geographer who studied human interaction with the environment, said biodiversity loss and climate change were behind the desire to plant out verges in Western Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"So, there's a bit of a drive to replace the traditional verge coverings which quite often is grass here, which you can maintain as a low water use vegetation type as well, but there's a drive to replace that with locally growing endemic and indigenous plants.</p>
        
            <p>"There's less emphasis on vegetables and fruits growing on the front verge, but it's really about having those locally grown plants that are specific to the area that could even potentially forge some ecological connectivity between them and remnant vegetation."</p>

            <p>Dr Pauli said there was an interesting correlation between planting out a berm and social interaction.</p>
        
            <p>"So, what our researchers found is that when one person starts planting out their verge then their neighbour will quite often come over and say, 'Oh what are you doing? That looks really interesting' and start thinking 'Is there something I could go away and do as well?'"</p>
        
            <p>Planted out verges were still quite rare with between 5 and 10 percent of berms planted out in the Perth area.</p>
        
            <p>"But they do tend to cluster, so you'll have streets where there's a higher than average percentage of verge gardens. And that's primarily because of a phenomenon that we like to call social contagion, which sounds a bit strange, but people will actually come over and get ideas from other people and then take that away and do that on their front verge as well."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Pauli said the increased social interaction was a by-product of the ecological and aesthetic goals.</p>
        
            <p>"Being out in that public space gives people permission to go and talk to someone because they're out in public. So now you can talk to them. They're not just in their private garden anymore."</p>
        
            <p>As well as the community well-being benefit there was a boost to local fauna and flora and an educational aspect to verge planting.</p>
        
            <p>"There's primarily a very important educational benefit, particularly here in Perth because people are responding to local climatic variables and local biodiversity variables, so that educational component is around changing perceptions of what can be considered to be a normal sort of garden for this region."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Pauli said there was not enough data yet to say how much water was saved by planting out verges or the benefit for local wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>"So there's definitely some social benefits, there's some educational benefits and there's likely environmental benefits as well. But those are a little bit more difficult to quantify."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an organisation that supported community gardens and sustainable backyard projects was backing Alana Brough and her planted berm in New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>Sustainable Taranaki's Jenni Hammond said as long as they were well maintained berm gardens should be supported.</p>
        
            <p>"If they are prepared to plant up a berm with something that would provide local residents food, provide opportunities for community engagement and interactions with your neighbours then I think that berm gardens are an awesome opportunity for additional food sovereignty in your area."</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Hammond said at the very least the New Plymouth District should be open to a discussion about changing its policy on berm gardens.</p>
        
            <p>"That could involve community consultation, working in with your neighbours or a commitment to keeping it maintained and a wider discussion about what that looks like."</p>
        
            <p>She could only see an upside.</p>
        
            <p>"A productive use of space is always a great thing and growing food in these times seems like a great idea. Reducing your supermarket bills and getting to know your neighbours and use your space productively."</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to Brough, New Plymouth District Council said the Local Government Act prohibited planting of any tree or shrub or the digging up of the berm in any way without its prior approval.</p>
        
            <p>"Roadside berms need to be kept clear of vegetation and other items, such as pavers, unless we've given prior approval as plants and trees can become overgrown and encroach over footpaths, roads and driveways," manager infrastructure Rui LeitƒÅo said.</p>
        
            <p>"This impacts public access and creates an issue for people with limited mobility. Access to underground utilities also needs to be maintained.</p>
        
            <p>"Unauthorised plantings or paving on road reserve can also create safety concerns in the neighbourhood and become a liability for council should the property change hands and/ or the plantings are no longer maintained."</p>
