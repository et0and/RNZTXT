            <p>The Beths have once again triumphed at the Aotearoa Music Awards.</p>
        
            <p>The indie-stars won two of the three awards they were nominated for, taking home best group and the award for best album with their third album Expert in a Dying Field.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time the band have won best album, after they won it in 2020 for their second album Jump Rope Gazers.</p>

            <p>Lead singer of The Beths Liz Stokes told Morning Report that winning the award for best group was a special award for the band.</p>
        
            <p>"I love working with these people and it means a lot to be called the best group," Stokes said.</p>
        
            <p>Stokes was also delighted to win best album in what she describes as a "golden age for New Zealand music".</p>
        
            <p>"There were 12 nominees for best album. There were truly no weak albums, there is something out there for everybody and there is a lot of good stuff being made."</p>

            <p>Stokes said the quality of New Zealand music at the moment could be attributed to a "unique perspective".</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe because of where it's situated in the world, it's taking in a lot of global stuff, but then using alchemy to make it into something that is really unique."</p>
        
            <p>The Beths are currently in Los Angeles working on new music, something Stokes said was overdue.</p>
        
            <p>"Our album (Expert in a Dying Field) actually came out in 2022, and so it's time to make a new album."</p>
        
            <p>Stokes said she was currently writing a lot of songs for the album but was unsure what the album would look like once it was finished.</p>
        
            <p>While the band may currently be in the US, plans for a New Zealand tour are in the works.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been too long since we played in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a spate of bad luck playing in Auckland in particular, because Laneway in 2023 got cancelled because of the big storm, and we were playing another festival in Auckland and that got cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>"We're well overdue and really looking forward to playing some shows in Aotearoa."</p>
