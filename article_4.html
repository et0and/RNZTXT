        <h2>Australian farmers to get fix for methane-laced cow burps before NZ</h2>

A solution to dairy cows' methane-laced burps could be ready to sell to NZ farmers next year, but Australian farmers will get it first. Audio

            <p>A solution to dairy cows' methane-laced burps could be ready to sell to NZ farmers next year, but Australian farmers will get it first.</p>
        
            <p>There is already a methane-cutting product on the market for feedlot cattle overseas, but grazing animals like those in New Zealand and Australia have proved slower to solve.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand company Ruminant Biotech has developed a small metal capsule or bolus, which delivers a potent methane-squashing medicine into an animal's gut.</p>
        
            <p>The substance inside the capsule can be found in a particular kind of seaweed, but the plan is to manufacture it in an industrial plant in New Zealand, instead of harvesting vast amounts of seaweed.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Tom Breen said a New Zealand trial showed a single dose reduced by three-quarters a cow's planet-heating methane emissions for 100 days.</p>
        
            <p>The process of inserting the bolus would be familiar to farmers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Think of a larger drench gun."</p>
        
            <p>Researchers are now trying to get the effect lasting six months.</p>
        
            <p>The company has not publicly published its results, but government-funded climate investor AgriZero was sufficiently impressed to chip in another $4 million, on top of the $1.8 million it invested last year.</p>
        
            <p>The company also received $7.8 million in research funding from the government's Climate Emergency Response Fund in 2022, and a smaller investment from the government-funded New Zealand Green Investment Fund.</p>
        
            <p>An upcoming study by the University of Sydney - looking at whether the treatment affects beef cattle's meat production - will be shared publicly, said Breen. He said the treatment was safe for animals.</p>
        
            <p>Breen said having produced good results in the New Zealand trial, the company planned to use the next six months to produce its first commercial product.</p>
        
            <p>"We've made substantial progress over the last three years."</p>
        
            <p>He said the goal was for it to be available in Australia in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Breen said the company is aiming to have a product ready for New Zealand farmers in 2027.</p>
        
            <p>He said the delay was because New Zealand regulations for methane inhibitors treated them like an animal medicine, and were very comprehensive, while Australia had very few restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>Investor AgriZero has asked the government to loosen up a little on regulating methane inhibitors, writing a submission to the Ministry for Primary Industries saying New Zealand risked being left behind in the race to make farming more climate friendly.</p>
        
            <p>But AgriZero's Ruth Leary said while there was room for streamlining, there were good reasons why New Zealand had more hurdles than Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Unlike New Zealand, they're not as export-reliant and we rely on our reputation as an exporter of safe agricultural products, our milk and our meat," she said.</p>
        
            <p>With no price on making methane emissions at the moment, there is no direct incentive from the government to use products like this in New Zealand to lower farming's emissions.</p>
        
            <p>Leary said companies such as Mars and Nestle were offering incentive payments for cleaner farming in their supply chains, but more incentives were needed to encourage farmers.</p>
        
            <p>It has been a long search for a slow-release methane inhibitor that works in grazing animals, with commercial products available overseas - such as 3-NOP or Bovaer - only working in feedlots. There, animals can be continuously fed a powder with their grain.</p>
        
            <p>Leary said AgriZero only invested in six of the more than 100 products assessed for cutting farming emissions. This was the only one delivering methane-cutting molecules with a bolus inside a grazing cow.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys are based in New Zealand, so they know our farming system well and they're the only inhibitor-type product we've seen that is developing a slow-release solution for the pasture-based farming system," said Leary.</p>
        
            <p>Other possible solutions being worked on include a methane vaccine, and a compound harvested from daffodils.</p>
