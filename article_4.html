            <p>Multiple fire crews have been battling a vegetation fire inland from Ōtaki Beach, on the Kāpiti Coast, on Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The smoke could be seen from several kilometres away.</p>
        
            <p>Some people were able to see it from as far away as Paraparaumu - a distance of 14km.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said in a statement it was alerted to the fire, behind the former Ōtaki Health Camp, just after 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire is burning slowly through very thick bracken and gorse and has burnt through approximately five hectares."</p>
        
            <p>Six rural crews were working to contain the fire and keep it away from homes, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point, smoke is blowing out to sea and at this stage Fire and Emergency has not evacuated anyone."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency asked people to stay away from the fire ground.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday a large workshop was destroyed in a fire in Swamp Road, on the other side of the Ōtaki River to this fire.</p>
