The government spent an additional $5.7 million on security in emergency departments for summer, after an increase in "violent incidents" at hospitals.

            <p>Emergency department doctors say some of extra security staff they have been given over summer are not properly trained.</p>
        
            <p>Hospital EDs got just under $6 million from the government before Christmas to hire 200 security guards until the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>The overcrowded waiting rooms have become increasingly unsafe as hospitals struggle to cope with high demand and frustrated patients and whānau.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand chair of the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine Dr Kate Allan said the extra security staff who were well trained had been a huge help in reducing violence and calming people down.</p>
        
            <p>But other doctors reported that their EDs did not receive any security leaving staff feeling unsafe and unsupported, she said.</p>
        
            <p>There were also EDs which reported that "some security staff did not seem to be appropriately trained, integrated or supported" which meant they had trouble responding effectively to security issues and communicating effectively with patients, whānau and visitors, Dr Allan said.</p>
