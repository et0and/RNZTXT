            <p>Fuel has been seen leaking from a boat that partially sunk while taking part in a Hawke's Bay fishing competition near the Port of Napier breakwater on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Booms were out on Saturday morning to absorb any potential diesel spill.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were rescued from the 10.5 metre long recreational boat while taking part in the MegaFish event, after their boat hit a submerged log.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured, but the boat was carrying 500 litres of diesel at the time of the collision.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel has been towed to port and was being lifted out by a 100 tonne crane, before being taken to a nearby sailing club at the owner's expense.</p>
        
            <p>One of the event's co-organisers Beck Christie said remnant debris from Cyclone Gabrielle has rarely been an issue over summer and this was the first incident they have had with debris since the competition began three days ago.</p>
        
            <p>"People have been fishing in the bay, all over summer, and it hasn't been an issue.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just one of those fluke things, it was a submerged log under the water, it wasn't floating so it would have been pretty hard to see.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just an accident, which is unfortunate."</p>
        
            <p>Christie said the affected family was part of the local fishing club and was being well-supported.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone's doing fine, the club came together really well and we worked with Coastguard New Zealand on that incident," she said.</p>
