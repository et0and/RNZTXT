        <h2>Firefighters warn South Islanders to postpone controlled burns</h2>
        <p>
Thursday and Friday are expected to be unseasonably warm with high winds, which increases the fire risks.

            <p>Firefighters are urging South Island residents to postpone controlled burns for the next few days due to a high wind forecast.</p>
        
            <p>A controlled burn became a wildfire on Monday near Canterbury's Lake Pukaki, growing to cover 50 hectares and resulting in overnight evacuations.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Mid-South Canterbury district manager Rob Hands said the forecast for Thursday and Friday was unseasonably warm with high winds.</p>
        
            <p>"Some parts of the plains will experience gale-force winds and high teens in temperatures across this time," Hands said.</p>
        
            <p>"While most of the Mid-South Canterbury District, as well as Canterbury and Nelson-Marlborough, are in an open fire season, FENZ urges anyone planning to burn on these days to put this off for another day."</p>
        
            <p>In Marlborough, the areas of most concern were Awatere, Ward and inland Molesworth due to the weather conditions and dryness in the area, Hands said.</p>
        
            <p>People in these areas were recommended to avoid burns from Thursday to Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Large parts of the South Island were very dry for this time of year, which created the perfect recipe for burns to get out of control, Hands said.</p>
        
            <p>"It does not take much for a burn to get out of control and put people in danger. There will be many better days to burn over the coming weeks."</p>
        
            <p>People who had already burned in the past few weeks should also be vigilant, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Please take extra care to monitor your burn piles during this time and take action as needed. We have seen in the past burns from previous weeks re-igniting during these kinds of weather conditions."</p>
