            <p>An Auckland mental health service is livening up its space with artwork by artists who have faced mental health challenges.</p>
        
            <p>The Kāinga Tiaki Centre launched an exhibition of 20 works in its Mount Eden clinic in collaboration</p>
        
            <p>with Toi Ora, an art therapy programme many of its service users (whaiora) work with.</p>
        
            <p>The exhibition's opening was attended by Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Paul Goldsmith.</p>

            <p>Olive, an Occupational Therapist at Kāinga Tiaki, said the project was inspired by a client they referred to Toi Ora, who wanted to show off their work.</p>
        
            <p>"They would come in here and look at our big blank walls and say 'we don't have enough room to exhibit our work - can we use your walls,' which I thought was fair enough.</p>
        
            <p>"I talked to them about a partnership ... where we can exhibit and sell Toi Ora artwork and give it a place to be seen."</p>
        
            <p>Olive said it had been empowering for their whaiora to celebrate the work of their peers and focus on the positive.</p>
        
            <p>"In a clinical environment, most of the focus is on treating illness.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to see expressions of recovery and that we are more than our illness, to me is a really important part of this initiative and having this work on the walls."</p>
        
            <p>Artist Ben Stewart's paintings were among the works included in the centre's first exhibition.</p>
        
            <p>He was honoured to have his artwork displayed in the clinic.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been a service user of Kāinga Tiaki since I was young and it was a beautiful full circle moment for me to be able to give back to something that has helped me so much throughout my life."</p>

            <p>Stewart said art and being a part of the Toi Ora community had been invaluable for his mental health.</p>
        
            <p>"It has given me a purpose to my life and a routine and a supportive environment that I can find structure in."</p>
        
            <p>Toi Ora Director Susanne Ritzenhoff said the opportunity had been uplifting for their artists and had brought more people to Toi Ora.</p>
        
            <p>"When people come into the space and see the difference art makes to the lives of the artists it's just incredible."</p>
        
            <p>"The art actually speaks for itself. It's not good because it's done by someone with mental health challenges, it's good because it's good."</p>

            <p>She hoped the initiative would soon be expanded into other clinical environments.</p>
        
            <p>The works on display at the centre could be purchased on Toi Ora's website.</p>
