            <p>A disabled Christchurch man and his family have received some Christmas cheer after finding themselves in a desperate housing situation.</p>
        
            <p>Father-of-two Rudolph Delport is a double leg amputee and is on kidney dialysis, while his wife Natasha is unable to work because of health problems.</p>
        
            <p>He previously told RNZ that his disability allowance was not enough to cover his rent in the private market - which was set to increase - alongside growing health expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Delport feared his family would eventually be homeless, after being on the MSD housing register for seven years.</p>
        
            <p>"We totally understand that we're not the only ones in this situation but we're also talking about someone who has a life expectancy. We've actually tried to find cheaper accommodation," said Natasha Delport.</p>
        
            <p>"The doctor [has] said the road ahead is just going to get worse and worse and worse for us."</p>
        
            <p>Following RNZ enquiries with the Ministry of Social Development, the Delport family has been granted accommodation through Kainga Ora.</p>
        
            <p>This will cut their weekly rental expenses in half.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Christchurch City Mission said it was having to turn more people away amid an increase in requests for food parcels.</p>

            <p>The longstanding charity has noticed a 10 percent increase in parcels being given out over the past year.</p>
        
            <p>A family of four that RNZ has spoken to say they asked the city mission for support because of financial problems caused by a lack of social housing.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch city missioner Corinne Haines said Christmas was a tough time for those most vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>"We are having to limit our support at the end of this year to those people who we've supported during the year, with our food parcels.</p>
        
            <p>"But there are still people who are asking us ... to help them and at this stage we're not quite sure, we'll [have to] wait until we get to the end of the week but it's tough."</p>
        
            <p>Haines said over the past six months, the charity has bought three times the value of the food it bought in the same period last year.</p>
