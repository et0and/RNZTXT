            <p>One person has died after a car crashed into the water, closing a busy Coromandel Peninsula coastal highway.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called about 3.25am on 2 January, after the car hit a power pole and crashed into the water in a single-car crash near Russek Road, police say.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 25 was closed near Kereta, south of the town of Coromandel, with no detours available. Anyone needing to travel to or from Coromandel town was warned need to go through Whitianga on the eastern side of the peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>The highway had reopened by early afternoon, the Transport Agency's website said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who saw the crash or may have seen the driver before the crash was asked to call Police on 105, or to visit their report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number P057287229.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit is investigating.</p>
