            <p>An Otago man who killed Royalburn Station's head butcher in a head on crash has been sentenced to three years and eleven months in prison in the Invercargill High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Hayden Richard Hurst, 29, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he hit Outrega Anderson's car on State Highway 6 near Gibbston in December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston said when Hurst got behind the wheel that morning, his blood alcohol level of 131mg - more than double the legal limit, he had over twice the high risk legal limit of MDMA in his system and he wasn't wearing corrective lens.</p>
        
            <p>It was the morning after his work Christmas party in Queenstown. His employer had booked accommodation, but Hurst decided to drive to his home in Wanaka.</p>
        
            <p>He drove recklessly and dangerously for half an hour before the fatal crash, veering into oncoming traffic and forcing some drivers to leave the road to avoid a head on collision, Preston said.</p>
        
            <p>Hurst was also disqualified from driving for four years after release and ordered to pay Anderson's family $10,000 in emotional harm reparation.</p>
        
            <p>In a victim impact statement, Anderson's family said it was a senseless act that left them with a true life sentence, with overwhelming and unbearable grief some days.</p>
        
            <p>The effects of his sudden death was catastrophic made even more upsetting by his mum's Alzheimer's preventing her from being able to properly grieve her son, they said.</p>
        
            <p>One of his nephews had anxiety and feared another of his loved ones would die in a car crash, they said.</p>
        
            <p>They describe Anderson as a beautiful, kind and compassionate soul, with a talent for art and burgeoning career.</p>
        
            <p>His workmates described him as a rock of Royalburn Station, saying his death had left them heartbroken and with a gaping hole in their lives.</p>
        
            <p>They challenged Hurst to ensure he made every effort to become a better man, to never drive while intoxicated again and help others to learn from his mistakes.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston said their victim impact statements spoke of a kind, beloved and highly respected man whose life was cut far too short.</p>
