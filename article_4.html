            <p>The cause of Christchurch's Port Hills fire is yet to be determined, but police say residents have come forward with good information.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Tuesday, police confirmed they had spoken to some people who were seen on a walking track on the hills and left quickly in a car.</p>
        
            <p>This was just before the fire - which quickly grew to 650 hectares - broke out last Wednesday afternoon.</p>

            <p>Police forward commander Roy Appley said three people had come in on Monday and passed on some good information with video footage.</p>
        
            <p>He said such an incident was disappointing and caused huge angst for the community.</p>
        
            <p>It was fortunate that no lives had been lost, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was the sort of thing that did not need to happen, and if offenders were involved, the consequences of their actions were rarely thought about.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ incident controller Steve Kennedy said drones were flown over the hills again overnight.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 50 hotspots were identified, and "good progress" had been made this morning, meaning that number was down to 40.</p>
        
            <p>The cooler weather had assisted in the firefighting but wet weather had made it slippery to get back up the tracks.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighting conditions remained favourable - but temperatures would rise again this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 firefighters remained on site at the Port Hills, but he expected it would be less tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Two helicopters were in a nearby paddock on standby, but had not been needed yet today.</p>

            <p>The state of emergency remained in place.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Tuesday morning, Fire and Emergency NZ incident controller Steve Kennedy said about 5 millimetres of rain fell on the fireground at the Port Hills.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight crews made "great progress" eliminating many of the hotspots and deep seated burning at one of the largest skid sites.</p>
        
            <p>"The specialist drone crew continued thermal imaging overnight and has identified further areas that crews will focus on [Tuesday]."</p>
        
            <p>Kennedy earlier said the fire risk remained extremely high.</p>
        
            <p>Work that generates sparks, which includes mowing lawns, should be done earlier in the day when it is cooler, he said.</p>

            <p>Firefighters battling a blaze in Canterbury's Waikari Valley were stood down overnight because the conditions were too slippery for them to continue safely.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said there had been significant rain in the Waikari Valley area.</p>
        
            <p>Crews have managed to contain the 300-hectare vegetation fire and evacuated residents were told they could return home on Monday afternoon. They needed to remain vigilant incase the fire sparked up again.</p>
        
            <p>A fly-over this morning would assess the state of the fire and help determine how they continue to fight it.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Morning Report, Hurunui District mayor Marie Black said she woke to rain this morning which would be a welcome relief to fire crews and the community around Waikari Valley.</p>
        
            <p>Black said she was certain FENZ would be maintaining a watch on the 300-hectare fire as the fire continued to burn underground.</p>
        
            <p>Glenmark Drive resident and farmer Mark Sidey was prepared to leave his home if the blaze escalated, saying there was every chance of a repeat.</p>
        
            <p>"A fire could start any time around here at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"[I'm] very vigilant on the farm at the moment with my motorbikes and working in the heat of the day just what we're up to, and, talking to a friend a week ago who's too scared to ride a horse around the Port Hills at the moment incase the shoes hit a rock and spark."</p>
        
            <p>Metservice meteorologist Clare O'Connor said Christchurch was expected to get to about 18C - about 10C below Monday.</p>

            <p>A number of areas in Hawke's Bay have now moved to a restricted fire season, while East Tararua has a ban on any open air fires.</p>
        
            <p>In a restricted season, people must have a fire permit to light an outdoor fire.</p>
        
            <p>The areas this applies for are rural and coastal Wairoa, Mahia Peninsula, Heretaunga, Ahuriri, Hawke's Bay Coast, Pahīatua, Eketāhuna, and west, south, and central Tararua.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said east Tararua faced an extremely high fire risk and has moved to a prohibited fire season.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay community risk manager Nigel Hall said there was no rain forecast for the next 10 days.</p>
