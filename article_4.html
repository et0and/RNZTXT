            <p>Two men have been arrested after an aggravated burglary at a Michael Hill store in Whakatﾄ］e.</p>
        
            <p>It is just the latest in a string of burglaries and robberies targeting the jewellery chain.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, a group of five thieves made off with jewellery from Michael Hill in a brazen smash and grab attack at Auckland's NorthWest Shopping Centre.</p>
        
            <p>In January, a young person was arrested after an armed robbery at the Michael Hill store in Silverdale Mall on the Hibiscus Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Just a day before the Silverdale incident, Bayfair Shopping Centre in Tauranga had been evacuated after a robbery at the Michael Hill store there. Police said a fog cannon went off and the offenders fled the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Ash Clements said two men, aged 20 and 21, were due to appear in Whakatﾄ］e District Court on Friday, charged with aggravated burglary over the latest incident.</p>
        
            <p>Further charges were being considered.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the effects this has had on the victims who were in the store at the time."</p>
        
            <p>A vehicle involved in the burglary had been found and was being forensically examined, Clements said.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or anyone with video from the area, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was believed more people had been involved.</p>
        
            <p>The Whakatﾄ］e store was also ram-raided in 2021. Thieves smashed the front window with a white ute and made off with thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise.</p>
