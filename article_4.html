            <p>A huia feather has broken the record for the most expensive feather ever sold at auction.</p>
        
            <p>The feather was auctioned at Webb's Auction House in Auckland, 116 years after the last confirmed sighting of the bird.</p>
        
            <p>Head of decorative arts at Webb's, Leah Morris, told Morning Report that the feather was expected to go for $2000-$3000, and the winning bid of $46,521 exceeded all expectations.</p>
        
            <p>"We were very surprised to see such a wonderful result."</p>
        
            <p>Morris said there were about four people phone bidding for clients on the feather, as well as a number of people in the room and bidders online.</p>
        
            <p>While Webb's could not discuss who purchased the feather, Morris did confirm they lived in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"This feather in particular, it was registered as taonga tÅ«turu in 2013, so we were required to treat it as such.</p>
        
            <p>"That means you have to be a registered collector with the Ministry of Culture and Heritage to purchase it, and we also have to update the ministry on the movement of the feather."</p>
        
            <p>Morris said the huge interest in the feather was due to the fact that it was a good example of a huia feather.</p>
        
            <p>"This feather in particular, it's really retained its iridescent sheen, the feather looks great, there's no insect damage."</p>
        
            <p>Morris said that Webb's took care to frame the feather behind UV protected glass, and it was on archival paper.</p>
        
            <p>"We're hoping it has a really long and healthy life."</p>
