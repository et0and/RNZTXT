            <p>A rise in the firefighting levy that comes out of insurance premiums has been reduced for coming years.</p>
        
            <p>The levy already went up 12.8 percent in July, and Fire and Emergency was seeking another 5.2 percent rise through to 2029.</p>
        
            <p>However, the government says that has been revised down to 2.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, a flat $40 charge on vehicle insurance FENZ sought, up from just $9.53, has been reduced to $25, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Internal Affairs Minister Brooke van Velden said she was assured this was enough to fund essential frontline work.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that Kiwis are not paying more than necessary to ensure FENZ is resourced to maintain high standards of frontline services," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>She has also told FENZ to find savings of $60 million by 2029 so it can build up its reserves.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ is 97 percent funded by levies, which the insurance industry is unhappy about, wanting the Crown to simply fund it from its main pot.</p>
        
            <p>It earlier argued it needed the 12.8 percent rise because it was "urgent and cannot wait".</p>
        
            <p>"Our operating costs have increased, and we face immediate funding shortfalls," it said in a report in April.</p>
        
            <p>It has a lot of fire stations that need upgrades, seismic or asbestos work, and an ageing fleet of large fire trucks prone to breakdowns.</p>
        
            <p>It earlier forecast its operating costs to rise to $748m next year, plus nearly $90m in capital costs. Its operating costs in 2016 were $423m.</p>
        
            <p>It also has a $75m Crown loan it has to pay back.</p>
        
            <p>The 12.8 percent rise has relieved some of the pressure.</p>
        
            <p>The minister in April asked FENZ's board for evidence it needed the 5.2 percent increase; she earlier refused RNZ's request to see related briefings.</p>
