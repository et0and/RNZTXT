            <p>A large part of the footpath on lower Queen Street is blocked off this morning, after fallen masonry injured two pedestrians yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A small piece of concrete fell from 99 Queen Street about 11am on Monday, breaking through a glass canopy and leaving two pedestrians with moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Fencing had been put in place that afternoon, barring members of the public from getting close to the scene.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, the area underneath the canopy had been blocked by metal fencing, and signs were in place directing pedestrians around the space.</p>
        
            <p>People walking through the central city were forced to walk on the road, or cross the street to get around the cordon.</p>
        
            <p>One pedestrian RNZ spoke to said it was lucky the debris didn't hit the two victims outright, as he thought it would have killed them.</p>
        
            <p>Another said they were not concerned by what had happened, but that the cordon was blocking them from getting their morning coffee.</p>

            <p>The council said officers confirmed it was a loose piece of masonry that fell from a balcony.</p>
        
            <p>There was no sign of further loose concrete, it said.</p>
