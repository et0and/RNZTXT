            <p>Looking at a landscape screensaver lowers blood pressure, listening to birdsong decreases stress, and smelling lavender reduces anxiety.</p>
        
            <p>It's common sense that interacting with the natural world makes us feel calmer, but what is actually happening in our bodies and minds?</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen years ago, Oxford University biologist Kathy Willis - "quite a cynical scientist" - got interested in this question.</p>
        
            <p>She takes a deep dive into how sensory connection with the natural world can help make us healthier and happier in her new book Good Nature.</p>

            <p>In the last 50 years, a big body of scientific evidence has built up about how contact with nature can regulate heart rate variability, blood pressure, cortisol and adrenalin, Willis tells RNZ's Saturday Morning. </p>
        
            <p>We can all self-prescribe nature as a calming medicine in our own lives, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're having a stressful incident the best thing you can do is actually look out the window or look to look at some vegetation because it really does induce calming.</p>
        
            <p>"If you know that certain sorts of nature lower your blood pressure, reduce your stress and anxiety levels, that is enough [to be beneficial].</p>
        
            <p>"Those are the things that then trigger strokes and cardiovascular diseases."</p>
        
            <p>To really understand how to maximise the health benefits of nature we will need clinical studies, Willis said, but in the meantime, accessible green space should be a necessity in towns and cities, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to think of nature more like a part of infrastructure so we automatically think 'This is where the water goes, this is where the electricity goes, this is where the nature goes."</p>

            <p>A 20-minute walk in nature (ideally around scented plants) three or four times a week is beneficial for stress relief.</p>
        
            <p>Plants with yellow and green leaves are particularly good at triggering brain activity, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>Spider plants - which reproduce easily and are really hard to kill - excel at air purification.</p>
        
            <p>Yellow and white flowers are best for relaxation and calming.</p>
        
            <p>The melodic up-and-down sound of birdsong on headphones has been shown to lower stress and pain scores during surgery, Willis said</p>
        
            <p>Other sounds of nature, such as wind in trees and trickling streams, also have a proven calming effect.</p>
        
            <p>'Tree hugging' is kind of a derogatory term but stroking unvarnished wood lowers your heart rate, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that stroking animals can calm people down. Actually also touching plants seems to have similar triggers, similar reactions."</p>
        
            <p>The soothing benefits of lavender are not an old wives tale, Willis said.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes you sleep. It makes you more relaxed because lavender molecules, once they're in your blood, they interact with that biochemical pathway to reduce anxiety."</p>
        
            <p>The scents of cedar and cypress trees, especially Japanese hinoki, have been shown to significantly elevate the natural killer cells in our blood which attack cancers and viruses, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In her diffuser at home, Willis burns hinoki essential oil in the mornings, rose oil to stay awake and lavender at night time.</p>
