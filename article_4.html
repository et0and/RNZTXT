            <p>A man has died after being shot in Clendon Park in south Auckland on Thursday afternoon, prompting a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police have confirmed the man entered Clendon Park Medical Centre with injuries, but sustained the gunshot wound at another location.</p>
        
            <p>The man was transported to Middlemore Hospital, but has since succumbed to his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>No arrests have been made, but police are currently making inquiries at a nearby Wattle Downs address as part of the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We are speaking with a number of individuals as part of those enquiries to understand what has taken place this afternoon," detective senior sergeant Malcolm Hassall said.</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity around the Gambare Place area this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Several police units had attended the scene, with witnesses reporting seeing the Armed Offenders Squad and a Hato Hone St John ambulance right outside the medical centre.</p>
        
            <p>Entry to the shopping complex via Palmers Road had also been blocked off.</p>
        
            <p>"The community can expect there to be an increased police presence in the area over the coming days," Hassall said.</p>
