            <p>A fatal shooting in east Auckland this week may be connected to another shooting several weeks earlier, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Saia Kokohu Vi, named by police as Tuipulotu Vi, was shot on Monday morning outside his family home in Pakuranga.</p>
        
            <p>The 59-year-old is being remembered as a kind grandfather.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Shaun Vickers said police were making steady progress in their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"As part of our enquiries, we are investigating how this homicide may be linked to another incident where a firearm was discharged towards a house in Beach Haven on the morning of 23 July," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>During that incident last month residents in Beach Haven reported several gunshots fired at a house on Rambler Crescent, but nobody was injured.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment we can confirm there is a familial link between people who live at both addresses, but we are working hard to understand the motivation behind both shootings," Vickers said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Vi died in a shocking display of violence, and we understand the community is feeling uneasy."</p>
        
            <p>He said police were working to confirm if the shootings were gang related.</p>
        
            <p>"It is still very early in our investigation, and we have a lot of ground to cover as we piece this together."</p>
