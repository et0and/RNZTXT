            <p>Pak'n Save and New World's online shopping sites now offer the option of sorting by price again.</p>
        
            <p>Foodstuffs attracted criticism from Consumer NZ when it removed the ability earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>It said at the time it was because it was upgrading its digital platform.</p>
        
            <p>Now, shoppers can also sort by unit pricing, which makes it easier to compare the price of different items.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the functionality had been improved.</p>
        
            <p>"Across our New World and Pak'n Save apps, the sort by price was already available."</p>
        
            <p>Unit pricing has been one of the areas of focus as part of the Commerce Commission market study into supermarkets.</p>
        
            <p>Regulations require major grocery retailers to display the unit price for goods clearly and legibly, at no less than 25 percent the size of the marked price.</p>
