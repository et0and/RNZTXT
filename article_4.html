            <p>Fire crews are still working to contain a vegetation fire on the eastern Coromandel peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency is continuing to fight the fire, which broke out yesterday near Kūaotunu.</p>
        
            <p>The fire has grown to approximately 600 metres by 600 metres in size, from about 300 metres by 600 metres on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Assistant Commander for Waikato, Shane Bromley, said there were three helicopters and two ground crews at the scene on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Bromely said Sunday afternoon that while the fire is under control, it is not yet contained.</p>
        
            <p>Crews are focusing on dampening down hotspots and the left-hand side of the fire, which three helicopters are attacking from the air.</p>
        
            <p>It is hoped the fire will be contained by the end of today.</p>
        
            <p>Bromley said the fire had grown slightly in size since Saturday, with firefighters having to deal with some tough terrain.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire is up a cliff face in old pines that have been fallen and have regrowth all over, so it's a little difficult for ground crews to get in there," Bromley said.</p>
        
            <p>He said crews were working to fight the fire from the air, with about 40 staff at the scene from Kūaotunu, Whangapoua and Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no risk to people or property.</p>
        
            <p>"There's two properties that are close by the fire, but they're well away and in a safe area. At this stage we don't see there's a risk to those properties, it's still quite a long way away from them, and there's a lot of grass in between, so the efforts the crews will put in today won't require evacuations."</p>
        
            <p>Bromley said the fire was under control, and expected the fire to be contained by the end of Sunday - though it would still take a few days to extinguish completely due to the terrain.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a strong southeast wind blowing smoke out to sea, so they were hopeful the wind would die down on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Bromley said they were asking people to please stay out of the area if they did not need to go there.</p>
        
            <p>Black Jack Road will be closed all day, with stop go traffic management in place so residents can access their homes.</p>
        
            <p>There have been no evacuations.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known how the fire started.</p>
        
            <p>Thames-Coromandel mayor Len Salt reminded people the district is under a total fire ban.</p>
        
            <p>While it was not known what caused the blaze, it was a reminder to everyone to stay vigilant, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're on high alert for fire risk and at this time we call on our communities and visitors and locals to manage that fire risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Just to make sure they're careful about open fires, minimising the risk whenever possible and basically working together to keep everyone safe."</p>
        
            <p>Salt said firefighters had done a fantastic job controlling the blaze in challenging conditions.</p>
