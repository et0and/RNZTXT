            <p>More than 400,000 people have had their information taken in a cyber attack on MediaWorks.</p>
        
            <p>The company said the attacker took information from a database of online competitions from as far back as 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Initially it was thought as many as 2.5 million people could have been affected with alleged hackers demanding cryptocurrency in ransom.</p>
        
            <p>Information shared included names, dates of birth, gender, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers - and in some cases, images or videos that may have been submitted as part of the entry.</p>
        
            <p>The company had emailed those affected.</p>
        
            <p>It said the attacker had published information online.</p>
        
            <p>Mediaworks said it was reviewing its IT systems and cyber security protections.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Wendy Palmer apologised for the concern and inconvenience caused.</p>
        
            <p>"We want you to know that MediaWorks takes data security seriously and is working hard to make sure this doesn't happen again."</p>
        
            <p>The Privacy Commissioner and police have been notified.</p>
