            <p>An Auckland jewellery store has reopened, after an attack that left its owner hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>Gurdeep Singh was hit in the head with a hammer during a robbery at his store, Pooja Jewellers, in Papatoetoe, in June.</p>
        
            <p>He reopened the shop on Sunday, but said what happened during the attack keeps coming back to him.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just trying to forget and move on," Singh said.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's happened to me and my family in this very shop, it's very hard for me to just block that."</p>
        
            <p>Singh was hit in the head by a group of offenders, while the rest of his family huddled at the back of the store.</p>
        
            <p>The group fled the scene after Singh's son chased them away with a sword.</p>

            <p>At his store's reopening, Singh said he was recovering well after the attack.</p>
        
            <p>"Physically, I'm much better - feeling good," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I still have a headache on my right side, and feeling sort of heavier on right side where the hammer hit was...</p>
        
            <p>"I'm getting better every day."</p>
        
            <p>But, he said the incident had left him feeling unsafe.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm walking up and down the road, I look at the front, look at the back, and I just make sure that nobody's following me, nobody's up there who's going to punch me ...</p>
        
            <p>"This is not the environment that I want me or my family to be [living] in."</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested five people in relation to the violent robbery, including a 16-year-old male who was charged with aggravated robbery.</p>
        
            <p>Singh said there needed to be tools for authorities to target offenders behind the scenes, not just perpetrators.</p>
        
            <p>"I always have a question, first up - where it goes?" he asked. "There's somebody out there buying it...</p>
        
            <p>"We need to change laws, we need to have some kind of mechanism, some kind of tool to dig deeper and find out what's happening."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Singh said retailers would end up taking the law into their own hands if they weren't supported when dealing with retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody should have to pick up a sword, or knife, or bat, or anything like that to protect your own family, it shouldn't happen in the very first place,</p>
        
            <p>"But if the government can't do anything, people will take law in their own hand. And people, you know, they fight for it."</p>

            <p>Attending the reopening was Minister for Ethnic Communities Melissa Lee, who said the family had been deeply impacted by the robbery.</p>
        
            <p>"When the incident happened, for the family, it was devastating for them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this turn out is a support network that is actually around the community coming out, wanting to support the family, so that they can actually get back into business."</p>
        
            <p>Lee said the government was doing a good thing with its tough stance on law and order, and its boot camp scheme.</p>
        
            <p>She said boot camps, due to start at the end of July, would aim to teach repeat offenders responsibility.</p>
        
            <p>"When you look at the number of repeat offenders amongst our young people, I think you can actually count that there's a small group of people who actually offend and reoffend, constantly," said Lee.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have these serial offenders taken to potentially go to these boot camps where they can be taught their responsibilities as citizens - their responsibility as human beings, to not reoffend - to actually realise the impact their offending has had on people, is actually a good thing.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully that helps them not to offend again."</p>
        
            <p>Community support worker Marshal Walia was also at the reopening, and said he wanted to see to see tougher penalties imposed on offenders from judges.</p>
        
            <p>"The judges are not giving the harsh penalties," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If they can pick up a hammer, then why can't they go into a jail?"</p>
        
            <p>He said the discipline taught in boot camps would make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"When you go through the discipline, and when you know you have to get up at a certain time, and you have to do a certain task, those are the small things which will make a big difference in peoples lives."</p>
