            <p>Passengers on the Qatar Airways flight to Auckland from Doha that diverted to Maldives spurring "flared tempers", were given mixed messages by airline staff as they tried to explain the situation, a family member says.</p>
        
            <p>Flight QR920 was diverted to Valena International Airport at the islands destination in the Indian Ocean on Friday after a "technical issue".</p>
        
            <p>The plane landed and passengers had to wait there for more than 12 hours while a replacement plane was flown to the Maldives.</p>
        
            <p>Those passengers were again in the air headed for New Zealand after the new flight departed, albeit about one hour late. The flight was now due in Auckland around 9.45pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, at the airport where stranded travellers said some people were forced to sleep on the floor of the departure lounge, they had been told at one point the stop was a "normal stopover", and part of a "pilot flight" initiative, a family member of one of the passengers said.</p>
        
            <p>The treatment of the passengers "lacked dignity" they said, after having spoken with family stuck at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers had been told they couldn't leave the airport or stay in hotels as they waited for the replacement airplane for that A350-1041 that had suffered the "technical issue".</p>
        
            <p>After queuing for two hours to get through security, passenger Glenn Hanham said they learned from airline staff the wait for a replacement plane would be about 12 hours.</p>
        
            <p>"Tempers got a bit flared when we were told that we couldn't leave the airport and Qatar wouldn't be putting us up in a hotel for the delay," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A second passenger who contacted Stuff said Qatar Airways did not provide hotel rooms because there were not enough rooms available for everyone, and the airline was only willing to book with their partners.</p>
        
            <p>They said travellers were also told they couldn't book their own accommodation, or leave the airport.</p>
        
            <p>"This has left passengers sleeping on the floor and chairs of the departure lounge. We were also not allowed access to our checked luggage," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Hanham said it was a shame they weren't going to be let out of the airport, but he was in good spirits.</p>
        
            <p>"Shame as it looks pretty good out there and after the chill of France, we would [have] fancied a dip in that beautiful water," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Geraldine Granma from Wellington was also among the stranded passengers, and said the airline did help families.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say that Qatar did put all the families in the business class lounge but the children are tired and very distressed," Granma said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the families have travelled from the UK with 18-month-old twins and pre-school children... they are travelling two hours north of Auckland on landing."</p>
        
            <p>She thought given the circumstances, airport staff in New Zealand could make special arrangements.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it would be amazing if the ground staff in Auckland ushered the families through passport control and biosecurity."</p>
        
            <p>She said she thought it "terrible that little children are tortured in long lines" upon arriving to the airport and priority should be given to children under 10-years-old.</p>
        
            <p>Two travellers told Stuff passengers were told about the diversion about four hours into the flight, and they landed just 15 minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>One passenger, who didn't want to be named, said most people were sleeping when the lights suddenly turned on and were told there was a "minor technical difficulty".</p>
        
            <p>"The crew were running around very quickly to suddenly prepare the cabin for landing. Everyone on board seemed pretty calm and understanding that we had to divert and relieved when we landed on the ground safely," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Hanham said they were told it was due to "a minor technical issue" but that it was "under control and there was nothing to worry about".</p>
        
            <p>"They haven't elaborated on [the] issue but the port side engine cowling was open when we disembarked," he told Stuff while waiting at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>Cowling is the removable cover of the plane's engine.</p>
        
            <p>Qatar Airways confirmed the diversion was due to a technical error.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to Stuff, a spokesperson said: "Qatar Airways regrets the delay of flight QR920 from Doha (DOH) to Auckland (AKL) on Friday. The aircraft diverted to Maldives (MLE) due to a technical issue.</p>
        
            <p>"The aircraft landed safely and plans for alternative travel arrangements for passengers are underway. All passengers will be assisted to ensure smooth onward connections to their final destinations."</p>
        
            <p>The safety and security of passengers remains its top priority, the spokesperson added.</p>
