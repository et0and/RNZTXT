            <p>A primary school competition to design and build wind turbines is generating an interest in engineering careers among the next generation.</p>
        
            <p>This year's Wonder Project Power Challenge was won by Clendon Park School's Tautua mo Tupulaga Samoan language unit.</p>
        
            <p>Their mentor, Watercare engineer Lukan Paitai-Tuiatua, who was himself born and raised in South Auckland, said he jumped at the chance to take part.</p>
        
            <p>"I know from growing up there that they don't always have the same opportunities as in other areas.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the kids I grew up with all just ... tried to make it in sports. So it was a good chance for me to go back and say 'There's more that you can do than just sports'.</p>
        
            <p>"The opportunities are there, but a lot of them didn't actually know about them."</p>
        
            <p>The Power Challenge - developed in association with Transpower - is part of The Wonder Project, Engineering New Zealand's free school programme.</p>
        
            <p>In the competition, ākonga design and build a wind turbine to light up a "mini town" in the form of a circuit board.</p>
        
            <p>Paitai-Tuiatua said the Clendon Park students were intrigued to hear about his work on Watercare's Central Interceptor project - the massive 15km-long wastewater tunnel between Māngere and Grey Lynn, which is designed to clean up Auckland's waterways.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some really bright kids out there who just need some guidance to help them realise their potential - and this project highlighted it.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope they take every opportunity put in front of them and have confidence that they can do some amazing things."</p>
        
            <p>Over 100,000 students have been involved in the Wonder Project and its predecessor, Futureintech, since it began in 2005.</p>
        
            <p>This year, 1231 classrooms signed up for the Wonder Project. Nearly half the students - 49 percent - were girls and more than 31 percent were Māori or Pasifika.</p>
        
            <p>The project has three separate programmes, which are aligned to the New Zealand Curriculum: the Rocket Challenge for Year 5-6, the Power Challenge for Year 7-8 and STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) Careers for Year 7-13.</p>
        
            <p>According to Engineering New Zealand, half the students who took part later reported an interest in pursuing STEM careers.</p>
        
            <p>However, next year the project loses its main funding source, after Callaghan Innovation (which is funded through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) decided to stop investment in STEM promotion.</p>
