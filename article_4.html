            <p>There have been 4666 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the past week, and 20 further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Of the new cases, 3865 were probable cases and 3012 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 55 cases in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The number of cases in intensive care units was not available on the Ministry of Health's website.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-day rolling average of new cases was 667 per day.</p>
        
            <p>Last Monday, 4803 new cases and 24 deaths attributed to the virus were reported for the previous week, with 171 cases in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Health NZ said it no longer recommended that asymptomatic household contacts of people with Covid-19 should test daily.</p>
        
            <p>A new Covid-19 vaccine, which could fight newer strains of the virus, would be available from 7 March.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ also confirmed earlier this year free RATs would be available until at least the end of June.</p>
