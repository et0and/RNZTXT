            <p>An elderly man waiting for his flood-affected home to be assigned a recovery category says if he dies waiting, Auckland Council will be to blame.</p>
        
            <p>He had been hospitalised three times since the 2023 Auckland Anniversary floods damaged his home, he told First Up.</p>
        
            <p>"If I die, I will write that these people are responsible for my death."</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody [has] contacted me so far, no help was rendered. I should know in which category I fall and what I am to do with the house. Can I demolish it? Can I repair it?"</p>
        
            <p>He was one of about 50 people who attended a Tāmaki Makaurau recovery office community meeting on Tuesday in Rānui, West Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>It had been nearly 17 months since the Auckland Anniversary floods shattered the lives of many across the city.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, many were living in in limbo, waiting for Auckland Council to assess whether their properties can be rebuilt and lived in again.</p>
        
            <p>Ranui and Swanson were amongst the worst affected suburbs in the city.</p>
        
            <p>Homeowners had until the end of September to register their properties for an assessment.</p>
        
            <p>Council was focused on helping those who were most at risk, and with complex needs, Auckland Council deputy group recovery manager Mace Ward said.</p>

            <p>He hoped all homes will be given a category by March 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's a deconstruction programme that continues, there's the infrastructure projects that will continue for at least 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>"The early ones will be at much more rapid in the first two years, but those other projects will continue for quite a long time. So there's a long time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>To speed up the categorisation process, council was looking at reallocating its budget.</p>
        
            <p>The $2 billion recovery fund was divided for resilience projects and property buy-outs.</p>
        
            <p>The council proposed some of the reslience funding to go towards buy-outs.</p>
        
            <p>But that was of little comfort to Belinda.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had neighbours next to us and also people across the road categorised as three, we're the only house sitting in a whole lot of people that haven't had a category yet, so it doesn't sound good for us.</p>
        
            <p>"We live on the stream and it's eroding more underneath our fence. So that's it. We've just realised that we're just stuffed now."</p>
        
            <p>Like the others, Belinda said she was not expecting answers from the meeting either.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be the same as the usual meetings and we all hear our stories all over again and nothing, I guess because I've asked all my questions to council. They're not answering everything that I need, so there's just no point."</p>
