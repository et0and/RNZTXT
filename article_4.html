            <p>For the first time, a reo Māori adaptation of a Disney film will be released at the same time as its English counterpart.</p>
        
            <p>Moana 2 and Moana 2 Reo Māori will be released in cinemas on 28 November.</p>
        
            <p>Mātewā Media has joined hands with Walt Disney Animation Studios again for the latest installment of the story, in which Moana and Maui reunite for a new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers.</p>
        
            <p>Jaedyn Randell and Piripi Taylor are returning to reprise their beloved characters, Moana and Maui, in the reo Māori version of the children's movie.</p>
        
            <p>Fresh off her success on The Voice Australia, Randell says it's exciting to see the films be released at the same time, and she's proud of the team behind it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's like quite heart-warming as well. I think the exciting thing about this one is that our tamariki will only know Moana 2 in te reo Māori rather than having to watch it in English for so long until we redub it, so it's really exciting and I'm really grateful to be part of this kaupapa," Randell told Midday Report.</p>
        
            <p>The Tāmaki Makaurau-based producation company has previously helped release reo Māori adaptations of other favourites, including Encanto and Lion King, to much success in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Randell, who also previously voiced Princess Anna in the reo Māori version of Frozen, says she doesn't know which movie is next in the pipeline but is quite confident there will be more reo Māori adaptations.</p>
        
            <p>Moana 2 and Moana 2 Reo Māori open in participating cinemas across Aotearoa New Zealand on 28 November.</p>
