        <h2>Why more police are using number-plate spotting tech</h2>
        <p>
The number of searches by officers on automated number plate recognition systems rose from 64,000 in 2020 to almost 700,000 four years later.

            <p>Police say their rapidly rising use of number plate searching technology is mostly because more officers are doing it, and are more aware of being able to use it.</p>
        
            <p>The number of searches by officers on two private companies' automated number plate recognition systems rose from 64,000 in 2020 to almost 700,000 four years later.</p>
        
            <p>A search of any vehicle's number plate can find all records of it caught on CCTV cameras outside shops and public places going back 60 days.</p>
        
            <p>Police did not provide evidence or make any claim that the rising use of the searches had cut crime.</p>
        
            <p>Data shows crime clearance rates steady or in some cases dropping, with victimisation rates and violent crime also steady.</p>
        
            <p>Police told RNZ the big rise in number plate searches was because more officers were allowed to do it - up by 2500 to 8600 officers between 2023 and last year - and more of them were aware of using it.</p>
        
            <p>"These authorised staff have requested ANPR data in a larger number of cases."</p>
        
            <p>It was "likely" officers were using it more often to investigate high-volume crime.</p>
        
            <p>Data shows burglaries are high volume, but the clearance rate for them has dropped. Many more people were being discharged without conviction in the latest figures than they were a decade ago, which coincides with the police first arranging with private company Auror to access its number plate technology.</p>
        
            <p>Police said another reason for the rise was the same plate entered in both private software systems will register as two searches.</p>
        
            <p>In the Auror system, 14 percent of searches targeted the same vehicle, and in the SaferCities system, that figure was 20 percent.</p>
        
            <p>This might indicate a wide net is being cast across many vehicle plates being searched.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a factor in the use of SaferCities almost doubling to 450,000 searches in one year, was its network had increased the area it covered.</p>
        
            <p>Police said RNZ should ask SaferCities for further details - but SaferCities told RNZ to ask police.</p>
