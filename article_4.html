            <p>Customs have arrested three drug couriers at Auckland Airport, seizing methamphetamine with a combined street value of more than NZ$10 million.</p>
        
            <p>The attempts involve two incidents, which are not believed to be related.</p>
        
            <p>A 33-year-old man and a 39-year-old man arriving from Toronto in Canada on New Year's Day were found to carry just over 20kg of methamphetamine in their checked-in suitcase.</p>
        
            <p>In the other case, a 59-year-old woman arriving from Honolulu Thursday night was found to carry about just under 7kg of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>Customs officers searched the woman's baggage and found clothing that was stiff to the touch. Border testing indicated the presence of methamphetamine, which had been soaked into the clothing.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport customs manager Paul Williams said drug couriers were trying to exploit the busy holiday travel period.</p>
        
            <p>"Day three into the new year and Customs has already stopped approximately NZ$10.2 million worth of methamphetamine from causing harm in our communities.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a result of the hard work of our frontline officers, supported by intelligence and targeting experts who have been working throughout the holiday season to identify and stop potential drug couriers."</p>
        
            <p>Williams urged travellers passing through airports to stay vigilant.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep your eyes out for suspicious activity, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to a Customs officer."</p>
        
            <p>The three suspects are due to appear in Manukau District Court today.</p>
