            <p>Warm humid air heading New Zealand's way will pump up temperatures, but also bring heavy rain to some.</p>
        
            <p>It come after NIWA predicted a warmer than average summer and forecasts some places would top 30 degrees this week.</p>
        
            <p>"The east, western parts of the South Island are in for some heavy rain," MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"Strong westerly winds will also feature around the southeast of the North Island."</p>
        
            <p>A 12-hour orange heavy rain warning for the ranges in Westland kicks in at 6am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The MetService said to expect up to 120mm of rain, with lesser amounts near the coast.</p>
        
            <p>It was warning people to clear out drains and gutters and for drivers to take care.</p>
        
            <p>Yellow heavy rain watches were also forecast for northern Fiordland from 3am Tuesday and for the ranges of the Grey and Buller Districts from 4pm Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a strong wind watch for Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay south of Hastings would run from Tuesday evening through to Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Rain or showers were forecast around the country through until Friday.</p>
