            <p>The associate minister of immigration has granted residency to a Brazilian couple whose immigration adviser forgot to apply for their residency path back in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Newton Santos and Nubia Chiarelli have been fighting for three years to get their case reviewed by minister Chris Penk.</p>
        
            <p>In July, after Green Party MP Ricardo Men√©ndez March pointed out that migrants struggling to stay in the country were "spilling their guts" to the media to get noticed by the immigration minister, the couple finally got an update from Penk.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter sent to March on 25 July, Penk said he had looked closely at their case and granted the visa, as long as the couple met health and character requirements for residency.</p>
        
            <p>"[Penk] asked us to send the medical exams, police certificates from New Zealand, and pay the skilled migrant application fee of $4290," Santos said.</p>
        
            <p>"We completed the exams, paid the fee as soon as we could, and sent everything to immigration. During the process, some additional documents were requested, and we sent those as well."</p>
        
            <p>After weeks of going through the final stages of their application, the couple said getting a positive result was a huge relief.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a long, tiring, and expensive process that impacted our lives for a long time," Chiarelli said.</p>
        
            <p>"When we found out that the immigration adviser we hired hadn't submitted our application, our lives were turned upside down. From that point until [we got granted residency], there were many sleepless nights, a lot of money invested, and a lot of waiting."</p>
        
            <p>She said finally being able to call New Zealand home as residents was a dream come true.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything that happened to us has served as a warning to many migrants, and we hope no one else has to go through what we went through.</p>
        
            <p>"If we could advise someone looking for an immigration adviser, we would say to research thoroughly beforehand. Look up the company and the adviser, check groups, and ask for recommendations for reliable companies."</p>
        
            <p>Chiarelli that people affected by negligent licensed advisers get the support and help they need from the immigration ministry.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how lives and families can be ruined by these companies' negligence and how it directly affects their mental, physical, and financial well-being.</p>
        
            <p>"In our case, we had people willing to help us, information, and time to try to change the outcome of this story, but not everyone is as fortunate."</p>
        
            <p>March said he was thrilled with the outcome for the couple.</p>
        
            <p>"I am stoked for Newton and Nubia, both because they'll finally be able to put roots down in their local community but also because their determination to right a wrong has helped shine a light on the need for better pathways to residency.</p>
        
            <p>"No one should have their lives turned upside down because of rapidly shifting immigration policies and lack of diligence by immigration advisers."</p>
        
            <p>March said he would continue fighting alongside migrant workers to ensure people are treated with respect and dignity.</p>
