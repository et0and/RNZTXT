            <p>Red Cross New Zealand has apologised after an overtaking attempt by a staff member in a branded car was caught on camera.</p>
        
            <p>Footage posted to social media showed the Red Cross-branded hatchback driving on the wrong side of the road, forcing oncoming traffic on to the shoulder, before pulling in close behind the vehicle infront in the appropriate lane.</p>
        
            <p>Red Cross New Zealand confirmed the overtaking attempt took place at around 4pm on Thursday near Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>They also said it had been reported to police.</p>
        
            <p>Red Cross secretary general Sarah Stuart-Black said she was shocked by the footage.</p>
        
            <p>"We are conducting a full investigation into the incident in line with our employment policies, our safe driver policy, and our code of conduct. The driver is co-operating fully with the investigation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This behaviour does not align with our values, and we sincerely apologise to all those who were involved in the incident or have been concerned about it."</p>
        
            <p>The staff member is not allowed to drive Red Cross vehicles while the internal investigation takes place.</p>
        
            <p>Those on social media were appalled by the driving, with some calling it "absolutely disgusting", "unbelievable" and a "daily occurrence for us who drive the roads".</p>
