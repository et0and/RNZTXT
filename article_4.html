            <p>A Treaty of Waitangi display at Te Papa in Wellington which was spray painted last year will be taken down next week.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve people were arrested on 11 December after a wooden display panel showing an English version of the Treaty of Waitangi was damaged with spray paint and an angle grinder.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa Liberation League and Te Waka Hourua - the M훮ori group affiliated with Extinction Rebellion - have claimed responsibility for the demonstration.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Te Waka Hourua said the English display was not accurate, and had repeatedly called for it to be taken down.</p>
        
            <p>The group said they believed the English text was displayed in a way which misled visitors.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Tiriti, in te reo M훮ori, is the only legitimate, legally binding agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"While Te Tiriti affirms M훮ori sovereignty, the English document says it was ceded.</p>
        
            <p>"The miseducation around Te Tiriti has resulted in a population who are ignorant of the promises made to M훮ori, leading to fearfulness and division."</p>
        
            <p>The group wanted an "an accurate translation for all New Zealanders to be able to read and understand".</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the incident, Te Papa said the purpose of the exhibition - which had been up in some form since the museum opened in 1998 - was to provide a space for conversations about the Treaty.</p>
        
            <p>But it said that conversation needed to change to meet the needs of the day, and made the decision to renew and reimagine the display.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa co-leaders Arapata Hakiwai and Courtney Johnston said keeping the panel in place temporarily had led to some valuable conversations.</p>
        
            <p>"But it is right that we change the space now, and take this step towards the development of a brand-new exhibition."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Te Papa said the panel would remain on show stay up over summer and then removed.</p>
        
            <p>It will be stored by the museum and no decision has been made about its future.</p>
