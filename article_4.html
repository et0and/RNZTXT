            <p>A number of houses on Sackville Street in Grey Lynn had their windows smashed in January, though incidents date back to February last year.</p>
        
            <p>On one of the days, six windows were smashed.</p>
        
            <p>The accused, who has been granted interim name suppression, was remanded in custody before Judge von Keisenberg and is expected to reappear in April.</p>
