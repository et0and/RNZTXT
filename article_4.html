            <p>The couple who died at a rural Auckland address on Thursday afternoon can be named as Alfred Helge Hansen and Gaye Carole Hansen.</p>
        
            <p>The pair, aged in their 80s, were found dead in a paddock by a relative who'd gone to check on them on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed they died after a ram attacked them.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff understands the husband went to feed the ram, but didn't return. His wife was killed when she went looking for him.</p>
        
            <p>Police said another person at the farm was injured by the ram.</p>

            <p>Police were called to the property on Anzac Valley Rd in Waitākere just before 7.30am on Thursday, and a scene examination was underway.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the ram was still in the paddock when they arrived and it was shot after becoming aggressive towards them.</p>
        
            <p>The victims' nephew and family spokesperson Dean Burrell said their deaths were linked to an animal.</p>
        
            <p>"My aunty and her husband lived at this property. They've lived here for about eight years. Unfortunately they've both lost their lives in a tragic accident.</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances of their passing was very unexpected, he said, adding that he was still coming to terms with it.</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said the couple rented the property. They were retired hobby farmers, and had sheep, cattle and chickens for 8 years.</p>
        
            <p>"They're good people. They're over 80. They don't deserve this.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is in shock as to what's happened. They are very upset."</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said he felt like he was dreaming when he found out what happened. "I just didn't believe it."</p>
        
            <p>Burrell, a front line police officer, was supporting the family given he understood the formal investigation process. His grief was yet to sink in, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He and his family requested privacy while they came to terms with the loss.</p>
