            <p>A "strong" quake shook the South Island late on Saturday night, with people as far away as Auckland reporting they felt it.</p>
        
            <p>The magnitude 5.1 quake struck at 11.37pm, in the ocean five kilometres northwest of Greymouth, on the West Coast, at a depth of five kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>Greymouth mayor Tania Gibson said it was "quite a sharp jolt".</p>
        
            <p>"There was quite a big noise like a freight train coming, and then all of a sudden there was movement.</p>
        
            <p>"So yeah, it was quite eerie, and then there was another couple [of aftershocks] after that."</p>
        
            <p>GeoNet described the shaking as "strong". There were more than 1400 felt reports, with six calling it "extreme".</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully everything's all right and there are no reports [of damage]", said Gibson.</p>
        
            <p>"I was watching my phone very carefully afterwards for any messages from Civil Defence, but it seems like everything [is] fine at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Most reports came from the South Island, as far south as Dunedin, while a number of people in North Island locations such as Hawke's Bay, Wellington, south Waikato and even Auckland said they felt it.</p>
        
            <p>Two aftershocks measured magnitude 2.8 and 3.9.</p>
