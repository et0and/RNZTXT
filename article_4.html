            <p>Coromandel police say they carried out over 900 alcohol breath tests across 28 checkpoints yesterday as part of a drink driving holiday crackdown that resulted in five drivers being processed for excess breath alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"Yesterday's hard work and  high number of checks are a credit to our dedicated road policing teams," said Inspector Mike Henwood, area commander for the Eastern Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>"We work hard alongside our road safety partners to prevent deaths and serious injuries from happening on our roads.</p>
        
            <p>"We got five intoxicated drivers yesterday and that's five too many," said Henwood.</p>
        
            <p>He said police are urging drivers to make sure everyone is wearing the correct seat belts, focus on the road, not their phone, avoid speeding, and drive to the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming into the holiday season and New Year it is doubly important that locals and holidaymakers alike know that they could be breath tested anytime and anywhere," he said.</p>
