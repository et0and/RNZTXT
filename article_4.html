            <p>A Wellington woman says the city's new cycle lanes are opening up a world of possibilities of what can be achieved without motor vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend Beth Walker - an executive assistant and researcher in Green MP Julie Anne Genter's office - moved into her new flat with the help of a collection of cargo bikes and a little elbow grease from like-minded friends and volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>But Walker said the journey was not without a few bumps in the road with some of the lanes proving a tight squeeze for heavily laden bikes and cargo trailers.</p>
        
            <p>It took just over three hours to get Walker's belongings - including a queen size bed and large chest of drawers - from her old flat in Island Bay to her new location in Newtown.</p>
        
            <p>"It was brilliant. It was such a good time and it went really smoothly and just really proved the point that these things are super achievable and there are alternative options to cars and vans," Walker said.</p>

            <p>Walker said a post on Wellington cycle community Facebook page quickly gathered seven cargo bike riding volunteers to help with the move.</p>
        
            <p>"When you have seven people, it makes it really smooth loading up and unloading. Once we got to my new house it took genuinely 10 minutes to unload," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>Walker - who does not own a car - said she was inspired to make the move after helping a friend move house without cars a couple of years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>She said she felt the cycle lanes along the route meant her convoy was less disruptive for other road users.</p>
        
            <p>"That really contributed to making it smooth and accessible and fun for everyone. It just gave us a safer and easier route. We didn't hold up anybody as much as we might have if we were riding on the road and [having] people trying to get around us," Walker said.</p>

            <p>But the day was not without its challenges.</p>
        
            <p>The placement of plastic bollards on Adelaide Road proved too narrow for Jade Musther's custom built electric powered bike trailer which was tasked with shifting Walker's queen size bed.</p>
        
            <p>"Jade got stuck going down there with my bed but we got the hang of it though because the bollards are flexible so they could go along and just gently knock the bollards on one side," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>Musther's trailer is built to match the same wheel base as other trailers on the market but they said they occasionally ran into trouble with the placement of the bollards sitting well inside the paint marking the lane on Adelaide Road.</p>
        
            <p>Musther said - even without a wide load - it was difficult to prevent the wheel of their trailer dropping into the drains on the side of the road.</p>
        
            <p>"I tend to ride in the bus-lane there because that lane is too narrow. The trailer is not significantly wider than my handle bar but there's very little wiggle room in that lane," Musther said.</p>

            <p>Wellington City Council spokesperson Richard MacLean said the council was aware of concerns about the lane.</p>
        
            <p>"There are ultimately space constraints along that stretch of road that we need to be mindful of.</p>
        
            <p>"We will keep an eye on it and, if it's feasible to make alterations to make cyclists with trailers feel they can use that lane safely, then we will look at it seriously," MacLean said.</p>
        
            <p>Beth Walker said she felt like the city's cycle community were ready and willing to step up and help if others wanted to try a bike powered move for themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"I think in modern society we have a big focus on the individual and sometimes people don't really benefit from that because it's really difficult to do certain things on your own - but with seven other people it makes it really easy.</p>
        
            <p>"People like helping each other right? It comes back around and that is what I think a community looks like these days. Being able to do things collectively makes it easier for everyone," Walker said.</p>
