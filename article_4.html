            <p>The latest Child Poverty statistics show more families are going without household essentials due to the rise in the cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ released its annual data on child poverty for the year ended June 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The data is based on nine measures set out in the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018. It is gathered through a mixture of interviews with households and data.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the three primary measures of child poverty had increased on the previous year.</p>
        
            <p>One in six children (or 17.5 percent) lived in households with less than half of the median household disposable income after household costs - that was up around 3 percent on last year.</p>

            <p>One in 8 children (12.5 percent) lived in households experiencing material hardship, meaning they were likely to go without fresh fruit and vegetables, doctor's visits, or good shoes.</p>
        
            <p>That was an increase of 2 percent on last year.</p>
        
            <p>General manager of social and population insights Abby Johnson said these increases reflected heightened inflation.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen an annual increase in material hardship, indicating that more households were going without some of the essentials due to cost."</p>
        
            <p>"We also saw that, for many households, incomes after deducting housing costs did not keep up with inflation, leading to an increase in one of the low-income poverty measures."</p>
        
            <p>One in eight children were living in low income households with less than half the median disposable income before housing costs - about the same proportion as last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, the statisticians said as there were "inconsistencies" in the data for the 2021 to 2023 year due to Covid-19 lockdowns, it was difficult to determine whether an annual change had occurred.</p>
        
            <p>For tamariki MƒÅori, Pacific children and disabled children there was no significant change on 2021 to 2023 year.</p>
