            <p>A man has been charged with shooting numerous people, including a boy on a Scouts-organised rubbish pick-up, with a gel gun.</p>
        
            <p>The attack on the 11-year-old happened on 1 November on Pererika Street in Rotorua. The attacker fired the gun - typically used for recreational battles - from a passing car, hitting the boy in the face.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately the injuries suffered by the young boy were not serious, but it was a distressing incident for him and his mum, and for the other children who were nearby at the time," Detective Sergeant Richard Lang said on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Two others were shot at in similar circumstances the day before, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pleased for all concerned that we have been able to hold someone to account for this senseless behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>The 21-year-old alleged offender has been charged with three counts of discharging a firearm in or near a place/dwelling and one charge of behaving threateningly, and will appear in Rotorua District Court on 24 January.</p>
