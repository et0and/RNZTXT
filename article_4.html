        <h2>Adapting to big-scoring pitch key to World Cup semi: Ferguson</h2>
        <p>
Kiwi pace bowler Lockie Ferguson says Mubai's stadium pitch must be assessed and bowling tightened up ahead of World Cup semi-final against India.

            <p>New Zealand pace bowler Lockie Ferguson says they must accurately assess Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium pitch ahead of their World Cup semi-final against hosts India and look to tighten up their bowling at the traditionally high-scoring venue.</p>
        
            <p>South Africa twice posted scores of 350-plus at the stadium and India made 357-8 in their clash with Sri Lanka before Glenn Maxwell hit a superb double century as Australia successfully chased down 291 against Afghanistan last week.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of Indian grounds have been high scoring," Ferguson told reporters in Mumbai before Wednesday's clash.</p>
        
            <p>"That's the nature of one-day cricket in this part of the world.</p>
        
            <p>"It's trying to understand what the pitch will be like and read what a good score on it is because those big overs, 10 runs here or there, can cost you at the back end of the innings.</p>

            <p>"From a bowling point of view, we're trying to shut down the big overs, try to understand what we think is a good total. It's an experience thing. The pitch will be different... it's hard to read two days out. We've got to adapt as quick as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Ferguson said the statistics favoured batting first at the venue, with New Zealand looking to knock India out of the World Cup semi-finals for a second straight edition.</p>
        
            <p>"At the same time, it's not up to me and we have to play the game on the day," Ferguson added. "Whatever it might be - bat or bowl first - we've got plans for that.</p>

            <p>"It's important to stick to them. Obviously, it's nice to bowl under lights, nice to see when the ball does move around a bit and it brings us into the game.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll have to play it as we see it come game day, but I'm looking forward to it."</p>
