            <p>Vulnerable striped skinks encountered at the Mt Messenger Bypass construction site in Taranaki now have a new home Rotokare Scenic Reserve, near Eltham.</p>
        
            <p>A taonga species, the scarcely sighted striped skinks are known for their lightning-quick movements and distinctive pale markings.</p>
        
            <p>Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust, Waka Kotahi and Te Ara o Te Ata - Mt Messenger Bypass project have formed a partnership to protect the lizard with the support of project partner Ngāti Tama and local mana whenua Ngāti Tupaia.</p>
        
            <p>A team has constructed a temporary holding area at the 230-hectare sanctuary for any striped skinks discovered during construction of the project on State Highway 3.</p>
        
            <p>So far three striped skinks (Oligosoma striatum) have been found at Mt Messenger and they were cared for at Auckland Zoo before being transferred to Rotokare.</p>
        
            <p>Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust conservation manager Fiona Gordon said the holding area would provide a safe environment where the skinks could acclimatise to their new surroundings before exploring the broader reserve through the treetops.</p>
        
            <p>Striped skinks hadn't been found during formal lizard surveys at Rotokare, but it was believed they were once present as they've been located in pockets around South Taranaki, Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are excited to offer a safe home for this at-risk skink species in a space completely free of rodents, one of their main predators."</p>
        
            <p>Any further striped skinks found by the project would be transferred directly to Rotokare.</p>
        
            <p>The Trust was also working with the Department of Conservation to secure a permit to transfer further striped skinks from other locations across Taranaki if needed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hoped that skinks will flourish in their new home, creating a secure population in South Taranaki," Gordon said.</p>
        
            <p>Native to New Zealand, striped skinks were usually found in lowland forests, farmland, and swamps, where they lived everywhere from the forest canopy to leaf litter on the forest floor.</p>
        
            <p>They are currently listed on the Department of Conservation's Threat Classification System as 'At Risk - Declining,' however, accurate population monitoring remained a challenge due to their secretive habits.</p>
        
            <p>The Rotokare Scenic Reserve Trust was a community-led conservation organisation dedicated to the preservation and restoration of native biodiversity within the predator-free sanctuary, located in South Taranaki.</p>
