        <h2>Patchy forecast for Christmas Day no deterrent to fun - mayors</h2>
        <p>
Rain is scheduled to sweep its way up the motu from the south through Christmas Day, but it's still going to be a great day, a collection of mayors say.

            <p>MetService says Christmas Day could feature showers or rain for much of the motu, but it's still going to be a great day, a collection of mayors say.</p>
        
            <p>Rain is expected to arrive in the morning along the western side of the South Island, and extend eastwards in the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, rain is forecast during the afternoon on Christmas Day for the western parts, and will reach the rest of the North Island later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne and Hawke's Bay are expected to stay dry for much of the big day, and could also have some of the highest temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>There is a low risk of thunderstorms for Hokitika and Fiordland, Southland, Clutha, Queenstown Lakes District, and Central Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei's mayor Vince Cocurullo is undeterred by the Christmas Day forecast.</p>
        
            <p>"I take everything that the MetService says with a pinch of salt," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are times when they say it's going to rain and then it's beautiful sunshine, and there are times when they say there'll be beautiful sunshine and then it rains."</p>
        
            <p>He said Whangārei had welcomed an influx of visitors over the Christmas period, a relief after years of roading woes through the Brynderwyn Hills.</p>

            <p>"There's a lot of people coming up north, as I live on the state highway I can see a lot of people travelling north," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"For the past four years we've had quite a few upsets so this year having a clean road up to the north is really great."</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara District mayor Craig Jepson was similarly optimistic.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas is a day when it doesn't matter what the weather [is like], you can enjoy it and enjoy your friends and family," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounds like it'll be nice in the morning so I think people will work around the weather, hit the beach, have a swim, freshen up in the morning and then tuck into a bit of Christmas food and cheer in the afternoon so one way or another they're going to have a good day, I think."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, regions on the east coast including Gisborne would enjoy the best weather New Zealand could offer.</p>
        
            <p>MetService predicted Gisborne would reach a high of 28 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>"We are loving every moment, if there's one place in the country that deserves the best weather it is Gisborne," mayor Rehette Stoltz said, referencing the devastating 2023 storms.</p>
        
            <p>"Things are definitely looking up, we have done so much and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved... Everyone deserves a wonderful break this summer and the beautiful weather coming our way is an absolute bonus and so well deserved."</p>

            <p>She said the town was thriving over the Christmas period, with Rhythm and Vines to follow.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been in and out of town for the last two days, and it is buzzing with great energy. I have met up with visitors from out of town, we are seeing lots of visitors coming to our place because they all know it's the best weather in the country," Stoltz said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic, we need everyone to support us and help us bring our economy back to what it was before the horrendous 2023, and we can only do that if people come and visit us and support our local businesses."</p>
