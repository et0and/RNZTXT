        <h2>Hamilton Gardens visitors disappointed as entry fee comes into effect</h2>
        <p>
The gardens have been part of Polly Williams' "family fabric" forever - but it'll now cost them $100 to visit.

            <p>A new $20 entry fee into the 18 themed gardens at Hamilton Gardens comes into effect this week - but city residents are exempt.</p>
        
            <p>Instead the fee applies to anyone aged 16 or over who does not live in Hamilton, which has caused some contention among neighbours in Waipā and Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The gardens attract a million people a year, and its 18 themed gardens are the star attraction.</p>
        
            <p>They include the Italian Renaissance, Ancient Egyptian, Tudor, Tropical, Modernist, Surrealist, Indian Charbagh, English Flower, and Chinese Scholars' gardens, as well as the much-loved Mansfield garden and the Japanese Garden of Contemplation.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklander Polly Williams grew up in Hamilton and was at the gardens on Friday to remember her late parents, who visited a lot during her childhood.</p>
        
            <p>"I was brought up in Hamilton. I've lived here since the age of five but I don't live here anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"We used to come here a lot with my parents who are both now passed. We used to bring Mum and Dad here all the time with my kids.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been part of our family fabric forever."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said it was a family tradition to visit Hamilton Gardens on Christmas Day.</p>

            <p>"But I won't be able to bring them anymore because it's going to cost us about $100 to bring our family here and we probably won't do that."</p>
        
            <p>She said the themed gardens had special meaning to her family.</p>
        
            <p>"We do enjoy the rest of the gardens as well. There are other walks that we do along the river.</p>
        
            <p>"But it does hold a really special place in our hearts and it's quite sad for me that it's now going to cost us and perhaps be a little bit unaffordable for us when we do come to visit."</p>

            <p>"I come to a walking group here on a Thursday but I won't be doing the inside walks anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's annoying for those of us that are just out of town. For myself, I would have found it more acceptable if we could have come for $5, for one layer outside the city."</p>
        
            <p>She said $20 for tourists was appropriate but for nearby non-Hamilton ratepayers it was "a bit much".</p>
        
            <p>"I was talking to a lady coming in this morning and she had lived in Hamilton all her life. She's now gone into a rest home at Tamahere and she can't come to the gardens for free."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton Gardens director Lucy Ryan said the themed gardens alone attracted more than half a million visitors each year.</p>

            <p>She said the reaction from neighbours to the fee was understandable.</p>
        
            <p>"We do understand how our nearest neighbours are disappointed but unfortunately we had to draw the line somewhere and that was the ratepayer boundary.</p>
        
            <p>"The residents and the ratepayers of Hamilton are the ones that are currently paying for the garden so it's only fair that they continue to get in for free."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said there was an annual pass available to neighbours for $39 per adult, until the end of December. After that, it would be $50.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was possible there would be between a 40 and 60 per cent drop in visitors initially.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a new visitor centre, due to officially open on Tuesday, together with an upgrade to the Eygptian garden and a toilet block, cost $12 million and was funded out of Hamilton City Council's last long-term plan.</p>
