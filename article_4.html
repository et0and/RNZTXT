            <p>The reopening of a Hawke's Bay bridge this weekend marks a "milestone moment" for a rural community, nearly two years after its destruction at the hands of Cyclone Gabrielle, says a district council spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>The Fletchers Crossing Bridge in Wakarara reopened on Friday almost two years after it was destroyed in the February 2023 storm.</p>
        
            <p>Central Hawke's Bay District Council group manager for Community Infrastructure and Development, Mark Kinvig, said the local community was now reconnected with the rest of the region.</p>
        
            <p>"Reopening Fletchers Crossing Bridge is a milestone moment for our district as it brings back normality and ease to the community... it's not just about the structures - it's about the lives they support."</p>

            <p>He said the new bridge would be more resilient in future storms and offered other tourism and travel benefits, such as providing a more direct route to Sunshine Hut in the Ruahine Forest Park.</p>
        
            <p>The project was fully financed by the $11m North Island Weather Event Fund. Fletchers Crossing is one of the fund's four key Central Hawke's Bay recovery sites prioritised for repair.</p>
        
            <p>The $1m works completed on the bridge was just phase one of a three-part project to restore the bridge and surrounding roads over the next six months, at a total cost of $2.5m, Kinvig said.</p>
        
            <p>"The priority for my team was to get this bridge opened as soon as possible and to protect it from any future major events, that one-in-a-100-year storm event."</p>
