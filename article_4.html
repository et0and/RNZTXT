        <p>

            <p>The Whanganui District Council is pushing ahead with a buy-up of three properties in the CBD facilitating the development of a four-star hotel and carpark in the city.</p>
        
            <p>The move comes ahead of public hearings and deliberations on the draft long-term plan which asked for public feedback on a proposed council-led 60-bed hotel project</p>
        
            <p>Council agreed to buy the properties - worth about $4 million - near the corner of Ridgway Street and Victoria Avenue - using $3.5m from the Whanganui Endowment Fund with the remainder debt funded.</p>
        
            <p>The fund's property portfolio already includes about 40 properties with a value of about $45m.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive David Langford told councillors that buying the three properties would support a feasibility assessment for the hotel and carpark proposal, but that the investment stacked up whether a hotel development went ahead or not.</p>
        
            <p>He reminded councillors they had agreed to a plan to grow non-rates revenue to ease the burden on ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"The annual return on capital of this purchase will be about 5 percent or a net of $190,000 a year with room to improve this with a bit of management.</p>
        
            <p>"The return on the properties is good enough that it is a sensible addition to the city endowment portfolio whether the hotel occurs or not. I acknowledge the timing is not great and there will be perceptions that council is predetermining its position as part of the long-term plan [on the hotel], but I want to be explicit that is not the case."</p>
        
            <p>Council heard one of the properties - Wakefield Chambers - was a suitable anchor site for a hotel development and that the others could provide ancillary services including additional rooms and parking.</p>
        
            <p>Complicating decision-making for councillors was the fact the sale and purchase contract for two of the properties would go unconditional on 13 May.</p>

            <p>Councillor Rob Vinsen worried about buying the Whanganui Furnishings building as a potential carpark for the proposed hotel.</p>
        
            <p>"Why is this effective to consider this adds to a hotel by having a carpark where you've got to walk through the weather to get to it if you're a guest at that hotel?"</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Jenny Duncan thought the property buy-up was a bad look.</p>
        
            <p>"My concern is about the optics of this.</p>
        
            <p>"Why was the unconditional date not made after 7 June so we didn't conflate matters and look to the community that we were going ahead with something [prior to LTP deliberations]. I know what we're doing and I support it, but the timing is really poor."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Helen Craig acknowledged it was an awkward decision for councillors.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we have to leave the emotion aside and the influence we might feel from the public aside and decide on the facts."</p>
        
            <p>Craig made no secret that she was in favour of the eventual development of a hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Michael Law was uncomfortable with making a commercial decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe experts should be making these decisions and not us. We are not financial analysts. We shouldn't be making decisions on purchasing property."</p>
        
            <p>He felt there was not enough detail in the council officers' report and the return on investment did not seem high enough.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Josh Chandulal-Mackay said for him the investment stacked up and gave the council future options.</p>

            <p>But Vinsen - who failed with a motion for the decision to lie on the table until the next council meeting - said the property buy-up reinforced his view council should not be dabbling in business.</p>
        
            <p>"First of all to be discussing property purchasing and property acquisition on the front page of the Whanganui Chronicle next day is no way to run a business.</p>
        
            <p>"Business people know when to hold 'em and they know when to fold 'em and this is a time to fold 'em. No self-respecting property developer would do this."</p>
        
            <p>Vinsen believed there was an appetite for a hotel development in Whanganui, but it should be driven by a commercial operator not council.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Philippa Baker-Hogan said she could not support making a decision on the properties ahead of ratifying the long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>"In no way did I think I'd be opening my council papers yesterday and see that this was going to be in the public arena and we were going to be making a decision to purchase some property prior to making a decision whether we are going to go ahead with a decision [on the hotel] prior to the deliberations."</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Andrew Tripe agreed to a separate vote on each of the property acquisitions and all three were approved by a majority vote.</p>
