            <p>One person has been charged following a crash at an Auckland Christmas Parade where people were hit by a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>On 25 November 2023, five people were injured after a Burger Fuel-branded vehicle hit two pedestrians during the parade.</p>
        
            <p>Three people in the vehicle, including two children, were allegedly then assaulted by people in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City West Area Commander Inspector Allise Robertson saida 45-year-old man had been charged with two counts of careless driving causing injury.</p>
        
            <p>He would appear in Auckland District Court on 4 March.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said police had also investigated the alleged assaults that occurred after the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite extensive enquiries for CCTV, video footage or independent witnesses, we have not been able to corroborate these reports.</p>
        
            <p>"As such, police have concluded our inquiries into this incident and we have advised all parties concerned."</p>
        
            <p>Whau Local Board member Catherine Farmer, who was at the parade, said at the time she heard the MC yelling "stop" shortly before the car hit pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>"The MC started yelling out 'stop, stop, go back, stop!' and then I heard him say 'we've got to get Fire and Emergency here, we've got to get ambulances,'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then there was just a general melee."</p>
