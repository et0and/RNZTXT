            <p>Prominent Canterbury farming leader Colin Drummond from Erewhon Station has died.</p>
        
            <p>Drummond from the Canterbury high country passed away on the 11 December after what his family described as a brief but brutal illness.</p>
        
            <p>Drummond, who ran a clydesdale horse stud on the station, was the Mid-Canterbury representative for the Federated Farmers High Country Industry Group.</p>
        
            <p>On the farms Facebook page, his wife Erin Cassie said his death was a massive shock.</p>
        
            <p>"Not sure how we proceed without this one in a million mountain of a man beside me. But I know how lucky I have been to "do" life with a soul mate who completed me.</p>
        
            <p>"Its been a wild ride but I take comfort that his "better to burn out than rust out" mantra ensured his life was certainly no dress rehearsal."</p>
        
            <p>She said Colin's life would be celebrated on Tuesday 17 December at his home.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the death of Chris Allen, who died after a workplace accident on his Ashburton farm last week.</p>
