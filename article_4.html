            <p>Disgraced Blenheim gymnastics coach Gregory Pask has pleaded guilty to further charges of sexual offending.</p>
        
            <p>The well-known community figure appeared in Blenheim District Court again on Tuesday and entered guilty pleas to 32 further offences.</p>
        
            <p>Pask in December pleaded guilty to 29 charges of sexual offending against girls between 2014 and September last year.</p>
        
            <p>Police said at the time they believed there were more victims, as Pask had been in continual contact with children for years.</p>
        
            <p>Blenheim Gymnastics Club said it was shocked and appalled to learn of the serious sexual offending committed by one of its former coaches.</p>
        
            <p>Pask would be sentenced next month.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Ash Clarke of Marlborough CIB acknowledged the further guilty pleas and called on any other victims to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand it can be hard to come forward and report incidents of this nature, but we would like to reassure you police take these matters seriously and have a number of officers and detectives dedicated to these cases. We will ensure you have a safe space to report offending in confidence."</p>
