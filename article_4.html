            <p>A subtropical low and preceding fronts will move southwards over northern parts of the North Island from Monday, bringing easterly gales and periods of heavy rain, MetService warns.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch has been issued from 10pm in Northland, and from Tuesday morning in Auckland and Great Barrier Island as well as the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>Periods of heavy rain are also expected north of Kaikohe during Monday morning and afternoon, especially in the east.</p>
        
            <p>There is a high chance of the watch upgrading to a warning in Northland, but only a moderate chance in Auckland, Great Barrier Island, and the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>A strong wind watch has also been issued for Northland, Auckland, Great Barrier Island and Coromandel Peninsula from Tuesday morning, all with a moderate chance of being upgraded to a warning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService last week said it was likely Monday would see the first formal weather alerts of the year, and that has come to pass.</p>

            <p>Rain warnings are issued when the expected rainfall will be greater than 50mm within six hours or 100mm within 24 hours. A watch is issued when forecasters expect "conditions may deteriorate to the thresholds".</p>
        
            <p>Wind warnings are issued when speeds are expected to exceed 90km/h or there will be frequent gusts exceeding 110km/h.</p>
        
            <p>The thresholds can be adjusted temporarily "in collaboration with regional authorities to support more effective readiness, response or recovery activities".</p>
        
            <p>NIWA, which will take over MetService in a merger announced by Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Judith Collins last year, said "a downhill trend for the top of the North Island" was incoming thanks to a low-pressure system.</p>
