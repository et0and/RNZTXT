            <p>New Plymouth readers have escaped into novels and New Zealand non-fiction titles this summer, according to Puke Ariki and community libraries.</p>
        
            <p>On the fiction shelves, The Women by Kristin Hannah was the top summer read in physical and eBook categories, along with perennial favourites such as Lee Child, David Baldacci, Lucinda Riley and John Grisham.</p>
        
            <p>Breakout best-seller Bonnie Garmus' Lessons in Chemistry also featured in the fiction top 10.</p>
        
            <p>The life story of Pippa Latour, The Last Secret Agent, the last surviving special operations agent in France to get out alive after its liberation in WWII, was by far the most frequently issued non-fiction title.</p>
        
            <p>Autobiographies from actor Sam Neill, musicians The Topp Twins, and rugby start Ruby Tui also proved popular, as was Atomic Habits by James Clear - an indication of people's inclinations toward new year resolutions.</p>
        
            <p>Summer had also been busy with more than 61,800 visits counted across New Plymouth's libraries and to the Mobile Library Te Waka Pukapuka, since the start of December.</p>
        
            <p>Libraries manager Angela Jowitt said novels and self-improvement books resonated with readers right now.</p>
        
            <p>"Our readers appear to be loving escapes into other worlds and finding support and motivation for their New Year's intentions in our shelves and digital resources," Jowitt said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is also fantastic to see Aotearoa authors featuring in the top lists, particularly in non-fiction."</p>
        
            <p>Across the district's libraries, 150 children were also taking part in Puke Ariki's Summer Reading Programme, which encouraged youngsters to explore a reading journey through Te Waonui a Tāne - the forest of Tāne.</p>
        
            <p>The summer's popular children's picture books included The Dinky Donkey by Craig Smith, Lynley Dodd's Zachary Quack Minimonster and King of the Swamp by Catherine Emmett.</p>
        
            <p>Teenagers were picking up fantasy author Rick Riordan more than any other writer targeting young adults, with Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters and The Battle of the Labyrinth taking first and third most-issued spots.</p>
        
            <p>In second place was mystery series A Good Girl's Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson, whose popularity spiked after the release of the TV series on Netflix in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"A Puke Ariki library card unlocks hundreds of thousands of books, audiobooks, eBooks, streaming services and more," said Jowitt.</p>
        
            <p>"Readers of all ages and stages are always welcome at the central and community libraries, where they can browse an incredible range of stories and knowledge."</p>
