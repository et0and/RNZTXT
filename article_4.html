            <p>An ambulance transporting a patient to hospital has collided with a school bus in central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said one of its crew suffered minor injuries and has been taken to hospital after the crash on Newton Road, near Ponsonby at about 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>The bus was from Diocesan School for Girls and no pupils were injured.</p>
        
            <p>St John district operations manager Andy Everiss said the ambulance was transporting a patient to hospital at the time and they were transferred to another ambulance to continue the journey.</p>
        
            <p>Diocesan principal Heather McRae said another school bus had been following behind, so students were able to change to that bus to finish their trip.</p>
        
            <p>The school would carry out a health and safety report into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Everiss said it would cooperate with a police investigation into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there would likely be delays around Newton Road while the scene was fully cleared.</p>
