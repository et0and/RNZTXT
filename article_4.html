Those critical of a new ERO report focusing on teacher training have raised concerns about its methods.

            <p>Universities have rejected Education Review Office criticism of their teacher-training courses.</p>
        
            <p>In a report published on Monday, the ERO said 60 percent of the principals it interviewed said their new teachers were not ready to be in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>The report also found graduates from some universities felt better prepared than others, as did those from courses that involved more time in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>It called for an exit exam for graduating teachers, higher entry standards, and a push to attract the most academically able students.</p>
        
            <p>Alison Kearney, chairperson of Council of Deans of Education, which represents the country's teachers' colleges, said the ERO report was based on responses from a small number of new teachers who trained during the peak of the pandemic, when many were not able to spend the usual amount of time in classrooms before graduating.</p>
        
            <p>"We are concerned about ERO's use of a small-scale survey of less than 10 percent of new teachers and 12 percent of principals to make sweeping, system-level claims and to compare different education providers."</p>
        
            <p>It was normal for people to feel unconfident when they started a new job, Kearney said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is in keeping with research in other professional areas as well. Professions such as lawyers and engineers and psychologists, they all report similar things."</p>
        
            <p>The ERO report did not provide enough evidence to warrant increasing the amount of classroom "practicum" time, Kearney said.</p>
        
            <p>The Teaching Council required student teachers in a one-year teacher education programme - the norm for secondary teaching - to spend at least 80 days or 16 weeks in classrooms, and for those in three-year programmes the minimum was 120 days or 24 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Kearney also rejected the report's call for an exit exam for graduating teachers.</p>
        
            <p>"Exit exams are not in keeping with evidence-based practice," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Examinations are really good if you're trying to measure rote learning or, at their best, useful for surface-level recall rather than deep understanding. So for something as complex as teaching, I'm sure that people would agree that examinations would be inappropriate and not really of value."</p>
        
            <p>Universities already conducted a final assessment, which was mostly oral and covered complex areas of decision-making, Kearney said.</p>
        
            <p>New teachers' confidence in the job and their decision to stay or go were influenced by many factors, she added, noting that surveys showed a large number of teachers were unhappy with high workloads, lack of support and their pay rates - all factors that had nothing to do with their initial teacher education.</p>
