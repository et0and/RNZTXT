            <p>A primary school in Hamilton was in lockdown as police searched a nearby address this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they arrested a person after a pre-planned operation at an address in Frankton on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons were put in place and a local school was advised by Police to go into lockdown as a precaution," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>An alert on Frankton School's website just after 9am Monday advised parents and caregivers the school was in lockdown due to an "incident" near the school.</p>
        
            <p>"All children are safe and accounted for. We remain in lockdown," Frankton School acting principal Christine Lennon posted on the alert.</p>
        
            <p>About 40 minutes later, the lockdown ended.</p>
        
            <p>"We are now out of lockdown and all students, staff and persons on-site are safely accounted for. Everyone did extremely well and responded to instructions. A notice will be going out to parents/caregivers tonight to provide some more information about our emergency lockdown procedures," Lennon said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the cordons have been lifted. However, officers remain on the scene.</p>
