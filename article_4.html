            <p>Police said a hoax mayday call about a ship in danger tied up emergency services for several hours today.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they received a call about a vessel in danger off WhangƒÅrei Heads at about 10.45am.</p>
        
            <p>Agencies spent three hours investigating the call, said Northland Police Senior Sergeant Clifford Metcalfe.</p>
        
            <p>"We had multiple resources deployed from police and Coastguard looking for this vessel, including search and rescue boats and a fixed wing aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only were these assets tied up, but staff and volunteers were called out."</p>
        
            <p>If there had been a real emergency at the time, lives could have been in danger, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When Coastguard respond alongside us, it's important to remember that their volunteers often have to leave their work and study to respond.</p>
        
            <p>"It is incredibly frustrating for our staff who are there to help.</p>
        
            <p>"People need to respect the safety of others, and the people and services that are entrusted to keep them safe."</p>
        
            <p>Metcalfe said enquiries are being made into the source of the hoax calls.</p>
