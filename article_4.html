            <p>The lower North and South Islands are the biggest hotspots for whooping cough as an epidemic sweeps the country, official data shows.</p>
        
            <p>Health officials on Friday declared a whooping cough epidemic and put a nationally coordinated response in place.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 263 cases of whooping cough in the four weeks to 15 November - the highest number of cases over a month to date for all of 2024, Te Whatu Ora said.</p>
        
            <p>The latest data collated by ESR showed the highest rates of infection were in Wairarapa, Southern, Whanganui and Capital and Coast health districts.</p>
        
            <p>It broke down rates of infection in the four weeks to 8 November.</p>
        
            <p>Wairarapa had 13 cases, which was by far the highest rate at 25.4 cases per 100,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>That was followed by Southern at 11.6 (42 cases), Whanganui at 11.4 (8 cases) and Capital and Coast at 10.4 (34 cases).</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora was urging people to get vaccinated, and said babies are particularly vulnerable to the life-threatening infection.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 50 percent of pēpi who catch whooping cough before the age of 12 months need hospitalisation and 1 or 2 in 100 of those hospitalised pēpi die from the infection," said public health medicine specialist Dr Matt Reid.</p>
        
            <p>"While there have been no deaths so far during 2024, sadly, three infants died last year from whooping cough, and we want to stop that from happening again."</p>
