            <p>Strong winds at Wellington Airport have caused 15 flights coming in and out of the capital to be cancelled, and hundreds in the city are without power.</p>
        
            <p>Most flights had been able to operate normally, but wind gusts were causing landing difficulties for some flights, the airport said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Air New Zealand said flight NZ417 was returned to Auckland after it was unable to land from gusty weather, and customers would be accommodated on the next available service.</p>
        
            <p>Customers were advised to check their flights on the Air New Zealand app and website for updates.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, almost 250 properties were without power in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were working to fix the fault after the outage happened at 11.30am, affecting more than 20 streets in Petone.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Electricity said the outage was caused by damage to its overhead network equipment.</p>
        
            <p>The power was estimated to be restored by 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has forecast a heavy rain watch and a strong wind watch with gusts expected to reach up to 100km/h for Wairarapa, Wellington and the Marlborough Sounds through to 4pm on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The north-to-northwest winds may approach severe gale in exposed places, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain watches were also in place for the Westland ranges and the headwaters of the Canterbury lakes until 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, there was a strong wind watch for the Canterbury high country which expired at 3pm.</p>
