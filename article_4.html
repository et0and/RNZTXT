            <p>A beauty clinic has been found to have breached care standards when a woman received severe third-degree burns during a body contour beauty treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The Health and Disability Commission investigated after a woman complained a machine overheated while she was undergoing thermal shock lipolysis treatment at the clinic, in June 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The woman spent nearly a week in hospital as a result of the burn, and required a skin graft.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Commissioner Dr Vanessa Caldwell found the clinic did not provide adequate information before the treatment, and it did not respond appropriately when the woman first reported pain.</p>
        
            <p>The client reported that "her treatment was administered with a machine that the clinic knew had a faulty part that required replacement, and, as a result, she suffered a large third-degree burn on her abdomen. [She] said that this was extremely painful and required a skin graft...," the Commission's report said</p>
        
            <p>The beauty therapist's first aid response was also lacking, it found, as they provided an ice-pack for the burned woman, but did not put her burn under running water - as recommended by Hato Hone St John.</p>
        
            <p>The Deputy Commissioner said the clinic breached the woman's rights under the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights.</p>
        
            <p>She also criticised the clinic's risk management procedures, as a staff member had earlier been burned by the thermal shock lipolysis machine. However the clinic had continued to use the machine "without putting in place adequate safety measures."</p>
        
            <p>The Commission has released a list of recommendations for the clinic to improve client safety.</p>
