            <p>Police say they are supporting the people who were at home when three men broke into a Mission Bay property, on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said an investigation into the aggravated robbery was in the early stages.</p>
        
            <p>"No injuries have been reported. We are ensuring the victims are being provided with support," a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Three men entered the property and took a number of unspecified items.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a scene examination was continuing.</p>
        
            <p>They were alerted around 11.15pm on Thursday night, to an incident at the home on Selwyn Avenue in Mission Bay which is one of the most affluent suburbs in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Media, including Stuff and New Zealand Herald, are reporting the home is owned by Barry and Diane Rissetto who appeared on the 2019 NBR rich-list.</p>
