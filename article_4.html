            <p>Convicted sex offender James Parker has been refused parole for the fourth time - but the reasons for further delaying his release have been suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>Parker was jailed indefinitely in 2013 for sex offences against boys, committed while he was deputy principal of a Far North school.</p>
        
            <p>It was revealed during today's Parole Board hearing that when Parker is eventually released, it will be in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Parker told the board he accepted he would never teach again and would need to find work where he had no access to children.</p>
        
            <p>He said his dream was to find a job in the outdoors, such as farming, growing plants or working with animals.</p>
        
            <p>Parker said the five years of intensive treatment he had been through had been "life-changing".</p>
        
            <p>A Corrections officer said Parker's conduct was positive and he continued to work in the prison's management unit.</p>
        
            <p>Parole Board convenor Kathryn Snook said the board would see him again in November.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the discussion during today's 40-minute hearing was suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>Parker was 38 when he was sentenced in the Kaitāia District Court to preventive detention with a minimum non-parole period of seven years.</p>
        
            <p>Preventive detention means he can be released only when the Parole Board considers it safe to do so.</p>
        
            <p>He admitted 74 charges representing at least 300 occurrences of indecent acts, unlawful sexual connection and sexual violation involving boys aged 9 to 16.</p>
        
            <p>The offences occurred between 1999 and 2012.</p>
        
            <p>At the time the Crown described the damage done to his victims and the wider community as "incalculable".</p>
        
            <p>Justice Paul Heath said Parker's actions had damaged the trust not only of his pupils and their families, but potentially the trust all parents place in teachers.</p>
