            <p>A Hawke's Bay man has been charged after police say he attempted to meet an underage girl for sex.</p>
        
            <p>The 46-year-old man was arrested on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He faces three counts of indecent communication with a young person under 16, and one of travelling to meet a young person/sex grooming.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Alex MacDonald said the investigation was continuing, with national and regional online child exploitation policing units taking part.</p>
        
            <p>The case was an excellent reminder of the need to be vigilant around online safety for children and young people, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The school holidays would be a great time to sit down with your kids and have a conversation about how to stay safe online. You can find information on the Police website to help with those conversations."</p>
        
            <p>"We urge anyone with concerns about potential criminal behaviour targeting children or young people to get in touch with Police so that we can investigate."</p>
        
            <p>The man was scheduled to appear in Hastings District Court on Monday.</p>
