            <p>Watch - Police have arrested and charged a man with the murders of Auckland man Fuk-Fu Kwok, and his wife Mei Han Chong.</p>
        
            <p>Kwok, who was 66, was found dead at his Ellerslie home on Monday evening having suffered violent injuries, while Chong had been missing since then, along with their car.</p>
        
            <p>The 42-year-old Glenfield man charged with their murders is due to appear in Auckland District Court this morning, lead investigator Detective Inspector Scott Beard told media at Auckland Central Police Station.</p>
        
            <p>The arrested man was found in Hamilton on Thursday night.</p>

            <p>Police believe multiple people were involved in Kwok's murder, due to the nature of his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>They could not yet say the same about Chong, until her post mortem is carried out tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard remains at the Ellerslie address.</p>
        
            <p>There will be an increased police presence across Auckland as the investigations are ongoing, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage police are not ruling out further charges and arrests.</p>
        
            <p>He would not provide any more detail about the arrested man, as the matter is before the court.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of hours of CCTV footage were reviewed, and helped to lead to the arrest.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team identified activity near the Celtic Crescent homicide scene on the night of the alleged homicide, which has allowed us to scour hours and hours of CCTV footage, which located a vehicle of interest. We're of course devastated to locate Mrs Chong in these circumstances, and we're now providing support to a son who has lost both his mother and his father," Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle registration plates on Chong's car had not been found but based on CCTV footage it had different registration numbers at different times, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>At a briefing on Thursday Detective Inspector Beard told the media that police held grave fears for Chong and suspected that she was also a victim of foul play.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's son said it was totally out of character for her not to contact them.</p>
