        <h2>Fa'anānā Efeso Collins remembered a year on: 'It's hard to speak of him in the past tense'</h2>
        <p>
"It feels as if he's still with us, such was his influence on our lives," a Manukau councillor says.
</p>
        
            <p>Friends are remembering New Zealand Green Party MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins, a year after he died during an Auckland charity event.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā collapsed while participating in a charity run aimed at supporting local Pacific communities. He is survived by his wife, Vasa Fia Collins, and their two young daughters.</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā was born and raised in South Auckland's Otara, with his parents having migrated from Samoa to New Zealand.</p>

            <p>A dedicated advocate for the marginalised and the chairperson of the Otara local board, Fa'anānā was remembered at his funeral last year as a compassionate champion for the Samoan and South Auckland communities.</p>
        
            <p>Mariner Fagaiava won the charity event a year ago, but said that morning brings him "great sorrow".</p>
        
            <p>Fagaiava regrets not expressing how much Fa'anānā meant to him as a mentor and friend during their last phone call.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't fully processed what happened; it unfolded so quickly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think back to that day; [Fa'anānā's wife] Fia was absent, and it would have been considerate to delay releasing that news until his family could receive it first.</p>
        
            <p>"Winning was incredible, but then the news cameras arrived, and we found ourselves bombarded with media attention; in that moment, my heart went out to Fa'anānā's wife and daughters. I did my best to connect with them through mutual friends.</p>

            <p>"I want to send all my love to them; he was a part of everyone's lives but ultimately was a devoted husband and father. I believe his legacy continues through them."</p>
        
            <p>Friends of Fa'anānā are still grappling with the impact of his loss.</p>
        
            <p>Lotu Fuli, a councillor for Manukau, was mentored by Fa'anana and values their shared memories from high school and university.</p>
        
            <p>"There's truly no one like Fa'anana," she said. "He loved Fia and their daughters immensely, and she has the backing of our entire community.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been going through old photographs, sharing and resharing them. I've known Fe since our days at Tangaroa College, and this past year has been tough without him in our community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to speak of him in the past tense; it feels as if he's still with us, such was his influence on our lives."</p>
        
            <p>Fa'anānā was an advocate for community groups, particularly the queer community, which Seuta'afili Dr Patrick Thomsen, a senior researcher at the University of Auckland, noted. He helped Fa'anānā deepen his understanding of the rainbow Pacific community he actively supported.</p>

            <p>Seuta'afili described Fa'anānā as the perfect role model to address recent divides.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a unique individual; everyone has their strengths and talents, and his was uniting our community.</p>

            <p>"What I admired about him was his approach to engaging with communities. He held meaningful conversations and was genuinely open-hearted.</p>
        
            <p>"The developments in the country were ongoing, but he exemplified someone raised in a conservative environment who actively sought to learn about different perspectives and embraced them."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Josephine Bartley remembered collaborating with Fa'anānā on local labour committees and acknowledged how much his presence was missed in challenging times for Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"He transcended politics and council discussions, and that absence is felt now more than ever."</p>
