It remains a mystery where Tūi had been - or if someone was looking after her. Audio

            <p>A tabby cat that disappeared eight years ago from their owner's place in the northern suburbs of Wellington has been found again, to much surprise.</p>
        
            <p>Hilary Taylor said Tūī went missing in 2016 when she jumped the fence and disappeared into a neighbour's garden. She had only recently been adopted along with another SPCA cat.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a lot of searching for her, she couldn't be found.</p>
        
            <p>"I got a phone call from the local vet, he said we've got your cat Tūī here," Taylor told Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know where she was found. We assume it was local because it was a local vet. We believe some people found her and took her in."</p>
        
            <p>When Tūī was found in November, the vet scanned her microchip and found registration records which had her marked as missing.</p>
        
            <p>Listen: Tūī the cat comes back</p>
        
            <p>"She was already nine years old when she took off. So she's 17 now, which is a good age for a cat and I'm actually quite impressed that she managed to survive for eight years. We don't know if anybody was caring for her.</p>
        
            <p>"Apparently, the vet thinks she's in quite good condition, so maybe somebody was looking out for her, we just don't know."</p>
        
            <p>Although her features remain the same, her matted fur and size change did not make her instantly recognisable to Taylor.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'd seen her on the street I might've said 'Oh that looks like TTūī ', but I probably wouldn't have gone 'Oh look, there's Tūī !'"</p>
        
            <p>Tūī has been reunited with her "original partner in crime from the SPCA", another cat, too.</p>
        
            <p>"She did disappear on Saturday, and we thought 'Oh no' ... fortunately, she wandered back into the garage."</p>
