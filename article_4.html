            <p>The road up to Arnott Heights in Greymouth, where slips have left 50 homes isolated, is still closed to traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Geotechnical engineers had been working over the past few days to stabilise a "precarious" area of the Arnott Heights hillside.</p>
        
            <p>A major slip that came down about midnight on Monday left the area cut off to residents and motorists.</p>
        
            <p>There was further movement overnight on the shaky slope, resulting in some small slips.</p>
        
            <p>A Grey District Council spokesperson said teams were hoping to put concrete blocks in place to provide a safe passage for traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Residents with four-wheel drives were being allowed go up and down the hill.</p>
        
            <p>Transport was being provided for people without a suitable vehicle.</p>
