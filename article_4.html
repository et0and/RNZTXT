            <p>Gravity-defying cats, gurning donkeys and dogs in a flap all feature in this year's Comedy Pet Photo Awards.</p>
        
            <p>But a dog trying to squeeze through a small cat flap squeezed in as winner in a tight competition.</p>
        
            <p>Sarah Haskell snared 2024 top prize for her photo titled, "Not just for the cats!"</p>
        
            <p>The winning image was up against some fierce competition from seemingly headless horses to a dancing dog and gravity-defying cats.</p>
        
            <p>Haskell said she was thrilled to have been crowned this year's winner.</p>
        
            <p>"I am delighted that Hector and I have been part of it, and am tremendously proud to be a winner."</p>
        
            <p>In its fifth year, the annual photo competition aims to highlight the positive and vital role that pets have in our lives.</p>
        
            <p>Six judges determined the winner of the overall best photo based on "technical excellence" and the "amusing content and caption".</p>
        
            <p>Here's the winning image alongside the other category winners and finalists.</p>
