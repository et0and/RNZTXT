            <p>Doctors at Rotorua Hospital's emergency department have lost faith that management will deal with critical staff shortages, which they say are putting community safety at risk.</p>
        
            <p>In a letter to staff leaked to RNZ, the director of operations for the Lakes region, Alan Wilson, said the region was moving to a "single roster" for the emergency departments at Rotorua and Taupō, which was in danger of having to close due to the doctor shortage.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Rotorua clinicians have told RNZ they felt "blind-sided" by the "bombshell" directive, which will involve a two-hour return trip or overnight stays.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said it would now be consulting with staff "in the coming weeks".</p>
        
            <p>However, one senior ED doctor - whom RNZ has agreed not to name - said staff were sceptical.</p>
        
            <p>"To be frank, we have lost trust in Alan Wilson and have no faith in his ability to lead either Rotorua or Taupō hospital through this challenging time.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to this lack of trust, further engagement and 'consultation' will be difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"He has repeatedly undermined much of the hard work done by senior clinical staff and he appears to have no regard for the health and safety of our community."</p>
        
            <p>A business case for two extra full-time staff put forward by Rotorua ED earlier this year was rejected due to insufficient funding.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua Hospital is at risk of losing its accreditation from the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine to train specialists due to its own shortage of senior doctors.</p>
