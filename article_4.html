            <p>Police have launched a homicide probe after a body was found in Gulf Harbour by a fisherman.</p>
        
            <p>They are also asking for help in identifying the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, we have not been able to confirm the identity of the victim, but we can say they are a female of Asian-decent, possibly Chinese, and small in stature," Acting Detective Inspector Tim Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are asking anyone who may have information on a woman matching the description who they have concerns for to please get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority will be to then identify and notify the victim's next-of-kin."</p>
        
            <p>Police don't believe there is wider risk to the public and would not speculate on what has happened.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank those who have already come forward and given us information.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who was near the water in the last few days, or in the Gulf Harbour area, who saw anything suspicious or of concern should get in touch with Police as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"No piece of information is insignificant as we work to determine exactly what has occurred."</p>
