            <p>An Auckland builder will spend two years and seven months in prison after supplying a number of guns to the black market.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Colin Palmer was recently sentenced on 10 charges involving firearms, class A drugs, and explosives in Auckland District Court, police confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Palmer pleaded guilty to charges linked to the supply of 18 guns to unlicensed people, including a pistol made from a sawn-off rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>He also pleaded guilty to possessing explosives and 13 large-capacity prohibited magazines that should have been handed in during the buyback, Detective Inspector Albie Alexander said, and to supplying methamphetamine and cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>The offending was an example of a firearms licence holders actions overshadowing those of legitimate holders, Alexander said.</p>
        
            <p>"Palmer abused the privilege of holding a firearms licence to purchase and then divert a significant number of firearms to criminals.</p>
        
            <p>"His offending was highly premeditated for financial gain."</p>
        
            <p>Between April and August 2023, Alexander said Palmer purchased a large number of rifles and shotguns - not all the guns were able to be recovered and many remained in the black market.</p>
        
            <p>"Two firearms were found at the home of a patched gang member shortly after Palmer bought them from Auckland gun stores.</p>
        
            <p>"One rifle had been illegally cut down to a pistol and another had its serial number erased, but Police could retrieve it and linked it to Palmer who had purchased the rifle three months earlier."</p>
        
            <p>Palmer's actions would be easier to detect when the registry is fully in place, Firearms Safety Authority executive director Angela Brazier said.</p>
        
            <p>"Firearms dealers and licence holders are now actively recording details of sales and transfers and the movement of firearms is closely monitored for non-compliance."</p>
