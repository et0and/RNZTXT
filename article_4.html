            <p>A 42-year-old man has been arrested and charged after a recent spate of overhead power line thefts in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had received a number of reports of this nature across Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>They said the most recent incidents cut power to 79 homes near Pannell Avenue and left wires exposed near a kindergarten on Mcteigue Road.</p>
        
            <p>Since the weekend, there have been thefts on Halswell Junction, Mcteigue Road, Cable Street, Clifton Terrace, Mount Pleasant Road, Sparks Road, Shaw Avenue and Pannell Avenue, said police.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Roy Appley said the harm this kind of behaviour had the potential to cause was serious.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine if you were on your way to work, walking children to school or walking the dog and came into contact with exposed wires," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone gets hurt, including yourself.</p>
        
            <p>"You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return."</p>
        
            <p>Officers executed a search warrant on Tuesday morning at a Rangiora address in connection to recent overhead power line thefts from January and February in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a man, 42, was arrested and charged with theft and intentional damage causing danger to life.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have spoken with residents and businesses in affected areas and were asking the public for any information that could assist in identifying and locating those involved.</p>
        
            <p>Appley said in a previous instance of power line tampering, a neighbour heard the sound of an angle grinder and notified police, which led to an arrest.</p>
        
            <p>"If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it.</p>
        
            <p>"We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires - do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police urged residents to ring 111 immediately if they saw anyone acting suspiciously around power poles and lines, or 105 after the fact.</p>
