            <p>Hamilton City Councillor Andrew Bydder needs to publicly apologise for his use of the words "r******d" and "s*****c" in an expletive-laden rant online, a disability advocate says.</p>
        
            <p>Vision Impaired NZ national executive director for parents Dr Rebekah Graham said the use of the words in a derogatory manner made them ableist slurs.</p>
        
            <p>Graham - a Hamilton resident - is one of 10 people who have lodged a formal complaint over Bydder's online submission to Waipā District Council.</p>
        
            <p>Bydder, a first-term Hamilton councillor who lives in Cambridge, opened his submission on the placement of a third bridge in the town with: "What the f**k are you r******d s*****c c**ts doing?".</p>
        
            <p>He went on to insult Waipā mayor Susan O'Regan by saying: "Get off your fat arse and do your job", as well as writing that outgoing chief executive Garry Dyet "better be sacked before he retires".</p>
        
            <p>Graham said Bydder needed to publicly apologise and give a sizeable donation to both Cerebral Palsy NZ and IHC.</p>
        
            <p>"The word 'r******d' is an offensive ableist slur that discriminates against the intellectually/learning disabled community.</p>
        
            <p>"It has long since been discarded from use and is widely considered pejorative. It is considered by some in the community to be hate speech."</p>
        
            <p>She said the word "s*****c" was used by Bydder in a derogatory manner because it was intentionally used to offend people.</p>
        
            <p>"This word is an old-fashioned and offensive name for a person who has cerebral palsy. It is highly offensive to people within the cerebral palsy community and has no place in formal documentation.</p>
        
            <p>"No elected member of any local council should deride disabled people and their families in this way. We are not slurs. We are members of the public and we have a right to dignity and respect."</p>
        
            <p>Graham said as the mother of a disabled child, she was distressed at the comments.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me feel ill that other adults think of that way when they think of my child. It makes me incredibly distressed that my child gets used as a slur to demean other people, and that is not okay."</p>
        
            <p>O'Regan said she had received a flood of support and she considered Bydder and his supporters were the "overwhelming minority".</p>
        
            <p>She said she could not call for Bydder to resign, but said if one of her councillors "behaved in that sort of manner I would have some pretty frank discussions around their ability to continue to uphold standards that people expect of elected members".</p>
        
            <p>O'Regan said before the feedback she did not know Bydder and said he had never contacted her personally before with his concerns.</p>
        
            <p>She admitted Waipā had "mis-stepped" in earlier consultation over the placement of a third bridge but said she had apologised for that but it did not excuse Bydder's comments, which she said grabbed her attention for all the wrong reasons.</p>
        
            <p>A Hamilton City Council spokesperson said there were now 10 complaints about Bydder's conduct, including Hamilton mayor Paula Southgate, a mix of elected representatives from both councils, and members of the public.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff expect to have an assessment of the complaint on Thursday. Any further complaints of a similar nature can be considered against the initial assessment."</p>
        
            <p>The assessment is estimated to cost $700 and will determine whether an investigation was warranted or not.</p>
        
            <p>Bydder was unapologetic for the comments and said any councillors who had complained about him could "f**k off" because he had the right to freedom of expression.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the slurs on the disabled community, Bydder said he would make a donation when Waipā council paid $50 million to Cambridge residents for devaluing their homes with the bridge's proposed placement over four streets.</p>
        
            <p>Bydder said although he was not in one of the streets, he lived nearby and would be affected by traffic on the major arterial route if it went ahead.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had received 20 messages about the submission and only two were against. He claimed four Waipā councillors were also supporting him.</p>
