        <h2>Kauri dieback: Some Waitākere tracks may never reopen</h2>
        <p>
A popular Waitākere walking track has reopened, but it is unclear it majority of the tracks in the ranges will ever reopen following the spread of kauri dieback. Audio

            <p>An expert says it is unclear whether some walking tracks in the Waitākere Ranges will ever reopen following the spread of kauri dieback.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the popular Cascade Falls track has finally reopened after it was closed in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Five years ago it was estimated one in five trees in the Waitākere Ranges were infected with the disease.</p>
        
            <p>The pathogen infects roots, and stops the trees from getting water and important nutrients.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council senior kauri dieback advisor Stuart Leighton told Checkpoint most tracks were still closed, and it was unclear whether all would eventually reopen.</p>
        
            <p>But a survey in 2021 found the disease was moving slower than initially thought, he said, and most trees at the centre of the ranges were free of the pathogen.</p>
        
            <p>"We're making progress. It's a long journey," he said, but council was putting in the infrastructure to help improve kauri health.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were a few setbacks with storms like Cyclone Gabrielle that kept the tracks from opening sooner.</p>
        
            <p>"There's 11km of tracks reopened through some of the most beautiful kauri forest in the Auckland region. So it's fantastic to be able to welcome people back to that space."</p>
        
            <p>Most of the tracks in the Waitākere Ranges were still closed, however, Leighton said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the trees would be reassessed in a few years, but it was key to think in long-term time frames because kauri trees could live up to 1000 years.</p>
