            <p>Three young people have been charged following an armed robbery by people in masks, after a public tip off.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City CIB detective senior sergeant Chris Allan said about 9pm on Sunday police received a report of several masked people entering a commercial premises on Hillsborough Road, Mount Roskill.</p>
        
            <p>They were armed with weapons.</p>
        
            <p>"The group allegedly attacked the sole attendant and stole alcohol, cigarettes and money before leaving in a vehicle," Allan said.</p>
        
            <p>The victim received minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Allan said just before the aggravated robbery a person called police to report people in two vehicles acting suspiciously.</p>
        
            <p>"Responding to this matter, equipped with the information from the member of the public including registration plates, police were later able to locate two vehicles and apprehend the alleged offenders."</p>
        
            <p>Four people were taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>He described the robbery as "nasty" but praised the member of the public.</p>
        
            <p>"This information was critical in the swift response to this incident and apprehension of the alleged offenders. This is a great example of the community assisting police, leading to these offenders being held to account."</p>
        
            <p>Weapons and stolen property were recovered by police.</p>
        
            <p>A man and a woman, both aged 21, were charged with aggravated robbery and were due to appear in Auckland District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A 16-year-old would appear in Auckland Youth Court on 9 January charged with aggravated robbery.</p>
