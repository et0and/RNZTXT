            <p>Two teenagers have been arrested after fleeing police following a jewellery store robbery in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, police found a vehicle of interest relating to an aggravated robbery of the jewellery store on Onehunga Mall earlier that day.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Scott Armstrong said the robbery occurred at 4pm and a "large amount" of jewellery was stolen.</p>
        
            <p>At 10pm, the vehicle that allegedly fled the scene was found in Papakura.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff deployed into the area, locating the vehicle travelling through Manurewa and Eagle was soon providing observations from overhead," Armstrong said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police attempted to stop this vehicle on Roscommon Road, but it drove away at speed and was not pursued."</p>
        
            <p>Armstrong said while being watched from the air, the vehicle hit another vehicle, resulting in a minor collision but no injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Spikes were deployed on the South-Western Motorway but the vehicle continued to travel in an "erratic" manner, and exited at Massey Road.</p>
        
            <p>Spikes were again deployed near the Mt Wellington Highway.</p>
        
            <p>Police chased the vehicle towards Pakuranga and Armstrong said it was being "driven extremely erratically and fortunately no members of the public suffered any harm".</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle being chased collided with barriers at the intersection of Ti Rikau Drive and Reeves Road and the chase ended.</p>
        
            <p>"These offenders approached another member of the public's vehicle; however, our staff quickly got the pair, aged 15 and 17, into custody.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also recovered a large amount of jewellery in the vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>The 17-year-old male has now been charged with aggravated robbery, dangerous driving, failing to stop and two counts of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"He has also been charged in connection with a violent attempted robbery at a Mt Albert sports bar on 22 June.</p>
        
            <p>"Those charges include four counts of aggravated wounding, assault with intent to rob, committing a burglary with a weapon and assault."</p>
        
            <p>The 15-year-old has been charged with aggravated robbery and two counts of unlawfully taking of a motor vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>They are both expected to appear in Auckland Youth Court on Wednesday, and police will be opposing the older teen's bail.</p>
        
            <p>Armstrong said the alleged actions and violence used were appalling.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to actively investigate this sort of offending which causes a high level of harm to the business owners as well as the wider community."</p>
