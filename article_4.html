            <p>A child is in a critical condition after an incident at an Auckland pool.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services rushed to the Mt Albert Aquatic Centre about 4.15pm on Saturday, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it took one patient in a critical condition to Starship Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The centre posted on Facebook that there had been a medical event, resulting in the pools closing early.</p>
        
            <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience it may caused."</p>
        
            <p>The pools would reopen as usual at 7am on Sunday.</p>
