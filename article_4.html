            <p>A state of emergency has been declared in Dunedin and for the Clutha District, but a rain warning for east Otago has been downgraded to a "heavy rain watch".</p>
        
            <p>Roads have closed due to flood, residents have had to evacuate, slips have caused chaos, some residents have lost power and some bus routes in Dunedin have been cancelled, while others are operating at a reduced capacity.</p>

            <p>A red heavy rain warning originally set to go until 11pm Friday was eased about 8pm, and widespread rain for Southland had eased and the rain watch there lifed at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>MetService advised people to still stay up-to-date with the latest forecasts.</p>
