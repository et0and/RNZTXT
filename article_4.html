            <p>A man has been left with serious injuries after a road rage incident at a supermarket, and another has been arrested, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The assault at the Woolworths carpark in the Lower Hutt suburb of Wainuiomata happened about 10pm on Wednesday, police said, and they appealed for anyone to contact them if they saw what happened, had footage, or knew those involved:</p>
        
            <p>"In particular, we would like to speak to the occupants of a light-coloured Toyota Corolla, who may have recorded the incident on a phone, and the occupants of another vehicle who stopped and attempted to calm those involved in the incident," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"With the store open at the time and shoppers about ... we are confident there are other people who witnessed what occurred and may be able to help our enquiries.</p>
        
            <p>A 23-year-old man was charged with wounding with intent, and was scheduled to appear in Lower Hutt District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle he was driving was seized and would be forensically examined, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information was asked to call Police on 105, or to visit their Update Report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number 250205/0193. Information could also be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or on their website.</p>
