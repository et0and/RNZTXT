            <p>Two Napier schools were put into lockdown on Thursday afternoon after reports of a person with a weapon being seen nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to reports of a "disorder" on Tait Drive at 2.15pm, a police spokesperson said, and it was believed a weapon had been seen.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police were on Tait Drive, the spokesperson confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"There are cordons in the area and locals are asked to respect these until the incident is resolved."</p>
        
            <p>Motorists should avoid the Kennedy Rd and Tait Drive area in particular, the spokesperson said as congestion was expected.</p>
        
            <p>Parkside Adventist Christian School said on social media, students were allowed to go home just before 3pm, but needed to avoid Tait Drive as it was closed.</p>
        
            <p>The school earlier said it had been put in lockdown "until further notice".</p>
        
            <p>Porritt Primary School also said on social media it was in lockdown after being advised to do so by the Ministry of Education.</p>
        
            <p>"Our spaces are secure and our students are safe. We cannot lift this lockdown until given the all clear by the NZ police."</p>
        
            <p>Parents should not come to the school to collect their children, Porritt Primary School principal Maaka Papuni said, as rooms couldn't be unlocked for safety reasons.</p>
