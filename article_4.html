            <p>The reopening of a custody unit on Auckland's North Shore will reduce the time frontline staff will spend transporting people in custody according to police.</p>
        
            <p>The Waitematā East District Custody Unit will be used for operations across the North Shore and Rodney district.</p>
        
            <p>The facility began accepting detainees on Tuesday morning with Police Commissioner Richard Chambers, Minister of Police Mark Mitchell and Waitematā District Commander Superintendent Naila Hassan in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"Waitematā is a vast district geographically and it's important my staff aren't unnecessarily taken off the road for lengthy periods of time," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"The new District Custody Unit will mean reduced travel times for staff working as far north as Wellsford, down to Devonport."</p>
        
            <p>"At the end of the day we'll have frontline staff back out there faster working to keep the community safe."</p>
        
            <p>With high tech CCTV and intercom systems, the unit will reduce costs and processing times for officers.</p>
        
            <p>"The facility is technologically advanced and future-focused for our custody staff," Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Custody Units are an important part of managing people in our care and custody safely.</p>
        
            <p>"In many instances those people in custody require intensive monitoring, and features such as high-quality CCTV and intercom systems will help custody staff."</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to see the use of technology to make savings and efficiencies, such as the high-quality audio-visual link suite installed.".</p>
        
            <p>"In many instances for those detainees appearing in court remotely this will remove some costs and complexities associate in transporting them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The facility had been decommissioned in 2013 but has now re-opened to help police manage the more than 120,000 people put into custody each year throughout New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to find ways to adapt to the growing demand and population across communities in Waitemata," Superintendent Hassan said.</p>
        
            <p>"This facility will be supported by sworn police staff, alongside additional Authorised Officers recruited into the roles."</p>
