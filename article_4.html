            <p>A dumping of snow overnight is promising good things for skifields in the South Island, though there are warnings for those hitting the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander announced it would cancel all ferry sailings from 8.30pm Tuesday until Thursday morning due to large swells and poor conditions in Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy swell warning remains in place until 3am Wedneday in Wairarapa between Turakirae Head and Mataikona.</p>
        
            <p>Road snowfall warnings were in force overnight for the Desert Road (SH1) in the North Island and for Lewis Pass (SH7), Arthur's Pass (SH73), Porters Pass (SH73), Lindis Pass (SH8), Crown Range Road, and Milford Road (SH94).</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi/Transport Agency said Lindis Pass (SH8) from Omarama to Tarras was closed due to heavy snow.</p>
        
            <p>Cardrona and Treble Cone general manager Laura Hedley told Morning Report there would be a bit more snow today but most of it fell Monday and overnight into Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to have a big snow fall right before the school holidays come."</p>
        
            <p>This season was "night and day" compared to last winter, she said.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday they had been expecting 20cm of snow.</p>
        
            <p>"When it just kept snowing yesterday, all day, when we got to 50cm the team were pretty excited."</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told Morning Report the snow was expected to move to the upper South Island today and eventually on to the central North Island later on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a snowy day yesterday and overnight."</p>
        
            <p>The swells around the Cook Strait and greater Wellington area would pick up Tuesday, reaching up to 6m before calming down by Thursday, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're expecting them to start picking up as the day (Tuesday) goes on.</p>
        
            <p>"For us on the ground the weather is expected to start easing," she said.</p>
