            <p>One of the country's biggest office blocks is being sold to a Hong Kong-China company.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi Property has reached a conditional agreement to sell the 38 storey Vero Centre in Auckland to the unnamed company for $458 million.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Clive Mackenzie said the building had been a centrepiece of its portfolio but no longer fitted its business plans.</p>
        
            <p>"It is no longer core to strategy, given the company's focus on creating retail-led mixed-use centres."</p>
        
            <p>He said the company was recycling its capital.</p>
        
            <p>"Once settled, the funds raised from the sale of the Vero Centre will be used to repay bank debt and then re-invested into other initiatives."</p>
        
            <p>The sale price was a discount of 1.9 percent to its valuation of last September, but Kiwi Property said it had returned 11 percent on its investment since it acquired the building in 2001.</p>
        
            <p>The deal needs approval of the Overseas Investment Office.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi has been developing build-to-rent long term accommodation at the Sylvia Park shopping centre, and was also developing a new town centre south of Auckland in the small settlement of Drury.</p>
