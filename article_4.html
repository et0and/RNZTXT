        <h2>Whangārei seals twin-city agreement with Ra'iātea in French Polynesia</h2>
        <p>
Ra'ātea, about 230km west of Tahiti, is regarded as a likely starting point for the Polynesian migrations that led to the settlement of Hawaii and Aotearoa.

            <p>A Northland council has sealed a twin-city agreement with one of the most culturally significant islands in Polynesia.</p>
        
            <p>The signing, by Whangārei mayor Vince Cocurullo and three mayors of Ra'ātea, took place at Whangārei's Terenga Paraoa Marae on 12 December.</p>
        
            <p>Ra'ātea, about 230km west of Tahiti, is part of what is now known as the Society Islands in French Polynesia - but for many centuries it was the political and spiritual hub of eastern Polynesia.</p>
        
            <p>It is also regarded as a likely starting point for the Polynesian migrations that led to the settlement of Hawaii and Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo said the twin-city relationship was the brainchild of Whangārei District Council kaumātua Taipari Munro, who put the idea to mayors in Ra'ātea.</p>
        
            <p>"They jumped at it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo said the mayors had spent some time in Northland on a fact-finding trip, seeing what the region had to offer in the way of cultural commonalities and business connections, and what Ra'ātea could offer in return.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about whānau. We're all family really. It's the idea of connecting back to Ra'ātea."</p>
        
            <p>He expected there would be a return visit to Ra'ātea late next year.</p>

            <p>Cocurullo said twin-city relationships fostered mutual understanding and long-term friendship between countries.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the exchange of ideas and culture, they often brought benefits in trade and tourism.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei also has a twin-city agreement with Haikou, the capital of Hainan, an island province of China.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kuta kaumātua Matutaera Clendon said the small island of Rangiatea, off Mangahawea Bay in the Bay of Islands, was named after Raʻiātea by early Polynesian arrivals in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Archaeological digs at Mangahawea Bay have uncovered evidence of one of New Zealand's earliest human settlements.</p>
