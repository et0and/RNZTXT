            <p>A dive-bombing competition has relocated after a person died jumping into Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Regional qualification heats for a national dive-bombing competition have been relocated after a person was killed jumping from a historic crane there on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The person jumped off the historic crane that is permanently moored at the waterfront on Friday afternoon, and a rƒÅhui has been put in place.</p>
        
            <p>The first qualifying round for the Manu World Championship was scheduled to take place at a nearby diving platform on the waterfront this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said following the tragic death, the event, which aims to promote safety in popular water sports, will now be held at the regional aquatic centre in Kilbirnie.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, competitors and manu enthusiasts are being warned to check the water is clear of people before they jump in this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Water Safety New Zealand chief executive Daniel Gerrard said diving into a pool was different from the sea, but safety should still be top of mind.</p>
        
            <p>Before competitors jump, they should always check the water depth, and that they are clear of the pool edge as well as other swimmers.</p>
        
            <p>"You need to make sure you're not going to land on anybody, and that you're not going to hit the side of the pool.</p>
        
            <p>"We just encourage everybody to stop and have a think about the conditions, stop and have a think about the environment they're going into and and make sure they come home."</p>
