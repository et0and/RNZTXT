            <p>Auckland police say three people have been arrested after the discovery of a loaded, 3D-printed gun.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were stopped by a member of the public on Te Irirangi Drive in South Auckland, about 6.20am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>He told the officers he had been drinking with a group at the Manukau Velodrome, but one of them pointed a gun at him before they had left in a BMW.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were able to locate the BMW, but the driver then attempted to drive away in the car after being ordered to stop.</p>
        
            <p>His vehicle was then stopped after driving over bollards, with the 29 year old driver fleeing on foot, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers arrested the man and found ammunition, cannabis, a loaded magazine and a makeshift taser in his vehicle, they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Another vehicle travelling with the BMW was also stopped, and two women were arrested. Police said the officers found a loaded 3D printed gun in the second vehicle, matching items found that had been in the BMW.</p>
        
            <p>It was good to have a dangerous weapon taken out of the community, Inspector Rakana Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is yet another example of great proactive Police work, which creates a safer community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will continue to patrol this area and are working with our partner agencies to ensure members of the public can be safe and feel safe while going about their business."</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old has been scheduled to appear in Manukau District Court on Monday, to face charges of presenting a firearm at a person, unlawful possession of a firearm, failing to stop and dangerous driving.</p>
