            <p>A 13-year-old girl who fell and hit her head while ice-skating on a school outing has died.</p>
        
            <p>Kymani Hiley-Hetaraka suffered an unsurvivable head injury after falling at Alpine Ice Sports Centre in Christchurch on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to hospital in a critical condition following the fall.</p>

            <p>The school's principal Dr Peggy Burrows this morning confirmed Kymani had died from her injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Kua whetūrangitia koe. Return, take your place amongst the stars along with your ancestors," Burrows said on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Kymani Hiley-Hetaraka, a beloved member of our school community. Kymani was a vibrant and cherished ākonga who touched the lives of many with her kindness, aroha and beautiful spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important at this time that we support each other and take care of each other. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hiley-Hetaraka whānau at this time."</p>
        
            <p>A social media post by a family member said: "It is with heavy broken hearts that we would like to let our Whānau Hetaraka and friends know of the tragic passing of our taonga Kymani Mana Hetaraka age 13 in Christchurch."</p>
