            <p>Napier City Council has given life support to the Hawke's Bay Tourism agency, as councillors voted to contribute a share of the $1 million needed to meet its minimum operating budget.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council and Central Hawke's Bay District Council had already voted to back Hawke's Bay Tourism with operational grants of $462,500 and $75,000 respectively.</p>
        
            <p>Napier's contribution of $450,000 was welcomed by Hawke's Bay Tourism chair George Hickman who said the last few months had been challenging for the organisation and its staff.</p>
        
            <p>"We have lost some staff because of the uncertainty," Hickman said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is positive news. It gives us a lifeline to maintain Hawke's Bay Tourism," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are extremely grateful to the three councils for giving us enough money to keep the light on while we find other funding sources."</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the Minister for Tourism and Hospitality Louise Upston announced on Thursday a $3m fund from the International Conservation and Tourism Visitor Levy to be used to attract international visitors to the regions.</p>
        
            <p>Upston said she expected the regions to join up to accelerate work to promote their wider region, so visitors have opportunities to "explore multiple parts of our wonderful country".</p>
        
            <p>Hickman said they would "immediately be working on how Hawke's Bay could access the funds to supplement what the councils have already committed".</p>
        
            <p>The money is needed after Hawke's Bay Regional Council announced late last year that it would be pulling its funding for the regional tourism organisation from June 2025.</p>
