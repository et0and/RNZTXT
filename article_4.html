            <p>A recent poll showing a hung parliament was not what the government was seeing on the ground, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>The Post/Freshwater Strategy poll shows National slipping four points since the October 2023 election</p>
        
            <p>The Freshwater Strategy poll isn't a member of the Research Association New Zealand (RANZ) industry body.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not what we're seeing and I'm very comfortable with the level of support we've got from the New Zealand people," Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>He said people saw the work being done on the economy, crime and education.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to continue to work incredibly hard."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon told Morning Report he disagreed his government was to blame for making the economy worse in the past year.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no doubt about it, a year into our government the people and the economy are much better of than they would have been.</p>
        
            <p>"We're doing everything we can to drive growth into the economy."</p>
        
            <p>Unemployment was at 4.8 percent and forecast to peak at 5.2 percent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But Luxon said the coalition had done a "really good job" getting spending under control.</p>
        
            <p>Inflation was down and interest rates were heading down, the "next challenge" was to grow the economy and create and retain jobs, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got work to do."</p>
