            <p>Two injured climbers are likely to spend another night at a hut on Aoraki/Mount Cook as rescuers are still unable to reach them.</p>
        
            <p>Police were alerted after the climbers made it to a remote alpine hut and called the Department of Conservation on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday evening, police said the hut was on the mountain itself and more than 2000 metres altitude.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to current weather conditions, Search and Rescue personnel have not been able to extract the pair from the mountain at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>The police spokesperson said the weather was continuously being monitored for a suitable weather window.</p>
        
            <p>"The Aoraki Mt Cook Alpine Rescue Team remain in communication with the two people who have sufficient food and water for an extended stay."</p>
        
            <p>MetService said weather at Mount Cook on Wednesday was partly cloudy with showers. There were northwesterlies, strong at times.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday's weather was not looking good.</p>
        
            <p>MetService was predicting heavy rain at times with thunderstorms possible from the morning, clearing in the evening.</p>
        
            <p>There was also likely to be northerly winds, easing in the afternoon.</p>
