        <h2>Major sewerage line threatened by slip on cliff metres from SH2</h2>

Thousands of cars pass the spot, along the Hutt River Te Awa Kairangi, each day.

A slip at the top of a 6-7m high cliff alongside the Hutt River at Tait훮, is eroding ground just metres from State Highway 2, behind the trees on the left. A major sewage pipe runs under the walking-bike path.

            <p>A major sewerage pipe appears to be at risk from a slip eroding a cliff along the Hutt River Te Awa Kairangi.</p>
        
            <p>The slip is also just metres from the edge of busy State Highway Two, below the road and between it and the river.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of cars pass the spot each day.</p>
        
            <p>It is much closer again to the sewerage pipe, which runs under a walking-biking path at the top of the 6-7m high cliff.</p>
        
            <p>Any rupture might send sewage into the popular swimming spot at Tait훮 Rock.</p>
        
            <p>"Slip remediation will be complex and costly," said the Greater Wellington regional council.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water says engineers assessed the slip in 2022 but it has not old RNZ what they found.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been aware of this erosion near Tait훮 Rock since 2010 and its potential impact on the wastewater pipe," Wellington Water said in a statement on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The council's take was a bit different: "The slip near Tait훮 Rock was caused by erosion at the base of the riverbank in 2014," it said.</p>
        
            <p>The erosion began encroaching on the path in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Neither agency made any mention of doing any work to try to slow down or stop the slip.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll continue to work with other infrastructure providers in closely monitoring the situation," Wellington Water said.</p>
        
            <p>Fixing it might require an agreement and funding between it, the water agency and NZTA, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>It most recently discussed the slip with the transport agency in December, and with Wellington Water in May last year and January this year.</p>
        
            <p>"WW is responsible for wastewater pipes between the path and State Highway 2," it told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>It strengthened barrier fencing around the slip edge late last year and put up warning signs.</p>
        
            <p>It would soon "rearrange concrete blocks previously placed at the slip edge".</p>
        
            <p>"Greater Wellington actively monitors this slip and will inform WW and NZTA of any changes."</p>
