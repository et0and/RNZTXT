            <p>A New Zealand Defence Force aircraft brought back 52 New Zealanders on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) confirmed the flight from Noumea landed in Auckland shortly before 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>However, there were some people who were unable to get to central pick-up points for the flight, MFAT said.</p>
        
            <p>"With New Caledonia in a state of emergency, including a national curfew, travel has been restricted," a spokesperson for MFAT said.</p>
        
            <p>That meant people outside of Noumea could still be trying to get to the pick-up points, they said.</p>
        
            <p>A final repatriation flight is planned for tomorrow for the remaining people who wish to return to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe this to be fewer than 20 New Zealand citizens."</p>
        
            <p>In the past week the NZDF had brought more than 300 people out of Noumea, many of them New Zealanders, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>Seven people have died in the riots, which were sparked by a controversial electoral reform that some feared would weaken the indigenous Kanaky vote.</p>
        
            <p>France said it was sending seven more mobile military units as reinforcements in New Caledonia.</p>
        
            <p>The Presidential Palace also said a state of emergency would end, as planned, on Tuesday at 5am local time (6am NZT).</p>
        
            <p>The arrival of an additional 480 gendarmes will bring the number of French security forces in the territory to about 3500.</p>
