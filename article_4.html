            <p>There are "critical" internal health and safety risks at WorkSafe, with very high staff turnover and a stalled restructure.</p>
        
            <p>The restructure is the second in a few months, with the first cutting 128 jobs at the 700-strong agency in February, and staff are now in limbo.</p>
        
            <p>Their main union is also raising the possibility of further job cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"The People, Health and Safety risk remains critical due to the uncertainty for kaimahi regarding the organisation's structure," according to the agency's latest quarterly report.</p>
        
            <p>"This has created higher turnover and purposefully unfilled vacancies."</p>
        
            <p>The report, for the three months ending 30 June - said staff attrition had been running at almost 30 percent for the past six months, although this was partly due to the cuts in February.</p>
        
            <p>The second restructure is now overdue, and has been caught up in pre-consultation talks with the PSA union.</p>
        
            <p>"PSA have been fully briefed on the upcoming change proposal," WorkSafe said today.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA said it was "concerned that job losses are being proposed by WorkSafe".</p>
        
            <p>"We do not agree this is necessary. We believe WorkSafe can achieve a more efficient structure without the loss of jobs," it told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>But WorkSafe said while it had not made any decisions about its structure, it was considering "various options".</p>
        
            <p>The workplace health and safety regulator began axing jobs and shedding activities, after reporting a $17 million deficit last year.</p>
        
            <p>It has reversed that with a $3m surplus for the year to July, and hit 13 out of 13 of its targets, despite spending $1.8m less on delivering services, its quarterly report said.</p>
        
            <p>It was a period when changes were "expected to positively influence some of the strategic risks", said the report.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe now says its second restructure proposal will go out late this month, and staff will be the first to know.</p>
        
            <p>"We will have a number of support options available to kaimahi."</p>
        
            <p>Part of the uncertainty around the restructure is due to a successful union legal challenge to lack of consultation in a restructure at the Ministry of Education. Another challenge has succeeded at TVNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"The original timing for our upcoming organisational change proposal was deferred due to pre-consultation engagement with the PSA in line with the recent Ministry of Education determination," WorkSafe said today.</p>
        
            <p>The PSA said WorkSafe was required to work with its members, who wanted input on the new structure.</p>
        
            <p>The uncertainty has been compounded by a health and safety sector review by minister Brooke van Velden.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe has just introduced a new strategy and new six-point priority plan - but it does not yet have a new way to deliver them, a year since its first restructure began.</p>
        
            <p>A new shape is emerging of a pared-back agency trying to bolster its investigation and legal resources.</p>
        
            <p>Its quarterly report said 18 out of 20 recommendations in a baseline review had been done. It also has a new chief executive and three new directors.</p>
        
            <p>Staff numbers had "stabilised" at 595, which is 20 percent lower than last year.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation's surplus was helped by spending $6m less on staff than budgeted for, and re-jigging its IT overhaul.</p>
        
            <p>While back-office cuts have carried on, adding bodies to the front-line has been harder - front-line inspector numbers have stalled at about 200.</p>
        
            <p>A recent review of its prosecution function found the load on inspectors translated into rushed deadlines for the capable legal team.</p>
        
            <p>The agency spent $1.8m less on core delivery than expected, "due to more vacancies and greater attrition during the organisational change, and strong cost controls".</p>
        
            <p>But some things that previously were a priority have been halted, including a long-delayed overhaul of ineffective regulations to try to make plant - machines, vehicles - safer; and a reduced focus on work-related transport deaths and injuries, after saying in 2020 it would pay more attention to this.</p>
        
            <p>The ACC-funded programme has already shrunk by almost $4m, reducing a funding stream for some industry organisations that partnered with WorkSafe. However, ACC has said it may pick those up when it takes back the programme, which significantly undershot its goals.</p>
