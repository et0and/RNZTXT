            <p>Philip Polkinghorne's obsession with sex worker Madison Ashton drove him to murder his wife, says the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>The former eye surgeon is accused of killing Pauline Hanna in 2021, while he claims her death was suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Reading her closing address, Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock aimed to convince the 11-person jury that Polkinghorne killed Hanna on 5 April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Jurors had relived that day in vivid detail over the past seven weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna had injuries on her nose and skull, and bruises on her arm.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne's defence offered various explanations - that she bumped her head, or that her personal trainer grabbed her by the arm.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock thought those explanations were too convenient.</p>
        
            <p>"So far she's been gripped, she's banged her nose, and now she's banged her head," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"What are the chances that she has both become suicidal and had this bumpy old time that has injured her in all these different ways immediately prior to her death?"</p>
        
            <p>McClintock zeroed in on what she called the most damning evidence against the defendant.</p>
        
            <p>"The single most significant piece of evidence in this trial is that Dr Polkinghorne had tried to strangle Pauline Hanna before," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"She told her best friend about it in January 2020."</p>
        
            <p>Given the couple's history, McClintock said it was unlikely Hanna would lie about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, the suggestion [from the defence] seems to be: maybe she lied about it to them, maybe it's the alcohol talking... But why?"</p>
        
            <p>"She did nothing in relation to Dr Polkinghorne but defend him, paper over his bad behaviour. 'Oh, he's not that bad, I love him, he loves me.' Why would she lie about this?"</p>
        
            <p>She told jurors that Hanna feared her husband.</p>
        
            <p>A year before her death, in a message to friend and coworker Margaret White, Hanna had described the defendant as "beastly."</p>
        
            <p>"Hanna said to her: 'I just need you to know, if anything happens to me.' Despite the fact she loved him, 'I just need you to know if something happens to me...' Well, just over a year later, something did happen to her," McClintock said.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the trial, jurors heard intimate details of Polkinghorne's life - his financial issues, his meth use, and his ongoing affair with Australian sex worker Madison Ashton.</p>
        
            <p>McClintock suggested those challenges reached boiling point on 5 April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"He had become increasingly angry and agitated, he's obsessed with Madison Ashton, he's haemorrhaging money," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any one or more of these support the logical conclusion that these two argued about something that night, or these issues boiled over."</p>
        
            <p>In the years leading to Hanna's death, McClintock said the defendant's infatuation with Ashton became obsessive.</p>
        
            <p>"He's clearly obsessed with Madison Ashton, on one hard drive alone he had 4222 saved images of Madison Ashton."</p>
        
            <p>And she said that obsession drove him to murder.</p>
        
            <p>"Pauline Hanna was in the way. This dream life he had with Madison Ashton couldn't be reconciled with the life he had at home with Pauline Hanna."</p>
