            <p>Three teenagers have been rescued from the Kawerau River in Queenstown, a body of water which has grade 5 rapids.</p>
        
            <p>The three males entered the river upstream of Rafters Road in Gibbston and immediately got into difficulty. Police were called to the area about 3.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>Area prevention manager senior sergeant John Fookes said one managed to get himself safely onto rocks, but the other two in the group were swept a short distance down the river.</p>
        
            <p>The second teenager was able to get to a bank on the opposite, inaccessible side of the river, while the third teenager was pulled out by a witness who jumped down a bank to render assistance.</p>
        
            <p>Fookes said further down the river were the grade 5 Nevis Rapids which were incredibly unforgiving.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the treacherous nature of the body of water, a rescue helicopter was dispatched and within half an hour was hovering by each of the three swimmers and rescuer so they could climb aboard to safety, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fookes said this was an incredibly close call for the young men, and it was extremely lucky someone saw what was happening and heard the screams for help.</p>
        
            <p>Had the trio been swept any further downstream, emergency services would have been dealing with an entirely different scenario, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone swimming in rivers or exploring outdoors to do research first and treat the environment with respect.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to thank all those involved in the rescue, and the people who were so quick to raise the alarm.</p>
