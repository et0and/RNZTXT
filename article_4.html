            <p>Two brothers have admitted their roles in the death of Shayden Perkinson on the morning their trial was to start.</p>
        
            <p>Samson Manuel pleaded guilty to murder; Bronson Manuel admitted to injuring with intent to injure.</p>
        
            <p>The brothers were remanded in custody and will be sentenced in July.</p>
        
            <p>For nearly two years, Shayden Kenana Rua Perkinson's whānau have endured an agonising wait for justice.</p>
        
            <p>But, on the morning the long-awaited trial was set to begin, things took a positive turn with two brothers at the centre of the case admitting they were responsible for his death.</p>
        
            <p>Bronson, 31, and Samson Thomas Manuel, 26, were due to stand trial in the High Court at Whangārei for their roles in the death of Shayden Perkinson at the Gull Service station in Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>Perkinson's death caused outrage among the community after it was reported the 25-year-old had stepped in to help his cousin who was approached by the Manuels while getting cash from an ATM in April 2023. He was fatally stabbed and died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Perkinson was labelled a "hero" for protecting his cousin.</p>
        
            <p>Hundreds of people turned out to Perkinson's tangi and a peaceful protest was organised voicing concerns around escalating violence in the city. There were multiple witnesses present in a nearby carpark at a car event and his death was captured on CCTV and phones.</p>
        
            <p>Following the homicide, Bronson and Samson were arrested and charged with murder and pleaded not guilty in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after, their relative, Mickey, was charged with accessory to the fact to murder after it was alleged he drove the brothers to a location in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday morning, the trio appeared in the High Court at Whangārei before Justice Jane Anderson and a large crowd of Perkinson's whānau.</p>
        
            <p>Samson pleaded guilty to murder, Bronson to an amended charge of injuring with intent to injure and Mickey had his charge withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown advised Justice Anderson some areas of the summary of facts and details of what happened that night will be finalised on the day of sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>The brothers were remanded in custody and will appear for sentence on 1 July.</p>
