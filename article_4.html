        <p>
Protecting the saltmarsh - a habitat to birds, fish and reptiles - is essential to maintaining biodiversity, advocates say.

            <p>Volunteers have planted more than 500 buffer plants to help protect the ecologically significant Pātea saltmarsh in South Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>The saltmarsh covers several hectares along the tidal reaches of the Pātea River and is the largest area of ribbonwood/sea rush vegetation between the Manawatū River and the Tongapōrutu estuary in North Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>The South Taranaki District Council organised the planting, which was timed to coincide with World Environment Day.</p>
        
            <p>Reforestation co-ordinator Joe Churchman said the saltmarsh played a crucial role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
        
            <p>"The saltmarsh is a habitat to bird species, freshwater fish and reptiles. Protecting and restoring the saltmarsh is essential to maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance."</p>

            <p>Saltmarsh habitats were rare in Taranaki, reinforcing the significance in preserving the site in the best possible condition, Churchman said.</p>
        
            <p>The Pātea saltmarsh was included in the Taranaki Regional Council's Key Native Ecosystem programme, and the two councils were working together with the community to protect the marsh which was classified as "acutely threatened".</p>
        
            <p>"Our efforts will focus on fencing off the saltmarsh to prevent damage from livestock, buffer planting to enhance the habitat and improve water quality, as well pest plant and animal control," Churchman said.</p>
        
            <p>"Monitoring plots will also be set up to better understand how the area is changing over time."</p>
        
            <p>The saltmarsh can be seen while crossing over the Pātea River bridge on State Highway 3 at the southern end of the town.</p>
