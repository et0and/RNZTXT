            <p>Three men have been arrested in connection to the murder of a man in his 80s and the arson of his Stokes Valley home last year.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched in November after one of three arsons at the Hanson Grove block of flats.</p>
        
            <p>Ian David Moller, 82, was critically injured and died four days later.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third attack on Hanson Grove in the space of a month. The first took place on 5 November, another on 10 November, and the third on 14 November, all during the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Charges against one person relating to the first blaze were dropped last month.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said on Wednesday morning police conducted multiple search warrants in Hutt Valley, targeting the three men, who are aged in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        
            <p>Now, the three men have been charged with participating in a criminal group, arson and conspiring to commit arson, while two are also facing murder charges.</p>
        
            <p>The men are set appear in the Hutt Valley District Court on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Four others were arrested during the course of the search warrants on unrelated matters.</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said this had been a "long and protracted enquiry, which has culminated in today's arrests through the dedicated work of a team of detectives in the Hutt Valley and wider Wellington District".</p>
        
            <p>Moller's neice, Denise Harrison, previously told RNZ it had beenhard to find peace and move on while the person responsible was still out there.</p>
        
            <p>"Had my uncle died at 82 of an illness or just old age, I could have reconciled that a lot more easily. But it did occur to me when I was speaking at his funeral that the circumstances of this were just not right."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said on Wednesday he had spoken to the family.</p>
        
            <p>"I have spoken with the Moller family who were relieved to hear the news, in what is a further step forward in coming to terms with what happened," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>She said police were confident there are further witnesses who might now feel comfortable coming forward and speaking to them.</p>
        
            <p>People could report information on 105 either online or over the phone, referencing file number 241105/2249 or quoting Operation SOVE.</p>
