        <p>
The Italian alders have been blamed for damaging footpaths and causing people to slip and fall.

            <p>The chainsaws are being primed for a swathe of mature trees which line the streets of downtown New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>The 15m-high Italian alders have been blamed for damaging footpaths and causing people to slip and fall when they drop their leaves and woody catkins or cones during autumn.</p>
        
            <p>Three of the trees - which were planted about 30 years ago - were removed in December and signs have appeared on 11 more warning of their imminent demise.</p>
        
            <p>A further eight are due for the chop next year.</p>
        
            <p>They are being removed as part of the first phase of a $10.3 million city centre makeover.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Neil Holdom said the alders were past their use-by date.</p>
        
            <p>"They're beautiful trees, but we've got to a point where we've encountered a problem and we're trying to encourage commerce in the CBD and the business owners have asked for help.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had elderly people have accidents, so what we're doing is we're not going to mow them all but we are going to get the chainsaws out and knock a few of them over and replace them with species that will cause less problems."</p>
        
            <p>Holdom said the trees would replaced by a variety of local plants.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they'll be New Zealand natives and if people want to go to our website there's details of that.</p>
        
            <p>"I see that there's been nikau palms used in other areas and things that are providing less of a slip hazard and kind of aligning with our focus of planting significant natives around the district."</p>

New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom says the alder trees have been blamed for creating a slip hazard and damaging infrastructure.

            <p>He was aware not everyone would be happy to see the alders go.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh, absolutely. Look everything we do will be supported by some people and opposed by others.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've tried to do is find a middle ground where we are removing the trees that are creating problems and eliminating those problems and putting in something new and contemporary in its place."</p>
        
            <p>Rahul Kumar - who runs the restaurant El Abrazo on Devon Street - did not think the trees needed to come down.</p>
        
            <p>"We totally support if they stay, because you can say it's environmentally friendly and they look quite nice also.</p>
        
            <p>"I think you should be kinder to the trees."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>But the manager of Ballentynes Fashion Central, Robyn Paul, thought they had overstayed their welcome.</p>
        
            <p>"No one wants to see trees getting cut down. It's a sad thing, but problem is they are not the right type of trees for our main street.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately the amount of leaves and debris [that] fall down, people have slipped so many times.</p>
        
            <p>"I've physically have had to help several ladies over the years who have hurt themselves. It just gets really wet and slippery."</p>
        
            <p>On Devon Street there were mixed feelings about the decision to swing the axe.</p>
        
            <p>Barbara was not a fan.</p>
        
            <p>"I am a tree hugger totally, so I just feel desperately sad that they are going to be murdered and chopped down."</p>
        
            <p>
About a third of 60 alder trees in New Plymouth are being removed in the first phase of a $10.3 million inner city makeover. The trees have been blamed for creating a slip hazard and damaging infrastructure.

            <p>Anthony appreciated the size of the alder trees.</p>
        
            <p>"I like New Zealand natives, but I like trees that are already existing more, so I would prefer to save them.</p>
        
            <p>"I just like looking at trees that have a decent size already. Keep them if you can."</p>
        
            <p>Beth, who used a walking stick, reckoned they needed to go.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially for people who use walking sticks. I just avoid coming into town when it's wet and leaves are falling. It's too slippery, very slippery. It's very good for them to go."</p>
        
            <p>The council said there were 60 alder trees in the CBD in total, but not all faced the chop.</p>
        
            <p>It cost $41,000 to bring down the first three trees and put in new plantings, but due to the phased nature of the project the total cost for replacing the trees facing the axe was not available.</p>
