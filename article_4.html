        <h2>No effort into guest safety at fatal Dunedin student flat party, tenant admits</h2>
        <p>
The tenants had blocked off other exits, sealed up doors, and put plastic on the floors to protect their belongings.

            <p>A tenant of a fatal Dunedin student flat party has admitted he did not put any effort into looking after guest safety.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago student Sophia Crestani, 19, died during a stairwell pile up at an overcrowded flat party at The Manor in October, 2019.</p>
        
            <p>An inquest is underway in the Dunedin District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The Manor tenant Kees Scott told the inquest that he had more than 30 drinks at the 'Maggot Fest' party and spent most of the night in another tenant's room.</p>
        
            <p>They blocked off other exits, sealed up doors, and put plastic on the floors to protect their belongings which had been damaged in the past, he said.</p>
        
            <p>During cross examination, Sophia's father Bede Crestani said it appeared the tenants wanted to protect their gear and the flat, not their guests.</p>

            <p>Crestani asked Scott if he put any effort into looking after guest safety, to which Scott answered no, not really.</p>
        
            <p>He was questioned why he did not make more of an effort given The Manor had received multiple noise complaints and more than 400 people were invited.</p>
        
            <p>Scott left the party about 11pm to use a toilet in a different house, arriving back to find a commotion with people coming out onto the street and screaming, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That was when he became aware of a pile up, and he recalled removing barricades from the doors.</p>
        
            <p>He admitted he appeared to have ignored the multiple noise complaints from previous parties and took no action to avoid them.</p>
