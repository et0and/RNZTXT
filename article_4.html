            <p>An Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Wellington was diverted to Christchurch on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Flight-tracking website Flight Radar 24 showed flight NZ405 circled over the Cook Strait before heading south to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ405 from Auckland to Wellington diverted to Christchurch this morning due to a hydraulic system issue," an airline spokesperson told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"This meant the aircraft required a longer runway for landing. The safety of our people and our customers is our number one priority. Impacted customers will be re-accommodated on the next available service."</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on board the flight, James Camons, told RNZ the pilot tried to land in the capital twice before telling passengers he had to head to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a little bit scary. I think most of the passengers were quite anxious after the second attempt failed, and the pilot said you know what, we can't land this thing."</p>
        
            <p>Emergency crews checked the plane at Christchurch Airport before passengers disembarked, Camons said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully we landed safely in Christchurch, I'm very happy about that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But he was not happy about a five hour wait before the next flight the airline put him on, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Camons was meant to land in Wellington at 8.30am, and now will not arrive until 3pm, meaning he would miss meetings he travelled for.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of disgruntled passengers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an absolute joke how they've dealt with this."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said it put people on the next available flight.</p>
