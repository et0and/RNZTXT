            <p>Police are still investigating the death of a Napier man who fell from a car on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>But it has been determined that Reif Cotter, 33, died from injuries relating to his fall.</p>
        
            <p>"He was not subsequently run over," Detective Sergeant Stacey Bailey-Tran said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Police understand Cotter was travelling on a mattress on top of a black station wagon when he fell. The car was driven from the Marewa shops on Kennedy Road, along Nuffield Avenue, shortly before 9pm on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>"We are reiterating our appeal to the public to come forward if you have any information at all that may help police piece together what happened, and get answers for [Cotter's] family [...] and we ask the public to consider [Cotter's] family when making any online comment or speculation."</p>
        
            <p>The Tamatea local has been remembered as a loving father.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page has been set up for his three young children and their mother, Holly Te Ngahue.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ngahue on Facebook wrote Cotter was "the most loving" dad, brother, son, and moko.</p>
        
            <p>"Your contagious smile, your willingness to give, your sily antics, the absolute life of any party. We all love you so much Reif."</p>
        
            <p>Cotter played for the Eskview and Districts Ruby Football Club, and has been described as a "beloved teammate".</p>
        
            <p>"A talented winger, Reif brought not only skill to the field but also a contagious cheeky smile that could light up any room," a post on the Clubs' Facebook page reads.</p>
        
            <p>Police have asked that anyone who saw the vehicle concerned contact them online or via calling 105 (reference number 241228/8289).</p>
