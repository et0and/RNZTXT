            <p>One of the Bay of Islands' great maritime spectacles returned at noon on Saturday, when the starting signal sounded for the annual Tall Ships Race.</p>
        
            <p>Organised by the Russell Boating Club every summer for the past 49 years, the event is touted as a celebration of sail rather than a serious race.</p>
        
            <p>That, however, doesn't make the competitors any less determined to win - or lessen the annual, mostly light-hearted, controversy over the handicap system used to decide placings.</p>
        
            <p>Club commodore Bruce Mitchinson said 45 vessels had registered as of 8am, but organisers were busy signing up a rush of last-minute entrants on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions were superb with a cloudless sky and a light southwesterly, which was expected to pick up as the sea breeze kicked in around midday.</p>
        
            <p>The afternoon forecast was for a 10-knot southerly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more of a fun race, though we get some people who are pretty serious about it. It's a reasonable length, 12 to 15 nautical miles, so it gives people some time on the water, and then of course we have the prizegiving and a hāngī."</p>
        
            <p>As in past years racing would take place in four divisions, Mitchinson said.</p>
        
            <p>The tall ships division was open to vessels of two or more masts and more than 30 feet (9.1m) on deck, while the classic invitational was dedicated to historic vessels.</p>
        
            <p>A separate junk-rig division would be offered for just the third year, while an all-comers division was open to any sailing boat as long as it measured at least 22 feet (6.7 metres) on deck.</p>
        
            <p>The course started and finished off Russell wharf with the distance depending on the division.</p>
        
            <p>More than 70 vessels took part last year with the oldest, the Kerikeri-built Undine, dating back to 1877.</p>
        
            <p>The winner of last year's coveted tall ships trophy was the R Tucker Thompson, a 60-foot gaff-rigged topsail schooner based at Ōpua and used as a youth training ship.</p>
        
            <p>The post-race festivities at Matauwhi Bay Reserve were as keenly anticipated as the racing itself, with a huge hāngī catering to 800 people and two bands, one acoustic, one rock, playing until midnight.</p>
