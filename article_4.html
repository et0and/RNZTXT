            <p>A fire that claimed the life of a tourist on the West Coast is not believed to be suspicious, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Jirong Wang, 46, was the woman who died in a house bus fire in Blue Spur, near Hokitika, last week.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband, with whom she was touring the South Island, managed to get out unharmed.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said formal identification had now been completed.</p>
        
            <p>They were continuing to "work with the family through what is a difficult time", the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"After an extensive scene examination and witness enquiries police have concluded that the property did have fire precaution measures, including smoke alarms and fire extinguishers."</p>
        
            <p>Police also said the property provided short-term rental accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Their investigation was continuing, but police confirmed Wang's death would be referred to the Coroner, and police staff were assisting with organising the return of her body to China.</p>
        
            <p>The Chinese Embassy had previously told RNZ it was supporting Wang's husband and providing assistance to her family.</p>
        
            <p>It also reminded Chinese tourists visiting New Zealand "to improve their awareness and ensure personal safety".</p>
