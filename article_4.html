            <p>A woman charged with murdering a man who died at Kaitāia Hospital on Saturday night has been remanded in custody and granted interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old woman appeared in the Kaitāia District Court on Monday afternoon, and was next due in the High Court at Whangārei on 4 October.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Rhys Johnson said the accused and victim were known to each other, and police were not looking for anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>Kaitāia residents could expect to see an increased police presence while the enquiry continued.</p>
        
            <p>"While at the centre of this investigation is a tragic incident, we are pleased to have been able to bring a quick resolution to the victim's grieving whānau," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Kaitāia Hospital about 11.40pm on Saturday after a seriously injured man was dropped off at the emergency department.</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said he died a short time later, despite the efforts of medical staff.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was arrested on Sunday night.</p>
