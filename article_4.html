            <p>Auckland Council is meeting today to go over the first proposal for its 10-year budget, which sets its political direction under mayor Wayne Brown.</p>
        
            <p>The council's budget committee will discuss the Mayoral Proposal for the Long Term Plan, which features a slew of rates rises and some controversial changes for the city.</p>
        
            <p>Returning some of the land around the Port of Auckland, introducing congestion charges, and putting rates up 19 percent over the next three years are just a few of the ideas put forward.</p>

            <p>In his proposal, Brown said council needed to affordably deliver the basics, and do more with what it already had.</p>
        
            <p>Exactly what to cut and what to keep will be on the table today.</p>
        
            <p>In the city centre, transport is top of mind for commuters. One of them, Mark, does not support congestion charges for some main roads into the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>"I've heard about that, and [I'm] not too much of a fan," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's sort of punishing the people wanting to get to work."</p>
        
            <p>A $50 weekly transport pass has been proposed, alongside cutting funding for some cycleways.</p>
        
            <p>Mark said the public transport network needed investment.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the public transport needs a massive overhaul," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The big issue with that is a lot of people are using their cars at the moment because public transport is either unreliable, it obviously doesn't turn up on time, or it comes late.</p>
        
            <p>"If they can put this money towards actually improving it in better ways, then sure."</p>
        
            <p>Rates rises of upto 19 percent are on the table for the next three years, to meet costs relating to the storms and City Rail Link cost blow-outs and the $220 million running costs when it opens in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Another commuter, Wendy, said that was "bad news".</p>
        
            <p>"They have to justify it first."</p>
        
            <p>She said the congestion charges were likely to be part of city life.</p>
        
            <p>"I suppose if you have to be on the road at peak times, you've got to pay."</p>
        
            <p>Council said it would have a funding gap of $470m within three years - plugging it with rates would lead to rises of 35 percent over that time.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor suggested plugging the gap with a wealth fund that held Auckland Airport shares for selling down and the proceeds from leasing the port.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklander Gill Macklin said hefty rates increases would not please anyone, and supported selling off assets to balance the books.</p>
        
            <p>"I think [Wayne] Brown has to try and balance his budget [...] perhaps he should sell Auckland Airport."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's 10-year budget will go out for public consultation before being finalised and adopted in 2024.</p>
