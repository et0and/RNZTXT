            <p>The man accused of killing Nelson police officer Lyn Fleming has pleaded not guilty to her murder and the attempted murder of her colleague.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old appeared in person at the High Court at Blenheim on Friday morning from Christchurch Prison where he has been remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>He entered not guilty pleas to six charges; the murder of Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming, the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsay, causing grievous bodily harm with reckless disregard for safety and three charges of dangerous driving.</p>
        
            <p>Members of Fleming's family sat in the public gallery while others watched the hearing via audiovisual link.</p>
        
            <p>The man pleaded guilty to two charges - driving while disqualified and driving with a blood alcohol level of more than 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
        
            <p>He last appeared via audio visual link in the High Court at Nelson. However, with the Nelson Courthouse currently closed for seismic strengthening work, today's appearance was held in Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer John Sandston said the defendant had consented to a remand in custody and would not be applying for bail before the trial, with a provisional date set for next year.</p>
        
            <p>He was granted continued name suppression for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>He also planned to make an application for the case to be transferred from the High Court at Nelson to another High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Fleming was killed in the early hours of New Year's Day after being struck by a vehicle while she was on foot patrol in central Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Her colleague, Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsay was critically injured and required surgery. A third police officer was assessed for concussion. Two members of the public were also injured.</p>
        
            <p>The 62-year-old was laid to rest on 16 January, following a funeral with full police honours, attended by hundreds at Nelson's Trafalgar Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said Fleming was widely respected and her death was "tragic and senseless".</p>
        
            <p>She had been an officer for 38 years and was the first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty in New Zealand.</p>
