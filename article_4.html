            <p>Police are yet to release the names of the two people killed in tragic circumstances in Lower Hutt yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A woman was killed in a hit-and-run in Naenae yesterday morning - and in the afternoon a man was shot dead by police after holding his partner hostage in Wainuiomata.</p>
        
            <p>He had been holding a weapon to his partner's neck.</p>
        
            <p>A Coast Road resident Elizabeth Lister said she heard police trying to negotiate with the man at the centre of the hostage situation and heard him also yelling back.</p>
        
            <p>"After they shot him, they brought her out ....And she was just absolutely hysterical, screaming - it was awful," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then about five minutes later, they brought him out on the trolley".</p>
        
            <p>
Elizabeth Lister, the next door neighbour of the scene of a fatal shooting in Wainuiomata, overheard the whole ordeal, and watched some of it unfold from her window.

            <p>Lister said both she and her husband have been left shaken by the tragedy on their doorstep and found it hard to sleep last night.</p>
        
            <p>Jen, who lives nearby on Naenae Road, told RNZ she woke up about 5.45am on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"I came out to the lounge and I noticed my front door was open, which was quite unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"My husband was on his way to work but he was putting the bins out and then he came back inside to say that there was an accident and he saw unfortunately a body with a sheet over it."</p>
        
            <p>Jen said throughout the day police had cordoned off the road and they were liaising with them because they had cameras.</p>
        
            <p>She said the road was known for being particularly busy and people speeding on it.</p>
        
            <p>"We've lived here for about five and a half years now and this is the fourth accident that has occurred on this road."</p>
        
            <p>She said the crash was sad and shocking.</p>
        
            <p>Lower Hutt Mayor Campbell Barry said the local community are also feeling uneasy after the two tragic deaths yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Barry wants to reassure the community that the two events are completely separate, and such things don't happen often.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are doing everything they can and really want to provide the reassurance that these are very unusual events... and it's obviously a shock to have two in one day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said he's confident police are working hard to keep the community safe and find the person responsible for the hit-and-run.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been briefed by the area commander and they're providing support to those impacted."</p>
        
            <p>Police are continuing their investigations into both events.</p>
        
            <p>They want anyone who saw or has CCTV footage of the dark-gray Mazda 6 sedan involved in the Naenae hit-and-run to get in contact.</p>
        
            <p>The car was stolen from Belmont in the early hours of Thursday morning and was driving erratically.</p>
        
            <p>In the Wainuiomata case, police have assured the woman involved is safe and any updates will be released promptly.</p>
        
            <p>Wainuiomata Marae manager Lynda Olsen said she does not know the whƒÅnau of those involved but it was a shock to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of uncertainty and a lot of anxiousness, most probably a little bit scared so a lot of people chose to stay in their own homes.</p>
        
            <p>"But us that are out in the community have a lot of confidence because we have lots of support around us.</p>
        
            <p>"We know if there's something going to happen, we can duck and dive anywhere in Wainuiomata."</p>
        
            <p>Olsen said it is unfortunate the police were not able to use non-lethal force.</p>
