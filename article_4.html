            <p>Surgery and appointments are being called off around the country as junior doctors go on strike again on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Junior doctors were walking off the job at 7am, for the second time in two weeks - this time for two days.</p>
        
            <p>In the earlier one-day strike, hundreds of procedures and clinics were unable to take place.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora said it had already postponed some complex procedures to try and ease pressure on hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>But it said emergency departments were open and people should turn up for appointments unless they've heard otherwise.</p>
        
            <p>The doctors said they were protesting against pay cuts for about 600 colleagues in specialities with big staff shortages.</p>
