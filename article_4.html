            <p>A controversial housing development north of Wellington has been granted resource consent.</p>
        
            <p>The Plimmerton Farm project in Porirua seeks to build 2400 new homes in addition to a commercial area, retirement village, and school.</p>
        
            <p>It has been widely criticised by environmental groups amid concerns about runoff into the wetland, known as Taupō Swamp.</p>
        
            <p>The project - earmarked by the Labour government for fast-track consenting under the Covid-19 Recovery legislation - received the green light to be included in the new Fast-Track Approvals Bill last month.</p>
        
            <p>At the time Porirua mayor Anita Baker, a longtime advocate for the the project, said the region was in desperate need of more homes, and was confident the checks and balances to protect the wetland would be sufficient.</p>
        
            <p>She has previously stated that the developers - one of whom has a past conviction for environmental damage - would be watched very closely.</p>
        
            <p>The Environmental Protection Authority said the independent panel approved the resource consent 169 working days after the application was lodged by developers Malcolm Gillies and Kevin Melville.</p>
        
            <p>It was approved under the Covid-19 legislation and is subject to conditions, including the remediation and creation of a wetland.</p>
