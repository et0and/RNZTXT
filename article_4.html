            <p>Police investigating the death of a man in Palmerston North last year are looking for a "distinctive" beanie.</p>
        
            <p>Dayne Rademakers, 36, was fatally stabbed at an address on Clyde Crescent in August last year.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday police said they were looking for a "camo-coloured beanie with built-in lights on the front".</p>
        
            <p>"After a number of enquiries, this beanie has become an item of interest to our investigation," Detective Senior Sergeant Karen Heald said.</p>
        
            <p>"It may have been discarded around the time of Mr Rademakers' death and we are interested to hear from anyone with information."</p>
        
            <p>Heald said it might have been stolen in the weeks leading up to Rademakers' death.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to work hard to get answers for Mr Rademakers family and provide them with a sense of closure."</p>
        
            <p>In December, police said "people closely connected to Dayne at the time of his death have not provided reliable information".</p>
        
            <p>Information can be passed onto police by calling 105 and quoting file number 230821/7290 or via Crime Stoppers.</p>
