            <p>Warning: This story discusses details of sexual violence.</p>
        
            <p>The lawyer for a man accused of multiple rapes has suggested in court that another witness was responsible for one of them.</p>
        
            <p>John Hope Muchirahondo is on trial in the High Court at Christchurch for more than 30 charges, including rape and unlawful sexual connection, which span 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>A Crown witness told the court on Thursday he was among five people at Muchirahondo's house the night one of the complainants says he raped her in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Anselm Williams suggested it was not Muchirahondo, but him who the complainant found on top of them when they woke on the couch.</p>
        
            <p>"I put to you that you had left the room, and while she was asleep, you kissed her. Did that happen? "</p>
        
            <p>The witness denied that, saying he had passed out in another room and had been with someone else the whole time.</p>
        
            <p>He continued to deny suggestions Williams made, which included raping the woman.</p>
        
            <p>However, he did admit his memory of the night was not complete because he was heavily intoxicated and it happened years ago.</p>

            <p>Institute of Environmental Science and Research scientist Nicholas Curnow, who was giving evidence as an expert witness, told Crown lawyer Claire Boshier a likely match had been indicated for some of the DNA found on swabs taken from the complainant.</p>
        
            <p>"In essence, that DNA profiling evidence provides strong support for the proposition that the male DNA in the swab came from Mr Muchirahondo?" she asked.</p>
        
            <p>"That's correct," Curnow said.</p>
        
            <p>It could not have been the witness, as Williams suggested, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The profile that we obtained did not correspond to [the witness]'s profile. There were discrepancies and it didn't match the swabs from the areas we tested," Curnow said.</p>
        
            <p>But a police detective then told the court he had a discussion about possibly investigating whether that witness may have sexual assaulted someone else the same night.</p>
        
            <p>"We heard yesterday [a woman] initiated or indicated to police that she would like to initiate an investigation into the conduct of this man. She had this conversation with you, didn't she?" Williams asked Detective Mark Kolmer.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, she did," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That arose out of her concerns about what might have happened while she was passed out that night, is that right?" Williams asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Correct," Kolmer replied.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues tomorrow.</p>
