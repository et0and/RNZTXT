        <h2>Barrier businesses welcome new moorings for boaties hit by caulerpa ban</h2>
        <p>
Anchoring has been restricted around most of the island to help stop the spread of the invasive seaweed caulerpa. Audio

            <p>New boat moorings could be the answer for Great Barrier Island businesses struggling with a lack of tourism due to anchoring restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>The restrictions are in place around most of the island as a measure aimed at stopping the spread of the invasive seaweed caulerpa.</p>
        
            <p>The island's existing moorings were full, so boaties who wanted to visit had nowhere to secure their boats, which local businesses said had been a huge blow to island's economy.</p>
        
            <p>In previous years, Tryphena Bay to the south of Great Barrier Island had been a hive of activity where boaties would anchor in the harbour and visit local shops.</p>

            <p>But in 2021, rules were put in place restricting where vessels could anchor, to stop the spread of the invasive seaweed caulerpa.</p>
        
            <p>Pa Beach Cafe owner Rochelle Winger said the lack of visiting boaties had been tough for her business.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty scary because we have people that we have to look after. We've got people that work for us - people that need money, they need to pay their rent.</p>
        
            <p>"And same with us, we've got a family and we want to be able to afford to pay our rent."</p>

            <p>Protecting the island's marine life was very important to locals on the Barrier, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real Catch-22 because on the one hand, we want the tourism, but then on the other hand we need our seafood and we want to take care of our ocean.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're kind of stuck of in the middle of what do we do."</p>

            <p>Exotic caulerpa can spread quickly across the seabed, creating a thick, mossy carpet that smothers native marine life.</p>
        
            <p>The weed is thought to spread when small amounts get caught on anchors or fishing and diving equipment, then moved to other locations.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland deputy mayor Desley Simpson hoped to strike a balance on the issue by expanding the island's mooring zones to bring in more boaties.</p>
        
            <p>"Where there's a will, I believe there can be a way. But my first priority is the environment and that the protection will stop caulerpa any further than what is happening at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>She was hoping to arrive at a solution after meeting with the Auckland Harbourmaster next week, adding there were "quite a few options in this space".</p>
        
            <p>Aotea / Great Barrier local board chairperson Izzy Fordham said putting in new moorings could be a win-win.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got some evidence of how it works in Australia; they can be booked online, so it could be a revenue gain as well. Helping the community and helping those boaties also."</p>
        
            <p>Marilyn Stephens is a trustee of NgƒÅti Rehua-Ngatiwai ki Aotea, the tangata whenua of the island.</p>
        
            <p>She said the iwi had been monitoring boats around Aotea, and not all of them were following the anchoring rules.</p>
        
            <p>"We've traced a boat - a superyacht - and it's come into Barrier on the west side, anchored, [then] it's gone round to the east side and it's anchored. And then it [went] right round past the north edge of the island to Mangawhai, so how can you stop them?</p>
        
            <p>"These are superyachts that come from overseas. We don't know what they're doing."</p>
        
            <p>Stephens wanted to see more action from the government in the fight against caulerpa, saying there had not been enough over the last three years.</p>
        
            <p>"If they don't do something tangible, one of our biggest industries will be impacted."</p>
        
            <p>Dwain Hindriksen, controller for the Ministry for Primary Industries' caulerpa response, said around $11 million had been allocated to control the weed, including $5 million allocated earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>That included a project to remove caulerpa through diver-assisted suction dredging in Port Fitzroy to the north of Great Barrier and elsewhere in the Hauraki Gulf.</p>
        
            <p>Divers are expected to be in the water next month.</p>
        
            <p>MPI had also invested in diver surveillance, expert advice, public information campaigns and compliance monitoring.</p>
