            <p>Tests have shown an elevated level of lead in the Tokomaru water supply.</p>
        
            <p>People living in the Horowhenua town are being told not to drink tap water while testing continues.</p>
        
            <p>Boiling the water will not make it safe and residents should use bottled water for all uses including brushing teeth, preparing food, and baby formula, Horowhenua District Council said.</p>
        
            <p>A water tanker would be at the Tokomaru Community Hall, and the school and early childhood centre was being given bottled water.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the measures were a precautionary step.</p>
        
            <p>Further tests were being done on Wednesday morning, and council and health officials were meeting to discuss next steps.</p>
        
            <p>Horowhenua mayor Bernie Wanden said it was an unplanned test which revealed the lead traces initially.</p>
        
            <p>"There had been some work done on the plant, and [a staff member] thought it was just timely that they make sure that there was no issues."</p>
        
            <p>He said those results took a week to come back, but following that, they increased their testing regime across the network.</p>
        
            <p>The tests being rushed through today should answer some big questions: "Whether there is an issue, or [so] we can isolate exactly where the contamination is," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've taken samples at the top, at the source, at the plant and the reservoir, and further in the township, so we can understand or try and isolate where the problem is."</p>
        
            <p>On 16 July, the council tested drinking water at the Tokomaru Fire Station given the recent completion of upgrades at the Tokomaru Water Treatment Plant. That test indicated the presence of lead in the network - this was thought to be a sampling error - however as a precaution it did additional and more regular testing.</p>
        
            <p>Following advice from Taumata Arawai (NZ Water Regulator), the council proactively implemented an enhanced testing regime. Results in late July confirmed the reservoir was compliant.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday 4 August a test indicated the presence of lead in the reticulation network which was thought to be impacted by a corroding brass tap at the sampling point.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday 6 August test results indicated non-compliant lead levels in both the reticulation network and the reservoir at the Tokomaru Water Treatment Plant. These results are due to the enhanced testing in place, and council immediately contacted Taumata Arawai and the Ministry of Health for advice.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the council said it wanted to be transparent and up front, so it notified the community of the test results as soon as they were confirmed.</p>
