            <p>An Auckland school is offering support to its students after their belongings were destroyed in a bus fire.</p>
        
            <p>The group from Pasadena High School in Point Chevalier was returning from a camp on Friday when their bus broke down in Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>They were transferred to another bus to take them back to school and their luggage was left on the original bus, which was being towed. But that bus caught fire, destroying the stored luggage.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Jonathan Hughes said it was upsetting for some of the students, and those affected and their whƒÅnau have been contacted.</p>
        
            <p>He said the school counsellor and the senior management team were available to support them.</p>
