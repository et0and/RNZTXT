            <p>Motorists will now face two agencies tracking their speed with the power to fine them - but not for the same offence.</p>
        
            <p>Police are running tenders for two types of speed detectors - radar and laser - to be fitted in patrol cars, or operated outside them.</p>
        
            <p>The tender says its existing gear is at the end of its life.</p>
        
            <p>Up until now, the police had these detectors plus ran the country's network of fixed and mobile speed cameras.</p>
        
            <p>But that network is now being handed over to the Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the police said it would be working with the Transport Agency to complement each other.</p>
        
            <p>"This work will include steps to ensure that motorists are not ticketed twice for the same offence, due to officers and cameras operating in the same vicinity."</p>
