            <p>A man has been charged with manslaughter after the death of a 75-year-old at Hutt Hospital earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Martin Todd said the older man was involved in an altercation at the hospital on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>He was taken to Wellington Hospital with a brain injury but was later transferred back to Hutt Hospital, where he died on 19 January.</p>
        
            <p>A police investigation to determine exactly what happened prior to his death has resulted in a 23-year-old being charged with manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in the Hutt Valley District Court on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand last week launched its own internal review.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora, Capital, Coast and Hutt Valley operations group director Jamie Duncan said its staff were working closely with police on the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.</p>
        
            <p>Todd acknowledged the grief and loss the man's family were experiencing, and said police would continue to offer all the support they could.</p>
