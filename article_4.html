            <p>Parents said Matapu School were proactive in communicating that their children were not involved in the crash on the school's street.</p>
        
            <p>Matapu school is on Hastings Road, and parent Jo Bissell said the local community were concerned.</p>
        
            <p>"I had some friends who actually messaged me to say 'are your kids ok?' - that was after the fact - but I guess word had been rolling out," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Bissell said she feels for the families involved, especially as she heard children were hurt.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings Road, between Skeet and Eltham roads, was likely to remain closed for some time while the serious crash unit investigated, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the crash is currently unknown.</p>
