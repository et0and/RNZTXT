            <p>Ponsonby is one of Auckland's oldest neighbourhoods, and while Ponsonby Road's boutique fashion outlets, cafes and restaurants have been struggling recently, there is still plenty of optimism that the area will bounce back.</p>
        
            <p>With high interest rates and the country dipping in and out of recession, many retailers say business is the quietest it's been in years.</p>
        
            <p>But there is also optimism that even with changing consumer trends, the street will see a revival.</p>
        
            <p>Ponsonby retailers say having a shop front on the vibrant street is as much about community as it is about customers.</p>
        
            <p>Diva opened Beau Restaurant on Ponsonby Rd in 2020 - just weeks before the first Covid lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>"Ponsonby is vibrant. It's beautiful. It's like a loving little village, we're just blessed to be in the suburb."</p>
        
            <p>Three months ago she opened a cafe next door, at the Three Lamps end, close to Herne Bay.</p>
        
            <p>She was not worried about the famous street being less busy right now.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess it wasn't even really a consideration because this is all we've ever known.</p>
        
            <p>"We love Ponsonby, and so we decided to open the deli to be able to expand what we do and connect with like a broader part of our community."</p>
        
            <p>Diva said the Ponsonby community choosing to eat local helped her keep going.</p>
        
            <p>"I know that when they make choices to come here or other restaurants and cafes, they're intentionally doing that and we're all just thankful," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Diva said while it could be busier, they were "sticking it out", like most businesses in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Down the other end of Ponsonby Road, Nick Neilson owned The Polished Diamonds store.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was attracted to the vibrant character of Ponsonby, and not just the amount of customer traffic.</p>
        
            <p>"I very strategically chose Ponsonby for my business, and that's not necessarily based off of the market of people who frequent it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the fact that I did like the neighbourhood. I think it was on par with our our brand and our people, but it's also the the neighbourhood itself."</p>
        
            <p>He said the foot traffic may be lower right now - compared to what it was when he first opened his store seven years ago - but that was the reality for retailers across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see Ponsonby Rd as any different from any of the economic times that we're currently having in New Zealand, and we're doing what we can to survive it."</p>
        
            <p>He said the local business association had been proactive in helping.</p>
        
            <p>"We do market days. We've been opening up to different kind of ways of broadcasting how businesses can be successful in general.</p>
        
            <p>"Ponsonby has been quite proactive in trying to curb what is kind of a national situation right now."</p>
        
            <p>Neilson said there had been a lot of work happening to give Ponsonby Road a new lease of life when the economy rebounded.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hopeful, I'm optimistic. I see the good in Ponsonby. I see the strong neighbourhood of Ponsonby, the community of Ponsonby."</p>
        
            <p>Just down the block, Elliot Alexander had been running his art gallery Endemicworld on Ponsonby Rd for 13 years.</p>
        
            <p>He was not worried about economic ups and downs, but acknowledged he's in a good tenancy situation.</p>
        
            <p>"We're very lucky we have a very supportive landlord. I know some businesses don't, and I think that's a huge disadvantage."</p>
        
            <p>Alexander said the change in consumer buying patterns was nothing new.</p>
        
            <p>"Retail has been changing since the internet began."</p>
        
            <p>He said most of their sales were completed on mobile phones.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though we released 400 square metres of retail space on Ponsonby Road.</p>
        
            <p>"I think if you start a business and you want your 100 per cent of your income to be from your local physical clientele and a local physical store, you have to be extremely niche. An example of that might be the local tattoo parlour or the local bakery. They're busy non-stop doing a great job."</p>
        
            <p>He said Ponsonby Road's identity was changing from that old neighbourhood of independent boutique retail.</p>
        
            <p>"To talk about Ponsonby Rd as just one general space - it's not quite that simple anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got Macpac on the main street, that's not Ponsonby Road in it's essence. It's not a bespoke store.</p>
        
            <p>"A chain store is not what people think of when they go to Ponsonby Rd."</p>
        
            <p>Alexander believed the changes were being driven by more internet shopping, rising land values, and residential development.</p>
        
            <p>"The value in the land to to people isn't in a shop being there to sell things. It's about providing an experience, a community feel, which means there should be some spaces that actually sell things, but a lot of it will be everyday consumables that you need when you live in the city."</p>
        
            <p>A strategy document for the future of Ponsonby was being developed by the local business association.</p>
        
            <p>People could complete an online survey to share their experiences, which it said will contribute to a place-based vision for the future of the popular neighbourhood.</p>
