            <p>The director-general of health has denied Tauranga City Council an extension which would have allowed the city to delay water fluoridation.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council had sought to delay fluoridation, which was set to occur on 1 November.</p>
        
            <p>However, in a letter last Friday, Director-General of Health Dr Diana Sarfati turned down the request.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Mayor Mahé Drysdale on Tuesday expressed his disappointment. Drysdale said council-elected members had wanted matters currently before the High Court to be finalised before the system was brought permanently online.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health was appealing a High Court decision that found its order forcing 14 councils to fluoridate was unlawful.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge that the ministry is empowered to mandate water supply fluoridation under the Health Fluoridation of Drinking Water Amendment Act 2021, but feel that this was an important opportunity to allow court processes to run their course and provide direction for water consumers and water supply authorities," Drysdale said.</p>
        
            <p>However, in the letter to the council from the director-general of health received on 20 September, the ministry stated the High Court had twice confirmed the directions for councils to fluoridate their water supplies remained valid, and Tauranga's request for an extension would not be granted.</p>
        
            <p>"While the ministry's response has yet to be considered by elected members, the scale of the financial penalties the council could face if it does not comply with the fluoridation direction are extreme, including a fine of up to $200,000 and an additional $10,000 for each day of non-compliance," Drysdale said.</p>
        
            <p>"Additionally, we could also be required to pay back the ministry's contribution towards the fluoridation dosing equipment, which is estimated at $3.4 million."</p>

            <p>Drysdale said given those costs would fall directly on ratepayers, he believed it was likely the council would decide to comply with the directive.</p>
        
            <p>In July 2022, fourteen local authorities, including Tauranga City Council, were directed by the director-general of health to add fluoride to their water supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty days of continual dosing must be carried out prior 30 November 2024, the date required by the Ministry of Health direction.</p>
        
            <p>"In order to comply with the 1 November deadline, testing and commissioning of the fluoridation dosing system would need to begin by mid-Octoberi," said Drysdale.</p>
        
            <p>"In order to give everyone certainty and as much time as possible I have asked that no fluoride is added through system testing until at least 24 October, after the council has had the chance to consider the letter from Dr Sarfati."</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council says it was going to continue exploring options for establishing a non-fluoridated water supply for the community.</p>

            <p>A report to council was expected in December 2024 outlining options for a non-fluoridated water supply, discussing costs and who would pay those costs, risks and feasibility of a non-fluoridated supply.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Health's advice was that community water fluoridation was a safe and effective way to support good oral health. Fluoride had no taste or smell, and consumers would not notice any difference to the drinking water.</p>
        
            <p>The Tauranga water supply was previously fluoridated from 1963 to 1986, and 1990 until December 1992.</p>
