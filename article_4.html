            <p>Police have announced a homicide investigation has now been opened into the death of a man in Auckland and two people have been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>The incident unfolded on Tomuri Place in the suburb of Mount Wellington about 1.30 Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported the man who died had been stabbed, Detective Inspector Simon Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were notified that an altercation had taken place at the property, during which a man received critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, despite best efforts from emergency services, the man was pronounced dead at the scene."</p>
        
            <p>Harrison said he knew this would be a shock to the community and he wanted to reassure people the incident appeared to be isolated.</p>
        
            <p>An increased police presence would remain in the area on Saturday night and cordons would stay in place while police did a scene examination.</p>
