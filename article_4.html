            <p>The award-winning New Zealand abstract artist Mark Braunias died on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Braunias, 69, was a prolific creator who experimented with line and bold colours across different mediums throughout an almost forty year career, winning the $25,000 Parkin Drawing Award and two Wallace Art awards.</p>
        
            <p>His work is represented in Te Papa's collection and he exhibited extensively in New Zealand's most well known public and private galleries.</p>
        
            <p>Braunias collapsed outside his house in Kawhia on Tuesday morning and later died at Waikato Hospital, according to his younger brother, the New Zealand Herald journalist Steve Braunias.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a classic artist. He lived for making art. He painted obsessively and was fascinated his whole life by line and colour. He pursued that all his life."</p>
        
            <p>Braunias was born in Tauranga in 1955. His talent was evident from a young age, an interest that likely came from their father, a house painter by trade who also painted landscapes, Steve said.</p>
        
            <p>Braunias had a fascination with their father's business sign painted over the family garage in a semi circle using capital letters.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty early he started keeping large A3 hardcover diaries... full of writing in capital letters but they would also have drawings and this continued his whole life."</p>
        
            <p>Braunias studied at Mt Maunganui College and later at Ilam School of Art in Christchurch in the 1980s, according to the obituary Steve wrote in the Herald.</p>

            <p>One of Mark's strongest supporters for the last 25 years was Jonathan Smart from Jonathan Smart Gallery in Christchurch. He called Braunias a well-known and successful New Zealand artist who was a warm person.</p>
        
            <p>"He is known for making paintings that lean towards abstraction that are also deeply human."</p>
        
            <p>Braunias liked to sell his work and "watch the joy of collectors' eyes light up, and hearts beat faster as they get a Mark Braunias", Smart said.</p>
        
            <p>What turned out to be his last show ended a few weeks ago at Ann Parker Gallery in Whanganui. The gallery owner, Lorene Taurerewa, watched Braunias' work for years.</p>
        
            <p>She was surprised such a well-known artist would accept an invitation to exhibit at a gallery that had only been open for 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing that I really liked about him was he was quite diverse in his way of working. He was painting very bright colours. His works were very large as well as monochromatic works."</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, Braunias experimented with quilt making and glass blowing while keeping with his abstract style.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw him like a 12-year-old boy. Everything is interesting to him. He is the type of person to look under things, behind things, " said Taurerewa.</p>
        
            <p>With four exhibitions this year, Braunias showed no signs of slowing down, said his brother Steve Braunias.</p>
        
            <p>"More and more, he got more active."</p>
        
            <p>Braunias was also a fixture of the community in Kawhia where there will likely be a memorial early next year, Steve Braunias said.</p>
        
            <p>A funeral was planned for Monday in Mt Maunganui.</p>
