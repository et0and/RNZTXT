            <p>A new report has highlighted failings at Taranaki Base Hospital over the death of an elderly man who died less than an hour after being discharged in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The Aged Care Commissioner found the New Plymouth hospital did not complete the necessary pre-discharge checks on the man.</p>
        
            <p>The man in his 80s was treated for five days in hospital after being admitted for an inflammatory lung disease and abdominal pain.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital discharged him even though he was still struggling with shortness of breath and mobility, and he died five minutes after arriving home.</p>
        
            <p>Aged Care Commissioner Carolyn Cooper found the hospital breached the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights.</p>
        
            <p>A lack of planning and communication resulted in the man being discharged in an unsafe manner, she said.</p>
