            <p>A dog belonging to a man missing in Coromandel bush for more than two months has been found in Maratoto, inland from WhangamatƒÅ.</p>
        
            <p>Jordan van Deursen failed to return from a hike in the Wentworth valley area with his terrier Bagho on 29 October, and the official search was suspended after 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>Police have now confirmed Bahgo has been found.</p>
        
            <p>"The dog turned up at a rural address near to one of the track entrances linked to where Jordan was last known to be," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The dog was then reunited with Jordan's family and police were alerted."</p>
        
            <p>But there was still no sign of van Deursen, 29.</p>
        
            <p>"Police and Land SAR are assessing the circumstances around Jordan's dog being found, and reviewing information provided by the public," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>A relative of van Deursen previously told RNZ Bahgo was the 29-year-old's "best friend".</p>
        
            <p>"He's hiking every day with his mate, his little dog, his best friend, he knows a bit about the bush but not enough to be out there this long," uncle Mario Kerkhof said.</p>
        
            <p>"I doubt he would've taken much with him if he was going for a quick hike, he would've just taken the basics, he probably wouldn't even have taken any water knowing Jordan, he does rough it a bit. I think he had tramping boots and might have had a jersey."</p>
        
            <p>The alarm was not raised until three days after van Deursen began his Sunday hike, after his car was spotted still in the carpark the following Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>By then the weather had turned incredibly bad, with the tail of Cyclone Lola lashing the area.</p>
        
            <p>An air and land search had not turned up any clues, and was suspended after 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>Police want to hear from anyone with information on van Deursen's whereabouts.</p>
