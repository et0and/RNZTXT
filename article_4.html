            <p>An alleged drunk driver is facing charges after driving his car into a house in Auckland's Albany.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the 44-year-old driver found himself hanging three metres above the ground and was stuck in the vehicle for some time.</p>
        
            <p>The incident took place on Fairview Avenue just prior to 8pm on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>On arrival, Acting Inspector Warwick Stainton said the vehicle was found suspended over a three-metre drop between a house and retaining wall.</p>
        
            <p>"The male was stuck in the vehicle for some time as FENZ had to secure the vehicle before we could get him out safely.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily for him he was uninjured, however extensive damage was caused to the property."</p>
        
            <p>Stainton said the driver was under the influence of alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>"People who drive while impaired by alcohol are putting themselves at risk, as well as everyone else on the road," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This incident has caused massive damage to someone's family home which could have been avoided if someone had called a taxi.</p>
        
            <p>"So please, plan ahead if you're going to be drinking, and make sure you have arranged a safe way to get home afterward - whether that is organising a sober driver, getting picked up, or catching a taxi or ride share."</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in North Shore DIstrict Court on Thursday, charged with driving with excess breath alcohol and dangerous driving.</p>
