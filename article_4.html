            <p>Syrian New Zealanders and their loved ones gathered in Waitangi Park on Wellington's waterfront on Monday to celebrate the end of a decades-long dictatorship.</p>
        
            <p>Rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday, ending his family's five decade regime after more than 13 years of civil war.</p>
        
            <p>Shaymaa Arif was among the crowd of about 200 in Wellington. She is Sirian Iraqi, and her family immigrated to New Zealand in 1997, but friends and extended family remain in Syria.</p>
        
            <p>She said one of her uncles had spent time in prison, but that was not uncommon.</p>
        
            <p>"Every single Syrian you talk to here probably has a family member who has been arrested and detained for God knows what reason by the Syrian regime, and we can finally taste freedom."</p>

            <p>She said some were already making plans to return home, at least for a visit.</p>
        
            <p>"To go back to Syria and summer over there and just contribute back to our country and help rebuild it," she said. "I have to remain hopeful."</p>
        
            <p>Event organiser Ahmad Morad said it felt amazing to finally be gathering to celebrate, rather than protest.</p>
        
            <p>"We've never seen this amount of people over here, because they've been scared of even raising the green Syrian flag."</p>
        
            <p>He said before Assad's ousting, many had feared repercussions for their families in Syria should they show up to protest.</p>

            <p>He did not know what the future now held and while there was worry, people were just grateful for now.</p>
        
            <p>His brother Diaa Morad said he would love to be in Syria celebrating with his people, but New Zealand was home now.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really great feeling after 14 years of being away from home, to see people breathing freedom back in Syria."</p>
        
            <p>He said friends and relatives in Damascus were still waiting for things to settle, but they were so happy to see an end to Assad's regime.</p>
        
            <p>Sabiha Eidi is only 14, and she had lived New Zealand half her life.</p>
        
            <p>She said she was just happy her country was finally free, and that she got to celebrate with her people.</p>
        
            <p>"Meeting other people here that are also here to share the same happiness as me is really nice and heartwarming," she said.</p>
