            <p>Police cordons have been put up on a Palmerston North street after a possible sighting of a man who aimed a gun at an officer in Palmerston North.</p>
        
            <p>A hunt is on for the armed man, who fled the scene in Highbury on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>About 8:30pm police approached a man and established there was a warrant for his arrest. They attempted to take him into custody.</p>
        
            <p>The man then became agitated and presented a firearm to an officer.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were put up around Brentwood Avenue but officers could not locate him.</p>
        
            <p>The cordons were taken down, but police confirmed these were back up on Wednesday afternoon due to a possible sighting.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there were no further details about the sighting at this time.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Ross Grantham on Wednesday told Midday Report he believed the public was safe and there was no immediate threat to the community.</p>
        
            <p>Grantham said that police knew who the man was, and asked for him to turn himself in, or any associates to provide any information on his location.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the Criminal Investigation Branch engaged in locating this young man, and we have a very experienced set of detectives," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Grantham would not disclose physically defining features of the man, but stressed police are working hard to bring him into custody.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it would help in this situation for us to describe the male because we know who he is, we are looking for him," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The public are safe with what we know and the actions we are taking."</p>
        
            <p>The same man also aimed a gun at a member of the public as he was fleeing police, who was walking on Featherston Street..</p>
        
            <p>Grantham said police were providing support to the officer involved who was not physically harmed.</p>
        
            <p>They would not accept violence or attempted violence against officers or anyone in the community, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Grantham said further disruptions in the area are possible if he does not turn himself in</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking for anyone who witnessed the incident or know the person involved to get in touch on either 105 or online using the reference file number 250212/1858.</p>
