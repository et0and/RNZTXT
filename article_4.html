            <p>Almost 20 red-billed gulls have been found dead at Kaikōura's South Bay, from what is believed to be a dog attack.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation (DOC) South Marlborough senior biodiversity ranger Pat Crowe said a member of the public found the dead birds last Friday, with injuries that appeared to have been caused by one or more dogs.</p>
        
            <p>He said the gulls were found in an area where dogs were required to be on a lead - and urged the public to ensure dogs were kept under control in coastal areas.</p>
        
            <p>"It's extremely disheartening to see wildlife killed in such a needless and preventable way. We work hard to protect gulls and other nesting birds around Kaikōura Peninsula from pest animals so it's tough to see such a large number of birds killed by a domestic animal."</p>
        
            <p>The native gulls - tarāpunga - are a taonga species for iwi Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura.</p>
        
            <p>Both DOC and the iwi viewed the harming of the birds very seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"Red-billed gulls are commonly seen in coastal areas, but their numbers nationally are declining at an alarming rate. The species currently has a conservation status of 'at-risk: declining'," Crowe said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kaikōura Peninsula is a stronghold for the species with around 3000 pairs nesting there annually."</p>
        
            <p>Under the Dog Control Act 1996, the owner of a dog that seriously injures or kills protected wildlife can be imprisoned for up to three years and fined up to $20,000, or both, if convicted. The court can also order the dog or dogs involved to be destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>DOC was asking anyone with information about the gull deaths to contact the DOC 24-hour number 0800 DOCHOT.</p>
