            <p>TVNZ is proposing to axe its long-running current affairs programme Sunday, hosted by veteran broadcaster Miriama Kamo.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of plans to cut dozens of jobs at the broadcaster.</p>
        
            <p>Staff are learning which programmes are affected at a series of meetings on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ said a proposal had been presented to Sunday staff which could result in cancellation of the programme.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the 1News Midday and Tonight bulletins may also be canned, and consumer affairs programme Fair Go could to be cut too.</p>
        
            <p>A hui for all news and current affairs staff is due to be held at one this afternoon, following the individual programme meetings.</p>
        
            <p>Fair Go is one of New Zealand's longest running and most popular television series.</p>
        
            <p>The consumer affairs show, which investigates complaints from viewers, first aired in April 1977 and is just shy of its 47th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>During a 2021 interview with RNZ's Afternoons programme, original host and creator Brian Edwards said he was inspired by a BBC programme called That's Life.</p>
        
            <p>He said the team behind Fair Go wanted to protect people from rip offs and scams in their daily lives.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
