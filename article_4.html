            <p>The government has put aside $2.9 million to continue providing period products in schools.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme is a continuation of the one put in place a year ago by the Labour government, and is expected to benefit up to 200,000 students.</p>
        
            <p>But Education Minister Erica Stanford said the funding was due to run out in June.</p>
        
            <p>Continuing the funding was a matter of dignity, and it meant girls would not have to miss school because they did not have the access to period products, Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>"Young women deserve equal opportunities in education, which is why continuing this initiative is so important," Stanford said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an attendance problem in this country, and I have been working very closely with David Seymour who's very supportive of this policy as well, to make sure that we are giving all students the ability to come to school, and if that means providing period products at school then we will do it," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also encouraging students, and I know schools have been encouraging young women to be able to take period products home on the weekends, for holidays, for evening, so it's not just for school time."</p>
        
            <p>The University of Otago estimates up to 95,000 young New Zealanders could be missing school because of a lack of access to period products.</p>
        
            <p>All intermediate, kura and secondary schools can opt in to the scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Minister for Women Louise Upston said this was a positive step in addressing period poverty.</p>
        
            <p>"A lack of access to period products can be extremely stressful, disruptive and can impact students' confidence while learning.</p>
        
            <p>"For too long, periods have not been discussed openly. It's important conversations around our bodies are normalised, and part of this means ensuring young women can access the products they need, without feeling embarrassed."</p>
        
            <p>The latest funding is from within Ministry of Education baselines.</p>
