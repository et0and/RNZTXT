            <p>There have been 3399 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the past week, and seven further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Of the new cases, 2068 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 168 cases in hospital; the number in intensive care was not available, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury was the worst affected region, followed by Capital and Coast, Waikato and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Last Monday, 4042 new cases and 14 deaths attributed to the virus were reported for the previous week, with 162 cases in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Health NZ said it no longer recommended that asymptomatic household contacts of people with Covid-19 should test daily.</p>
        
            <p>There has been a small bump in the number of people getting Covid-19 vaccines since the newest one arrived last month.</p>
        
            <p>Experts think Long Covid is still a worry. Teachers are the most vulnerable occupation to getting Long Covid, which can still affect people four years after catching the virus, a new study shows.</p>
        
            <p>Fatigue and brain fog were found to be the most common effects. But others could be life-altering like heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome and a whole range of neurological effects.</p>
