            <p>Two helicopters equipped with monsoon buckets are on their way to a large scrub fire near Doubtless Bay in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze, in 1.5 hectares of pines and dense scrub at Taemaro Bay, was reported just before 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Northern fire communications manager Michael Anderson said two fire trucks from Mang≈çnui were at the scene with more on the way from the Karikari rural brigade.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood firefighters are protecting homes but the wind is light and flames are spreading slowly.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the fire is unclear.</p>
