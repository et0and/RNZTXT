        <h2>Pharmac holds out hope for ongoing supply of HRT</h2>
        <p>
People who cannot tolerate the new brand of oestrogen patches may still be able to apply to stick with their old treatment, Pharmac says.

            <p>
There have been long-running shortages of HRT (hormone replacement therapy) patches, and Pharmac has done a deal to source oestrogen patches from a new supplier - but say they may not be a good alternative for everyone.

            <p>People who cannot tolerate the new brand of oestrogen patches may still be able to apply to stick with their old treatment, Pharmac says.</p>
        
            <p>Some patients have been highly critical of Pharmac's decision to change suppliers, saying the patch that is set to be funded from July does not work for them.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's chief executive, Sarah Fitt, said she understood patients' concerns, but it was the only option to secure sufficient supply.</p>
        
            <p>"Pharmac has been managing ongoing supply shortages of the current oestradiol patches for several years, and we know that's been very difficult for people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on the information from the current supplier, Sandoz, it is unable to fully meet our supply needs with Estradot due to the continually increasing demand. The company we will contract with, Viatris, has provided an assurance that it is able to meet current and future demand - making it the only viable option."</p>
        
            <p>The new patch contained the same active ingredient in the same quantities as the Estradot brand of patches, Fitt said.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate, however, that this brand of patch or other funded alternatives might not be clinically suitable for everyone, so we will make sure there is an option to apply for access to other brands if needed," Fitt said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're still working out the details, and we'll share that information once it's confirmed."</p>
        
            <p>More than 6000 people have now signed a petition calling on the government to continue funding the Estradot patches.</p>
