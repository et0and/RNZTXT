        <h2>Slash debris, swimming bans darken Gisborne beach holidays</h2>
        <p>
Gisborne District Council chief scientist Murry Cave said it was disappointing the waterways have been clogged again.

            <p>Some of Gisborne's beaches are covered in slash, following days of heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>The Wairoa District had a heavy rain warning that was in place lifted today, but the region is still soaked.</p>
        
            <p>The rain caused slips and some surface flooding, spoiling residents' holiday celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>It has also caused beaches and waterways in the region to be covered in slash.</p>
        
            <p>Slash has been a major problem in the region, with a 12-year-old boy dying in January 2024, after being injured at a beach that was covered in slash.</p>
        
            <p>In October 2023, the government brought in regulations where slash longer than two metres, and with a large-end diameter of more than 10 centimeters, must be removed after harvesting from erosion-prone land unless it is unsafe to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne District Council chief scientist Murry Cave said it was disappointing the waterways have been clogged again, following the rain over the last few days.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had further woody debris come down the Waimata River onto the city beaches, and it's a wee bit disappointing because we've managed to get a big clean up done just before Christmas and now it does look rather messy again so we're trying to work out how we can get rid of some of that bigger material as soon as possible."</p>

            <p>Cave said there was a bridge that is potentially damaged as a result near Bruce Road.</p>
        
            <p>He said assessments will get underway on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's most likely that the city, beaches and the beaches from Whangara through to Tolaga Bay will be the worst affected.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't had a chance to assess those beaches yet, just the city beaches, but that's planned for this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>The city's beaches have been closed due to slash and emergency sewer valve releases.</p>

            <p>Cave is urging people to follow advice.</p>
        
            <p>"We already have signs up on the city beaches and on the beaches up at Wanui Beach warning of the danger.</p>
        
            <p>"For Waikanae Beach at the moment where we probably have about 10 to 15 big logs that could roll around and be a threat to life, we're really looking about how we can move those as fast as possible.</p>
        
            <p>"It may not be possible to get the contractors on, but we are looking at whether or not we can actually drag those logs up beyond the high tide mark so that the beach is safe."</p>

            <p>Cave said that should be done in the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>SafeSwim have issued a warning not to swim at Waikanae Beach, Wainui Beach, Tolaga Bay and Ocean Beach due to dangerous conditions, including large breaking waves, strong currents and strong winds.</p>
        
            <p>A similar warning has been issued for Ohope Beach due to sharks.</p>
        
            <p>It comes right before the three-day Rhythm and Vines music festival begins on Sunday, with up to 30,000 people expected to attend.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, Surf Live Saving said the Gisborne District Council has strongly advised people to stay out of the water to avoid the risk of illness, but is monitoring the situation and will provide updates as conditions change.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're heading to Rhythm and Vines or considering a swim at the beach in Gisborne; then please note that there is a current water quality notice in place for Gisborne beaches due to the recent storm."</p>
