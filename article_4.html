            <p>Three new people have been appointed to the board of the Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>The former chairperson of Waka Kotahi, Paul Reynolds, and board member Patrick Reynolds resigned last year and Victoria Carter is also leaving.</p>
        
            <p>They are being replaced by Warwick Isaacs, Rob Gilmore and Pat Dougherty.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown says the incoming members have strong links to local government and understand the transport needs of local communities.</p>
        
            <p>David Smol, who has served as a board member since February 2019, has been reappointed for a further 18 months.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the government is focused on economic growth and productivity, improving road maintenance and delivering a new generation of Roads of National Significance.</p>
        
            <p>He said the new board appointments will bring a wealth of delivery experience with backgrounds in engineering, construction, and infrastructure delivery.</p>
        
            <p>"Warwick Isaacs is from Canterbury and brings significant construction delivery experience having been the Director of the Christchurch Development Unit at the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority.</p>
        
            <p>"Rob Gilmore is from Kerikeri and has over 40 years' experience in road transport, working around the globe including at Downer in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Pat Dougherty is from Nelson and has significant experience across rail, roading, water and local government."</p>
        
            <p>He said the board was important in delivering on the government's priorities to enable Kiwis and freight get to where they wanted to go, quickly and safely.</p>
