            <p>The whole Northland region will be under a total fire ban from midnight Saturday over dangerous fire conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand has extended the prohibited fire season - already in place for some areas - over the dry, hot and windy conditions.</p>
        
            <p>District manager Wipari Henwood said it was too dangerous to light any outdoor fires.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a huge fire risk at present and all of the recent fires are taking their toll on our firefighters.</p>
        
            <p>"Over 90 percent of Northland's firefighters are volunteers, so the constant call-outs don't just have an impact on them but on their families and their employers or their own businesses too."</p>
        
            <p>Henwood said to avoid activities that generate sparks including grinding, mowing, welding and using chainsaws until there has been significant rain.</p>
        
            <p>"It only takes one spark to ignite a fire in these conditions. People have the best of intentions, but the consequences are severe when a fire starts.</p>
