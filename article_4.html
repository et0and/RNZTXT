            <p>The woman accused of murdering an elderly Khandallah resident will continue to be held in prison, while she waits to hear if her application for bail will be granted.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Gregory, 79, was found dead in her Baroda Street home on 24 January, after what police described as a "violent act".</p>
        
            <p>A 52-year-old woman, whose identity remains suppressed, faces one charge of murder and one count of obtaining thousands of dollars by deception.</p>
        
            <p>She has been remanded in custody since her arrest on 11 February.</p>
        
            <p>The murder charge was laid after police searched the Porirua landfill for items they believed had been discarded following the death. The financial deception charge was added last month.</p>
        
            <p>Details of a bail hearing held at Wellington High Court on Tuesday cannot be published under the law.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Dale La Hood said he would make a decision on the woman's application at a later date.</p>
        
            <p>Gregory's obituary described her as a dearly loved mother and mother-in-law, and a treasured grandmother.</p>
