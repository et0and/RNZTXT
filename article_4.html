            <p>The 20-month-old was struck by a vehicle leaving a Kaitaia address on Tuesday</p>
        
            <p>"The parents of the child drove her to Kaitaia Hospital themselves, where medical staff assessed that she had received critical injuries,' Detective Senior Sergeant Kevan Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>The child was flown to Auckland's Starship hospital in a critical condition, but died of her injuries on Friday morning.</p>
