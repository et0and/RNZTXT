            <p>Heavy rain is set to lash parts of the South Island for much of Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Orange level warnings are in place for Westland and Buller Districts until the evening.</p>
        
            <p>MetService's Heath Gullery told Morning Report the rain was starting in the west of the South Island and slowly moving up to the lower North Island throughout Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"There is likely to be some localised flooding, and rivers and streams will be running high."</p>
        
            <p>Gullery said once the current rain front moved away there was more wet weather behind it, through until Tuesday next week.</p>
        
            <p>However the temperatures would also be more mild, with the east of the North Island possibly reaching the low 20s.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a change from that really cold weather we've had... It certainly will feel spring like."</p>
        
            <p>And it might be some good news for hydro lake levels which have been blamed for soaring power prices.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it will, it will be a gradual impact... it'll probably take several rain events to bring those levels up again," Gullery said.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings for Tasman, the Tararua Ranges and Mt Taranaki have been upgraded to orange.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said up to 250mm of rain was expected on the Westland ranges and up to 100mm nearer the coast.</p>
        
            <p>"Peak rates of 15 to 25 mm/h expected about the ranges during Friday," MetService said of Westland.</p>
        
            <p>In Buller peak intensities of 10 to 15 mm/h were expected.</p>
        
            <p>"Streams and rivers may rise rapidly. Surface flooding, slips, and difficult driving conditions possible."</p>
        
            <p>Yellow strong wind watches are in place for Canterbury High Country, and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Yellow heavy rain watches are in force for Richmond, Grey District and Fiordland.</p>
        
            <p>Part of SH73, between Arthur's Pass Village and Otira, was closed on Friday morning due to rockfall, there were no detours available.</p>
