            <p>Trains between Wellington and Waikanae are running again after about two hours of cancellations.</p>
        
            <p>However, passengers should still expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Metlink cancelled or suspended Kāpiti line services due to what it is calling an operational incident.</p>
        
            <p>It cancelled the 5.55pm Kāpiti line service from Wellington to Waikanae, and the 7pm service from Waikanae to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Other services had been suspended between Wellington and Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink said it had organised a limited number of bus replacements.</p>
