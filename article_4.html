            <p>A person has been found dead in the water near Raglan.</p>
        
            <p>Formal identification is yet to take place, but police believe it to be 31-year-old Luke Berwick, who was reported missing last week.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public saw the body around 2.25pm on Monday from a nearby footbridge.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they extended their condolences to Berwick's whānau and loved one.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will continue to make inquiries into the circumstances of the death on behalf of the Coroner."</p>
        
            <p>The discovery came as police were conducting a land and sea search for Berwick.</p>
        
            <p>He had last spoken to his family on 24 September and was understood to have been fishing in the area when he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>On social media, Wahangaoterangi Trust said local kaumātua had placed a rāhui on the whole of Whaingaroa Harbour, as well as Ngarunui beach, north to Kaha Point (muscle rock).</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately Luke Berwick has been missing since Tuesday. Police have been following leads but are quite certain now that Luke is missing at sea. There has been a rāhui put over the ocean by local kaumātua.</p>
        
            <p>"Until further notice, if you want to respect local tikanga and protocol then don't enter the ocean until the rāhui is lifted."</p>
        
            <p>The trust said it was supporting Berwick's family.</p>
        
            <p>"We have acknowledged to them that the community are feeling their sadness and fear of the situation."</p>
