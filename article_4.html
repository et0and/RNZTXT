            <p>Police have been searching the Hutt River for a man who has been missing two months.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas Basire, 28, was last seen near the Ewen Bridge on Railway Ave walking on the stop bank towards Petone on 24 November 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Martin Todd said he was wearing a red long-sleeved sweatshirt, black trousers and black sneakers at the time of his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday police had a specialist search team searching both the Hutt River and riverbank.</p>
        
            <p>Todd said both police and Basire's family were seriously concerned about his wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>"It is out of character for Tom to not be in contact with his family, especially to miss seeing his family on his birthday in December," said Todd.</p>
        
            <p>Todd urged anyone with information about Basire's whereabouts to contact them online or call 105 quoting the reference number 241213/6143.</p>
