            <p>There are suggestions popular UK disc jockey DJ Fred Again could be playing a gig in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council did not respond directly to RNZ's inquiry whether the artist was going to play a set.</p>
        
            <p>It said it could not confirm anything until the artist-led announcement.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was told people have begun buying tickets to Wellington in anticipation of the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson for the Homegrown festival, which was held over the weekend, told RNZ they were not allowed to comment.</p>
        
            <p>It was rumoured while the other stages from the Homegrown festival last weekend had been taken down, the Park Stage had been left up for Fred Again to do a pop-up show this Friday or Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers of the CubaDupa festival said they did not have any "secret acts or gigs planned", but were "looking forward to a magnificent weekend in the capital" nonetheless.</p>
        
            <p>CupaDupa runs from midday Saturday until 9pm Sunday, "with no programming falling outside of these hours".</p>
        
            <p>Fred Again posted a video of himself watching an old video of Jonah Lomu playing in an All Blacks game on his Instagram Story at 4pm on Tuesday.</p>
