            <p>Two separate fires near Manurewa in Auckland overnight are being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said crews were called to a two-storey apartment block on Lincoln Road about 4.30am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>All persons are accounted for, and four fire trucks remained dampening down hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>And firefighters responded to a blaze at a house on Great South Road about 9.45pm on Saturday, which FENZ was also treating as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator was at the scene.</p>
