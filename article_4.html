            <p>An Auckland auction house expects five rare huia feathers to fetch a good price when they go under the hammer on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Interest in the extinct native bird's feathers has soared since May, when a single feather - valued at between $1000-$2000 - sold at Webb's for a world record-breaking $46,521, making the feather the most expensive in the world.</p>
        
            <p>The Guardian dubbed the feather "more expensive than gold".</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the price of huia feathers had taken flight, Webb's head of decorative arts Leah Morris said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely increased. You would see them sell for around the $2000 mark prior to the May sale and then after [that] we now have a revised pricing, and they're sitting between $8000 and $14,000."</p>
        
            <p>The five feathers are in different conditions and are valued on the Webb's website from $7000 to $14,000.</p>
        
            <p>One was bought at auction 10 years ago, but the others were passed down, Morris said.</p>
        
            <p>One of them was gifted by K카ngi T훮whiao to a postmaster or telegraphists he met in 1882, and was inherited by the vendor's grandfather.</p>

            <p>The accompanying written text says it is "a 'relic of the Whatiwhatihoe great native gathering' in May 1882 / From K카ngi T훮whiao to one of the postmasters + telegraphists introduced to him at Alexandra 14.5.82".</p>
        
            <p>Another another rare taonga up for sale on Sunday was a hand-carved seal that belonged to the second-ever Bishop of Melanesia, Bishop John Richardson Selwyn, Morris said.</p>
        
            <p>"Usually these get destroyed after the bishop passes or they go into an archive ... it's really special we have this for auction."</p>
        
            <p>The last confirmed sighting of a huia was in 1907. Morris said people recognised the feathers were precious, and New Zealanders felt a real connection to the extinct bird.</p>

            <p>"It's ... a story of loss, and deforestation and hunting, and people really connect to the huia bird because they appreciate our native flora and fauna and they want to protect them."</p>
        
            <p>Morris said Aucklanders had not quite been flocking to view the feathers, but interest had been "steady".</p>
        
            <p>"They might not be looking to purchase, but they're looking to see a huia feather, because you might not get to see one, in your lifetime."</p>
        
            <p>The five framed feathers are up for sale as individual lots at Webb's Mt Eden auction house, starting at 2.30pm on Sunday.</p>
