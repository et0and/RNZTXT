            <p>To most people, a traditional Christmas dinner means meats and Christmas cake or pudding, so what do you make when vegan and gluten-free guests RSVP?</p>
        
            <p>Alby Hailes, a former winner of The Great Kiwi Bake Off, has a new recipe book Good Vibes.</p>

            <p>I spoke to him to find out how to navigate Christmas without disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we're in 2023, often you do have to be catering to different diets - whether that's for allergy reasons or personal preferences," Hailes says.</p>
        
            <p>"[But] Christmas is a time where everyone should be able to enjoy themselves and everyone should be able to enjoy whatever kai you're putting on the table."</p>
        
            <p>"When you think of Christmas, you often think of a meat-based centrepiece, but a lot of what I try to do with my cooking recipes is placing vegetables at the centre of the table and that they can be just as much a showstopper as that leg of roast lamb or that turkey that you've been roasting."</p>
        
            <p>Hailes recommends his showstopper cauli with speedy satay & hazelnut dukkah as a vegan and gluten-free centrepiece from his cookbook Good Vibes.</p>
        
            <p>"What you do is you parboil the whole cauliflower. So, it cooks it a wee bit in boiling water, and then you just put it into an oven at a really high temperature. It's rubbed in lots of delicious spices. We're thinking things like sumac, ginger, cardamom."</p>
        
            <p>He says then whip up a quick satay sauce with tahini and peanut butter and maple syrup and soy sauce.</p>
        
            <p>"You put that over the top of the hot cauliflower, sprinkle some nice dukkah, some other fresh herbs."</p>
        
            <p>When placed at the centre of the table "it almost looks like this alien-like creature, as the leaves of the cauliflower unfurl.</p>
        
            <p>"It's perfect as a centrepiece because you can then just dig in with a spoon. Everyone just takes some of the cauliflower. I think it's just as delicious and it's probably easier than having something meat based on the table."</p>
        
            <p>Sides are also essential, Hailes says. He recommends his grilled sweetcorn and nectarine salad with miso dressing - also from his Good Vibes cookbook.</p>
        
            <p>"Something that I quite like is really utilising the summer produce because in Aotearoa we're so lucky that we can grow a lot of great produce and you know things like sweetcorn and stone fruit. They really are at their peak during the summer months when we get to have Christmas. It's great to incorporate that in your menu."</p>
        
            <p>It's also an ideal dish for a busy kitchen. "Often the kitchen can be quite busy at Christmas if you've got lots of things going on in the oven."</p>
        
            <p>He says this dish can be done on the stovetop or outside on the barbecue.</p>
        
            <p>"So essentially you grill some nectarines and some whole sweet corn cobs.</p>
        
            <p>"Then you add in some herbs and this delicious miso dressing, which gives it that kind of umami-ness which is that really nice savoury quality, which balances with the sweetness of the corn and the nectarines."</p>
        
            <p>He says while some people might be unsure about fruit in salad, he thinks it's a nice counterpoint to some of the richer food often present at a Christmas feast.</p>
        
            <p>Hailes says for many people dessert is the trickiest part to make vegan and gluten free as the dishes often have flour, eggs or butter.</p>
        
            <p>He says his Eton Mess is a great alternative to the classic Kiwi pavlova and trifle.</p>
        
            <p>"What's miraculous is that you can make meringues that are vegan-friendly by using aquafaba, which is the drained brine from a can of chickpeas."</p>
        
            <p>Alongside delicious crispy meringues, he says it also has the refreshing flavours of strawberries, elderflower and basil.</p>
        
            <p>"We have these beautiful strawberries over Christmas, so it's great to utilise them and something floral like elderflower, as well as the herbiness of the basil compliments it really nicely."</p>
        
            <p>To make the strawberry sauce, alongside the fresh strawberries, he recommends coconut yoghurt instead of cream as a great vegan alternative.</p>
        
            <p>"My strawberry basil and elderflower Eaten mess is perfect for someone who's both vegan and gluten-free, or anyone. It doesn't even have to be that that's your dietary preference, it's delicious anyway."</p>
        
            <p>Hailes says all his dishes are fairly simple and can be attempted by cooks of all levels of experience.</p>
        
            <p>He also recommends doing prep work the day before when possible, giving you more time to celebrate with friends and family.</p>
        
            <p>He's also quick to recommend his cookbook for anyone searching for a Christmas gift.</p>
        
            <p>But how does Christmas work in the house of a winning cook?</p>
        
            <p>Hailes says he comes from a family of excellent cooks, who share in the cooking.</p>
        
            <p>"But I think as I've grown more into my own identity as a cook and gotten more into cooking I think now there's a part of me that really enjoys that process of being able to make and share kai for my whānau, and so these days I do often take up the mantle of preparing quite a few dishes for the family Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>What will Hailes be bringing to the table this Christmas?</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually having Christmas with my partner's family for the first time. So I'm not sure. I think I might still do a bit of the cooking."</p>
        
            <p>He says he might make one or two of these recipes, but he's also got a traditional family dish.</p>
        
            <p>"In my family, we actually have this traditional dessert called a turkey pudding - which sounds horrific, but I promise there are no turkeys involved in the making of it. It was my grandma's recipe. She's now passed away and it's a kind of chocolate mousse dome covered in slices of raspberry Swiss roll. And it's pretty special for our family. So I'll probably be making that one this year in her memory."</p>

            <p>Showstopper cauli</p>
        
            <p>2 tbsp + ¼ to ¾ tsp sea salt</p>
        
            <p>1 large cauliflower, a few tender leaves left on</p>
        
            <p>4 tbsp olive oil</p>
        
            <p>finely grated zest and freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp muscovado sugar</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp ground sumac</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp ground cinnamon</p>
        
            <p>1 tsp ground ginger</p>
        
            <p>1 tsp ground cardamom</p>
        
            <p>½ tsp ground chipotle chilli</p>
        
            <p>3 tbsp finely chopped coriander, plus extra to serve</p>
        
            <p>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
        
            <p>½ tsp cracked black pepper</p>
        
            <p>Speedy satay</p>
        
            <p>3 tbsp crunchy peanut butter</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp tahini</p>
        
            <p>freshly squeezed juice of ½ lemon</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp maple syrup</p>
        
            <p>1 tsp gluten-free hoisin or gluten-free soy sauce</p>
        
            <p>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</p>
        
            <p>½ tsp ground chipotle chilli</p>
        
            <p>¼ tsp sea salt</p>
        
            <p>¼ tsp cracked black pepper</p>
        
            <p>Hazelnut dukkah</p>
        
            <p>40g hazelnuts, roughly chopped</p>
        
            <p>1 ½ tsp each coriander seeds, cumin seeds and sesame seeds</p>
        
            <p>½ tsp each sea salt and cracked black pepper</p>
        
            <p>Preheat the oven to 220°C fan-forced (or 240°C conventional).</p>
        
            <p>For the showstopper cauli, fill a large saucepan (big enough to fit your cauliflower) with water. Add 2 tbsp salt and bring to the boil over high heat. Carefully add the whole cauliflower and cook for about 8 minutes, until parboiled (a knife should go easily through most of the cauliflower but meet some resistance at the centre).</p>
        
            <p>In a bowl, whisk together the remaining cauli ingredients, including the remaining ¼ to ¾ tsp salt, to form a slightly runny paste.</p>
        
            <p>Drain the cauliflower and transfer to a rack to 'drip-dry' for 2 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower to a large casserole dish or roasting tin and brush the paste over, massaging it into the crevasses to evenly coat. Roast for 15 minutes, until the top of the cauliflower is slightly charred. Remove from the oven.</p>
        
            <p>To make the speedy satay, place all ingredients into a jar or bowl. Add about 40ml cold water a little at a time, whisking with a fork after each addition until it forms a thick but pourable sauce.</p>
        
            <p>For the hazelnut dukkah, toast the chopped hazelnuts in a dry frying pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until just starting to brown a little. Add the cumin, coriander and sesame seeds and toast for a further 2 minutes, until the hazelnuts are golden brown and the seeds are fragrant and toasted. Use a mortar and pestle to grind until the seeds form a coarse powder around the chopped hazelnuts, still with some texture and crunch. Stir in the salt and pepper.</p>
        
            <p>Serve the whole cauliflower hot, topped with the speedy satay, hazelnut dukkah and a generous sprinkling of coriander.</p>

            <p>Salad </p>
        
            <p>4 large corn cobs, husks and silks removed</p>
        
            <p>6 spring onions, cut into 5cm pieces</p>
        
            <p>4 nectarines, stones removed, sliced into 1cm wedges</p>
        
            <p>1 large handful basil leaves, torn</p>
        
            <p>1 telegraph cucumber (about 300g), quartered lengthways and cut into 1cm dice</p>
        
            <p>Miso dressing</p>
        
            <p>3 tbsp maple syrup</p>
        
            <p>1 ½ tbsp shiro (white) miso paste</p>
        
            <p>freshly squeezed juice of 2 lemons</p>
        
            <p>½ long red chilli, finely chopped</p>
        
            <p>6 tbsp olive oil</p>
        
            <p>For the salad, heat a barbecue grill until hot. Barbecue the corn for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until most of the corn kernels are lightly charred. At the same time, barbecue the spring onion for 5-10 minutes, until browned and starting to char a little. Transfer the spring onion to a large bowl. Transfer the corn to a chopping board. Once cool enough to handle, stand the corn upright, and use a small sharp knife to cut off the kernels. Add the corn to the bowl with the spring onions and discard the cobs.</p>
        
            <p>Place the nectarine wedges on the barbecue and grill for 3 minutes, turning to cook both sides, until browned and softened a little. Add the grilled nectarine to the bowl, along with the basil and cucumber.</p>
        
            <p>For the miso dressing, place all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour the dressing over the warm salad and toss through to coat. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>
        
            <p>This salad is best served warm, but is happily refrigerated and eaten cold the following day.</p>
        
            <p>(Serves 6 to 8, but easily doubled).</p>

            <p>Vegan meringues</p>
        
            <p>100g aquafaba (liquid drained from a 400g can chickpeas ~ Pam's are good)</p>
        
            <p>¾ tsp cream of tartar</p>
        
            <p>100g caster sugar</p>
        
            <p>Strawberry sauce</p>
        
            <p>500g fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped into small 1 to 2cm pieces</p>
        
            <p>4 tbsp elderflower cordial</p>
        
            <p>2 tbsp lemon juice</p>
        
            <p>10 basil leaves, finely chopped</p>
        
            <p>Macerated strawberries</p>
        
            <p>500g fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered lengthways</p>
        
            <p>10 basil leaves, slice thinly</p>
        
            <p>3 tbsp elderflower cordial</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp lemon juice</p>
        
            <p>To serve</p>
        
            <p>700g Greek-style coconut yoghurt</p>
        
            <p>1 tbsp elderflower cordial</p>
        
            <p>Prepare the meringues and strawberry sauce in advance (ie the day prior).</p>
        
            <p>Preheat the oven to 100°C fan-forced (or 120°C conventional). Grease and line a large oven tray with baking paper and brush the paper very lightly with a little canola oil (this will help to ensure the meringues don't stick to the paper once baked).</p>
        
            <p>For the meringues, place the aquafaba and cream of tartar in a clean large bowl. Using an electric hand or stand mixer (a stand mixer makes this a lot easier), beat the aquafaba on high speed until white and forming stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. While beating continuously, gradually add the caster sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, making sure each tablespoon of sugar is dissolved before adding the next. Once all the sugar has been added, continue beating for a further 5 minutes to form a beautifully stiff, thick, and glossy meringue. Spoon large heaped tablespoons of meringue mixture onto the lined oven tray, with a little space between to allow them to spread - you should have about 12 piles of meringue. Place on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 1 hour 45 minutes (the meringues will take on a little more colour compared to egg-based meringues). Turn off the oven, open the door so it is slightly ajar, and leave the meringues to cool in the turned off oven for a further 45 minutes to dry out fully. Store in an airtight container.</p>
        
            <p>For the strawberry sauce, place the chopped strawberries, elderflower cordial and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the strawberries start to break down (you can mash these a little as they cook) and the liquid reduces slightly to form a delicious sauce. The sauce will thicken further as it cools. Stir through the chopped basil, transfer to a container or jar and refrigerate until ready to assemble your Eton mess.</p>
        
            <p>Assemble the Eton mess immediately prior to serving (to ensure the meringues retain some crispness when eaten).</p>
        
            <p>For the macerated strawberries, place the chopped strawberries in a large bowl. Add the basil, elderflower cordial and lemon juice, tossing to coat. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the flavours to mingle.</p>
        
            <p>To assemble the Eton mess, in a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut yoghurt and elderflower cordial until smooth. In a trifle bowl (or similar-sized deep glass serving bowl), spoon one-quarter of the macerated strawberries into the base. Then begin to layer the components, first spooning over one-third of the yoghurt, drizzle with one-third of the strawberry sauce, roughly crumble over one-third of the meringues then spoon over one-third of the remaining macerated strawberries. Repeat twice more with alternating layers of yoghurt, sauce, meringues and strawberries, finishing with a scattering of macerated strawberries on top to finish. Serve immediately.</p>
