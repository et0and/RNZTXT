            <p>David Benbow has filed an appeal against his murder conviction for killing his childhood friend, Michael McGrath.</p>
        
            <p>McGrath was last seen in his Christchurch home in May 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Two years later, former prison guard David Benbow was charged with his murder, accused of fatally shooting the 49-year-old.</p>
        
            <p>But neither the gun, nor Mr McGrath's body, has been located.</p>
        
            <p>A High Court jury found Benbow guilty of murder and he was serving a sentence of life in jail with a minimum non parole period of 17 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Court of Appeal has confirmed he has filed an appeal against both his conviction and sentence.</p>
        
            <p>A hearing date was yet to be set.</p>
