            <p>Auckland train services on the western line have been cancelled between Britomart and Newmarket due to a track issue.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport blamed a "Kiwirail track infrastructure issue" near the CBD's Britomart station.</p>
        
            <p>"Scheduled buses are accepting rail tickets and AT Hop cards," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Trains in the country's biggest city have regularly been disrupted in recent months, with problems including signalling failures, speed restrictions, software problems, construction, maintenance and even summer heat.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown in February organised a meeting with Auckland Transport, Kiwirail, Auckland One Rail and a representative for the Minister of Transport to discuss the ongoing interruptions.</p>
        
            <p>There were about 9000 unplanned outages on the network last year, and more than 1300 between 15 January and 19 February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
