            <p>One of two men charged following the death of Flaxmere man Darcy Strickland has pleaded guilty to his murder.</p>
        
            <p>Alizaye Kireka Windzar Todd, 20, was brought before the High Court at Napier on Friday and said "guilty" in a strong, clear voice after he was asked to plead.</p>
        
            <p>The Mongrel Mob associate maintains he is not guilty of a separate charge of injuring with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, related to a woman who was hurt on the night that Strickland died.</p>
        
            <p>A trial for a second man charged with murder, Keontay Wayne Chadwick, 23, has been set down for 12 February next year.</p>
        
            <p>Strickland was found injured outside a house in Ramsay Crescent in the Hastings suburb of Flaxmere just before midnight on 13 October, 2022. He died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Strickland, 29, was described as a gentle giant in a family tribute after his death. He had returned from a trip to France about three weeks before. He was remembered for his kindness and generosity towards his Flaxmere community.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Dale La Hood presided over Friday's hearing via audio-visual link from Wellington.</p>
