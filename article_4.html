            <p>Mission Bay man, Brian Gray, spent his weekend swimming 150 km of the Waikato River. It took him 30 hours without breaks to get from Karapiro to Port Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The river's current provided help along the way, but he didn't finish the task without some dramas - including getting lost and swimming the wrong way for a few hours.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd gone and done test swims to see what the current was, because it starts off fast and gets slow, and then the last 15 to 20km can be quite tidal.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you have to make sure you hit it at the right time. Otherwise, you can be swimming against the current, which is about 4km at its peak".</p>
        
            <p>But his best laid plans went awry when it came to doing the actual swim, he told RNZ Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"I measured my swim speed and my float speed, and I already knew my normal swim speed, because you decrease as you get more tired and swim longer, I put that on my spreadsheet and worked out every how long it's going to take me for each 10km section."</p>
        
            <p>However because the boat to take him to the start point was over loaded, the start time was delayed by an hour, he said.</p>
        
            <p>More trouble was to come.</p>
        
            <p>"When we'd done that test, they had the gate open so we went flying down.</p>
        
            <p>"When we did the actual swim, the gate wasn't open. I talked to Mighty River and asked them nicely if they'd open it for an hour or so, but they wouldn't, wouldn't play ball, bit rough, isn't it?"</p>
        
            <p>And about halfway into the swim, his "addled brain" sent him the wrong way.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I was following instructions and going up the river bank, but I'd turned around. I don't know how you get lost on a one-way river. "</p>
        
            <p>Back on track he had to keep his energy levels up, he wanted to keep his nutrition healthy and natural, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was having mostly kumara, which lasted quite well for 10 hours, and then it sort of came up in one solid chunk. Not the best, feeding eels."</p>
        
            <p>Plan B was energy drinks, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was taking athletic drinks that have high calories and gels and all those things are not really very good for you, but feeding me well, they get you through it."</p>
        
            <p>Night river swimming is like "staring at a wall for 31 hours." Gray said.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not on your phone or watching telly or anything like that. So, you've got to be okay in your own mind and either think about things or switch off. I just seemed to switch off more, instead of thinking about stuff, instead of solving the world problems."</p>
        
            <p>You can't switch off so much you fall asleep, however, he said</p>
        
            <p>"Sleep is the ultimate limit, if you think I'd like to swim for a week, well, sleep becomes an issue at some stage. That's the final limiter."</p>
