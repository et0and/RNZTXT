        <h2>Grounded barge could be stuck at Westport beach for days</h2>
        <p>
A specialist tug is on its way, but any re-float won't be until later in the week, authorities say.

            <p>A barge that ran aground on a Westport beach could be stuck there for days, authorities say.</p>
        
            <p>Manahau, a Westland Mineral Sands barge, ran aground at Carters Beach about midnight Saturday during a storm.</p>
        
            <p>It had 11 people on board. No-one was injured and there were no leaks, Maritime NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>There was also no cargo on board at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Work was being undertaken on Sunday to ensure the grounded barge "remains stable" at the beach, Maritime NZ said.</p>
        
            <p>"The work to date has involved our people, representatives from the vessel's operator, as well as from local and regional authorities," incident controller Blair Simmons said.</p>
        
            <p>"This afternoon, diggers have been on the beach, creating anchor points to lock the vessel in place.</p>
        
            <p>"This stops it from potentially drifting towards rocks at high tide."</p>
        
            <p>All work was being undertaken during daylight hours.</p>
        
            <p>Once the Manahau was stable, authorities would figure out how to move it without harming any people or the environment, Simmons said.</p>
        
            <p>That would require careful planning and analysis and would take some time.</p>
        
            <p>He said Westland Mineral Sands had spoken to salvage experts and was planning on sending a specialist tug down from Taranaki, ahead of a potential re-float later in the week.</p>
        
            <p>"Re-floating the vessel will be a delicate operation, and we will closely review any plans being put in place by the operator."</p>
        
            <p>Simmons discouraged locals from climbing on the barge or getting close to it while machinery was working.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an operational area, and people need to stay away for their own safety."</p>
        
            <p>The 11 crew members remained on board and were safe, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A Maritime NZ investigation into the grounding was underway.</p>
