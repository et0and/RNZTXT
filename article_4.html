            <p>Three men taken to Gisborne Hospital after a 100-person brawl at a 21st turned deadly remain in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they are not ruling out further arrests or charges since they are still in the early stages of their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The brawl broke out after two uninvited guests arrived at the party, police earlier said.</p>
        
            <p>Two men - Chrysler Stevens Mark and Kane Taare-Gray - died in the fight.</p>
        
            <p>The bodies of the men have been transported to Palmerston North Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora MidCentral said they were brought in on Monday, and were in police custody at its morgue.</p>
        
            <p>The scene examination on Lytton Road appeared to be winding down on Tuesday, with the size of the police cordon shrinking to just the property where the party was held.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic teams were back on the ground again, combing the street for evidence.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, forensic teams were seen swabbing cars and entering different properties.</p>

            <p>Police said they had identified 40 witnesses in their investigation, which they have described as complex, and wanted to identify another 60.</p>
        
            <p>They wanted to interview everyone at the party, and were requesting any videos, photos and information from the night to help with their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>One of the men in hospital was one of the uninvited guests, while the second gatecrasher was a 29-year-old man who was arrested and currently remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Police were at Gisborne Hospital, but it remained open to patients and visitors.</p>
        
            <p>A high police presence would remain in Gisborne this week, including over Easter.</p>
