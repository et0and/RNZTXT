        <h2>'Dr Polkinghorne was changing' - Friend says surgeon was 'bit more manic' before wife's death</h2>
        <p>
"His nature changed, his physical presence changed ... a little bit irrational, I felt, at times," Stephen MacIntyre, who knew the couple 25 years, has told the court.

            <p>Warning: This story contains discussion of a potential suicide.</p>
        
            <p>A close friend of the retired Auckland eye surgeon accused of murdering his wife, said his friend's behaviour changed in the year leading up to his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>It's the second week of the trial of Philip Polkinghorne, who denies killing Pauline Hanna in their Remuera home in April 2021. His defence argues she had struggled with her mental health and that her death was a case of suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's case was that the couple were unhappy, that Polkinghorne was a "heavy" meth user who was living a secret "double life" with a prostitute and that finances had become a strain because of this - and that the combination of these factors led him to kill Hanna during a violent struggle which he then staged as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen MacIntyre, who had known the couple for 25 years is the first personal contact of the couple to testify in the trial at the High Court in Auckland, and appeared through audio-visual link.</p>
        
            <p>He said he came to know Polkinghorne through spending time together at Rings Beach in the Coromandel where they both owned baches - having coffee , fishing, diving and having dinner barbeques together on public holidays and at Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Crown Prosecutor Brian Dickey whether there had been any changes he observed of the couple or in his relationship with them in the years previous to Hanna's death, MacIntyre said yes.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that Dr Polkinghorne was changing…over a period of time, some things I saw and felt I didn't particularly liked, I probably just backed off the relationship a little bit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that in that period leading up to Pauline's death, he was quite changed, he told me some things that turned out … I doubted the truth of them, his nature changed, his physical presence changed, he became slimmer and more muscly, a different physique, a bit more manic, a little bit irrational I felt, at times," he said.</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre recalled a time when Polkinghorne told him about an incident in Manaia where he crashed his ute into a fence.</p>
        
            <p>He said Polkinghorne initially said that no one saw the incident and that he got a new ute, but in a later account said he had crashed due to falling asleep at the wheel and was asked to pay for damages.</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre said his friend's account was inconsistent, and he didn't know if he could believe either of those accounts.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Dickey what he thought led to that change, MacIntyre said " I felt he was using drugs".</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre said whereas in the past he would see the couple often on public holidays and Christmas, he saw them less in the year prior to Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>He said he observed less change in Hanna, "Pauline didn't change to me other than one thing, I saw her walking one day around the coast, probably in the year before she died and I thought she seemed to have lost a bit of weight, other than that I didn't notice any difference in Pauline".</p>
        
            <p>The court has heard from a former product tester for Consumer NZ, Paul Smith, who analysed the energy usage at the Polkinghorne home on the morning Hanna was found dead on 5 April, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The defence has argued Polkinghorne went downstairs that morning to the kitchen, to make tea and toast for his wife, before finding her body lying in the entranceway.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said he analysed the energy usage of the household in the previous evening and in the early morning, from 4am to 7.30am.</p>
        
            <p>He said he could not conclude specifically what appliances were drawing energy, but could make assumptions based on spikes in energy above the baseline use, and how much energy appliances like an electric kettle or toaster use.</p>
        
            <p>"I reasonably think we can rule out the use of the kettle or the toaster in that period [of the early morning] because the energy increase over the baseline is not sufficient to support their use," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey asked to clarify whether this was both appliances being used at the same time separately.</p>
        
            <p>"In combination we can definitely rule them out, absolutely there's not enough energy there. Separately, the energy is closer, but still there is a lot of doubt to whether you could use it there, because anything else using the energy would have to cease using that energy," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>In cross-examination by the defence, he was asked if when he completed his analysis, if he knew the house had underfloor heating.</p>
        
            <p>He did not, Smith said, but he could not draw conclusions about the underfloor heating as they did not know its model or the timer it was set to.</p>
        
            <p>The defence showed the court pictures of a red toaster in the Polkinghorne kitchen, set to the lowest setting, and a matching red kettle, which Smith agreed appeared to have condensation on its glass lid.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Smith said he could not make an assumption about how long it might take condensation to dry out, or when this might have indicated when the kettle was last used.</p>
        
            <p>He said he could not reasonably determine the energy usage of a toaster set to its lowest setting, but his analysis was based on average consumer use.</p>
        
            <p>"While you'd expect there to be some correlation between the toaster setting and the brownness of the bread, the level of toasting, it's not as easy to say that one toast to set low, or one toast to set high will produce a particular amount of energy used or amount of toast."</p>
        
            <p>Smith was also quizzed about the probable use of the washing machine and dryer.</p>
        
            <p>A damp sheet was found in the dryer of the Polkinghorne home on the morning of 5 April.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said he agreed with a second analysis referenced by the defence, that the dryer could only have been used between 6.30pm and 10.30pm the night before.</p>
        
            <p>Of the washing machine, he said it could have been used in the morning because it would have drawn a low level of electricity on a cold wash cycle, but it was hard to make an exact conclusion.</p>
