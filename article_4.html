            <p>The treatment plant providing water for Te Aroha in Waikato is experiencing ongoing temporary shut-downs as the filtration system struggles to cope with sediment washed in by recent heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Matamata-Piako mayor Adrienne Wilcock said the tap water is currently safe but urged people to save water.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't run out of water and we don't intend to run out of water. They'll keep the plant running, they're just looking for solutions to make sure we can manage that."</p>
        
            <p>But Wilcock said if people do not conserve water the town would run out as the plant could not currently produce the amount of water the town would usually consume.</p>
        
            <p>Matamata-Piako District Council said it recommends residents consider going out of town to a friend's house or workplace to shower.</p>
        
            <p>It asked residents not to use dishwashers, washing machines, baths, or water outside the house.</p>
        
            <p>This meant turning off garden times, not washing the car or water blasting.</p>
        
            <p>The famous Te Aroha Mineral Spas has also had to close for the day.</p>
        
            <p>Water tankers are available in the town for drinking water at the Silver Fern Farms Event Centre and on Whitaker Street, outside Te Aroha Domain.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are asked to bring clean containers to fill.</p>
