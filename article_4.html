            <p>Surf Lifesaving is advising those hitting the beach this weekend to be alert for sharks.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after multiple reports of shark sightings on the North Island's east coast.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Lifesaving northern region general manager Zac Franich said the reality is that people swim where sharks live.</p>
        
            <p>If swimmer sees a shark, Franich said they should exit the water calmly and notify a lifeguard.</p>
        
            <p>He said the safest place to swim is between the flags, as that is where the lifeguards direct their attention.</p>
        
            <p>Safeswim on Thursday advised people not to swim at Ōmanu Beach and Papamoa Beach, both in the Bay of Plenty, after shark sightings.</p>
        
            <p>A week ago, a near one-metre-long suspected bronze whaler was spotted by lifeguards at Ōmanu.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Lifesaving's manager for the Eastern Region Chaz Gibbons-Campbell said it was receiving reports of shark sightings at some popular swimming beaches along the North Island's east coast.</p>
        
            <p>"We're certainly seeing a few sightings across the coastline over the last couple of days and that's due to the clear weather and flat conditions that we're seeing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really cool to be able to see them in the ocean, we give them some space let them swim on by and usually lifeguards are advising people to be back in the water within half an hour so it's pretty safe most of the time."</p>
        
            <p>He said anyone who saw a shark should get out of the water and alert lifeguards.</p>
        
            <p>"Just exit the water in a calm manner, no thrashing about, and let others around you know as well so they can exit the water," Gibbons-Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also good to note the direction it's travelling, how big it is, and if you can see any identifying features that helps [the lifeguards] to determine what kind of species it is and make a more informed risk assessment."</p>
        
            <p>He said there had been four rescues at patrolled beaches between Waihi and Opotiki so far this year, including people getting caught in offshore wind while kayaking and stand up paddle boarding.</p>
        
            <p>Gibbons-Campbell said next week would bring good swells to beaches along the east coast, particularly near Gisborne, and asked people to be prepared and take care in the water.</p>
