            <p>The east coast of New Zealand is bracing for strong winds on Sunday, as firefighters continue to damp down a wildfire burning in the Canterbury high country.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday should see fine, sunny weather for much of Aotearoa, except for some showers in the Deep South around Dunedin and Invercargill.</p>
        
            <p>Generally settled weather is forecast for the start of the weekend ☀However, a blustery severe weather system moves up the country on Sunday and a burst of very heavy rain is forecast for parts of Westland.Get more details at https://t.co/hnwmGxCYeR pic.twitter.com/vFKerUR8uG</p>
        
            <p>Come Sunday, however, a number of strong wind warnings are in place. People in affected areas are being warned to prepare by securing any items that could be picked up by strong winds. Driving could be challenging in exposed places, especially for those in high-sided vehicles and motorcycles.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said northwest winds may approach severe gale in exposed places on Sunday in Marlborough, on the Canterbury Plains, Banks Peninsula, Otago, Southland, Stewart Island and Fiordland, with a high chance these wind watches would be upgraded to warning status.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Island, Wairarapa from Masterton northwards and Hawke's Bay south of Hastings were also under a strong wind watch for Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Westland should expect heavy rain from the early hours of Sunday, peaking in the late morning, with 250-300mm expected about the ranges and 100-150mm around the coast.</p>
        
            <p>There are also heavy rain watches in place early on Sunday for the headwaters of the Otago lakes and rivers, Fiordland, the Grey and Buller districts, as well as the headwaters of the Canterbury lakes and rivers.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, State Highway 73 linking Canterbury and the West Coast has reopened to escorted convoys, with 10 helicopters, two planes and 86 firefighters involved in work to suppress the fire that tore through grass, scrub and wilding pines near Castle Hill village.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews are expected to take a week to stamp out the fire in steep terrain, with a team of three fire investigators examining the scene to try to find the cause.</p>
