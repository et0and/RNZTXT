            <p>Consultation has opened for proposals to correct and restore two Māori place names in Auckland, the New Zealand Geographic Board says.</p>
        
            <p>The board is proposing an area of Auckland CBD's waterfront be restored to its original name, Te Tōangaroa, and the spelling of Takanini be corrected to Takaanini.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei wanted Te Tōangaroa restored and assigned as an official place name, the board said in a press release.</p>
        
            <p>It would apply to the area bordered by Britomart Place, Beach Road, Quay Street and State Highway 16 - which includes Spark Arena as well as The Strand Railway Station, Te Taou Reserve, Mahuhu ki te Rangi Park and apartment buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Board secretary Wendy Shaw said Te Tōangaroa referred to the dragging of waka a long way to the shoreline.</p>
        
            <p>"The existing suburb names within the proposed Te Tōangaroa area are not being changed or replaced and there would be no changes to addresses or any need to update signage," the board said.</p>
        
            <p>With regard to Takanini becoming Takaanini, it would include the spelling on the suburb and its railway station.</p>
        
            <p>The board said this was endorsed by mana whenua, Te Ākitai Waiohua.</p>

            <p>"The suburb and railway station are named after rangatira (chief) Īhaka Wirihama Takaanini Te Tiki," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The spelling with the double aa correctly reflects that Takaanini is a compound word made up of taka and ānini, together meaning giddy or whirling."</p>
        
            <p>The board said signs at the railway station were changed to have the double a in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"If successful, maps and signs can be updated over time as they age and need replacing."</p>
        
            <p>The board said it wanted feedback from the wider community before any final decisions were made.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation for Te Tōangaroa closed on 11 July while people have until 10 September to comment on the correction of Takanini.</p>
