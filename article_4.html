A plan to transform healthcare through fewer specialist hospitals, more ambulances to link them and more community care is in limbo.

            <p>A plan to transform healthcare nationwide through fewer specialist hospitals, more ambulances to link them and more community care is in limbo.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora / Health NZ spent many months working on the plan but it is now caught up in a financial crisis.</p>
        
            <p>"Health NZ is still working through the details of how the organisation will deliver services under the recently announced reset," a spokesperson told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect to be able to provide more information on these matters in the coming months."</p>
        
            <p>The National Service and Campus Plan (NSCP) was the organisation's overarching attempt to follow the lead of the likes of the UK, Denmark and Netherlands.</p>
        
            <p>The aim: "transformational shifts" in how people get healthcare, in part to hold back on the demand for inpatient beds overwhelming the system.</p>
        
            <p>It "is the first stage in creating a deliberate plan for the future", to align services with geographic and demographic needs, said a briefing about the NSCP to the government in April, released under the Official Information Act.</p>
        
            <p>"The configuration of our health services and facilities needs to be nationally planned for all New Zealanders to have equity of access and outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>This meant complex care moving to fewer specialist hospitals, and less-complex care - "walk-ins" - of higher frequency moving to "less-complex settings".</p>
        
            <p>A downside was sicker people "may have to travel further", so road and air ambulances would have to be better.</p>
        
            <p>The NSCP also talked up having more partnerships with private providers, and investment in "hospital in the home".</p>
        
            <p>"Virtual healthcare will play [an] increasing part," said the briefing.</p>
        
            <p>This depended on a big uptake of telehealth, but that has not worked out so far either. Telehealth hit a high during Covid-19, used for primary health appointments about 20 percent of the time, but fell to just 8 percent last year, other reports showed.</p>
        
            <p>It also depended on much more costly digitisation within Health NZ and a new national health information platform called Hira. But that programme had $380m cut from it in Budget 2024, and was also in limbo.</p>
        
            <p>The digitisation work and the NSCP were both subordinate to a 10-year investment plan being worked on now, the heart of the "reset" that has followed the board being sacked and Commissioner Lester Levy being appointed.</p>

            <p>The NSCP emphasised "becoming one system". Levy and Health Minister Shane Reti have put new stress on a four-region focus.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Health NZX spokesperson told RNZ: "As with many functions, there will be a national lens on how we plan the future system of service delivery and the models of care in our community and hospitals."</p>
        
            <p>The old NSCP was meant to be delivered by the Hospital and Specialist Services Unit, but the national director of that has just been cut.</p>
        
            <p>The problem facing any plan is of tsunami proportions: In all regions, the number of over 80-year-olds - who needed 10 times more hospital stays than a 45year-old - would double by 2043, the briefing noted.</p>
        
            <p>And by 2043, almost 5000 new hospital beds would be needed if the model of care did not change.</p>
        
            <p>"An uplift of 4900 beds is unaffordable and does not account for the model of care charges we are expecting to make."</p>
        
            <p>The solution had been seen as more clusters of complex care and better networks of non-complex care, starting with Northland and Tai RƒÅwhiti/Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>It would be cheaper and faster to expand community networks, which would "reduce transfer to general and specialist hospitals" where capacity pressure was worst, the briefing said.</p>
        
            <p>The sacked board endorsed the NSCP in December. Reti asked to see it earlier in the year. How much of it remains under the reset, remained to be seen.</p>
