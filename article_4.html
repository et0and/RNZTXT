            <p>Five children have been arrested after using stolen cars to drive dangerously and crash into each other.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public called police around 11.30pm on Wednesday about the incident in Papakura's Battalion Drive.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Counties Manukau Inspector Matt Hoyes said two vehicles were seen "driving dangerously and seemingly crashing into each other".</p>
        
            <p>The call was responded to quickly, and also made it possible for police to determine that the vehicles being used were stolen.</p>
        
            <p>On arrival at the scene, Hoyes said officers spotted one of the vehicles involved.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff signalled for the driver to stop and while they did stop initially, the vehicle then took off at speed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police decided not to pursue, due to the manner of driving."</p>
        
            <p>The Police Eagle helicopter was used to keep an eye on the vehicle that had sped off. Officers were able to move ahead of the vehicle and it was spiked on Airfield Road in Takanini.</p>
        
            <p>"It has continued on for about another 300 metres before coming to a stop, and the five occupants fled on foot."</p>
        
            <p>All five were soon found by police and taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>The children, aged between 11 and 13, will all be referred to Youth Aid.</p>
        
            <p>Hoyes said: "This was excellent work from all staff involved, as they managed to bring what was a dangerous incident to a swift and safe conclusion".</p>
