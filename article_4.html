            <p>The hunt is on in Rotorua for a statue of a beloved stray dog which has been cut from its base and stolen.</p>
        
            <p>The dog named Harawene roamed an area beside Te Ngae Road which is part of State Highway 3.</p>
        
            <p>
Harawene was loved by locals and visitors to Rotorua.

            <p>Although she was timid and did not allow anyone to approach her, she was fed daily by locals, and when she died in 2008, a statue was put up in her memory.</p>
        
            <p>Fiona Cairns, who led the fundraising committee to build the statue, told Midday Report someone must have stolen the statue expecting to make a quick buck.</p>

            <p>"But sadly, they'll be disappointed."</p>
        
            <p>It was a hollow bronze statue, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The little bit that they would get for scrap metal is hardly worth all the anguish they seem to have caused a lot of locals, [who] are coming out of the woodwork at the moment as they did when she went missing," Cairns said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of very upset and angry people around.</p>
        
            <p>"We just can't believe that somebody would even take it like that."</p>
        
            <p>While fundraising, Cairns said there were responses from people from the UK, US, Canada and Ireland who had heard of Harawene from Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>She spoke of the pleasure that the statue gave everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"One woman, her little boy, waved to the statue every time he went past. She remembered the dog when it was alive, as I do. I've just had a lot of people coming forward in disbelief that this has happened," Cairns said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had not received any reports of the statue being stolen.</p>
