            <p>A high trust model in the firearms licensing process saw the man responsible for the Christchurch terror attack considered "fit and proper", an inquest has heard.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest into the attack where 51 worshippers at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre were murdered on 15 March 2019 has re-convened for its second phase.</p>
        
            <p>The terrorist's ability to obtain the guns he used in the attack is being examined.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the arms officer who approved the terrorist's firearms licence application gave evidence in the coroner's court.</p>
        
            <p>They said the entire firearms licensing process relied heavily on a "high trust" model, with the applicant and their referees trusted to tell the truth.</p>
        
            <p>It was also at a time where, in their opinion, police had accepted firearms ownership had moved from being a privilege to being a person's right.</p>
        
            <p>The arms officer said they had put a lot of weight on the two referees the terrorist provided in granting him his licence.</p>
        
            <p>This was because they were firearms licence holders themselves - with endorsements that allowed them to have pistols and military-style semi-automatics.</p>
        
            <p>The arms officer said the fact they had such endorsements meant they had been scrutinised heavily by police and considered fit and proper.</p>
        
            <p>In their opinion, this would have given them credibility and integrity.</p>
        
            <p>During the vetting process, the terrorist was asked by a vetter if he would have any concern for the safety of any person if he was to have a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard his response to this question was: "I don't have any enemies."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if this was an unusual answer, the arms officer said several different answers were given to that question and they did not consider it too unusual.</p>
        
            <p>The terrorist's application did not throw up any red flags, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was satisfied he was fit and proper."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, the arms officer said they had received no training or guidance on people having extremist views.</p>
        
            <p>But they told the court they would have flagged the application with a commissioning officer if there were any signs or mentions of racism or extremist views.</p>
        
            <p>However, they did not believe any applicant would ever have admitted to having such views even if they were asked.</p>
        
            <p>The arms officer earlier told the inquest they faced an often "insurmountable" volume of work and senior police figures did not appreciate the risk of the work of the role.</p>
        
            <p>They said they understood three people now undertook a scaled-back version of the role they held responsibility for in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>The arms officer said they had an incredibly heavy workload and there was a focus on turning around firearms licence applications within 30 days.</p>
        
            <p>They often ignored this, saying it felt "rushed".</p>
        
            <p>The second phase of the inquest is set down for three weeks, with about 15 witnesses expected to be called.</p>
