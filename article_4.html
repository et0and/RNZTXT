            <p>The Public Service Commission says Immigration New Zealand should have done more to minimise the risk of abuse to the work visa scheme.</p>
        
            <p>The Accredited Employer Work Visa scheme, which has been in place since July 2022, has faced criticism for not protecting workers adequately.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme was brought in after Covid-19 border closures led to worker shortage.</p>
        
            <p>In order to reduce visa processing times the number of checks required by immigration officers were reduced.</p>
        
            <p>There have been multiple reports of migrants being brought over by the scheme living in overcrowded housing and left jobless and immigration advocates have been calling for the scheme to be paused.</p>
        
            <p>The Commission has released the findings of an independent review of the scheme, led by Jenn Bestwick, which looked at whether Immigration New Zealand had mitigated the risk of migration exploitation appropriately.</p>
        
            <p>The review found while INZ's decision to reduce the checks was reasonable under the circumstances, it did not adequately assess the risk and impact of the changes to speed up processing times would have on visa abuse.</p>
        
            <p>When INZ staff did raise concerns about the risks, that INZ leadership "failed to pay adequate attention", the review found.</p>
        
            <p>The report said multiple staff members raised concerns with senior managers that migrants had paid large amounts of money to secure a job and visa, and were giving scripted responses to officials to conceal this fact.</p>
        
            <p>Some workers were not getting paid at all, and ineligible employers were being granted accreditation by officials, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Frontline INZ staff felt that responses from their bosses were dismissive and that issues raised were "swept under the carpet".</p>

            <p>Deputy Public Service Commissioner Heather Baggott said changes to the scheme did not work as intended and INZ should have done more to minimise risk of abuse of the work visa system.</p>
        
            <p>"Immigration New Zealand implemented, very quickly, a new model to accelerate immigration at a time the country desperately needed skilled workers."</p>
        
            <p>"While it was unscrupulous employers who exploited migrants coming into the country, Immigration New Zealand could have, and should have, done more to minimise the risk of that happening."</p>
        
            <p>She said Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment chief executive Carolyn Tremain had since made or was undertaking the necessary changes to the scheme to ensure it better protected migrant workers coming into the country,</p>
        
            <p>"I expect the chief executive will continue to make improvements in line with the recommendations identified in the report. And the chief executive has assured me this will happen."</p>
        
            <p>As at 14 August 2023, Immigration New Zealand had approved 80,576 Accredited Employer Work Visa applications, and there were 27,892 accredited employers.</p>
        
            <p>By 16 February 2024, MBIE had received 2107 complaints against accredited employers.</p>
        
            <p>One hundred and seventy-four employers are currently being investigated, 145 employers have had accreditation revoked, 53 have had accreditation suspended, and 48 employers are under assessment to have their accreditation revoked.</p>
        
            <p>Last year then-Immigration Minister Andrew Little said the scheme would be reviewed after he received an anonymous letter from an internal whistleblower.</p>
        
            <p>"The particular allegations were that some checks on employers were not being made, and some checks as part of the job check process were not being made," Little said.</p>

            <p>Migrant Workers Association spokesperson Anu Kaloti said the review would give immigration staff the confidence they could voice their concerns, without repercussions, in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Also, it mentions that there will be work done on an ongoing basis to make improvements so that that's a good sign that there's always room for improvement no matter how good systems are."</p>
        
            <p>But Kaloti told Midday Report that the "biggest let down" was that the review "never intended to deal with the policy side of things".</p>
        
            <p>"I hope that there will be another review which goes deeper and and wider and broader into the actual practice of tying our migrant workers to single employers, that's the root cause here."</p>
        
            <p>She said the department had "ignored" checks and balances, saying the number of migrant workers being exploited was on the rise.</p>
        
            <p>While some migrants were "scammed ... brought in to do a job but the job doesn't exist, or the company has folded", others were faced with being "overworked and underpaid, people being abused verbally, some cases of physical assault", Kaloti said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a very good introduction to New Zealand, so most of them do feel quite badly burnt.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of them are skilled and then they've worked as migrant workers in other countries. For example we have a whole batch of truck drivers who have come from the Middle East, from Dubai and other countries in the Middle East, and and when they compare their experience they feel very, very down and and depressed to be here."</p>
        
            <p>The fact that nearly 200 employers had to be investigated for wrongdoing, Kaloti said showed that the system was not robust to start with.</p>
