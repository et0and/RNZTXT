            <p>The new administrators of the Christchurch Show remain optimistic its slimmed down version of the show will be a success following a turbulent period for event leaders.</p>
        
            <p>This year's show began on Thursday after it was initially cancelled in April as most of the Canterbury A&P Association's board claimed it did not have the funds to run a show.</p>
        
            <p>A "scaled back" version of the show was confirmed after a $5 million deal was struck between the Christchurch City Council and the board.</p>
        
            <p>The show was then resurrected - though in a downscaled and different format - by events management company Event Hire with most of the board replaced.</p>
        
            <p>
Organisers are hoping between 50,000-60,000 people will attend the show over the coming days.

            <p>Former Speaker of the House and Cabinet Minister Sir David Carter has since taken the reins of the board.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ the response so far had been positive.</p>
        
            <p>Carter said he was hopeful of 50,000-60,000 over the next three days, but indicated that those numbers could be eclipsed.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be nice if we could," he said.</p>
        
            <p>An obstacle for Carter and co appeared to be the elements with rain and showers forecast over the next three days.</p>
        
            <p>"It has stopped raining (on Thursday)," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The people here at the moment seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"We just have to wait and see what is delivered."</p>

            <p>Even operating on a smaller scale, simply getting to the start line was an accomplishment in itself, Carter said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you consider I came on to the board 93 days ago, it's a remarkable turnaround that we've achieved with a very good, united general committee and board that has worked really well."</p>
        
            <p>Proceedings include the traditional livestock competitions, with about 600 sheep entered.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got beef cattle, we've got dairy cattle, we've got alpacas, so the animals are here," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The aim for organisers was to incorporate the "traditional elements" of the A&P show, including stall holders, food vendors, competitions and amusement rides.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the ingredients in getting a 2024 A&P Show off the ground was the personnel involved.</p>

            <p>Event management company Event Hire floated the idea of a scaled-back version of the show earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>The company's managing director, Phil Anderson, said they could not fathom the prospect of no A&P show.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean we're involved in so many events and it just made us go 'no show on Cup and Show week, that seems so odd'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of the vendors that worked with the company suggested to the company to get involved.</p>
        
            <p>"It seemed crazy but then we put a proposal together and here we are," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels awesome."</p>
        
            <p>
The show has beef cattle, dairy cattle and alpacas.

            <p>However, there was room for some innovation and fresh thinking.</p>
        
            <p>Drone racing and lawnmower racing events have been introduced this year.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the live entertainment and other elements haven't been seen before," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't wait to see the lawnmower racing."</p>
        
            <p>Although several schools had a teacher-only day on Thursday, some opted for a field day to the show.</p>
        
            <p>A group of school pupils RNZ spoke to said "food, animals, and more food" was the plan for the day.</p>
