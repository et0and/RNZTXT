A police statement said they had no work underway to change their "acceptable use of information and ICT" policy that includes an AI ban.

            <p>Police say they are not looking at altering the ban on the use of generative AI on their devices.</p>
        
            <p>They have contracts with US firm Axon, and Axon has begun offering US police departments AI software that writes up reports for officers on patrol, called Draft One.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not aware of any formal approaches made by Axon regarding Draft One," police told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>They had no work underway to change their "acceptable use of information and ICT" policy that includes the AI ban.</p>
        
            <p>"Any changes would first require rigorous assurances about the effectiveness, security, fairness and accountability of the product in question," a spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"While we cannot speak to decisions that may occur in the future, this is not a focus of our current work."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Police currently use Axon tasers, and store taser and some interview footage with the firm's evidence.com system in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The new tasers being rolled out do not have built-in cameras; many police forces account for this by pairing tasers with Axon body-worn cameras (bodycams), but New Zealand Police are still debating this.</p>
