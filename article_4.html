            <p>StarJam, a charity for children with disabilities, has closed, saying it cannot secure ongoing funding.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, the charity - which gave young people with disabilities free opportunities in music, dance and performance - raised $165,000 in an emergency appeal. But its financial problems continued and in October, it scaled back its services.</p>
        
            <p>StarJam's board of trustees announced on Wednesday night that it had had laid off its workers and immediately ceased all its workshops and programmes.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a heartbreaking decision, but it is the only responsible course of action given the financial instability," chief executive Gilli Sinclair said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are incredibly grateful for the support from our Jammers, staff, volunteers, and donors over the years."</p>
        
            <p>She said despite efforts to reduce costs and diversify revenue, the charity faced persistent financial challenges and was unable to secure the ongoing funding needed to continue.</p>
        
            <p>Rising operational expenses and limited funding options left it unable to sustain its work.</p>
        
            <p>"We cost about $130,000 a month for the 80 workshops across the country, so that was a long way to supporting us, but is unable to keep us with ongoing, sustainable support," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are devastated, we are devastated for our staff, but particularly for our jammers, who love StarJam.</p>
        
            <p>"For many of our jammers, it is their favourite opportunity every week, and we are devastated we have to do this to them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are so sorry it's ended this way. It's not a choice we would have willingly made, but I think the board has acted responsibly by looking at all options and making a very difficult decision."</p>
        
            <p>The liquidation process would begin once interim liquidators were appointed by the court, expected early next week, Sinclair said.</p>
        
            <p>Employee entitlements, as well as the claims of all other creditors, would be determined at that time.</p>
