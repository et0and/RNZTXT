            <p>An Otago man who killed Royalburn Station's head butcher in a head on crash has been sentenced to three years and eleven months in prison in the Invercargill High Court.</p>
        
            <p>Hayden Richard Hurst, 29, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he hit Outrega Anderson's car of State Highway 6 near Gibbston in December last year.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston says Hurst's blood alcohol level was more than double the legal limit and he had taken MDMA during a work Christmas party in Queenstown, and he was driving recklessly the morning after.</p>
        
            <p>Hurst was also disqualified from driving for four years after release and ordered to pay Anderson's family $10,000 in reparation.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson's family says it was a senseless act that left them with a true life sentence, with overwhelming and unbearable grief some days.</p>
        
            <p>They describe Anderson as a beautiful, kind and compassionate soul.</p>
