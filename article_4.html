            <p>Cases of Covid-19 are up on last week, as XEC emerges as a new variant of the virus.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 917 new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand over the week to Sunday, and five further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>There were 124 cases in hospital, although none are in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>The new Covid-19 variant XEC was first detected in Germany in August and appears to have a growth advantage over other circulating variants - but it is not a radically different variant.</p>
        
            <p>XEC is what is known as a "recombinant variant". Recombinants can occur naturally when a person is simultaneously infected with two different Covid variants.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Health NZ reported 886 new cases and six further deaths.</p>
