            <p>Health New Zealand / Te Whatu Ora said it was part of the plan for Covid-19 to be managed in a similar way to other communicable diseases from July.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ living well director Dr Martin Hefford said some funded services would remain available to help with the prevention and management of Covid-19 through the winter months.</p>
        
            <p>Vaccinations will still be free, as will antivirals for those who qualify.</p>
        
            <p>The government this month also extended the deadline of free Covid rapid antigen tests (RATs) until the end of September.</p>
        
            <p>"Vaccination against Covid-19 is our first line of defence against the virus," Hefford said.</p>
        
            <p>"We encourage people to ensure everyone in their whƒÅnau keeps up to date with their Covid-19 vaccine and all other available vaccinations."</p>
