            <p>One of the big opponents of a rejected bid to open a McDonalds in Wānaka says they hope community voices are not lost as the government targets an overhaul of consenting procedures.</p>
        
            <p>In a decision released on Wednesday, commissioners declined to grant developers for the fast food giant consent to build a restaurant along a highway passage into the Otago town.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Lakes District Council opened the proposal up for public submissions and of the 367 made, the majority were against it.</p>
        
            <p>The commissioners' concluded the proposal fell short of the "gateway assessment" that required adverse effects on the environment to be no more than minor.</p>
        
            <p>Other residents were concerned about litter, as well as the area's values about protecting the natural environment.</p>
        
            <p>In its submission, local group Wao Aotearoa Charitable Trust said the development along State Highway 84's Wānaka-Luggate Highway would negatively affect the town's "visual and aesthetic values".</p>
        
            <p>General manager Monique Kelly said McDonalds' intention to develop within a rural zone was unsuited.</p>
        
            <p>"When we are coming into town we are greeted by Mount Iron and that beautiful vista that surrounds us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our duty under the District Plan is to protect these landscapes from sporadic and sprawling urban development.</p>
        
            <p>"There's plenty of commercial and industrial land around Wānaka and I think there's options for McDonalds."</p>
        
            <p>McDonalds New Zealand has not ruled out an appeal of the commissioners' decision.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Simon Kenny said the franchise would speak with the developer and consider the next steps.</p>
        
            <p>"Our intention remains to open a restaurant in Wānaka, navigating some of the local commercial interests."</p>
        
            <p>Although the decision had some gratification for the local community, the matter had sparked some political ire, mostly outside Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>Some leaders felt McDonalds was a victim of needless bureaucracy.</p>
        
            <p>A few days before the decision, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop said on X that the McDonalds Wānaka bid was the "perfect example of everything wrong with the [Resource Management Act]".</p>
        
            <p>"Endless submissions including by taxpayer funded neo-puritans, various small stupid changes like reducing height of the logo.</p>
        
            <p>"Over a McDonalds."</p>
        
            <p>Parliamentary Under-Secretary for RMA Reform Simon Court said these decisions had a "massive chilling effect on development and economic activity".</p>
        
            <p>"We are in the process of replacing the Resource Management Act with a system that puts property rights first.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're peacefully developing your own land, selling something people want to buy, your activity shouldn't require the consent of every Tom, Dick, and Harry with an opinion."</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, ACT's environment spokesperson Cameron Luxton described the decision as "an economic own-goal for Wānaka".</p>
        
            <p>"A legitimate business has been blocked from investing, hiring locals and selling products to willing buyers."</p>
        
            <p>"It shows how our planning regime stifles development."</p>
        
            <p>Kelly said ensuring community voice was retained as part of any amendments to resource management laws was "essential".</p>
        
            <p>"Whatever iteration it becomes next, I hope we do take into account what communities around New Zealand want for their towns and cities.</p>
        
            <p>"And that we have it as an important component of any hearing or any submissions going forward."</p>
        
            <p>She said comments that the decision obstructed economic growth for the town held no weight, based on the crux of why the application was declined.</p>
        
            <p>"There are plenty areas that are zoned commercial so that argument falls over."</p>
        
            <p>The Resource Management (Consenting and Other System Changes) Amendment Bill had been slated to pass into law midway through this year.</p>
