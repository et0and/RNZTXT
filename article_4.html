            <p>My Kitchen Rules New Zealand contestant Michael Murray died on Monday, according to an extended family member.</p>
        
            <p>The family member, who did not want to be named, said they were informed Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>They said it was a sad time for Ng훮ti Rora of Ng훮ti Maniapoto, and all those who knew Murray.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a shock to all those who know him."</p>
        
            <p>They said Murray was an extremely talented and unique young man.</p>
        
            <p>Murray competed on the 2024 season of MKR with his cousin Piki Knap. On their official bio for the reality TV cooking show, the pair, raised in Te K큰iti, said they shared a love of cooking for visitors.</p>
        
            <p>Having spent years living in South America, Murray, 46, previously said his secret weapon was "being a mighty kitchen ninja".</p>
        
            <p>"I possess a magnetic energy - agility, precision and an unassuming personality."</p>
        
            <p>Murray, who has Ng훮ti Maniapoto heritage, spent much of the past 12 years in Mexico, Women's Day reported, where he worked on telenovela soap operas and did small stints on other shows.</p>
        
            <p>"I was Mr New Zealand back in 2005, and that's what took me overseas and eventually to Mexico. Obviously, I'm not Mexican, but they thought I was Latino. I did some great work there, then to come home and be a part of this whole journey with MKR is a blessing in disguise. I've always put my hand up to opportunity," he said at the time.</p>
