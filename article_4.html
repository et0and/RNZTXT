            <p>Contractors have cleared part of State Highway 6 in the Buller region after heavy rain and snow sparked the closure of dozens of highways across the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>A section of the highway between Murchison and O'Sullivan's Bridge had reopened by Sunday evening after a slip was cleared.</p>
        
            <p>"The road is open to two lanes, but under a 30km/h temporary speed limit," Waka Kotahi said.</p>

            <p>"Drivers must drive with care through the slip site.</p>
        
            <p>"The temporary speed limit will change to 50km/h on Tuesday at 7.30am, when work at the road's shoulder will be carried out at the site."</p>

            <p>State Highway 6 was still closed from the bridge to Inangahua due to another slip in the Buller Gorge, Waka Kotahi said.</p>
        
            <p>It would remain closed overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"People travelling between Nelson and Westport must avoid the area or delay their travel until this section of State Highway 6 reopens," Waka Kotahi said.</p>
        
            <p>All other roads affected by Saturday's bad weather had since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>The flooding and snow also stranded motorists. Two people had to be rescued in Marlborough after driving into flood waters near Spring Creek on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>A bus carrying 26 passengers also slid off the road on its way to Mt Cook Village on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>There were no injuries but the bus could not be towed and alternative transport was arranged for the passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the bus was driven onto a closed road in snowy conditions.</p>
        
            <p>The case had been referred to WorkSafe's commercial vehicle safety team.</p>
