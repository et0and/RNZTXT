Bay of Plenty residents have been experiencing virtual earthquakes and tsunamis this summer as a way for the Tauranga City Council to engage residents about the coastal risks the area faces. Video

Seeing, feeling and hearing a tsunami or earthquake unfold, in virtual reality, could help drive home the need for disaster preparedness, Tauranga City Council is hoping.

            <p>Bay of Plenty residents have been experiencing virtual earthquakes and tsunamis this summer as a way for the Tauranga City Council to engage residents about the coastal risks the area faces.</p>
        
            <p>Using a virtual reality headset, a user sees a computer generated version of the main Mount Maunganui beach coastline. They then experience a ten-minute simulation of a small earthquake, followed by a more serious earthquake, and make decisions about what actions they need to take in response.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga City Council community resilience advisor Isaac Orchard said people find the experience immersive and surprising.</p>

            <p>"The overwhelming response to using the simulation is 'oh my gosh, I didn't realise that an earthquake and tsunami could have that much of an effect here in Tauranga'."</p>
        
            <p>Council staff were following up the experience by encouraging residents to take actions to prepare for the real event.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first use of the technology in this way in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"In Japan, following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami there, they started using virtual reality far more often because they saw a greater uptake in emergency preparedness from people who use it," Orchard said.</p>

People are being encouraged to get a front row seat of what a tsunami or earthquake could look like, using virtual reality.

            <p>Orchard was reviewing the usefulness of the VR experience for disaster preparedness for a masters through Auckland University of Technology. He said young people seemed much more prepared for emergencies, and more willing to undergo the VR experience.</p>
        
            <p>"Adults have been hesitant to put it on, whereas children have been very willing to give it a go."</p>
        
            <p>The team got around this by using multiple headsets so family members could experience it together.</p>
        
            <p>Council Senior Emergency Management Advisor Liz Oliver and said there were maps to advise residents of where the risk zones are, based on a 1-in-2500 year tsunami event. However, the area could have tsunamis more frequently than that.</p>

            <p>She said the community seemed to understand the risks.</p>
        
            <p>"Anywhere in New Zealand, when you are on a coastline, there is that risk there."</p>
        
            <p>Evacuation maps were updated in October to show a single, blue evacuation zone for the areas a tsunami could reach.</p>
        
            <p>Tsunami safe locations were also included on the maps, and in the event of a tsunami people should walk, run or cycle to those safe locations or make their way out of the blue zone.</p>
