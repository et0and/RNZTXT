        <h2>Nine Dunedin homes red-stickered amid flooding</h2>
        <p>
The South Island continues to recover from a two-day series of record rain, but locals have also come together to help their neighbours.
</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin and the Clutha District remain under a state of emergency after the Otago region was pummelled by heavy rain Thursday and Friday, causing flooding and land slips.</p>
        
            <p>A red heavy rain alert for North Otago, Dunedin and coastal Clutha was lifted Friday night and there are now no warnings or watches in place in those regions.</p>

            <p>Nine homes have been red-stickered in Dunedin, it was announced Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Civil Defence and Emergency Management confirmed the red-sticker notices have been issued but the location of the houses could not be confirmed at present.</p>
        
            <p>A red sticker means the house is not safe to occupy.</p>
        
            <p>Rapid assessments of slip-affected properties were also underway in Dunedin, to check whether they were safe for residents to return to.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Council urged residents with flooded properties to contact their insurance advisor.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency staff also used helicopter footage today to assess the impacts on townships around coastal Otago.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank agencies, contractors and lifeline organisations who have all been working really hard to check on people and restore access to isolated communities and to help them get what they need," said Emergency Management Otago duty controller Jo Gilroy.</p>
        
            <p>"The good news is surface water in south Dunedin seems to be receding and SH1 at both north and south of Dunedin have reopened. All rivers including the Taieri and Clutha have peaked and flows are receding, although many remain high."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Toko Mouth and Glenledi were still without power after the storm damaged a power pole and brought down lines, but were expected to have it restored by 10pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>There were also water conservation and boil water notices in effect in parts of Clutha, Dunedin, Waitaki, and Central Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in Outram, Waikouaiti, Karitane and Hawksbury were being asked to conserve water as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Otago warned residents to ensure the water they were using and consuming was clean, as there were concerns following wastewater networks being overwhelmed in:</p>
        
            <p>A precautionary boil water notice had been put in place for West Harbour, from District Road, Roseneath to Lewis Street, Deborah Bay, after the main pipe was washed out in a slip at Maia.</p>
        
            <p>That included Roseneath, Sawyer's Bay, Port Chalmers, Carey's Bay and Deborah Bay.</p>
        
            <p>A new water supply was being used in the area and water quality testing was underway, Civil Defence controller Rob West said.</p>
        
            <p>"Based on early assessments, we are looking at replacing a length of water pipe approximately 500m long. The timeframe for a permanent solution will depend on further investigation, however we hope to have partial reconnection completed tomorrow. This would involve reconnecting to the St Leonard's reservoir.</p>

            <p>"We believe affected residents in the area have about two days' water remaining based on current usage so we remind West Harbour residents of the need to conserve water."</p>
        
            <p>Water trucks were at Roseneath, Sawyers Bay and Port Chalmers for anyone wanting fresh drinking water. There was also a water truck in Middlemarch. People must take their own containers.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin's residents were being warned of the risk of gastroenteritis due to floodwater and silt being contaminated with sewage.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence controller Scott MacLean said people needed to wash their hands, keep out of contaminated areas and dispose of flood-contaminated materials.</p>
        
            <p>"Floodwater and silt may contain sewage and other hazardous materials, and often carries bugs that can cause gastrointestinal (vomiting and diarrhoea), skin and eye infections," MacLean said.</p>

            <p>Community spirit is being felt in the Otago town of Milton, with one resident opening the doors of her community space to house evacuated residents.</p>
        
            <p>Tess Potae has lived in the area for 21 years and said she thought this week's deluge was not as bad as previous storms.</p>
        
            <p>She opened the property she owns around the corner from her home, to help flood-ravaged residents.</p>
        
            <p>"We call it a whare, and we had the facilities for the doors to be open for anyone that was stranded.</p>
        
            <p>"We probably housed 20-odd people."</p>

            <p>Potae said she was relieved the sky was now clearing.</p>
        
            <p>A Macandrew Bay resident said he was impressed by how prepared and responsive the council and emergency teams have been to the flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Footpaths on Portobello Road were still covered in a thick layer of mud.</p>
        
            <p>The local man, who did not wish to be named, told RNZ he was pleased by how quickly clean-up began.</p>

            <p>"I've been really impressed by the recovery, eh?</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like the council's been really prepared. You know, as soon as daybreak broke today there was people out and a big convoy of trucks all ready to go. It's been really impressive."</p>
        
            <p>Road access to the Dunedin settlement was still only open to residents.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 north and south of Dunedin had been reopened.</p>
        
            <p>But the Port Chalmers highway, State Highway 88, would remain closed over the weekend except for residents and emergency services.</p>

            <p>Dunedin City Council said the the welfare centre at Forsyth Barr stadium was likely to close on Saturday night when the last three families there had temporary accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence payments are available through the Ministry of Social Development for people impacted by flooding in Dunedin, Otago and coastal Clutha.</p>
        
            <p>The payments can help with emergency food, clothing and bedding. Emergency Management Otago said it can also covers costs if you've had to leave your home; a payment if you have evacuees staying with you in places such as a private home, marae or community centres.</p>
        
            <p>If you are a farmer or grower, or a worker or live on a farming business, Emergency Management Otago said support is available through your local Rural Support Trust. The number is 0800 787 254.</p>
        
            <p>Please contact your milk supplier if you have any concerns about milk collection, it added.</p>
