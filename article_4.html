            <p>Senior secondary school students may soon be delving into one of Shakespeare's plays, when a new curriculum is enforced in term 1 next year.</p>
        
            <p>If the Ministry of Education's draft curriculum, currently out for public consultation, goes ahead, studying Shakespeare would become compulsory in both years 12 and 13.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked recent high school graduates at the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology what they thought of making Shakespeare mandatory.</p>
        
            <p>Some students, like Leah Kampkes, welcomed Shakespeare becoming a required part of NCEA English.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was in high school, at least in the junior levels, I really enjoyed studying Shakespeare," she said. "We did a play a year and it was definitely my highlight."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pro! [compulsory Shakespeare]," Sofia Roger Williams said. "I think it's valuable for students to learn about and to be able to critique it from a modern perspective."</p>
        
            <p>Tajaney Purea thought Shakespeare would not excite some students, but that it was in their best interest.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everyone is into reading Shakespeare nowadays, but it's a good learning experience."</p>
        
            <p>English student Nicholas Lindstrom agreed learning Shakespeare would benefit students.</p>
        
            <p>"Shakespeare is important," she said. "It allows you to understand a lot of references and allusions in other English texts.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a good idea, it's just about how you execute it and make it engaging for young people."</p>
        
            <p>Another English student, Athena Li-Watts, added that high school might be the only time people were exposed to Shakespeare's works.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's good to get students into things they might not otherwise be interested in.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not huge into Shakespeare, but he's such a pillar in English literature and there is value in his work."</p>
        
            <p>However, not all students fully supported the move.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it might turn some students away from taking English as a subject," Keira Mathura said. "It [Shakespeare] has a reputation of being quite hard."</p>
        
            <p>Iris Wang took Shakespeare English in high school, but disagreed with making it compulsory.</p>
        
            <p>"There are other texts that could better capture more relevant social issues today. It's not for everyone and it shouldn't have to be."</p>
        
            <p>Some students, like Ben Jamison, had mixed feelings.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it [Shakespeare] has important themes, but you can get those from a lot of texts." he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good exposure for students to want to study theatre and drama, and the performing arts is losing cultural significance in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Levi Pruden said he didn't value Shakespeare over other literature he studied at school.</p>
        
            <p>"I did it [Shakespeare] in high school and I enjoyed it, but you can gain the same stuff from most texts. What a teacher can teach well is probably the most relevant.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably made me more verbose."</p>
        
            <p>Jemma McGregor said her English class studied Hamlet in Year 12.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a little boring, but he was one of the best writers of that time and we still use his work today."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education's draft curriculum is open for public consultation until 28 April 2025.</p>
