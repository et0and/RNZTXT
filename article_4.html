        <h2>Pilot put unsuitable propeller on his aircraft before fatal flight</h2>
        <p>
A coroner has found the 74-year-old pilot did not have maintenance approval for the overhaul of aircraft components.

            <p>A pilot in his seventies fitted a new propeller to his aircraft before taking it up for a test flight which ended in a fatal crash beside the runway.</p>
        
            <p>Nigel Anthony Frederikson, who was 74 at the time of his death, was also the chairperson of the Ōtaki Air Strip. He stored his small Sonex aeroplane in a hangar on-site.</p>
        
            <p>A report by Coroner Rachael Schmidt-McCleave found that on the morning of 17 August 2020, he left his house at 9am, telling his wife he was going flying.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV footage showed him installing the new propellor at the air strip, before taking the plane out of the hangar.</p>
        
            <p>About four hours later, shortly before 1pm, emergency services located his damaged plane at the air strip and found he had died of his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The propeller was not attached to the engine of the plane, and a search did not locate it.</p>
        
            <p>A separate investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) found that around 17 minutes after take-off, and while returning to the air strip, the propeller detached from the aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>Frederikson made a series of manoeuvres to lose height, but the aircraft went into a steep dive and struck the grass next to the runway.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic pathologist Dr Katherine White carried out a post-mortem, and found Frederikson's cause of death to be multiple injuries to the head, chest and skeleton.</p>
        
            <p>Frederikson's background was as an engineer, and he had retired from work as an advisor for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment about four years before his death.</p>
        
            <p>He held a private pilot's licence, having learned to fly in the 1990s and accumulating more than 20 years' experience. He built his aircraft himself in 2009.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner found he held a number of CAA-required certificates, approvals and ratings, including a valid New Zealand Certificate of Maintenance Approval for the purpose of maintaining his own aircraft.</p>
        
            <p>But the maintenance approval was not valid for the overhaul of components.</p>
        
            <p>Engine manufacturer Jabiru told the coroner the propeller Frederikson fitted on the morning of the accident was not approved for use with that engine.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner urged pilots to "re-familiarise themselves" with CAA material on design changes and airworthiness.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is any doubt as to whether a change constitutes a modification, I encourage operators to consult with the CAA before making the change and attempting a flight."</p>
