            <p>A new video of the New Zealand pilot held hostage in the Indonesian region of Papua is circulating on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Susi Air pilot Phillip Mehrtens was taken hostage by the West Papua Liberation Army fighters in February 2023 shortly after landing on a remote airstrip.</p>
        
            <p>The video shows Mehrtens surrounded by armed men and comes with a claim that he has been given two months to live before he will be shot dead.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has been unable to verify the footage or when it was filmed.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was aware of the video, it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Efforts were ongoing to secure Mehrtens' safe release, it said, including working closely with Indonesian authorities and deploying New Zealand consular staff to do so.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot's safety and wellbeing remained the top priority, and his family in Aotearoa and Indonesia were being supported, MFAT said.</p>
