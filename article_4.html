            <p>A person has died in a water-related incident at Narrow Neck Beach on Auckland's North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>Police and ambulance were called to the beach near Devonport around 5.50pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said the person appears to have suffered a medical event in the water.</p>
        
            <p>They said the person had either gotten out or been taken out of the water and received medical attention on the shore, but did not survive.</p>
        
            <p>The death will likely be referred to the Coroner who would ultimately rule on cause of death.</p>
