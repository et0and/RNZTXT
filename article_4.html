            <p>A Hamilton woman says she still has not been connected with a Hato Hone - St John Caring Caller months after asking for support.</p>
        
            <p>The volunteer-run service provides free calls to people experiencing loneliness.</p>
        
            <p>Anne-Marie told RNZ that after filling out the form to request a caller late last year, she did not hear back.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like I've been punched in the stomach.</p>
        
            <p>"You reach out for help from someone and hear absolutely nothing, not even an acknowledgement of receipt or a referral."</p>
        
            <p>Anne-Marie said she recently called the Hato Hone St John service and was told by staff they were working through a backlog of about 20 people still waiting.</p>
        
            <p>St John National Community Care Manager, Melanie Young, did not address a backlog of waiting callers but in a statement acknowledged that they were diligently handling enquiries following an unusually high demand from clients seeking to connect with volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate the patience and understanding of those who have recently enquired about our Caring Caller service.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the Christmas break and subsequent public holidays, our team is currently experiencing a higher volume of enquiries than usual."</p>
        
            <p>Young said everyone who contacted them would be connected with a team member as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>She said outside of public holiday periods they aimed to respond to requests within two weeks.</p>
        
            <p>St John recently called for more volunteers to help run the service, which currently numbers 600 trained callers.</p>
        
            <p>The service has been running for more than 25 years and makes regular phone calls to people who are feeling lonely or socially isolated, offering companionship and support.</p>
