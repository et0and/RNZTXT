            <p>The Defence Force is looking at how much work is required to bring one of its offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) to operational capacity after the sinking of its specialist dive ship HMNZS Manawanui.</p>
        
            <p>The Navy has two OPVs: HMNZS Otago and HMNZS Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The ships are designed for maritime surveillance, supply and support and patrol missions around New Zealand's coastline, the Southern Ocean and into the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>A Defence Force spokesperson said the Defence Force and its industry partners were currently assessing the amount of work required to get either of those ships to an "operational level of capability".</p>
        
            <p>That assessment work would be complete by the end of October.</p>
        
            <p>The Manawanui, which sank off Samoa after hitting a reef on 5 October, was one of just nine ships in the Navy's fleet.</p>
