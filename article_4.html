            <p>Over 85 percent of Muslims living in Aotearoa believe Islamophobia exists in this country, and more than half have experienced discrimination, according to the first baseline study of Muslims in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The study was conducted in 2023 by researchers from Massey University and funded by the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand and the New Zealand Islamic Think Tank.</p>
        
            <p>It followed several discussions between government and Muslim organisations following the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks.</p>
        
            <p>The study sought to understand discrimination, including experiences of exclusion, Islamophobia, feelings of heightened vigilance, reporting to the authorities and feelings of safety and wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>It was lead by Dr Fatima Junaid from the school of management, alongside Dr Shemana Cassim from the school of psychology and community researcher Jennifer Khan-Janif MNZM.</p>
        
            <p>The majority of the respondents were highly educated and all spoke English.</p>
        
            <p>"More than 50 percent of respondents felt that others treated them as if they were not smart, were afraid of them, or acted as if they are better than them. Sadly, 58 percent of respondents also felt that their children have been discriminated against at school," Junaid said.</p>
        
            <p>"The most common coping mechanisms for dealing with these difficult circumstances were praying harder, working harder and finding support within their own communities. Reporting to the authorities and attending counselling were the least popular ways of coping amongst respondents."</p>
        
            <p>Eighty-seven percent believed Islamophobia existed in New Zealand, 56 percent said they had personally experienced it, while over 60 percent believed women were at risk in relation to Islamophobia.</p>
        
            <p>"The experiences of Islamophobia were at school, university, within the streets, in public spaces or while dealing with authorities. The most targeted people were those who wore religious clothing such as thobe or hijab," Junaid said.</p>
        
            <p>Half of the survey respondents felt that Islamophobia negatively affected their mental wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>While more than 40 percent of respondents felt they were not treated fairly in the workplace, whether that was a less qualified colleague was promoted ahead of them, or that others assumed they were in a job of lower status.</p>
        
            <p>The research also asked respondents how they believed Islamophobia could be overcome.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of respondents took the onus of getting involved and actively doing something to deal with Islamophobia upon themselves," Junaid said.</p>
        
            <p>Suggestions included engaging with other communities, embracing their own identity and promoting awareness in the school curriculum, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The study was based on an online survey of more than 300 people and a focus group in Auckland of 18 people.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the study's respondents (20.2 percent) were in the 36-40 age group, and from the North Island (70 percent).</p>
