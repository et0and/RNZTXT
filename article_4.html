            <p>There's a huge variety of events happening throughout country to commemorate Te Rā o Waitangi on the 185th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty.</p>
        
            <p>Those seeking an alternative to the official events at Ti Tii marae could join Prime Minister Christopher Luxon at Ōnuku Marae - the first place in the Ngāi Tahu takiwā where Te Tiriti o Waitangi was signed, and, more than 150 years later, the site of the Crown's formal apology to Ngāi Tahu for breaches of Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>This year, manuhiri are asked to be at the marae gates at 8.45am for a powhiri that will begin at 9am.</p>
        
            <p>As well as the prime minister, speeches will be delivered by Governor General Dame Cindy Kiro, and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Kaiwhakahaere Justin Tipa.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the day's commemorations, Ōnuku, Ngāti Irakehu and Ngāi Tahu whānau will provide a hākari (feast), entertainment, market stalls, and activities for tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>For those who can't make the trip to Akaroa, a livestream will be available on the Ngāi Tahu website.</p>
        
            <p>In the nation's capital, the Poneke Tiriti Action Group is holding a kotahitanga and solidarity march from Pukeahu National War Memorial Park at 10am, which will arrive at Waitangi Park in time for the mihi whakatau at the city's annual waterfront event.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tori Whanau will be opening the free event at noon, welcoming the marchers as they arrive.</p>
        
            <p>There will be live music, kai, workshops and activities celebrating Māori culture and Te Tiriti.</p>
        
            <p>Another hikoi protesting the Treaty Principles Bill and government policy will leave Otautahi's Victoria Square at 11am and walk to New Brighton, where there will be speeches and live music.</p>
        
            <p>This year's hīkoi is "a call to action for all who stand for justice, equity, and the protection of Māori rights," say organisers Tai ki Maunga, Maunga ki Tai.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua's official Waitangi Day event, "Mō te aroha o te iwi - For the Love of the People," is hosted by Te Paratehoata Marae (Tūnohopū) at Wai Ariki Spa, starting at 10am.</p>
        
            <p>The event, which aims to build unity and honour the Treaty, includes musical performances, sports and games, waka rides and lessons, art showcases, and walking tours of the Rotorua museum garden.</p>
        
            <p>Given the official commemoration will be taking place at nearby Onuku, there will not be a formal powhiri at Okains Bay this year, Okains Bay Museum board chair Helen Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the much loved annual Okains Bay event - the longest running in the country outside of Waitangi itself - will host live music, free entry to the museum, special displays and exhibitions, games and activities, guided tours and a magic show from 9am to 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said there has been heightened interest in some of the history the museum holds, as the current political focus sees more Pākehā seeking to learn more about the history of Aotearoa, but she said that's nothing new for the museum.</p>
        
            <p>"That's always been a bit of a theme for this place. It's foundational history involved a vision before museums, or organisations generally, were thinking in that way. It's always had Pākehā, Tangata Te Tiriti thinking, involvement and engagement."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, further south, Ngāi Tahu - joined by Queenstown mayor Glyn Lewers - will lead an event at the Tāhuna Queenstown Recreation Grounds commemorating the Treaty's legacy.</p>
        
            <p>The day will open with a pōwhiri at 9.45am, followed by kapa haka, performances and kai, before a panel discussion between Hana O'Reagan, professor Janine Hayward, and Edward Ellison of Ōtākou Rūnaka.</p>
