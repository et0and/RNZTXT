        <h2>'Just like the marae, like being at home' - new space for Auckland's homeless</h2>
        <p>
The space is a collaboration between Māori wardens, Auckland Council and Eke Panuku.
</p>
        
            <p>An unassuming storage shed in downtown Auckland has been transformed into a place for the city's homeless to shower, wash clothes, store belongings and have some kai.</p>
        
            <p>It's a collaboration between Māori wardens, Auckland Council and council-controlled organisation Eke Panuku Development Auckland, with the aim of connecting people living on the street to services that can help them.</p>

            <p>Māori warden Matarora Smith, one of the volunteers at the homeless wellbeing space, said those popping in were treated like whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"We spoil them a little, we cook them a meal. It's nothing fancy, yesterday I had sausages and I was going to fry them ... and one of the girls said 'oh we really love the boil up'."</p>
        
            <p>Word got 'round about the boil up and a dozen people turned up for lunch that day.</p>
        
            <p>The new space, Manaaki Tangata, was a trial to provide somewhere for those living on the street to pop in, have a shower, do their washing and be fed.</p>
        
            <p>It is funded through council's existing budget for the wardens and is open every day from 10am-5pm.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about just giving our vulnerable people a space to come to, where they probably can remember when they were young, that they could have a space and feel safe," Smith said.</p>

            <p>Everyone has their own toothbrush in a brown paper bag if they come back and there are toiletries in the bathroom, she said it was personal items like these that made people feel welcome.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been some great feedback we've had the ladies talk about how safe they feel, just this morning the comment was made 'ma we love coming here, we feel so safe we can just be ourselves and do our own thing'."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said women in particular need somewhere safe to just be.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they fly under the radar and they've got little safe spaces somewhere else but as word goes around the trust will come back on us, that's what's happening being non-judgemental down here."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's homelessness lead Ron Suyker said the number of people living on the street in the city centre this year is similar to last year but more people in the wider region are struggling to put a roof over their heads.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always going to be a need for wellbeing when you've got somebody who has nothing. And it's not just those who are in downtown. Homelessness is largely transient so there's a lot of people coming into Auckland central who don't know where to go."</p>

            <p>About a dozen people come to the drop in space each day.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if it gives one person the opportunity to have a shower, clean clothes, a feed, store their goods then it's a good thing but actually what we're seeing is the need is far greater," Suyker said.</p>
        
            <p>"How do you numerically put a success factor on wellbeing for people?"</p>
        
            <p>Manaaki Tangata worked alongside other services, including the Auckland City Mission and the free mobile laundry and shower charity Orange Sky, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Demand for Orange Sky's Auckland service had quadrupled this year, compared to 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"The hope is we don't need it, the reality is we do. When you've got somebody who has nothing being able to give them a space of acceptance in a non judgemental caring environment, that's what it's here for."</p>
        
            <p>Suyker said it took a decade to find a suitable spot for the wellbeing pop-in and this one is temporary because it'll be redeveloped in the next year or so.</p>
        
            <p>"If it proves to be successful we'd love to have it ongoing...we're hoping that we find the next space and that it can be permanent."</p>
        
            <p>He said it's success is thanks to the Māori wardens, who are "walking angels".</p>
        
            <p>"They just exude such an aroha to those who are coming through and it is very much a safe space due in large to how they approach it."</p>
        
            <p>Smith has been a Māori warden since 2009, first in Manukau then the city centre and said it had always been a part of her family's ethos to help - she spent time volunteering in Sydney's Kings Cross.</p>
        
            <p>She said the city's homeless women needed more spaces like this.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping with Ron's help we get a few more of these around the place to strengthen our women. I know there's a lot of places but there's some gaps where our women fall through."</p>
        
            <p>One man who popped in for something to eat didn't wish to appear on camera, he said it is "just like the marae, like being at home."</p>
