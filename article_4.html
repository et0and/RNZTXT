        <h2>Sea Lion Trust offers $5k reward over baby's shooting</h2>
        <p>
The reward comes after a baby sea lion was shot in an estuary in the Catlins then left to die a slow, painful death.

            <p>A conservation group has offered a $5000 reward for information about the shooting of a sea lion in Otago.</p>
        
            <p>The reward comes after a baby sea lion was shot in an estuary in the Catlins then left to die a slow, painful death.</p>
        
            <p>Posting on social media, the Sea Lion Trust said they needed to send a message that such acts were not acceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only has an endemic species been deliberately killed with a shotgun, but it has been done in such a way that it will have suffered a slow and painful death.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that we learn to share our spaces with other species and remember the beaches, the ocean, the fish, are not ours, but belong to all."</p>
        
            <p>Sea lions were "charismatic and curious" animals, which sometimes approached people - making them vulnerable to harm, the trust said.</p>
        
            <p>"The loss of this young female sea lion is another blow to a small, establishing population that has already experienced low pup survival over the last couple of years."</p>
        
            <p>The same pup attracted attention earlier this year when she was born about 60km up the Clutha River, near Tuapeka.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information should contact the New Zealand Sea Lion Trust at info@sealiontrust.org.nz or your local police, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"All information will be passed on to the appropriate authorities and anonymity will be respected. This reward does not offer immunity from prosecution, and will be paid out after a conviction."</p>
