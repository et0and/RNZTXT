            <p>A Matamata College student who died after being struck by a freight train has been named as Sarie Morton.</p>
        
            <p>The Year 9 student died on Wednesday afternoon when she suffered critical injuries during the incident on Firth St outside the college.</p>
        
            <p>Morton's mother Katrina Bagley confirmed her daughter's death on Facebook this morning saying words cannot describe her sadness at having to announce the news.</p>
        
            <p>"Friends and family and for all of you who know Sarie, it's with sadness that words cannot describe that we're letting you know that Sarie was taken from us suddenly in an incident yesterday after school," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"We are still processing this. I am overwhelmed by the love and support by everyone and offers of help. Please just come."</p>
        
            <p>Matamata College principal Dr Angela Sharples also released a statement confirming the tragedy, describing Morton as "one of our beloved students".</p>
        
            <p>"Our heartfelt condolences go out to Sarie's family and friends during this incredibly difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>The school remained open today, with a blessing at the site held this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Professional support is being offered for anyone who needs, Dr Sharples said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we navigate this sudden loss, we are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love and support from our community. Your kindness and compassion are greatly appreciated by Sarie's family, friends, and all of us here at Matamata College.</p>
        
            <p>"Further details will be provided by the family and communicated with you. In the meantime, we are focused on wrapping our love and care around the family."</p>
        
            <p>Morton's death is being investigated by police. A WorkSafe spokesperson said it was not yet investigating and only making initial inquiries.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail executive general manager of operations Paul Ashton said they were looking into the circumstances of the incident and it would be premature to comment in detail at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Yesterday's collision between a freight train and a pedestrian in Matamata was a tragedy, and KiwiRail's thoughts are with the victim's family, friends and her community.</p>
        
            <p>"We are providing support for our driver, who is now on leave."</p>
        
            <p>Ashton thanked first responders and others who provided assistance at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"The rail corridor is an unforgiving environment where the consequences of an accident can be devastating. KiwiRail urges the public to cross the tracks only at dedicated pedestrian and level crossings."</p>
        
            <p>The train line runs parallel to Matamata College. In 2012 another Matamata College student died after being hit by a train outside the school. Zakariah Paul Lang, 15, had been walking with two friends near the tracks about 3pm when he was hit after stepping out of a tree line and into the path of the train.</p>
        
            <p>The train line runs through the township of 10,000 with houses on both sides and next to a state highway.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Adrienne Wilcock said she would wait until investigations were complete before the council could consider whether safety improvements were needed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked NZTA whether there were renewed concerns over safety and whether the section of railway line outside the school between College and Tainui streets should be fenced off, or an overhead bridge installed for students.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA) rail safety regulation national manager Gini Welch said NZTA was notified of yesterday's fatal collision, and its thoughts were with everyone affected by the tragic event.</p>
        
            <p>"KiwiRail is investigating the event, police will also investigate on behalf of the Coroner, and the Transport Accident Investigation Committee (TAIC) has been notified," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"NZTA is also making preliminary enquiries in our capacity as rail safety regulator."</p>
        
            <p>There was a level crossing that pedestrians could use at the intersection with Tainui St, near the college. In total the town had two level crossings.</p>
