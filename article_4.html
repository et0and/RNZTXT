            <p>An Auckland councillor and friend of Fa'anānā Efeso Collins is urging people not fall for fake livestream links to his funeral on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as people gather to pay their respects to the 49-year-old MP who collapsed and died taking part in a charity event in Auckland last week.</p>
        
            <p>Josephine Bartley told First Up on Tuesday she had spoken to a church minister in Auckland who had lost money in the scam.</p>
        
            <p>She was worried others were falling for it.</p>
        
            <p>"I spent a lot of yesterday looking up who had accepted the Facebook friend request; some of these people are in high positions in the community and they had fallen for it.</p>
        
            <p>"I would then message them to say they were being scammed."</p>
        
            <p>Her warning comes after Tipene Funerals, which is organising the funeral for Fa'anānā, has warned of fake Facebook pages.</p>
        
            <p>One page has more than 100 friends and advertises a hoax livestream link to his funeral using pictures of Fa'anānā and his family.</p>

            <p>Tipene Funerals spokesperson Taito Eddie Tuvalii said while it welcomed community Facebook pages set up to express grief, any with false livestream links or impersonating Fa'nanānā should not be trusted.</p>
        
            <p>"None of those pages are linked to us ... We have no knowledge of them and have no idea whose those people might be."</p>
        
            <p>Bartley said she was receiving friend requests on Facebook which offer links to the livestream of a funeral.</p>

            <p>Once accepted, the scammer requests money - sometimes as little as $1 - and says it will take bank details. Once the bank account details are given, people are at risk of finding money cleaned out of their account.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really not good.</p>
        
            <p>"One guy this happened to was a church minister who wanted to watch the funeral, He sent bank details as requested and fund money had been taken from his account.</p>
        
            <p>"There are so many of these popping up. They look official - they are headed up with details of livestreams and photos of the Tipene Funerals chapel.</p>
        
            <p>"But many are scams."</p>
        
            <p>Bartley was urging people to report any suspicious activity to Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>Tipene Funerals would provide livestream details on its Facebook page closer to the memorial on Thursday.</p>
