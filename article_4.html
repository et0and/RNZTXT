            <p>The Waipoua River fire has shrunken down to 91 hectares and now has a perimeter of 5.8 kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>Crews have ramped up to 96 firefighters, along with three aircraft and heavy machinery working to keep the blaze contained.</p>
        
            <p>Incident Controller Phil Larcombe said crews hoped to shrink it down even more on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hoping to further strengthen the fire containment lines and push back in on the fire area over the course of today."</p>
        
            <p>He said the weather should not cause any problems to their efforts.</p>
        
            <p>"The conditions today are favourable with light easterly winds, and the fire is being driven by fuel and the topography of the area. It is very dry here, and no rain is expected."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile he said the 20 homes that evacuated on Wednesday still had to stay away.</p>
        
            <p>"Whānau evacuated from their homes are not yet able to return but we are working hard to get them back as soon as it is safe."</p>
        
            <p>He warned others that a vegetation blaze could travel fast.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire at Waipoua River is a good example of how quickly a fire can get out of control, and the impacts it can have on the land and on people."</p>
        
            <p>Parts of Te Tai Tokerau are now under a complete fire ban including the top of the Far North, around Hokianga, and the Ripiro and Paparoa districts.</p>
