            <p>Police are calling for sightings of Elizabeth Wielga, who was last seen in the Tongariro area, while visiting from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Wielga, 67, did not show up for her flight home on 30 August, a police spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>They were alerted by Wielga's family when she did not return home when expected: "her family is concerned for her welfare".</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the missing woman checked out of accommodation in Tongariro earlier that day.</p>
        
            <p>"While our enquiries are in their early stages, at this point Police have not been able to establish Ms Weilga's movements after she left her accommodation," the police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Police want to hear from anyone who had seen her, or had any information to help them find her: "we urge you to get in touch", they said.</p>
        
            <p>Information can be supplied by calling 105 and quoting file number 200905/7641.</p>
