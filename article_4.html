            <p>Auckland Airport expects this weekend to be the busiest period over the next two weeks of the school holidays.</p>
        
            <p>Airport spokesperson Scott Tasker said although flights are nearly 15 percent down on pre-pandemic figures, the flights that are running during the holidays are likely to be full.</p>
        
            <p>From Friday to Sunday, the equivalent of the population of Tauranga will arrive or depart on domestic or international flights, he said.</p>
        
            <p>And anyone dropping off or picking up passengers should be aware of changes to the area, as a new Transport Hub is built, he warned.</p>
