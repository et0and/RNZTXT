            <p>A person has been taken to Christchurch Hospital in serious condition after a fire in a 'tiny home' near Dunsandel on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says crews from Dunsandel and Hororata were called to a fire in a house about the size of a shipping container on Karanga Road just ahead of 7am.</p>
        
            <p>They say additional water tankers were needed to extinguish the blaze, which was brought under control shortly before 8am.</p>
