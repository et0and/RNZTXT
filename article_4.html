            <p>The grass fire in Pound Road, in the suburb of Yaldhurst, was reported to Fire and Emergency about 1.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the fire was about 20 metres by 10 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters from four brigades have brought it under control.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is the latest in a series in the Canterbury area which has been experiencing hot dry windy conditions.</p>
