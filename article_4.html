        <h2>Call for wider access to meningococcal vaccines</h2>
        <p>
Meningitis can kill in 24 hours, and "it's essential we have a vaccination programme, free to everyone, because treatment often comes too late", bereaved dad says.

There are two vaccinations against meningococcal disease - one that protects against A, C, W and Y bacteria and one that protects against B bacteria.

            <p>Meningitis prevention advocates are urging the government to make vaccinations against the disease free for all students under 25, as New Zealand marks World Meningitis Day.</p>
        
            <p>There are different types of meningococcal bacteria, including A, B, C, W, and Y.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, most meningococcal disease is caused by group B bacteria.</p>
        
            <p>As well as septiciaemia (blood poisoning), it can also lead to meningitis, a life-threatening infection of the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord.</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms to look out for are a stiff neck, fever, headache, eyes being more sensitive to light, and confusion.</p>
        
            <p>The MenB vaccine is free for all pēpi, tamariki under five and rangatahi aged 13 to 25 years in their first year of certain close-living situations, such as boarding schools and university halls of residence.</p>
        
            <p>Those rangatahi are also eligible for the MenACWY vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>But Meningitis Foundation Aotearoa New Zealand chair Gerard Rushton said that that criteria was too narrow.</p>
        
            <p>"We're calling on the government to widen that criteria, so every [student] can have access to those vaccines."</p>

            <p>Rushton said Māori and Pasifika made up between 50 and 70 percent of cases, but the current policy discriminated against young people in those groups.</p>
        
            <p>"Take the secondary schools in South Auckland and Northland ... none of those children actually qualify for a free vaccination, and we're questioning why that is. We know this vaccine works, it will save lives, and protect our youth."</p>
        
            <p>He and his wife Claire lost their 16-year-old daughter Courtenay in 2014, after she contracted meningitis.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a "horrendous" disease.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality of meningitis is that it can kill in 24 hours, and that is why it's essential we have a vaccination programme, free to everyone, because treatment often comes too late."</p>
        
            <p>It was important to get vaccinated against the different strains, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's two sets of vaccinations, you need to make you're protected against [strains] A,C,W and Y and also Meningitis B. The MenB vaccination requires two shots, eight weeks apart."</p>
        
            <p>He said too often, there was a lack of awareness. In one case, 18 months ago, a first-year student in a hall of residence at Canterbury University contracted meningitis.</p>
        
            <p>"She had got MenACWY from her doctor but she wasn't offered the MenB vaccination and she ended up getting Meningitis B."</p>
        
            <p>The woman survived, he said, but "the underlying issue in all cases is a lack of awareness".</p>
        
            <p>The cost of a meningitis vaccination programme was "easily funded" by the savings made for the long-term care of survivors, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Forty percent of those who get it have a life-long disability. The average cost of a life-long disability is between $4-6 million. If you save two people a year from having a disability you'll pay for a vaccination programme for the whole of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday night, nearly 20 national landmarks from Invercargill to Whangārei will turn purple, in honour of World Meningitis Day.</p>
        
            <p>The Foundation has also launched Te Pukapuka Kauruku Kiriuhi Uakakā, The Meningitis Foundation Colouring Book - which has also been translated into te reo Māori - to educate parents and increase vaccination rates of children up to six years of age.</p>
