        <h2>Man at illegal campsite in national park inadvertently provides police with ID picture</h2>
        <p>
Authorities would still be in the dark about who is behind the illegal camping and clearing of native trees in Egmont National Park if not for the man inadvertently filming himself.

            <p>Authorities would still be in the dark about who is behind the illegal camping and clearing of native trees in Egmont National Park if not for the man inadvertently filming himself.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Ranger Cameron Hunt said stumbling upon the CCTV camera, which was not set up by authorities, was a stroke of good fortune.</p>
        
            <p>"When we were doing our scene examination of the campsite with the police we actually found the CCTV camera hidden in a tree.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really well disguised with leaves and moss all around it. So, we actually believe the CCTV camera belongs to that individual we want to locate," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Without that CCTV camera we'd have no idea who we are looking for, but definitely our suspect has filmed himself quite nicely and it's probably worth mentioning he's the only person detected on that camera.</p>
        
            <p>"So, that's why we're pretty confident it's one individual."</p>
        
            <p>Hunt said since going public with the CCTV footage there had been a big response from the public.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a number of people call in offering information on the identity of that person, so we'll be working this week coming with police to try and firm up some of that information and hopefully locate our person of interest."</p>
        
            <p>He said the man had built an elaborate campsite.</p>
        
            <p>"We got some information from the public in July about a possibly illegal camp in the park and it did take us a while to find it. It was a bit off the beaten track so to speak.</p>
        
            <p>"And when we got up there the person had built like a plywood floor over punga logs and then erected a dome tent over that. They'd taken in car batteries and there was a little portable fridge and gas cooker and a bed all set up, so it was a reasonably established campsite."</p>

            <p>He also had 200 litre plastic water tanks, and 44-gallon steel drum.</p>
        
            <p>It was still a mystery what the man was doing in the national park.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not really sure why or what the purpose of the campsite is at this stage, so that's why we really want to track this guy down and find out what's been going on."</p>
        
            <p>There were no signs of cannabis plantations or anything of that nature.</p>
        
            <p>But there was a significant amount of damage to native bush, with an area of 10m by 10m on the northwest side of the park near Pukeiti cleared out.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to take quite a few years for that bush to regenerate there's some reasonably substantial trees that have been cut down."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who can identify the man in the picture is urged to contact Cameron Hunt on 027 246 1083 or by emailing chunt@doc.govt.nz.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Conservation Act, it is illegal to fell or remove trees, shrubs or plants on or from public conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>It can result in a fine of up $100,000 and two years in jail. If the offending continues, further fines of $10,000 a day can be imposed.</p>
