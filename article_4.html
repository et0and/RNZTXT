            <p>Police are asking for public help to locate two reptiles stolen from an animal sanctuary in Warkworth.</p>
        
            <p>A 17-year-old male leopard tortoise and an 8-year-old female green iguana were stolen from Ti Point Reptile Park last week.</p>
        
            <p>Warkworth Police Station Officer in Charge Sergeant Dan McDermott said the incident was believed to have occurred sometime between 19 and 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>"Our teams have attended the address and our investigation remains ongoing to locate those believed to be involved.</p>
        
            <p>"However, police are now appealing to the public for their help as concerns grow for the welfare of the animals taken."</p>
        
            <p>McDermott said those who took the animals may attempt to sell them illegally.</p>

            <p>"We are concerned that these animals aren't getting the appropriate care and there may be attempts to sell them on the black market.</p>
        
            <p>"The best thing anyone involved can do is return the animals immediately to the Reptile Park."</p>
        
            <p>He said with information was asked to contact Police via 105, and reference file number 240320/8108.</p>
        
            <p>The leopard tortoise is the fourth largest tortoise in the world and it could reach a maximum weight of up to 40kg, but generally weighs between 10kg and 15kg.</p>
        
            <p>The green iguana is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay, with an adult female typically weighing 1.2 to 3kg.</p>
        
            <p>Ti Point Repitle Park Manager Mike Chillingworth said they were concerned for the animals, which were not suitable as pets.</p>
        
            <p>"The tortoise has been at the park since he was around two, and the iguana was hatched here.</p>
        
            <p>"We would appreciate any information or assistance which would lead to their return," Chillingworth said.</p>
