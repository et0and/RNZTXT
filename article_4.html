            <p>The trial for a woman accused of murdering her two children and hiding their remains in suitcases has been adjourned, and will not go ahead this week.</p>
        
            <p>At an administrative hearing in the High Court in Auckland on Monday morning, Justice Rebecca Edwards adjourned the trial, with a date to be set next month.</p>
        
            <p>Hakyung Lee has pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder.</p>
        
            <p>The bodies of her two children were discovered in suitcases in August 2022, after a family bought the contents of an abandoned storage locker in Auckland in an online auction.</p>
        
            <p>Lee, a Korean who is a New Zealand citizen, was taken into custody in South Korea in September 2022, and extradited to New Zealand two months later.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was due to begin on Wednesday.</p>
