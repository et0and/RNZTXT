            <p>Wellington City councillors are today hashing out how best to spend their revenue over the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed Long Term Plan could see budget cuts in multiple areas, including funding for the Khandallah pool upgrade, the begonia house at the botanic gardens, and three different skate parks.</p>
        
            <p>The council is also considering selling its shares in Wellington Airport - currently it holds a 34 percent wedge, valued at $278 million.</p>
        
            <p>It comes in the wake of its financial woes, including a multi-million dollar cost blowout for the town hall refurbishment.</p>
        
            <p>Sports groups, environmental organisations, and community park trusts have made last-ditch efforts during public submissions to explain why their funding should not be cut, but councillors have reiterated that cuts must be made somewhere.</p>
        
            <p>A Tawa Association Football Club spokesperson told councillors a Grenada North park upgrade was promised a decade ago, and some children had broken ankles this year because of its poor condition.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Sustainability Trust said its home energy savings service was still much needed, and uptake had only declined because the council had not marketed it properly.</p>
        
            <p>More than 60 amendments are being proposed following three days of workshops and a survey of councillors.</p>
        
            <p>The council's chief strategy and governance officer, Stephen McArthur, warned the "many and multiple" amendments would come at a cost.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of those amendments would have the effect of actually moving council further away from those finanical parameters that you've talked about in the various workshops. By that I mean average rates increase over 10 years of between five and eight percent and the 225 percent debt to revenue limit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The council I think will need to revisit how to address those financial challenges."</p>

            <p>Wellington City Lambton Ward councillor Tamatha Paul gave a valedictory speech at the beginning of the meeting, before her final day as a councillor tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>The Green Party member is leaving the council to enter Parliament as the Wellington Central MP.</p>
        
            <p>She told the long-term plan committee she was nervous to speak up when she first joined the council in 2019, but felt compelled to be a voice for other renters, students, and young people.</p>
        
            <p>A council by-election is likely to be held in mid-February.</p>
