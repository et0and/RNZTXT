            <p>A High Court trial for the man accused of murdering Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao begins on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Bao disappeared from the suburb of Hornby on 19 July 2023 when she was going to show a house to a prospective client.</p>
        
            <p>Her body was found just over a year later on 31 July, buried in a shallow grave along a treeline on a Greenpark farm.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao, 53, was arrested at Christchurch Airport days after her disappearance.</p>

            <p>One of Bao's friends Jin Tian, who spoke to her on the morning she vanished, said Bao promised to call her back but never did.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, Tian said Bao mentioned a potential client who wanted to transfer money to New Zealand during their phone call.</p>
        
            <p>She believed the client may have been the last person to speak to Bao.</p>
        
            <p>Yanfei Bao's husband reported her missing that night and her cellphone was found in grass on the side of the southern motorway on 21 July.</p>
        
            <p>Cao was initially charged with Bao's kidnapping but two days later police said they did not believe she was alive and the investigation became a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with Yanfei Bao's murder last September, to which he pleaded not guilty. A kidnapping charge has since been dropped.</p>
        
            <p>Bao lived in Christchurch with her husband, Paul Gooch, and her daughter who was aged 9 when she disappeared.</p>
        
            <p>In August last year, Bao's family released a statement thanking people for their support and urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Their only desire is to have her returned to them, so they can find closure and begin the grieving process," the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"Amid this harrowing experience, the Bao family encourages everyone to cherish their loved ones and express their feelings openly."</p>
        
            <p>Gooch said people should go home and tell those they held dear that "you love and cherish them".</p>
        
            <p>Cao's trial has been set down for six weeks.</p>
