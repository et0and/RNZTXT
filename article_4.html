            <p>The daughter of a roadworker killed by a truck says he'd previously spoken about his fear of being hit due to the number of trucks that sped through work sites.</p>
        
            <p>Her father Brian Barnes was fatally struck by a truck being driven by 40-year-old Michael Stacy on State Highway 23 south of Whatawhata on 12 February last year.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation revealed Stacy was speeding and the service brakes on his truck, which was transporting dirt from a nearby slip, were only working at 33 percent capacity. The parking brake was only working at 15 percent capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Barnes' grieving family were in the Hamilton District Court on Tuesday for Stacy's sentencing on a charge of careless driving causing death.</p>
        
            <p>His second oldest daughter, Ann Marie, 38, told Judge Glen Marshall that never in her life would she imagine her father would die from moving road cones.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't make sense at all because he wasn't meant to get out of his vehicle. What was he doing getting out of the ute to move cones?</p>
        
            <p>"You know, Dad always had a fear that one day he would get hit by a truck because of the amount of trucks he witnessed racing through roadworks, and not slowing down while he was in a vehicle was absolutely crazy.</p>
        
            <p>"A fear which became a reality."</p>
        
            <p>Younger sister, Gaylene Maruzza, said her world was completely shattered when she was told the words, "Dad's gone".</p>
        
            <p>"Just like that. Without warning."</p>
        
            <p>Making it even harder to bear was the fact the 58-year-old had just returned to work just under a year after having open-heart surgery - something doctors never expected him to recover from.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 23 was closed for significant periods last summer due to Cyclone Gabrielle creating havoc on various parts of the road.</p>
        
            <p>On the morning of 12 February, Stacy was driving a McGowan Transport truck that was helping repair a slip on the SH23 deviation.</p>
        
            <p>The road was closed to the general public.</p>
        
            <p>He picked up his Kenworth truck from the McGowan yard and headed to SH23 for a toolbox meeting.</p>
        
            <p>He drove to the slip site and filled his truck with a load of fill before heading to the dump site.</p>
        
            <p>After rounding a corner he came to a traffic control checkpoint at the intersection of SH23 and Cogswell Road.</p>
        
            <p>Working at the checkpoint was Barnes who had a work ute parked in the right-hand lane, while cones were in the left-hand lane.</p>
        
            <p>All trucks going through the site were required to come to a full stop to allow the worker to move the road cones and subject to a 30km/h speed limit.</p>
        
            <p>Stacy approached the site travelling 58km/h and was unable to stop and crashed into Barnes who was moving the cones.</p>
        
            <p>He died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Following a mechanical inspection, multiple issues relating to the braking system were found including the brakes not operating effectively, and mechanical joints that were visibly worn.</p>
        
            <p>The brakes were found to be a "contributory factor" in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Stacy's lawyer Glen Prentice told Judge Marshall his client felt an "enormous amount of remorse" which would have been evident at the restorative justice conference and in court.</p>
        
            <p>"He carries the weight of knowing that his actions caused the loss of a loved father and grandfather and husband.</p>
        
            <p>"He also appreciates that no sentence will hold him accountable for that extraordinary loss."</p>
        
            <p>Prentice described it as an "unusual case" given the aspect of brake failure yet he had decided to plead guilty to the charge due to the speeding aspect.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a situation just simply of a truck driver driving too fast and being careless in wet conditions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He noted there was "reasonably strong evidence" to suggest Stacy's truck was travelling at 35km/h just prior to the checkpoint, which was not too dissimilar to a truck travelling immediately before it at 28km/h.</p>
        
            <p>That truck was able to safely stop.</p>
        
            <p>"The brakes, in my submission, must have been a significant factor in this crash."</p>
        
            <p>He urged the judge not to issue an electronically-monitored sentence so that Stacy could continue to work.</p>
        
            <p>"It's what he knows."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall acknowledged the whƒÅnau's "devastating loss" and agreed to stop short of an electronically-monitored sentence.</p>
        
            <p>As well as sentencing him to 250 hours' community work, nine months' supervision, $5000 emotional harm reparation, and disqualifying him from driving for 12 months, Stacy was ordered to complete the Right Track Programme.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Marshall said it was a tough yet "life-changing" programme that he would find not only valuable but provide some first-hand insight for other attendees.</p>
