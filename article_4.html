            <p>Invercargill City Mayor Nobby Clark is recovering in hospital after suffering a minor heart attack.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was taken to Southland Hospital and stayed overnight as a precaution after the incident on 27 December, said the council.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Tom Campbell said Clark was in good spirits and recovering well with no further incident overnight, but had been transferred to Dunedin Hospital for further tests on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all very grateful for the care and support provided by the hospital care teams and our thoughts are with mayor Clark and his family as we wish him a speedy recovery," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The mayor and his family kindly request privacy while they focus on his recovery but I look forward to receiving more positive updates to share as they become available to me."</p>
        
            <p>Clark won the mayoralty from long-time incumbent Tim Shadbolt in last year's local body election.</p>
