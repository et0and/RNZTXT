            <p>A roadworks contractor is critically hurt after being hit by a truck which rolled down a street in the Auckland suburb of Remuera.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were notified of the incident at a roadworks site on Victoria Avenue at 10.18pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The contractor was taken to Auckland City Hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland Transport spokesperson said they would be working with WorkSafe to find out what happened.</p>
        
            <p>AT has also confirmed the truck belonged to a company doing contract work.</p>
        
            <p>"Our contractors do important, essential work across Auckland day in day out to keep our city moving.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the staff member and their family during this time."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the truck left the scene immediately after the crash, but the driver and the vehicle had since been found in the Papatoetoe area.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport's website stated the road would be closed overnight between 5 May and 16 May for asphalt resealing.</p>
