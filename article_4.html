            <p>The New Zealand flag will fly at half mast across government and public buildings to mark the funeral of the slain Nelson police officer.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming died after being struck by a vehicle while patrolling in Buxton Square early on New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>A funeral with full police honours will be held for the 38-year veteran on Thursday afternoon at Nelson's Trafalgar Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Paul Goldsmith has asked all government and public buildings and naval vessels to fly the flag at half-mast all day in her honour before being returned to full mast at the end of the work day.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of people gathered last Friday for a vigil to commemorate Fleming where she was described as a dedicated, intelligent, respected, matriarch of a police leader who touched many lives.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said work was underway with Fleming's family to provide a fitting tribute to the beloved police officer.</p>
        
            <p>It would include a motorcade, honour guard, police piper, and flag presentation to her family.</p>
        
            <p>Her family had agreed to share their farewell with the community so it would be livestreamed on the police website, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Lyn has made the ultimate sacrifice as a police officer, so it is appropriate we honour her with a formal police funeral."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Cathedral will be screening the funeral livestream for anyone who wants to watch it there.</p>
        
            <p>Dean Graham O'Brien said it will be for people to come together.</p>
        
            <p>"The cathedral has large screens that we use for services so it is sensible to offer them for this occasion.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone is welcome to join together at the cathedral, giving thanks for Lyn's service to our community," he said.</p>
