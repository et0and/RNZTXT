            <p>A new ferry between Auckland and Waiheke Island has sailed into service.</p>
        
            <p>Island Direct's 50-seat passenger ferry, Te Waipiki, will make up to 18 trips a day between Auckland's Downtown Ferry Terminal and Waiheke's Matiatia Wharf.</p>
        
            <p>Up until now Fullers360 has dominated the route, but it has come under scrutiny in recent months after travel disruptions and price hikes.</p>
        
            <p>The new service's founder, David Todd, told RNZ's Midday Report he had spent the morning travelling back and forth on the ferry, talking to passengers and getting some feedback.</p>
        
            <p>There had been a good number of people on board during the first crossings and he was hoping for a busy summer ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Todd said a one-way ticket cost $27.50 and a return $50, and the company was looking to introduce a multi-pass option in the next couple of weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers could also pre-book seats on the Island Direct service at no additional cost.</p>
        
            <p>"We're talking to Auckland Transport regarding the HOP Card and Gold Card, so we're pretty keen to get the various offerings going forward."</p>
        
            <p>In a media release, Todd said regular commuters would be "essential" to the new service's success.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been great to talk to our friends and neighbours on Waiheke Island about the new service and how we can better serve the community we love."</p>
        
            <p>Setting up the new venture had been "pretty streamlined", he told RNZ, with the biggest challenge being the purchase of a vessel.</p>
        
            <p>"We're on the water, we're operating and we're all ready for passengers, which is very exciting."</p>
