            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves told media Saturday afternoon that the police planned to be at the site through the weekend of what she called a "murder inquiry".</p>
        
            <p>David Karl Bridgewater, 38, was found dead on Carisbrooke Street, in the eastern suburb of Aranui on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said the family were "really shocked."</p>
        
            <p>"They're devastated about the news of their son, brother ... he was a father."</p>
        
            <p>Police were already looking for one car in connection with the investigation, but added Saturday that they are also looking for information on a green 2003 Holden Commodore registration BGE263 that was believed to be in Carisbrooke Street around the time of death.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said police are speaking to people who are cooperating with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Saturday, police said they were conducting a pre-planned search warrant at an address on the same street about 8.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons were in place while police searched the property, but have since been lifted. Police remain at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday afternoon, police said they had received more than 20 pieces of information from the public in relation to the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police are also still asking for sightings of a White 2006 Toyota Crown sedan with a sunroof (licence plate LEQ895), which may have been driven by the victim.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who has information which could assist the investigation is asked to contact police via 105, quoting file number 240104/2142. Information can also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
