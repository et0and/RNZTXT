            <p>The official Labour Day weekend holiday period is over and no one died on New Zealand roads, police say.</p>
        
            <p>It is a new record for the period, with the previous lowest being in 2013 when one person died and 109 people were injured.</p>
        
            <p>The worst Labour Day holiday weekend for deaths and serious injuries was in 1983 when 13 people died and 248 were injured.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, there were six deaths, 2022 saw five deaths, 2021 saw six deaths and in 2020, eight people died, according to the Ministry of Transport.</p>
        
            <p>National road policing centre Superintendent Steve Greal told Morning Report the zero deaths was "an amazing result".</p>
        
            <p>Greal said it was a combination of a huge effort by many people, but there was still a lot of work to do in terms of road safety.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be looking at a systems level to properly understand it for the long-term game, certainly in terms of sustainability.</p>
        
            <p>"From a policing perspective, the police effort is a part of that system and from our point-of-view for the last two years, we've done a lot, quite a significant change in the way we deploy our people."</p>
        
            <p>Greal said 73 percent of accidents occured on open and rural roads so it made sense for people to be in those areas, where the greatest harm was occurring.</p>
        
            <p>The enforcement of such areas had doubled in the last couple of years, contributing to "general deterrence", he said.</p>
        
            <p>Greal told Morning Report the weather warnings could have made an impact, with some people choosing to stay home instead of being out on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>But that did not deter everyone, and he said he saw some people doing "horrendous speeds" on Transmission Gully in Wellington in "teaming rain", which was not a good look.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand Transport Agency spokesperson Andy Knackstedt warned people not to be complacent on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>He said even if there were no deaths, those who are seriously injured in crashes can have lifelong impacts.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just asking people to do the basics - drive and travel at a safe speed, to share the driving, make sure you're well rested, and just take the the time that you need to to get home safely."</p>
        
            <p>In earlier holiday road tolls this year, the ministry said seven people died during Easter, four died during King's Birthday, and one died during Matariki.</p>
