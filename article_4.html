            <p>Potential pollution from the site of a capsize off the Port of Napier breakwater will be monitored this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were rescued from the recreational boat on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council said the 10.5 metre wooden recreational craft hit a log.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured, but the boat was carrying 500 litres of diesel at the time of the collision.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel has been towed to port and will be lifted out by crane, before being taken to a nearby sailing club at the owner's expense.</p>
