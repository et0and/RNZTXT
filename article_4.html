            <p>Police, iwi and gang representatives have met to talk solutions after a rugby club van was shot at over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The van was shot at after a Hawke's Bay third division rugby match at Bill Mathewson Park in Hastings on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A match between Tamatea and the Young Māori Party (YMP) was abandoned because of safety concerns, and the YMP van shot at as the players left.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu iwi chair Bayden Barber said the Wednesday hui was "a good start" and they now wanted to engage with all of the community in order to find a way forward.</p>
        
            <p>The hui included Black Power representatives Mundy Adams and Denis O'Reilly and police liaison John Tangaere.</p>
        
            <p>Barber said he had reached out to both sides, and another gang was having their own meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.</p>
        
            <p>He said with more rugby games due to be played this weekend, safety was paramount.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still a lot of tension in the community with what happened last weekend."</p>
        
            <p>Barber said it was a complicated situation and they needed to try and bring everyone together.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully all parties will be open to coming together because that's how we'll move forward. "</p>
        
            <p>"We can't let it simmer away and then erupt at some other event, or possibly another rugby game."</p>
