            <p>Indian President Droupadi Murmu has arrived in Auckland on a three-day state visit.</p>
        
            <p>India's head of state travels to Wellington tomorrow to hold bilateral talks with Governor-General Cindy Kiro, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters before attending a state dinner.</p>
        
            <p>She will be officially welcomed at Government House on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Murmu is also scheduled to attend the New Zealand International Education Conference in the capital before returning to Auckland on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>She will meet members of the Indian community in TƒÅmaki Makaurau on Friday evening before flying out to Timor-Leste.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said the visit showed New Zealand was a trusted and supportive bilateral and regional partner to India.</p>
        
            <p>India's Ministry of External Affairs said the visit would provide further impetus to relations between the two countries.</p>
        
            <p>This is only the second visit by an Indian head of state after then-President Pranab Mukherjee travelled to New Zealand in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Murmu, who is the second female and the first person from a tribal community to hold the position, is expected to present a floral tribute at the Mahatma Gandhi statue at Wellington train station.</p>
        
            <p>She will also participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Pukeahu National War Memorial in the capital.</p>
