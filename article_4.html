            <p>More than a third of this year's Whitcoulls Kids' Top 50 Books list were written by New Zealand authors.</p>
        
            <p>Long-running favourite Lynley Dodd topped the list this year with Hairy Maclary - while Harry Potter continued to captivate, claiming the second spot on the list.</p>
        
            <p>Just under a quarter of the books in the Top 50 were there for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>This year marks the 25th for the list, generated by children's votes for their favourite reads.</p>
        
            <p>Whitcoulls books manager Joan Mackenzie said the nation's young readers were keen to get behind their most treasured stories.</p>
        
            <p>"Such is our Kiwi kids' love of reading, many of the voting papers arrived complete with ringing endorsements; some even included lovingly detailed illustrations to support their favourite book."</p>
        
            <p>Classics such as The Gruffalo (8th) and We're Going on a Bear Hunt (17th) continued to delight and inspire, but this year's list had a strong local presence.</p>
        
            <p>Kat Quin's Kuwi's First Egg and Betty and Alan Gilderdale's The Little Yellow Digger placed fourth and seventh respectively, and The Wonky Donkey was 11th.</p>
        
            <p>The results also revealed young New Zealanders' love of bingeable series - 17 books on the top 50 were part of a series.</p>
        
            <p>Three series by New Zealand author James Russell reached the top 50 this year - with his Dragon Defenders, Children of the Rush and Dragon Brothers coming in at 16th, 18th and 31st respectively.</p>
