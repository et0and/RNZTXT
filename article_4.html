            <p>Some Auckland ferry services will return to normal frequency next month with new crew trained up to plug workforce gaps.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport reduced timetables last October to make time for ferry operator, Fullers360, to train staff.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, the restricted services and abrupt cancellations annoyed commuters, some of whom faced long trips on buses to get to their destinations.</p>
        
            <p>Following mass cancellations of Fullers ferries earlier in the year, then-immigration minister Michael Wood called a crisis meeting with Fullers, Auckland Transport and Waka Kotahi, to address the staff shortage.</p>
        
            <p>The result was that skippers and deckhands were added to the green list for visas.</p>
        
            <p>Fullers360 marine manager Andy Johnson said 20 new deckhands and 10 skippers had been appointed.</p>
        
            <p>From 4 June, Devonport ferries will return to a 20-minute frequency, while weekday sailings will be added to Half Moon Bay, Birkenhead, and Te Onewa Northcote Point services.</p>
