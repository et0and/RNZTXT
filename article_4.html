            <p>Customs has seized 35kg of cocaine in a ship docked at Port of Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>The illegal drug had a street value of about $15.7 million, consisting of about 350,000 doses, the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>The ship arrived from Panama last Thursday. Customs group manager maritime Paul Campbell said the cocaine was found in the engine compartment of a refrigerated shipping container full of bananas that evening.</p>
        
            <p>Two weeks ago, 140kg of cocaine was removed from a shipping container at the Port of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"There is an economic cost with this criminal behaviour that includes disruption to legitimate activity on New Zealand's ports," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"While Customs risk assesses all incoming shipments and vessels, the time involved for physical searches is significantâ€¦ clearance of other legitimate shipments becomes inevitably slower while we undertake inspections for suspect containers.</p>
        
            <p>"This is time-consuming work but Customs, and port operators understand it has to happen to stop the criminal activity that threatens New Zealand's supply chain."</p>
        
            <p>Port of Tauranga chief executive Leonard Sampson he understood the "value" of Customs' work, even if it delayed "legitimate cargo".</p>
        
            <p>"Our security and operations teams are highly focused on safety and preventing any illegal activity at our port."</p>
