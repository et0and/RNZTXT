        <h2>Christchurch 13 percent rates rise 'unviable for residents'</h2>
        <p>
Councillors have overwhelmingly supported going to the public with a 13 percent rates rise, despite concerns the long term plan did not do enough to address water infrastructure needs.

            <p>Christchurch City councillors have overwhelmingly supported going to the public with a 13 percent rates rise for the coming financial year.</p>
        
            <p>The council this afternoon signed off on its draft long-term plan, the 10-year budget, and the accompanying consultation document.</p>
        
            <p>Few councillors were pleased with the headline figure, but councillors approved the plan 13 votes to four.</p>

            <p>Among those who voted against the draft was Heathcote ward councillor Sara Templeton.</p>
        
            <p>She said the plan did not do enough to address the city's water infrastructure needs.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2018, the leakage rate from our pipes was 18 percent and we had a target of getting it under 15 percent," she said.</p>
        
            <p>But it was now at 27 percent, and the target was to get it under 25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"It's clearly unacceptable," Templeton said.</p>
        
            <p>"A fully functioning and safe drinking water supply is the lifeblood of any city, and ours is creaking and leaking and I've not seen a plan to fix it. It's only out of sight and out of mind until it's flowing down the street. This is not a more affordable long-term plan and we can certainly not afford for our water infrastructure to get so bad it fails."</p>
        
            <p>Spreydon ward councillor Dr Melanie Coker also held concerns about the lack of forward thinking.</p>
        
            <p>"We're leaving the tab for future generations to pick up," Coker said.</p>
        
            <p>But even those who supported the draft did so on the condition it would be altered by the time it was finalised.</p>
        
            <p>Fendalton ward councillor James Gough was scornful of the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the proposed 13 percent rates rise is shameful really, and totally unviable for residents. For me that's the headline of it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Harewood ward councillor Aaron Keown said he hoped the public would suggest cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope this is the one LTP where the public come in and tells us how not to spend money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes a lot of work has been done but I don't think enough work by table has been done to reduce the costs for people that live in our city. The rates rise is truly unacceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Keown wanted a single-digit rates rise.</p>
        
            <p>Submissions open on 13 March and close just over a month later.</p>
        
            <p>The council will finalise the long-term plan before July.</p>
