            <p>Dunedin residents are being asked to keep their dogs on leads and drive carefully near a golf course where two sea lions' pups were recently born.</p>
        
            <p>Hiriwa had her latest pup at the Chisholm Links golf course on Tuesday while another mother pupped not far from John Wilson Drive.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation biodiversity ranger Jim Fyfe said a previous pup was hit and killed by a car at Papanui Inlet in 2022 and a four-year-old male was killed by a car on Boxing day.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just the pups that are vulnerable so we're asking drivers to slow down in areas where there are sea lions present," Fyfe said.</p>
        
            <p>Nine pups have been seen between Warrington to Ocean View this breeding season.</p>
        
            <p>DOC has been in contact with the golf course management and the Dunedin City Council about requiring all dogs to be kept on leads near the course over the next month.</p>
        
            <p>Mothers started to leave their pups alone while they forage after a week and the pups were vulnerable to dogs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These pups are not world-wise and only weigh 9-12 kg when first left alone, so they are particularly vulnerable to being picked up by larger dogs."</p>
        
            <p>Signs have been put out and council animal services would patrol the area more frequently in the coming weeks.</p>
