            <p>The Māori Queen, Nga wai hono i te po will be among supporters of the national hīkoi making its way to Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The hīkoi is in opposition of the Treaty Principles Bill and government's policies affecting Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Participants of te hīkoi mō te Tiriti are having a rest day today after arriving in Porirua Sunday night on day 7 of the event.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday they will head towards Waitangi Park before making their way along the Golden Mile to the Beehive.</p>
        
            <p>Kiingitanga spokesperson Ngira Simmonds said she had a message of hope for the nation to come together and work through current divisions.</p>
        
            <p>"The Māori Queen is willing to help lead a conversation about nationhood and national unity but she will not accept a unilateral process that undermines Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>"The day for constitutional reform will come, but it must be done in good faith and in accordance with tikanga, and in full acknowledgement of the foundations of our nation bound together through Te Tiriti o Waitangi as Tangata Whenua and Tangata Tiriti," Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>He said Te Kiingitanga stands ready to support the nation in a way that uplifts Kotahitanga and mana motuhake.</p>
        
            <p>"Our nation's strength lies in honouring the promises we make to each other.</p>
        
            <p>"As the late Kiingi Tuheitia said at te Hui-aa-Motu earlier this year, the best protest we can do is to be Māori all day everyday," Simmonds said.</p>
