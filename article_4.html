            <p>A High Court jury has found a young stepmother guilty of the manslaughter of a two-year-old girl in her care.</p>
        
            <p>Jessica Mulford, 20, has been standing trial in Hamilton, charged with the murder of two-year-old Harlee-Rose Niven on 9 April 2022.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with injuring Harlee-Rose, her stepdaughter, with intent to injure her, on 9 November 2021. On that charge the jury found her guilty.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown case against Mulford was that she lost her temper with the child, "snapped" and injured her - possibly by stomping - causing catastrophic and unsurvivable internal injuries, including a split pancreas and damage to her liver.</p>
        
            <p>The defence case was that something else caused those injuries - possibly Mulford's now-former partner Dylan Berry giving the youngster a "magic carpet ride" on a sheet of tarpaulin towed by his motorbike - or possibly by a fall from a trike or an accident in the bathroom.</p>
        
            <p>The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 3.45pm on Thursday, and returned with their decisions just after 5.30pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Mulford began quietly weeping as the verdicts were delivered.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown case was led by prosecutors Rebecca Mann and Jacinda Hamilton, while Rebekah Webby and Nicholas Dutch acted for Mulford.</p>
        
            <p>Webby pointed the finger of blame at Berry.</p>
        
            <p>"It sounds convenient that Mr Berry distanced himself by sitting outside.</p>
        
            <p>"His account is entirely self-serving. Ms Mulford has a consistent story. Mr Berry's ... doesn't have a ring of truth."</p>
        
            <p>Mulford "is the only person that appears before you today because she is the one that changed Harlee['s nappy] that morning."</p>
        
            <p>Webby referred the jurors to the account of a young neighbour, who Berry had gone to for help after finding Harlee-Rose unresponsive.</p>
        
            <p>"She said Ms Mulford had just got out of bed, and was in her pyjamas - in 'sleepy mode'.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not indicative of a violent and angry person who has just snapped and assaulted a child."</p>
        
            <p>"The Crown said it: Emotions fuel actions. But there is nothing [in their case] to say emotion has fuelled any sort of action here."</p>
        
            <p>Mulford was likewise innocent of any wrongdoing in the 9 November 2021 incident.</p>
        
            <p>A Tauranga Hospital paediatrician who gave evidence during the trial said on that occasion Harlee-Rose's injuries were consistent with having suffered a non-accidental strangulation injury.</p>
        
            <p>Mulford, however, has always maintained the youngster's injuries were incurred by her climbing out a window and falling from a ledge - an incident that occurred while Mulford was shifting her car.</p>
        
            <p>Webby also pointed out the paediatrician did not rule out some kind of "complex accidental injury".</p>
        
            <p>"You have to determine it on the principle of beyond reasonable doubt," Webby said. "This was an unseen fall while Mulford was in the car.</p>
        
            <p>Mulford's actions afterward - taking Harlee-Rose to see her father, and then to a medical centre and then the hospital - would not be the actions of someone who had just strangled the child, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In her closing, Mann described the defence case as "fitting the literal definition of clutching at straws". She pointed to the various explanations Mulford had proffered - a fall from a scooter, a fall from a trike, or a fall in the bathroom - to people.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was clear on the morning of 9 April that Mulford had either murderous intent when she inflicted injuries to Harlee-Rose's abdomen, or she meant to cause her bodily injuries she knew were likely to cause her death - but went ahead anyway.</p>
        
            <p>It was undisputed that Mulford was alone with the youngster at the time she became badly unwell as a result of the injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no suggestion this is a premeditated killing. Very few murders fall into that category. Most are spontaneous acts in the spur of the moment ... mostly emotions are fuelling actions.</p>
        
            <p>"Kneeling on, standing on, or a punch, or a stomp - any of those things could have inflicted those injuries."</p>
        
            <p>A pathologist's analysis had found the toddler would have started showing symptoms "within minutes".</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidence before you that contradicts Mr Berry's evidence that he was outside at the time [the injuries were inflicted]."</p>
        
            <p>Mann reminded the jurors that the defence counsel - Webby, with the assistance of Nicholas Dutch - had made much of the supposed "magic carpet ride" during which Harlee-Rose may have suffered her injuries during their cross-examination of numerous Crown witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a proposition that was not accepted by any of them."</p>
