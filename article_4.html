            <p>A man died in central Auckland last week after suffering a head injury from a fall, following an interaction with the police.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a business in Boston Road, in Grafton, on Monday afternoon, as a man there was acting in an agitated way toward staff and paramedics, acting superintendent Sunny Patel said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police officers arrived and instructed the man to leave ...however following this, the man has fallen and suffered a serious head injury.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim was transported to hospital where he underwent surgery, however he has since died."</p>
        
            <p>A critical incident investigation has been begun, and investigators are now trying to piece together exactly what happened, Patel said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority had also been notified.</p>
        
            <p>"Our sympathies are with the man's family and friends at this time, and we are providing support to the man's family," Patel said.</p>
