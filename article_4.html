            <p>Workers from Plant and Food Research institute in Auckland's Mount Albert had to evacuate today after a chemical odour triggered the fire alarm about a 12.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>Ten fire trucks responded to the call, alongside a Hato Hone St John ambulance and two police cars.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters have since left the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A worker from the institute, who RNZ agreed not to name, said she heard about the incident from an emergency email.</p>
        
            <p>"I got an email from work saying that this happened. We also have a group chat and some of our colleagues sent the video of the fire trucks coming through.</p>
        
            <p>"I was off-site, I was on the field today since 6am, so I didn't know what was going on."</p>
        
            <p>She said she also received an email from the day care centre looking after her two children.</p>
        
            <p>"The day care is right next to the [research] building, so they saw everything.</p>
        
            <p>"They emailed us advising the kids were safe."</p>
        
            <p>Workers could not access their vehicles while emergency services were on-site, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I went out early in the morning with the [company] car to the field, but I couldn't bring it back because of the closure.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people got taxis home, because our cars stayed inside the building and we could not get in."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it worked with partner-agencies to contain the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Crews have since confirmed there is no risk and have handed the site back to owners," a spokesperson said.</p>
