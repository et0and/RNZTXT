            <p>A new Wellington queer film collective has a mission - to completely take down the film hierarchy.</p>
        
            <p>The New New film collective was formed in November last year.</p>
        
            <p>It was co-created by Stevie Goodwin who had just completed his master's in film at Massey University.</p>
        
            <p>His thesis was on queer film production processes.</p>
        
            <p>Goodwin said that certain practices in the mainstream film industry did not sit right with him.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sick of the tyrannical cis white man director who tells everyone what to do," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Film should be a creative and collaborative experience."</p>
        
            <p>Goodwin said The New New film collective was formed out of the frustration of being emerging film maker and having to fit in a certain kind of box.</p>
        
            <p>The collective's goal was not only to create authentic queer representations onscreen, but also to explore a more "queer" way of working behind the camera.</p>
        
            <p>This meant less hierarchical and "more circular and holistic".</p>
        
            <p>There was an emphasis on lifting each other up as creatives and making sure everyone had a voice, Goodwin said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the collective was more mindful than mainstream filmmakers of all the processes behind the finished product.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, a lot of care was taken to ensure the script was perfect.</p>
        
            <p>"Filmmakers often rush the script writing process and projects end up not having as much authenticity or heart as they could."</p>

            <p>The New New film collective was heavily influenced by the New Queer Cinema movement of the 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>Like this movement, The New New embraced low-budget production and put an emphasis on DIY techniques like hand-held camera work.</p>
        
            <p>They have made two short films so far - Fingerdance and Instant Film - both of which are thoughtful explorations of queer romance, Goodwin said.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted viewers of these films to come away feeling like they had seen something new in the "absolute queer heart" of the films.</p>
        
            <p>"You don't get this heart in mainstream queer productions."</p>
        
            <p>Student and drag king Zia Ravenscroft said being part of The New New was the most fulfilling thing they had ever done.</p>
        
            <p>They play a lead role in Fingerdance, contribute to script writing and running the collective's social media.</p>
        
            <p>"What I like most is that we are all equals, we're a true collective in every sense of the word."</p>
        
            <p>Goodwin said that The New New want to make a completely different type of film next, more similar to those of The New Queer Cinema movement.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing to do with romance or desire, something campy, surreal and fun."</p>
        
            <p>He said The New New were building a portfolio of films which would screen at the collective's yet to be confirmed debut event in November.</p>
        
            <p>They also planned to submit their short films to film festivals.</p>
        
            <p>The collective were still learning which practices work best and "what it all means", he said.</p>
