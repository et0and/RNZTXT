            <p>Water tankers are available on several streets.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare has asked residents with low water pressure to save water if possible, and avoid using their dishwasher or washing machine over the next 24 hours. It also advised keeping shorts short - four minutes or less.</p>
        
            <p>A section of Mountain Road has been closed off to traffic in both directions, and Watercare expect it to remain that way for at least 48 hours.</p>
