            <p>Wellington authorities are warning the public to take care near two rivers in the region due to toxic algae blooms.</p>
        
            <p>Red alert level warnings are in place for the Waipoua River at Columbo Road in Masterton and the Hutt River at Silverstream Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council is urging people not to swim in these river areas.</p>
        
            <p>It also wanted dog walkers to not let their animals in the water and avoid the river's edge where significant amounts of toxic algae had accumulated.</p>
        
            <p>Toxic algae grows on rocks in the riverbed and forms leathery, dark green or black mats, which can break off and accumulate at the river's edge.</p>

            <p>The regional council's knowledge and insights manager, Dr Evan Harrison, said the algae could be harmful to humans and lethal for dogs if ingested.</p>
        
            <p>"Even a small amount of toxic algae, the size of a 50-cent piece, can be enough to kill a dog."</p>

            <p>Dog owners who think their animals have swallowed toxic algae, or shows signs of lethargy, muscle tremors, fast breathing, paralysis or convulsions, should go to the nearest vet immediately.</p>
        
            <p>People who have been in contact with toxic algae and are feeling unwell should see a doctor, or ring Healthline on 0800 611 116.</p>
        
            <p>The community is advised to check the LAWA website for toxic algae warnings and alerts before visiting rivers in the Wellington region this summer.</p>
