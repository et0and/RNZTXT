            <p>Police have a DNA profile of the woman found dead in Gulf Harbour last week, but are yet to identify her.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tim Williams said the DNA obtained by police did not match anyone in their records.</p>
        
            <p>"We are hopeful this will assist us in finding out the identity of this victim.</p>
        
            <p>"Our priority remains on confirming their identification and results of further examinations and tests are still pending."</p>
        
            <p>Overseas Police and Interpol have been contacted to help with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police received almost 100 phone calls from members of the public trying to help them with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Officers are still reviewing those tips and CCTV footage, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched after a fisherman found the body wrapped in plastic bags on 13 March by the Gulf Harbour ferry terminal.</p>
        
            <p>Police have released of the blue pyjama bottoms and a light-coloured singlet with an emblem, that she was wearing.</p>
        
            <p>"The very nature of this discovery means this is a complex investigation - and it will take time," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"In saying that, the community can continue to be reassured that police are committed to holding the person, or persons, responsible to account."</p>
