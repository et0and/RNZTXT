            <p>A large house fire in the western Bay of Plenty has been extinguished after a two-hour effort.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokeswoman said the alarm was raised just before noon on Friday, with the two-storey home at Paengaroa, about 10km east of Te Puke, burning fiercely when the first firefighters arrived.</p>
        
            <p>The flames had also spread to a 200-metre-long shelterbelt.</p>
        
            <p>Six appliances and two water tankers responded, with crews initially focussed on stopping the fire's spread, she said.</p>
        
            <p>They managed to put out the house fire just after 2.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>There were no reports of injuries or anyone missing.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which was opposite Paengaroa School near the southern end of the town, forced the closure of Old Coach Road but it has since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator was at the scene.</p>
