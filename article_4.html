            <p>An Auckland couple believed to have been killed by a ram on their farm last week will be farewelled in a joint funeral.</p>
        
            <p>Alfred Hansen, 82, who was known by his middle name, Helge, - and his wife Gaye, 81, were found dead at their Waitakere property on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Post mortems confirmed the couple died from injuries caused by an animal, and police shot an agressive ram when they arrived at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A funeral for the pair will be held at the Kumeu Showgrounds on 24 April.</p>
        
            <p>An obituary said they died suddenly after a "tragic accident", and described them as "dearly loved" parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents.</p>
        
            <p>The victims' nephew and family spokesperson Dean Burrell earlier told RNZ the couple lived at the property where they were found dead.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, they've both lost their lives in a tragic accident."</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances of their passing was very unexpected, he said, adding that he was still coming to terms with it.</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said the couple rented the property. They were retired hobby farmers, and had sheep, cattle and chickens for eight years.</p>
        
            <p>"They're good people. They're over 80. They don't deserve this.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is in shock as to what's happened. They are very upset."</p>
        
            <p>Burrell said he felt like he was dreaming when he found out what happened. "I just didn't believe it."</p>

            <p>Helge and Jan Hansen's son, Antony, a photographer who lives in the United Arab Emirates, told Stuff his sister, Leanne, arrived at their father's property around the same time as police.</p>
        
            <p>He received a call around midnight, UAE time, from his sister, saying their dad and Gaye were dead.</p>
        
            <p>"It's frickin full-on for both of them to get taken out ... under such weird, crazy circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"You know the reality of ageing parents, but you don't expect anything so radical."</p>
        
            <p>Antony Hansen told Stuff his father, of Danish descent, used to run a sheep farm at Port Waikato, and knew what he was doing.</p>
        
            <p>"He's an experienced sheep farmer. He knows the potential outcome with rams, as far as being pretty stroppy.</p>
        
            <p>"It [must have] caught him off guard, or he wouldn't be in a paddock with one, because he's always been really cautious around rams."</p>
        
            <p>The deaths of the Hansens has been referred to the Coroner.</p>
