        <h2>'Disappointment' as more veterans likely to die waiting for Agent Orange legal arguments</h2>
        <p>
Advocates believe the right legal decision was already made when accepting the late Sir Wira Gardiner's brain cancer was a service related condition. Audio

            <p>Advocates are vowing to continue the fight for Vietnam war veterans but say more will die waiting as the government ministry appeals a High Court ruling.</p>
        
            <p>The late Sir Wira Gardiner made a claim in 2021 his glioblastoma brain tumour must be treated as a defence service-related condition due to exposure to Agent Orange. He died in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Tā Harawira's claim was initially declined by Veterans' Affairs but following a series of hearings, the Veterans' Entitlement Appeals Board accepted it.</p>
        
            <p>Veterans' Affairs immediately indicated it would appeal in a bid to seek clarity around interpretation.</p>
        
            <p>Barrister Paul Harman told RNZ's Midday Report he could understand the Crown wanting absolute clarity, but he believed the law had been correctly applied.</p>
        
            <p>"I share the disappointment that it will go to the High Court, and it may even go to the Supreme Court."</p>
        
            <p>Tā Harawira had died waiting and others would too, Harman said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means that veterans, and indeed their children who may inherit this kind of damage, are forever waiting for some so-called clarity at law before they can seek, say, medical costs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's both hurtful, it's a delay upon a delay, for some of these veterans and their children it would be what, 50 years."</p>
        
            <p>Harman said his own son had recently left the Defence Force. "And I am glad he has."</p>
        
            <p>"We are well beyond the days of musket and ball, machine gun and bullet, and bombs; we are now dealing with weaponry that is targeted and designed to cause long term damage."</p>
        
            <p>RSA acting chief executive Andrew Brown told Morning Report Veteran Affairs' appeal wasn't a surprise but he hoped they would have acknowledged by now the link between service in Vietnam and Tā Harawira's cancer.</p>
        
            <p>"(At) some point somebody, needs to say that yes it was in all likelihood related to his service in Vietnam and the Agent Orange that was present in the environment during the time that he served there."</p>
        
            <p>Other Vietnam veterans would be concerned that the case Tā Harawira and his family made hadn't been accepted, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he was confident "in the end" the courts would come down on the veterans' side.</p>
