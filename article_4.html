            <p>Flights were delayed in Auckland this morning after an issue with the submission of flight plans.</p>
        
            <p>The plans are a requirement for flying aircrafts, and need to be submitted at least 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the journey.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ staff member at Auckland Airport was told by a pilot that an issue with Air Traffic Control in the city meant flight plans were being issued very slowly, delaying take-offs.</p>
        
            <p>Airways NZ says is aware that some airlines had an issue entering their flight plans, but understands the situation has been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
