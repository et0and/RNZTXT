        <h2>Defence Force fire crew numbers questioned before fatal blaze - Report</h2>
        <p>
Despite a fatal fire at a Defence Force camp in May, the force is still struggling with too few firefighters.

            <p>The Defence Force is still struggling with too few firefighters even though the numbers of personnel overall who are quitting has dropped.</p>
        
            <p>At the big Burnham and Linton military camps, it still has its emergency responders on reduced hours.</p>
        
            <p>This was the case on 8 May, the night a teenager died in a fire at a Defence house at Burnham.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported earlier that Fire and Emergency (FENZ) went to the blaze instead of Defence Force responders, and got there within its time target of 11 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>"No evidence or circumstances have come to light that warrant an internal investigation or review into the incident," Defence told RNZ on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Email trails released under the Official Information Act to RNZ show a commanding officer at Burnham had asked about the state of Defence's depleted fire crews, late last year.</p>
        
            <p>Defence "has faced significant challenges in maintaining its Emergency Response outputs to Linton and Burnham areas over 2023 - specifically, maintaining continuous coverage from those two stations", was the reply.</p>
        
            <p>It was "currently losing more personnel than it is gaining" and had not recruited to cover all dozen vacant positions for 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Responders were leaving to join FENZ, or because of "unsustainable shift patterns".</p>
        
            <p>To try to stabilise things, the fire crews at the camps were stood down for a month in December-January, then went on reduced hours.</p>
        
            <p>That remained the case, with them covering daytime hours, Monday to Friday, in line with its agreement with FENZ, Defence said.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ covers the camps outside of that time.</p>
        
            <p>An insurance adviser told the Burnham commander that FENZ monitored the fire alarms.</p>
        
            <p>"FENZ would respond and would know the location of a fire but it is possible that those on the base would not be aware of a fire's location."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said on Thursday the death at Burnham of 16-year-old Elizabeth Marvin in May was being looked into by the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ had asked FENZ If it had any concerns or questions which had not been dealt with.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, Fire and Emergency cannot answer your questions as we consider the disclosure would be likely to prejudice that process," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeking a view from the coroner as to whether there is anything that can be made public at this stage."</p>
