            <p>Muslims around the globe will begin observing the holy month of Ramadan, a period of deep spiritual reflection and celebration, in coming days.</p>
        
            <p>Ramadan will see Muslims abstain from food during daylight hours and pray before breaking their fast at sundown alongside family and friends.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a look at when the holy month begins, the importance of fasting, and why the date changes from one year to another.</p>
        
            <p>Ramadan will commence in New Zealand at the start of March.</p>
        
            <p>The Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand is expected to make a moon sighting announcement on Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The start date of Ramadan can be challenging to precisely predict, as it's typically confirmed the night before, with the sighting of a new crescent moon.</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to modern technology, the Australian National Imams Council says tracking the moon has become easier.</p>
        
            <p>Islamic authorities around the world announce the commencement of Ramadan once the moon has been sighted.</p>
        
            <p>The Islamic Calendar follows the phases of the moon, or the lunar cycle.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, the holy month of Ramadan falls approximately 10 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
        
            <p>Lasting for 29 or 30 days, Ramadan 2025 will end around March 30, with the celebratory days of Eid al-Fitr estimated to start around 30 March, again with a possible difference of a couple of days.</p>
        
            <p>Ramadan is the most sacred month of the year for Muslims.</p>
        
            <p>It remembers the month the Qur'an was first revealed to the prophet Mohammed.</p>
        
            <p>During its 29 to 30 days, Muslims abstain from food and drink, including water, every day from dawn to sunset.</p>
        
            <p>When the sun sets, adherents to the faith break their fast with a communal meal called Iftar, usually with family or friends.</p>
        
            <p>The fast is traditionally broken by eating dates, to emulate how the prophet Mohammed broke his fast.</p>
        
            <p>During Ramadan, Muslims are also encouraged to do good deeds and abstain from sinful acts, while refecting on their faith and developing positive habits to be brought forward when the holy month ends.</p>
        
            <p>The practice of fasting during Ramadan serves spiritual and social purposes.</p>
        
            <p>According to Islamic Relief Australia, Muslims believe Ramadan is the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the prophet Mohammed more than 1,400 years ago.</p>

            <p>The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual relations to achieve greater "taqwa", or consciousness of God.</p>
        
            <p>It is one of the five pillars of Islam.</p>
        
            <p>Eid al-Fitr or the "festival of breaking the fast" marks the end of Ramadan.</p>
        
            <p>It is likely to take place on the evening of Sunday, March 30 depending on the sighting of the moon.</p>
        
            <p>It is celebrated as a time for family and friends to come together with communal prayer, gift-giving and dressing in new clothes.</p>
        
            <p>Eid al-Fitr happens in the first three days of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic Calendar.</p>
