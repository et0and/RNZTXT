            <p>A barrage of illegal street racers descended on the Hutt Valley and Porirua last night, taking over roads and intersections.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Police were out in force last night taking enforcement action against antisocial vehicle users, and disrupting illegal street racing activity across Hutt Valley and Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>It said many of the racers travelled in from out of the Wellington district to take part in street racing.</p>
        
            <p>Over the course of the night, police suspended three drivers, issued 70 infringements, ordered 20 vehicles off the road, summoned one driver for excess breath alcohol, and arrested one driver for failing to stop.</p>
        
            <p>Bailiffs from the Ministry of Justice also assisted, leading to five vehicles being seized and a large number of fines collected.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt Valley Area Prevention Manager Inspector Shaun Lingard said a large checkpoint set up at Grays Road and Motukaraka Point forced the group to disperse.</p>
        
            <p>"Police remain committed to holding illegal street racers to account as we know the impact that they can have on the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only does it keep residents awake and damage the road, but it places the drivers, passengers, bystanders and other motorists at extreme risk."</p>
