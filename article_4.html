            <p>The New Zealand stock market has opened down after a massive sell-off on Wall Street overnight as tariffs spark recession fears in the United States.</p>
        
            <p>The NZX Top 50 Index was down more than 1 percent (1.1%) shortly after the open on Friday, led down by shares in some large companies most exposed to export markets.</p>
        
            <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs were expected to cost New Zealand exporters somewhere in the region of $900 million, with wine, meat, dairy sectors and some manufacturing companies most affected.</p>
        
            <p>Fletcher Building and A2Milk were each down more than 4 percent, while Synlait Milk and ERoad were down more than 3 percent.</p>
