            <p>Another former funeral director charged with the mishandling of burials at an Auckland cemetary has pleaded not guilty in Auckland District Court .</p>
        
            <p>The 53-year-old was granted interim name suppression in court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents reveal the man is charged with obtaining about $18,000 by deception in alleged offences going back to 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Fiona Bakulich, a former employee of Tipene Funerals, pleaded guilty to interfering with human remains and 12 counts of obtaining by deception. She will be sentenced next month.</p>
        
            <p>The man appeared before Judge Belinda Pidwell.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer, Panama Le'au'anae, entered the not guilty plea on his behalf.</p>
        
            <p>He elected to have a trial by jury and was expected to reappear in June. The man was granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents outlined two occasions of alleged offending.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2015, the documents claimed the man obtained about $9000 by offering services as a funeral director, the duties of which he did not fulfil.</p>
        
            <p>In January 2022, the documents said, the man obtained $9,370.36 for duties he did not fully fulfil.</p>
        
            <p>About the same time, the man was charged with neglecting to seal and metal line a casket for burial.</p>
        
            <p>The maximum sentence for obtaining more than $1000 by deception is seven years imprisonment, while the burial related charge carries a maximum two year prison sentence.</p>
