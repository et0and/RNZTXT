            <p>Firefighters are working to extinguish a house fire just south of WhangƒÅrei.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were called to Caves Road in Mangapai at 2.30am on Tuesday to find a house and an attached garage "well involved".</p>
        
            <p>At its peak six fire trucks were battling the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Everyone in the house made it out safely, but crews were still working to put the fire out, a Fire and Emergency spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would be called in, but the blaze was not being treated as suspicious at this stage.</p>
