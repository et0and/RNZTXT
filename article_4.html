            <p>Police were wanting any information from the public about activity in the Liberton and Pine Hill areas, especially around 10pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"Residents living in the area with road facing CCTV that may have captured footage of the night are urged to contact police," Croudis said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts go out to his wife and family, as well as his friends and colleagues, at this distressing time.</p>
        
            <p>"This news will be difficult to process, and police are committed to finding answers of what has happened to Mr Singh and providing closure for his loved ones."</p>
        
            <p>Otago Punjabi Foundation Trust member Narindervir Singh said police had confirmed what the community already knew.</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever has done it should be behind bars because we don't want that kind of beast roaming around us. He can hurt someone else as well. It could be anyone of our beloved families. I'm not concerned just about the Indian community, I'm concerned about each and every person who lives in that area.</p>
        
            <p>"That person has no heart."</p>
        
            <p>Someone must have heard something if there was a violent struggle, Narindervir Singh said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't believe that no one has heard him screaming, shouting or even if he was fighting against them he must be making some kind of noise. You don't fight quietly.</p>
        
            <p>"Somebody might have heard that. I know when you're in pain you will be screaming a lot. No one has heard that screaming? Unbelievable. I don't believe that."</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone with information to come forward and find the killer.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed no-one was custody in relation to Gurjit Singh's death.</p>
        
            <p>However, on Monday police said: "There is not thought to be any ongoing safety risk to the public arising from the incident".</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked police how they could have made that statement in the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said: "Initial enquiries established that there was not thought to be an ongoing safety risk to the public arising from the incident. We're unable to provide further details while the investigation is ongoing."</p>
