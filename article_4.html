            <p>Police found a baby in a vehicle at a street racer event in the Waikato where more than 200 infringement notices were issued, they said.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 drivers blocked roads and exhibited unsafe driving behaviours across Waikato overnight, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Twelve people were arrested and about 220 infringements given.</p>
        
            <p>"Alarmingly, attending police found a baby in one of the vehicles driven by a group of teenagers believed to have travelled from out of district," Hamilton City Area Commander Inspector Will Loughrin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Operation Shadow was a police operation focusing on activity in Hamilton City and the wider Waikato region, targeting illegal street-racing offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"There were seven arrests made for excess breath alcohol, two for disorder, one for driving while suspended, one of a breach of home detention, and another had an existing warrant for arrest."</p>
        
            <p>Police also issued a number of infringement notices to bystanders who were consuming alcohol within liquor ban areas.</p>
        
            <p>Three people had their licenses suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Loughrin said there were a number of unsafe behaviours observed by officers.</p>
        
            <p>"There were numerous instances of people blocking intersections - both pedestrians and vehicles - a number of vehicles with no number plates and people wearing balaclavas in direct attempts to hide their identities, and people seen hanging out of windows of cars driven at speed."</p>
        
            <p>As well as the baby found in a vehicle, there were many people in attendance with children, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the community is sick and tired of this behaviour and people who needlessly put others at risk," Loughrin said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to send a message to anyone involved in this type of behaviour that police will work incredibly hard to hold you to account for any illegal activity - either at the time or after the fact."</p>
        
            <p>Two people taking part in the racing activity were also stabbed on State Highway 27 in the Matamata area shortly after 12.30am, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police will be utilising tools such as CCTV to follow up any other criminal offending.</p>
