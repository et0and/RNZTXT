            <p>A man who held an elderly woman at knifepoint in her retirement village home and stole her car has been sentenced to five years and seven months in prison.</p>
        
            <p>Kalib Kerr-Millar was silent as Judge Katie Elkin imposed the sentence at the Christchurch District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The home invasion happened in 2022, when the 27-year-old entered an elderly woman's home in Darfield, and held a knife to her throat before fleeing in her car.</p>
        
            <p>Kerr-Millar pleaded guilty to a raft of charges including aggravated burglary and assault with a weapon.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Elkin said the impact of the ordeal on the victim's emotional well-being had been significant.</p>
