            <p>A large fire on Matakana Island has now largely been contained, after burning for more than 24 hours since Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's District Commander Jeff Maunder said the fire burnt through about 37 hectares of scrub and pine slash.</p>
        
            <p>He said with the wind continuing to ease, crews are confident about containing the fire within its current boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>Maunder said firefighters will be monitoring the fire overnight.</p>
        
            <p>He said the aerial crews have stood down for the night but will be back in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ was alerted to the blaze about 7.30pm on Saturday and sent several crews to the island.</p>
        
            <p>The fire sent plumes of black smoke over the skyline in western Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said no houses were at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence said there have been no evacuations so far.</p>
        
            <p>The district's mayor, James Denyer, said the fire was very worrying, however, he was confident fire crews would be able to get the blaze under control.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just devastated that such a thing could happen. Any fire on Matakana is serious and has the potential to have far-reaching consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"It's obviously quite a big fire and I'm hoping that it can be put out relatively soon."</p>
        
            <p>Denyer said he was concerned about further bushfires as the region got drier over summer.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Commissioner Shadrach Rolleston said he could see the glow of the fire from his house.</p>
        
            <p>He said a family member told him the community had offered food and support to fire crews staying overnight on the island.</p>
        
            <p>Matakana Island was prone to bushfires in summer because it was so dry, Rolleston told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Late Saturday night, shift manager Garreth Lewis described the fire as about 300 metres by 300 metres, and "very visible from the mainland".</p>
        
            <p>The island has a small resident population and people are being asked to stay away from the fire.</p>
