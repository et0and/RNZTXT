            <p>Five people have died in crashes in the South Island in the past 24 hours, leading police to issue a plea for people to take care when driving.</p>
        
            <p>A person died in a single car crash on the West Coast on Sunday afternoon, two people died in a three-car crash on Sunday evening in North Canterbury, and two people died in a two-vehicle crash near ÅŒamaru on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A baby was among those taken to hospital in the North Canterbury crash, but police said the baby was not badly injured.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Ash Tabb, Canterbury prevention manager, said any deaths on the roads were devastating, and felt by many.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of the crashes emergency services respond to are preventable," Tabb said.</p>
        
            <p>"We see too many crashes where motorists have chosen to speed, drink drive, be impatient, or let themselves get distracted and take their eyes off of the road.</p>
        
            <p>"Deaths on our roads not only impact the family and friends of those involved but the emergency services who respond, and the public who witness the crash."</p>
        
            <p>Tabb said the message to motorists was simple - to do up their seatbelts, keep within the speed limit, and focus on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're having a big night, don't make the selfish decision to get behind the wheel after you've been drinking. Focus on getting home in one piece. Drive to the conditions and arrive alive."</p>
