            <p>The rollout of the transport agency's billion-dollar-plus national ticketing system continues to hit snags.</p>
        
            <p>Timaru was meant to get it first, in December.</p>
        
            <p>But NZTA Waka Kotahi said it was having to text some complex parts so it went smoothly.</p>
        
            <p>This meant Timaru and Temuka would be pushed out to the middle of the year.</p>
        
            <p>A trial had been run on one Christchurch bus route.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said 10,000 payments went through the new system, well above expected levels and with no problems.</p>
        
            <p>All of Christchurch should go live in September, and the whole country by the end of next year, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The ticketing solution, NTS or 'Motu Move', that is being built by a big American contractor, aims to offer contactless payment of the lowest fare possible by use of debit and credit cards or phones, across the country.</p>
        
            <p>A revised rollout schedule for other regions would be out soon, NZTA said.</p>
