            <p>A Kerikeri man who abused six boys more than two decades ago, while he was part of an underground sect, has been sentenced to 13 years in prison.</p>
        
            <p>William Stephen Easton, known as Bill Easton, has been sentenced in the Kaikohe District Court on 55 charges related to historic sexual offending against children.</p>
        
            <p>Handing down the sentence, Judge Brandt Shortland said the level of Easton's offending was unprecedented, it was premeditated and a betrayal of trust.</p>
        
            <p>He said the offending spanned four decades including when he was a church leader, a position of trust that he abused.</p>
        
            <p>The 80-year-old was a minister of the Two by Twos, also known as The Truth, a secretive Christian sect.</p>
        
            <p>Responding to the sentence, the police said they wanted to acknowledge the victims and their families and their ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>No conviction would ever take back what had happened, Detective Constable Mark Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>He commended those who came forward to report the offending and who testified at the trial.</p>
        
            <p>Easton was a well-known figure in his community for many years and in continual contact with children and young people.</p>
        
            <p>It could be incredibly hard and at times distressing to report or talk about incidents of this nature, but police took sexual offending seriously.</p>
        
            <p>They had officers dedicated to these cases, and they would ensure victims had a safe space to report offending in confidence.</p>
