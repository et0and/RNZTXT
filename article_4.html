        <h2>Fifth of beneficiaries paid too little, MSD survey shows</h2>
        <p>
Among those worst affected was couples with children - with them being paid either too much or too little just over half the time.

            <p>MSD has revealed it has been paying a fifth of beneficiaries and other clients surveyed too little.</p>
        
            <p>Among those worst affected was couples with children - with them being paid either too much or too little just over half the time.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development today released the results of its first survey looking into who has been getting full and correct entitlements.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, four out of 10 people were not getting the right amount, and six out of 10 were.</p>
        
            <p>MSD ending up paying a fifth of people more, and eight percent less.</p>
        
            <p>Most people who got major benefits, like Jobseeker or sole parent, were being paid correctly, with the bigger problems around more minor payments, like the disability allowance or accommodation supplement.</p>
        
            <p>The main problem was keeping up with people's changing circumstances, and clients who had less contact with it - such as non-beneficiaries - were more likely to not be getting the right amount, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Survey respondents told the ministry about barriers.</p>
        
            <p>"Clients reported that when a child or dependant was involved, the wait times for documentation sometimes discouraged them from applying for income support."</p>
        
            <p>The year-long survey covered just 1400 volunteers, too small to be representative, said Shannon Soughtton, group general manager of income, in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Still, it was useful as MSD worked on its $2 billion Te Pae Tawhiti overhaul of the welfare system</p>
        
            <p>"MSD has increased its interactions with a number of clients, particularly Jobseeker Support clients, giving people more opportunities to discuss their circumstances with us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"All clients have an obligation to tell MSD of any changes in their circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported last year on the initial results, that 43 percent of people were being paid incorrectly.</p>
