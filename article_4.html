            <p>Review: Boots, belt buckles and cowboy hats. That's all your keen eyes could see as a wave of denim engulfed Spark Arena and one of the world's biggest country music superstars serenaded a sold-out crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Before Chris Stapleton could even strum his guitar, and before even entering the venue, the cultural stranglehold country music now has on New Zealand was evident throughout the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Bars were packed, checkered shirts were tucked, and boots were shined as downtown Auckland put on its best Nashville impression.</p>
        
            <p>From the southern American accents to the hotels littered with out-of-towners, immediately you knew this concert would be like no other.</p>
        
            <p>As a self-confessed man of few words, Stapleton kicked off his show straight into song, with 'White Horse' getting one of the bigger cheers of the night from the diverse audience of young and old.</p>
        
            <p>The church of country was finally in session.</p>

            <p>In fact, it was the younger audience's vocal appetite for country music that hit it home just how much the genre has grown in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Stapleton was met by standing ovations throughout the evening, as he continuously and effortlessly matched his studio sound in real life.</p>
        
            <p>His stage presence was subtle yet captivating, as he took every opportunity to stretch his legs across the stage in the form of a guitar solo.</p>
        
            <p>A "thank you" followed each song as if we were doing him the favour, typical of southern US manners.</p>
        
            <p>After two songs, Stapleton made it clear our job was to have as much fun as possible, and boy, did we.</p>
        
            <p>His swapping of guitars after each song exemplified his talent and soulful sound, as he worked through hit after hit.</p>

            <p>The talented band, including a whiz on the harmonica, amplified the showcase and created an atmosphere that transported you straight to his hometown of Kentucky.</p>
        
            <p>His manners were met with resounding Kiwi cheer, with people travelling as far as Gore to see Stapleton in person before he ends his American Roadshow tour down under.</p>
        
            <p>He then, as he put it, "fired" his band as he took centre stage, with all those in attendance fixed on him, as he revisited how it all began - just a man and his guitar.</p>
        
            <p>The downlight and the close-up shots on the large screens above him hammered home that you were in the presence of something special and made you feel like you were the only one there.</p>
        
            <p>His raspy voice permeated around Spark Arena, before he brought his band back for 'Parachute', a clear crowd-pleaser as their backing vocals reached every corner.</p>
        
            <p>"I love you Chris Stapleton" and "Chris, there's no one better" were common themes of audience outbursts as seated sections of the venue became standing as every song intro ignited a new wave of excitement.</p>
        
            <p>It wasn't until 'Traveller' that the incredibly mannered superstar took an extra minute to thank everyone there, before asking us to join in on the chorus, which, of course, we did so gleefully.</p>

            <p>As many great artists do, Stapleton teased his most popular track, 'Tennessee Whiskey', with just the instruments playing, leaving fans begging for more.</p>
        
            <p>But not before what had become a regular theme throughout the night, another thank you - but this time, to his incredible band.</p>
        
            <p>From the whiz on the harmonica, to the maestro on the drums, or his wife's background vocals and tambourine, Stapleton comedically but sincerely introduced each band member to huge cheers of appreciation from the audience, all while 'Tennessee Whiskey' continued to play, before the most seamless and smoothest of transitions into the real thing you could have even thought possible.</p>
        
            <p>It had all the makings of a sensational finale. From the execution of his greatest hit to the massive standing ovation, and subsequent gratefulness and bows by Stapleton and his team.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, fans were not quite ready for it to be finished, and as it turned out, neither were they, albeit after some gentle Kiwi encouragement.</p>

            <p>Foot stomping, clapping and chants of "encore" echoed throughout the dimly lit Spark Arena, before Stapleton and his crew returned not even five minutes later.</p>
        
            <p>Like he had done all night, he thanked the audience, and crew, before playing two more songs, with the real finale this time around culminating with the band facing each other as they jammed one last time for the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Stapleton surrendered his guitar to the ground as the last track came to a close, and quietly exited the stage, as he prepares for another rodeo in front of another sold-out crowd at Spark Arena on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>If it wasn't obvious before, it sure was at the conclusion of an unforgettable experience, country music has reached New Zealand shores and it's here to stay, so saddle up and enjoy the ride.</p>
