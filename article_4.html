            <p>A man has been arrested after two people earlier arrived at an Auckland hospital with serious gunshot wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called after the two arrived at the hospital just before 11:30pm on Sunday 22 December. They arrived following reports received by police of gunshots heard not long before, in Hobsonville.</p>
        
            <p>By New Year's Eve, one of the two who were injured was still in hospital, Detective Senior Sergeant Megan Goldie said.</p>
        
            <p>But police had arrested a 29-year-old man that day, who they believe was responsible for the pair's injuries," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The man has been charged with two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and failing to carry out obligations in relation to a computer search, and will appear in the Waitākere District Court tomorrow [Wednesday 1 January, 2025]."</p>
        
            <p>"This is a good result, however this investigation remains ongoing and we would still like to hear from anyone who may have any information in relation to this incident."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the case was asked to call the police on 105, or report via their website, and to quote the file number 241223/2392, or an anonymous report could be made via Crime Stoppers, on 0800 555 111.</p>
