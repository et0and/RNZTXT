            <p>Hillary Outdoors has announced it's opening a new marine and conservation centre in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Founded in 1972, the not-for-profit offers outdoor education for schools and community groups, including programmes for the Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award.</p>
        
            <p>It had been searching for a new marine and conservation centre since 2017, chairman David Tommas said.</p>
        
            <p>"The acquisition of the Tangiaro Kiwi Retreat, encompassing 340 hectares of land, with 242 hectares protected by the QEII National Trust and home to one of the highest populations of kiwi birds on privately owned land in the Coromandel, fulfils this vision," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This unique location offers exceptional opportunities for experiential learning in the bush, coastal, and marine environments of the Northern Coromandel."</p>
        
            <p>It joined Hillary Outdoor's existing Tongariro Centre, and would open in time for Term 1 of the 2025 school year, chief executive Hillary Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are excited for the opportunities it will not only provide youth, but also the local community, and are delighted to say that local Coromandel school, Hauraki Plains College, is booked in the first week that the new centre opens," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hillary Outdoors closed its centre on Great Barrier Island last month after almost 20 years due to unsustainable operating costs.</p>
        
            <p>That closure was unrelated to today's announcement, it confirmed.</p>
