            <p>Dozens of residents from the Waipoua Settlement in the Kaipara District in Northland could be out of their homes for a week, as a large fire continues to rage in grassland and pine forest nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Residents have been sent to the nearby Waikara marae, which has been set up as a manaaki (support) centre.</p>
        
            <p>As of Wednesday night, the blaze covered more than 70 hectares, with about a 5km perimeter.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it saved 20 homes from being engulfed by flames, with the aid of seven helicopters with monsoon buckets working to douse the properties.</p>
        
            <p>No homes have been damaged so far and no-one has been injured.</p>
        
            <p>Te Roroa Development Group general manager Snow Tane helped with the evacuations last night.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report on Thursday fire crews were only able to fight the fire in areas they could access safely.</p>
        
            <p>Some crews had to be pulled back yesterday as conditions became too risky and the firefighting was left to those on board the helicopters.</p>
        
            <p>Some homes were just metres away from the fire front.</p>
        
            <p>"It was still a stressful time for the residents that were pretty close by."</p>
        
            <p>In some areas residents and firefighters were trapped and couldn't evacuate until the helicopters went in and doused the area.</p>
        
            <p>"It is tinder dry. The whole area around Dargaville north to the Hokianga is probably the driest point this summer - so a very challenging situation at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Some residents who evacuated had to cross over a ford before getting to a high point "well out of danger".</p>
        
            <p>Others were evacuated in vehicles and were taken to the marae where a briefing from Fire and Emergency and other support services will be held this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Residents face a nervous wait, as crews expect the fire to take up to seven days to be contained.</p>
        
            <p>Dargaville Intermediate School asked whƒÅnau to support those evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>"They are in need of food, toiletries and clothing at this stage. They had to leave all belongings behind," it posted on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>People could drop donations to the school office between 8am and 10am, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Ten firefighters have been monitoring the fireground overnight.</p>
        
            <p>An additional 40 firefighters will arrive on Thursday with plans to use heavy machinery to create fire breaks.</p>
