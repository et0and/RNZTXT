            <p>A leading surgeon is calling on politicians to stop using the health system for "point-scoring" and work together to treat health inequities in rural regions.</p>
        
            <p>Association of General Surgeons president Vanessa Blair, who works in Northland, said services were particularly dire in rural regions.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has recently reported Dargaville Hospital's night doctor has been replaced with telehealth, while patients are waiting six weeks or longer for GP appointments.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be a cross party accord about health to stop the political football treatment," Dr Blair said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an insult and a moral injury really to the whole medical profession, or anyone working in health."</p>
        
            <p>The problems of workforce shortages, underfunding and "postcode healthcare" were not new problems, Dr Blair said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need those in power to have those tough discussions about what healthcare we are prepared to fund as a country."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Health Minister Shane Reti said he worked "collaboratively", but a cross-party accord was "not on the agenda".</p>

            <p>"He is currently very firmly focused on his planning to improve the health system for the benefit of all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>Labour health spokesperson Ayesha Verrall said the previous government had "redesigned the health system so that we could start to address these inequities".</p>
        
            <p>"We got rid of the district health board model that consistently underfunded provincial DHBs so there were gaps in what they could afford to pay staff compared with metropolitan DHBs.</p>
        
            <p>"But we also had to fight off Covid. Coming out of that, yes, there were a lot of aspirations in the rural health strategy that we wanted to get on to, but of course we didn't have the opportunity coming out of the election."</p>

            <p>Dr Verrall said she did not see how a cross-party accord could work in view of the fundamentally different attitudes towards health provision between the two parties.</p>
        
            <p>"The importance of our health system should be something that's not in dispute across political parties.</p>
        
            <p>"But we've seen some pretty enduring political norms in our country cast aside by this government - for example, basically slandering the Health New Zealand Board - I don't think that's the sort of behaviour that's conducive to good bipartisanship agreement on things."</p>
        
            <p>However, the real issue underpinning the country's health woes was funding, and "any consensus on tax policy looked a long way off".</p>
        
            <p>While the government continued to claim a "record boost" to the health budget, it had not kept up with either population growth or increasing costs, Verrall said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every New Zealander is funded 4 percent less for their healthcare under this government than they were under the last Labour Government's budget."</p>
        
            <p>"I'm quite certain that the Labour Government wouldn't have been in that position because we didn't promise the same high level of tax cuts as the National Party did."</p>
