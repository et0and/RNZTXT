            <p>A police officer's use of force on a man he tackled at the top of a staircase inside the Kaitaia Police Station was unjustified, the police watchdog has found.</p>
        
            <p>The man suffered a dislocated shoulder in the incident in April this year and complained he had been pushed at the top of the stairs and punched in the face.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority found the man was inadvertently pushed and should not have been arrested for disorderly behaviour after falling down the stairs, nor charged with assault later.</p>
        
            <p>Police agreed the assault charge was premature and more investigation should have been done first.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred after the man, identified as Mr X, and his wife attended a resolution meeting at the station on behalf of their 17-year-old son, who had crashed into a car.</p>
        
            <p>As Officer A read the police summary of facts to both parties involved, Mr X disagreed with the account and began challenging the officer in a raised voice.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr X says he became upset because he felt Officer A was not impartial and lied about his son's actions."</p>
        
            <p>A person at the meeting told Mr X to let the officer finish.</p>
        
            <p>"Another witness says Mr then 'exploded' and started swearing at everyone, calling them a 'pack of mongrels' and 'c***s'."</p>
        
            <p>The IPCA said Officer A told Mr X to calm down and he responded by saying: "F*** you (Officer A). He then said to his wife: "F*** this bulls***, I'm leaving, get up (name), let's go now."</p>
        
            <p>Officer A followed Mr X out and told him to leave through a side door.</p>
        
            <p>Mr X turned and walked toward the officer and yelled another expletive.</p>
        
            <p>The officer told him to calm down or he would be arrested for disorderly behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>The IPCA said the officer escorted Mr X out by placing his hand on the man's upper back, which irritated him.</p>
        
            <p>"Officer A acknowledges that placing his hand on Mr X's back to escort him physically escalated the situation."</p>
        
            <p>The IPCA said it was unnecessary for the officer to put his hand on the man's back.</p>
        
            <p>When the pair got to the top of the stairs, CCTV footage showed the man stumbled onto the top step.</p>
        
            <p>The man said the officer deliberately pushed him but the IPCA accepted Officer A inadvertently pushed him through momentum.</p>
        
            <p>Mr X then turned and pushed the officer who reacted by grabbing hold of the upper part of the man's body, just as the man ducked.</p>
        
            <p>Officer A told the IPCA his bicep connected with Mr X's head and the authority accepted he did not punch the man in the face.</p>
        
            <p>The officer, a former sportsman, admitted his reaction amounted to a tackle and the pair lost their balance and fell down the stairs.</p>
        
            <p>Officer A then arrested Mr X for disorderly behaviour before the man was taken to hospital with a dislocated shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>However, the IPCA said the man could not be arrested for disorderly behaviour because he was not in a public place.</p>
        
            <p>It also said Officer A should not have been the one to escort Mr X out of the building and his use of force at the top of the stairs when he tackled Mr X was unjustified.</p>
        
            <p>But the authority did not recommend police lay criminal charges against Officer A.</p>
        
            <p>When Mr X complained to police about the use of force, Officer B said he was not sure if he could take the man's statement because he was a workmate of Officer A's.</p>
        
            <p>He checked with a superior who said he could but there was no attempt to address or explain a possible conflict of interest, the IPCA said.</p>
        
            <p>Officer B investigated and Mr X was charged with assault and summonsed to appear in court.</p>
        
            <p>The IPCA said the decision to charge Mr X was misguided and he should not have been served a summons.</p>
        
            <p>The authority found police did not appropriately manage Officer B's conflict of interest.</p>
        
            <p>Northland District Commander Superintendent Matt Srhoj said police carried out an investigation into the complaint alongside the IPCA's investigation.</p>
        
            <p>He said police found the decision to charge Mr X with assault was premature.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge further investigation was necessary and ultimately we withdrew the court summons."</p>
        
            <p>Srhoj said police also acknowledged the IPCA's findings concerning Officer B.</p>
        
            <p>"Police can always learn from situations like this, and we will continue to do so, to ensure our people, and the wider community, are kept safe."</p>
