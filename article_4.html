            <p>As Kiwi fans flood into Eden Park on Friday night for Coldplay's second of three concerts this week, venue boss Nick Sautner cannot help but want more.</p>
        
            <p>The UK pop-rock giants played to a 57,000 sell-out audience on Wednesday, and will do it all over again tonight and on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The three concerts make up half of Eden Park's allowance, meaning Eden Park will reach its cap tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>But Sautner hopes to get that increased to 12, and believes the justification for that is there for all to see - having previously hosted Six60, Pink, and Guns & Roses.</p>
        
            <p>"There's no guarantee, but we've got 97 percent support from the community," he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"We went through a process and I'm confident the commissioners saw the benefits and the engagement we've had.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to remember we've delivered. We said we would be able to deliver concerts at Eden Park."</p>
        
            <p>He said Coldplay's recent performances in Sydney saw the city receive an economic boost of $90 million, and has seen first-hand the foot traffic the band has had on Eden Park's surrounding suburbs this week.</p>
        
            <p>Sautner revealed Auckland Unlimited have indicated around $20m boost for Auckland's economy because of Coldplay.</p>
        
            <p>"With one venue in New Zealand, that will be far greater for our venue," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believes Kiwis have woken up to the potential of Eden Park, and hopes there will be plenty more to come in way of international artists on our shores.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beautiful stadium and we just want to make sure that it is utilised for both sport and entertainment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite insistent rain bucketing down in Auckland on Friday, Sautner is promising another magical night for Coldplay fans.</p>
        
            <p>He said people had been at the venue since 9am this morning buying merchandise, and there will be around 3000 staff on hand for support.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real carnival atmosphere here," he said.</p>
