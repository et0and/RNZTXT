            <p>Mount Hutt skifield in Canterbury is blanketed with snow on Monday after a chilly blast blew through.</p>
        
            <p>The general manager of operations for Mount Hutt, James Urquhart, said it was not unusual to get some snow about once a month on the mountain, but often in the summer months it is just a skiff, or light dusting, of snow.</p>
        
            <p>He said he woke this morning to see about 5cm of powder on the monitoring webcams.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not going to affect us too long, it'll melt pretty quick. It'll be gone probably by this afternoon. Tomorrow we'll be back to bare rock again, which will be great."</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a bit of a rude awakening for the maintenance crew who have their first day back at work up the mountain on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"They'll be swapping their togs for their puffer jackets," Urquhart said.</p>
        
            <p>However, Urquhart said it was not any sign of of how conditions will be this ski season.</p>
        
            <p>"It'd be nice if we could stock pile it and pull it out when you need it but the ski season is a long way off."</p>
        
            <p>Like many others, he hoped the next couple of months deliver some "proper" summer weather - not more snow.</p>
