            <p>A woman has admitted trying to bash a person to death with a hammer at a shopping centre after seeing a young child eating cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>Sarangi Karamea Jaque-Oddell Lim had just bought the hammer when she began furiously hitting a woman on the back of the head with it.</p>
        
            <p>The 28 year old would later tell police that she wanted to kill the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"I did attempted murder and I don't give a s***," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Lim was eventually charged with exactly that and pleaded guilty to it when she appeared in the High Court at Hamilton on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>According to the summary of facts, on 27 June last year, Lim was at The Base shopping centre in Hamilton where she bought several items including the hammer.</p>
        
            <p>After finishing her shopping, she returned to the car park and saw a child had a packet of cigarettes in her hand and was eating them.</p>
        
            <p>Lim became "angry and aggressive" and started shouting at the woman with the child.</p>
        
            <p>While the woman put the child in the car, Lim retrieved her hammer and "forcefully" struck the woman in the back of the head.</p>
        
            <p>The woman turned and tried to grab Lim to stop her, but Lim hit her again, hard, in the face and head.</p>
        
            <p>Both the victim and Lim fell to the ground, with Lim on top of her and continuing to hit her with the hammer - and her fists - to the head and body.</p>
        
            <p>It only came to a stop when members of the public intervened and dragged Lim off the victim who was bleeding heavily.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was hospitalised with two large cuts to the back of her head and her upper right cheek.</p>
        
            <p>She also sustained large bruises to her back and upper body.</p>
        
            <p>When spoken to by police, and in her initial written statement, Lim said, "I just snapped and hit her ... I bought a hammer from The Warehouse at The Base and when I got back to the car, I hit her twice with the hammer".</p>
        
            <p>When questioned about her intent, Lim said: "to kill with intent".</p>
        
            <p>"She'll be lucky she's still alive," she added in her interview. "So I lashed out today and I don't give a f***."</p>
        
            <p>"I did attempted murder and I don't give a s***."</p>
        
            <p>Lim was convicted by Justice Kiri Tahana and remanded back into custody ahead of her sentencing in June.</p>
        
            <p>A restorative justice conference was also ordered if deemed appropriate.</p>
