        <h2>'A bit of fun' lands ratepayers with hefty bill</h2>
        <p>
A reserve in Tasman has been torn up by motorbikes and although police are speaking with the alleged offenders, the cost of repairs lies with ratepayers.

Appleby Bridge Reserve has been torn up by motorbike riders and will cost about $10,000 to fix, Tasman District Council says.

            <p>Fixing damage caused by "reckless" driving on a Tasman reserve is expected to cost ratepayers thousands.</p>
        
            <p>People driving motorbikes, quad bikes and four-wheel drives bypassed the bollards at the Appleby Bridge Reserve near Richmond and tore up the grass, crushed plantings, and vandalised signs.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of fixing the damage is estimated at about $10,000. This will likely result in the deferral of other reserve projects, or reducing levels of service such as litter bin collection, due to tight budgets, Tasman District Council says.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a total disregard for the public who enjoy these community spaces," said Richard Hilton, Tasman District Council team leader for reserves operations.</p>
        
            <p>Vandalism in council reserves was often perceived as "a bit of fun" at the time, he said: "The damage is more mindless indifference than focused on damaging council and community assets."</p>

            <p>Police have contacted the alleged offenders and while some compensation may be received, the council never recovers the full value of the repairs, Hilton said.</p>
        
            <p>"The other issue is the general public are wary and they avoidâ€¯ these reserves, so in turn this means the reserve potential is lost to the wider community because they give up on it due to the damage," Hilton said.</p>
        
            <p>While repairs are being undertaken at the Appleby Bridge Reserve, council staff are also considering prevention measures, with bollards with steel wire being installed, additional plantings to reduce the open space that attracts vehicle damage, and increased signage.</p>
        
            <p>The damage at Appleby Bridge Reserve came as Nelson's Monaco Reserve also suffered vehicle damage last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Appleby Bridge Reserve has likely received the most damage out of Tasman reserves over the last year, with incidents increasing there over the last 18 months. But other rural reserves with passive open spaces have also been magnets for vandalism, such as the Busch, Wai-iti, and L.E.H Baigent Memorial Reserves.</p>

            <p>While damage had continued to climb at Appleby Bridge Reserve, it appeared to be on the decline at Busch Reserve, Hilton said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of this is related to measures we have put in place to stop the damage, catching the culprits and police intervention, but also people move on - the activity stops."</p>
        
            <p>Tearing up reserves was not the only form of antisocial behaviour being levelled at the council, Hilton said, as reserves staff and contractors also sometimes had to stop their work because of "reckless" actions and conflict from members of the public.</p>
