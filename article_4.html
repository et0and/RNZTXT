        <h2>About 50 jobs to be cut at Pacific Health Service</h2>
        <p>
The proposal brings the total number of redundancies at Te Whatu Ora to more than 2000.

            <p>Another 50 roles are proposed to be cut at Te Whatu Ora, this time from the Pacific Health Service, according to the public sector union.</p>
        
            <p>The health agency has disputed that number, saying the actual number of full-time jobs being removed was 49, leaving 99 roles in the unit.</p>
        
            <p>It said the number did not include roles which were being disestablished but were currently vacant.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after it was revealed on Wednesday that nearly 1500 more jobs were proposed to be cut at Te Whatu Ora.</p>
        
            <p>That was on top of more than 500 voluntary redundancies that had already been accepted. RNZ has tallied 2042 jobs are now gone or proposed to go at the agency.</p>
        
            <p>The Public Service Association said its numbers accounted for vacant roles, and the cuts would result in a slow-down of programme delivery for a year.</p>
        
            <p>"These cuts have been made to meet a budget, rather than the need of communities. These cuts will cause harm to Pacific communities," PSA health spokesperson Sue McCullough said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora declined to comment further, saying it was in the midst of a consultation process.</p>

            <p>The health agency's boss Margie Apa said the organisation was "resetting" and in the next few weeks it would consult with staff on a number of restructure proposals, with more to come in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>"We know working through these changes will be unsettling for affected staff and acknowledge a large number of positions are proposed to be removed," Apa said.</p>
        
            <p>National campaigned on slashing "back-office expenditure" as part of its "Back Pocket Boost" tax plan.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis asked public service departments to identify savings options of either 6.5 or 7.5 percent. Departments that had grown by more than 50 percent since 2017 were allocated the higher percentage.</p>
        
            <p>The changes would strengthen frontline clinical delivery and help Te Whatu Ora achieve national health targets, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said savings "across the public sector" were being reinvested in frontline services and tax reductions.</p>
