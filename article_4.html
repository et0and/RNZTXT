            <p>A Taranaki sunflower grower has had to take security measures (of a botanical nature) to deter would-be selfie-seekers.</p>
        
            <p>Scott Andrews' Huirangi Sunflower Field of 70,000 blooms is open for the public to visit, Friday to Sunday between 10am and 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>However, this year he has resorted to planting a border of maize in an attempt to stop people entering the field outside of those times without permission - often to take photos for Instagram.</p>
        
            <p>"We had people jumping the fence, picking them, taking photos, flying drones over them, that kind of stuff really. It is private property," he told Midday Report on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>It was a hard start to the year for the business already, with slugs demolishing the first crop they planted back in November, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We resowed on December 1 and it's looking good, but normally we would have been open a couple of weeks ago."</p>
        
            <p>To keep trespassers out, this year, he said he had planted a border of maize around the road edge - "you can't see the field now from the road, so I'm hoping it helps from people just helping themselves".</p>
