            <p>An investigation has found the grounding of the Westland Mineral Sands barge Manahau on Carters Beach in August could have been avoided.</p>
        
            <p>The company has completed its independent investigation into the incident, led by Tim Burfoot, a former chief investigator for the Transport Accident Investigation Commission.</p>
        
            <p>The barge ran aground near Westport in a storm and was refloated six days later, before being towed back to Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>The Manahau arrived on the West Coast in mid-August, to begin shipping mineral sands mined at Cape Foulwind from Westport to Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Burfoot's investigation found that it was fit for purpose, equipped with the necessary capabilities and properly supported by the company's shore-based management team.</p>
        
            <p>While the weather and sea conditions had been forecast accurately and sufficient information was available to make informed navigational decisions, the grounding was ultimately avoidable.</p>
        
            <p>His findings indicated that better decision-making by the crew at several key points during the incident could have prevented the vessel from running aground.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Bulk Logistics general manager Mike Stewart said most of the 11 shipping staff from had now returned home and the Manahau remained docked at Port Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>"The repair plan has been submitted to RINA, the international certification body, and the necessary work will take approximately one month once the vessel is in dry dock. Replacement propeller drives will take several months to procure."</p>
        
            <p>Both the Maritime Union and Merchant Service Guild had voiced concerns about the welfare of the Indonesian/Burmese crew aboard the ship.</p>
        
            <p>WMS Group managing director Ray Mudgway said there were important lessons to be learned from the grounding and any operational insights would be used to strengthen future decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>He said the company was "deeply disappointed" that a preventable event had delayed its plans to export mineral sand direct from the West Coast and it was working to return the Manahau into service.</p>
        
            <p>"We have full confidence in the Manahau's capability to provide a sustainable coastal shipping service along the West Coast and we remain committed to the restoration of West Coast ports, which we believe is crucial to unlocking regional resources and enabling the movement of both outgoing and incoming cargo."</p>
        
            <p>Investigations by Maritime NZ and the Transport Accident Investigation Commission are ongoing.</p>
