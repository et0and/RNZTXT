        <h2>Churches look to ditch insurance over high costs</h2>
        <p>
Some Catholic churches are ditching traditional insurance policies - and say the money could be better used elsewhere. Audio
</p>
        
            <p>Catholic churches in Otago and Southland are ditching traditional insurance policies due to skyrocketing premiums.</p>
        
            <p>It was going to cost the Catholic Diocese of Dunedin almost a quarter of a million dollars this year to insure about 50 churches, including Dunedin's St Joseph's Cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>The church now plans to establish a million-dollar trust fund, paying the equivalent of annual premiums directly to that fund to be used in case of disaster.</p>
        
            <p>But it is not actually enough to replace major churches should they be destroyed, and Catholic schools will continue to be covered by insurance companies.</p>
        
            <p>Father Gerard Ansley told Checkpoint the church had seen a steady rise in insurance premiums of about 25 percent a year, every year.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, their premiums were $135,000. This year, they were predicted to be close to $250,000, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, when do you stop?"</p>
        
            <p>The diocese's new plan of ditching insurance came when they looked at the numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't actually afford it. When people give money to the church they're really wanting the church to be doing its work, not to be paying insurance.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably the main driver is that we realised we can't afford not to insure but there are other options."</p>
        
            <p>The church went through a lot of research about what to do. Ansley admits that even a million dollar fund would not be enough to cover all its assets.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not really a self insurance fund," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The million dollar target is, we're working on the idea that if one of the priest's homes in an area was destroyed, then that would be enough to replace a priest's home.</p>
        
            <p>"For most of our churches we would just look for other alternatives, and maybe the fund could be used for demolition costs.</p>
        
            <p>"But in almost every case we would be looking at our church and saying we won't rebuild, we've got another option. A major disaster, of course, we would have to deal with that."</p>
        
            <p>Ansley said parishioners had reacted positively to the idea.</p>
        
            <p>"The response we have had is almost enthusiastically in favour, and I was expecting a lot of backlash."</p>
        
            <p>Each parish independently made its own decision and had agreed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm at St Mary's Basilica in Invercargill, magnificent church. Of course we'd be devastated if it fell down, but if it fell down we wouldn't be rebuilding it anyhow, even if it was insured."</p>
        
            <p>The church could find better uses for the money paid to insurance premiums, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In my parish here last year, the insurance was $26,000. That's a lot of money for a community to be paying and I think the people would see, we could spend that $26,000 doing other things."</p>
        
            <p>Catholic schools will not be part of the change, however.</p>
        
            <p>"Personally I would love to do with it our schools but we are legally obliged by the government to insure our schools."</p>
        
            <p>The insurance paid for schools is even more than for the churches, around $300,000 a year, Ansley said.</p>
