            <p>The artist behind a well-loved Dunedin mural says she has no idea why it has suddenly vanished.</p>
        
            <p>Polish artist Natalia Rak painted 'Love is in the Air' on the side of a Bond Street building in 2015, depicting two people sitting on a bench.</p>
        
            <p>It was recently replaced by a blank blue wall.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, I haven't received any information about the decision to cover my mural. This news has left me feeling a bit sad," Rak said.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that murals in public spaces have a limited lifespan, and the paint fades over time. It's a part of the natural cycle of life and art.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite this, I hold onto the wonderful memories from Dunedin and the warm reception my mural received."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on social media, Dunedin Street Art Charitable Trust said the building's owners made them aware the mural would need to be removed as part of repairs to the wall.</p>
        
            <p>"They indicated they would be keen to host another mural and the [trust] will work with them to do this now the wall has been completed," it said. "We're working together now to come up with options for a new mural on that wall."</p>
        
            <p>Rak said she enjoyed her time in the city and would be interested in returning.</p>
        
            <p>"If the opportunity arises, I will be more than happy to paint another new mural in Dunedin."</p>
        
            <p>The work was part of a wider network of street art throughout the city centre, which the Trust had turned into a street art trail.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Council said the mural was not one of its projects.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to note murals like 'Love is in the Air' are only ever intended to be temporary artworks," a spokesperson said. "Ownership of them sits with building owners and they can remove them whenever they wish."</p>
        
            <p>Sue Dovey, a former Dunedin resident who helped advocate for the artwork, hoped it would be repainted on the building.</p>
        
            <p>Dovey owned an apartment at 5 Liverpool Street (the address of the mural) and lived across the road on Bond Street, where she saw the artwork everyday.</p>
        
            <p>"You can easily see it from the street and through a cafe there. It's really well-known, every day there were people walking past it, people taking photographs of it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The meaning behind the artwork was connected to the local community and the story of how the artwork came to be, Dovey believed.</p>
        
            <p>"The back story may not be well-known. It was a picture of a little boy and a little girl. The little boy had a lollipop and wasn't sharing it with the little girl.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a commentary on how one man objected through the consent process to having this painting being done, basically," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another artwork was originally planned for that wall, but it went on another building when the person who lived in the building objected, sending it to a hearing which pushed it out of the artists' timeframe, Dovey said.</p>
        
            <p>Love is in the Air almost did not happen either, when it also went to a hearing for the same reason.</p>
        
            <p>Dovey had lived in the area, called the Warehouse Precinct, for years.</p>
        
            <p>"It was built up with all these big, old Victorian buildings in the 1860s to 1880s, during and after the Otago gold rush," Dovey said.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the precinct was converted into flats in the early 2000s and became a bit rundown, she said, but there was a noticeable change when the council began consenting street art.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole area is now this very friendly, trendy cafe area with street art all over the place.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be really nice if it could be replaced because it's an important part of the history of Dunedin, that area and the history of that building.</p>
        
            <p>"I can understand why that wall might've been crumbling and needing to be replaced [given how old the building is] but I do hope they replace the street art as well."</p>
