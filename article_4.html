            <p>WorkSafe is investigating an Auckland construction site after a scaffold collapsed and damaged a car.</p>
        
            <p>Area manager Danielle Henry said the 6m-high scaffolding fell onto a busy street about 12.30pm and severely damaged a passing car.</p>
        
            <p>Other cars swerved to avoid the debris.</p>
        
            <p>"It's lucky there wasn't anyone on it at the time and that no pedestrians or drivers were seriously injured," Henry said.</p>
        
            <p>But she said WorkSafe was unable to comment on the specific cause of the collapse, which was still being investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"Scaffolds can be complex pieces of engineering and it's important that they are designed and constructed by suitably qualified and experienced workers.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's collapse had the potential for tragic consequences."</p>
        
            <p>Henry reminded workers to double check any scaffolding on their sites.</p>
