            <p>A woman who arrived in New Zealand from China hoping for a new life was later devastated by the end of her marriage following her husband's affair.</p>
        
            <p>In a state of emotional chaos, Donglan Wu took a knife with a 12cm blade and stabbed the woman who had moved into the family home in West Auckland, while she was left temporarily living in a car.</p>
        
            <p>The woman received lacerations to her arm, a cut to her scalp down to the bone and a deep gaping wound on her neck. She required surgery, spent about three months in recovery and was left with permanent scars on her arm and neck.</p>
        
            <p>Wu, a first-time offender, was sent to prison for five years and three months, on a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and ordered to pay $10,000 to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>She was estranged from her son, and then, late last year, she was served with a notice she was likely to be deported.</p>
        
            <p>The 53-year-old has managed to stave off being sent home, with a successful appeal against a deportation liability notice on humanitarian grounds arising from her mental health history, family circumstances, and Christian beliefs.</p>
        
            <p>The Immigration and Protection Tribunal acknowledged the offending involved serious violence, but the facts pointed to it being an isolated incident at a time in the woman's life when she was suffering extreme psychological stress.</p>
        
            <p>It suspended the liability order for five years, on the condition that Wu did not commit any further imprisonable offence.</p>
        
            <p>Wu's story goes back to rural China where she was raised by her older sister when their mother was required to carry out government-enforced farm work, the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>Wu later worked in a handcraft company and then moved to Guangzhou where in 2001 she met her husband.</p>
        
            <p>She changed her hukou (household registration) to her husband's hukou and began working on his family's farm.</p>
        
            <p>Their son was born in 2003 and four years later Wu's husband left for work in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Wu worked in blue-collar jobs before she and her son arrived in New Zealand in September 2009.</p>
        
            <p>Soon after she learned of her husband's affair. She remained in the relationship because she wanted to keep the family together, the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>The family then moved to Auckland and bought a home and from 2017 to 2019, Wu worked in her husband's business.</p>
        
            <p>Despite her husband's promise to end the extramarital relationship, it continued. Arguments erupted and against a backdrop of domestic abuse and control, Wu became distressed and isolated, the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>A psychologist found later that Wu had experienced a prolonged period of powerlessness in a marriage where her husband had made all the decisions, and then fear of judgement from others when the marriage ended.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, the couple decided to separate but for two years they continued to live in their home in separate rooms.</p>
        
            <p>Wu's husband took steps to purchase her share of the home as she did not have the income to get a mortgage to buy him out.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, during a particularly heated argument, Wu told her husband that she wanted to "make headlines", intending that he stop his "nonsense".</p>
        
            <p>They separated in March 2021. Wu was paid $400,000 for her share of the family home in Massey. She moved out as agreed and the man's new partner moved in.</p>
        
            <p>Wu's accommodation plans fell over and she ended up living in her car for a short time.</p>
        
            <p>One night, she drove past the family home and, in a state of what was described as disassociated rage, she attacked her ex-husband's new partner.</p>
        
            <p>Friends of the couple for around 13 years said in evidence to the tribunal they were shocked to hear what Wu had done.</p>
        
            <p>They described her as a "very gentle person with a warm personality" and they had never witnessed her acting aggressively or abusively towards anyone.</p>
        
            <p>A specialist psychiatrist, Dr John Jacques, who interviewed her later found that Wu was likely experiencing a major depressive disorder with an acute depressive episode in the lead-up to the assault and in the months following her arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Wu said she could not remember her actions but was deeply ashamed and "very remorseful" of the pain and hurt she caused.</p>
        
            <p>"She will regret her actions for the rest of her life," the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>Wu's argument against deportation included fears of a lack of support in China, from either her family members who were poor and ageing, or the state.</p>
        
            <p>Her former husband, as respondent, said otherwise and that it would not be unjust or unduly harsh for Wu to be deported.</p>
        
            <p>He said Wu had $200,000 left of her settlement money with which to establish herself, she had varied work experience and her workplace skills were transferable to China.</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal accepted that Wu had enough money to buy a modest property in a rural area or small centre but it was highly unlikely she could afford to buy even an apartment in a major urban city such as Guangzhou, where she would have to return upon deportation because she was registered on her ex-husband's hukou.</p>
        
            <p>Wu said she was also unlikely to find work in China because of her criminal record and her age.</p>
        
            <p>A Parole Assessment Report said inquiries made with the Chinese New Settler Trust in Auckland advised women over 50 years in blue-collar roles (55 years for office workers) could not work in China.</p>
        
            <p>The tribunal said Wu would not have access to government-funded financial support because she had not contributed through employment.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no free access to public healthcare or social welfare payments. To open a business, in addition to funds, she would need guanxi or a network of relationships," the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>By contrast, in New Zealand, Wu had friends who had offered to accommodate her and who had long-established links to a Christian church community that would act as support.</p>
        
            <p>Wu also wanted to remain in New Zealand to restore her relationship with her son, the tribunal said.</p>
        
            <p>It found there were exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature which made it unjust or unduly harsh for Wu to be deported.</p>
        
            <p>It was also satisfied that allowing her to remain here would not be contrary to the public interest, because of the low risk of her reoffending.</p>
        
            <p>Wu has been in custody since March 2021. Upon her release, she would be subject to conditions until the end of her sentence term in mid-2026.</p>
