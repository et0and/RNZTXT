            <p>England's pre-Christmas series will provide Black Caps fans with their only test cricket of the home summer, with men's and women's white ball matches dominating the calendar.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Cricket released a schedule that comprises 26 Twenty20 and one-day internationals from mid-December to early April, played at eight different venues.</p>
        
            <p>There will be five double-headers featuring the Black Caps and White Ferns, with all of the men's team's T20 matches against Pakistan in March played straight after a women's international at the same venue.</p>
        
            <p>The men's summer starts with the November-December three-Test series against England, which had already been announced, to allow travelling supporters to organise bookings.</p>
        
            <p>A two-week visit from Sri Lanka either side of New Year's Day will comprise three T20s, followed by three ODIs.</p>

            <p>The Black Caps will then fly to Pakistan in February for a tri-series against the hosts and South Africa before heading straight into the Champions Trophy tournament, also in Pakistan.</p>
        
            <p>More short format cricket follows when the New Zealand men return home, with the five T20s against Pakistan, then followed by three ODIs against the same nation.</p>
        
            <p>The Rose Bowl will be up for grabs when the New Zealand women host Australia in an ODI series leading up to Christmas, with all three matches at the Basin Reserve.</p>

            <p>Sri Lanka's visit in March will comprise three ODIs, followed by three T20s, before Australia return later that month for three T20s.</p>
        
            <p>The Black Caps have a heavy test diet for the remainder of this year, leading up the arrival of England.</p>
        
            <p>They face Afghanistan in a one-off test in India in September, followed by two tests in Sri Lanka and three more against the host nation in India.</p>
