            <p>Two men who allegedly flew to New Zealand from Australia to pick up $7.65 million worth of cocaine have been arrested.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tom Gollan said the men were found on 1 June at a commercial address in Auckland's Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>They were arrested after they allegedly attempted to break into a container where 17 kilograms of cocaine had been placed.</p>
        
            <p>Gollan said the men were believed to be members of an organised crime syndicate and that they only came to New Zealand to pick up the drugs.</p>
        
            <p>One man is an Australian national while the other is New Zealand-born but living in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Gollan said they were arrested as they left the container yard on electric scooters.</p>
        
            <p>
The drugs were concealed in a container, police say.

            <p>"They left behind a ladder they had transported to the yards by way of the scooters.</p>
        
            <p>"Both men, aged 33 and 42, have since been charged with burglary and the possession for supply of cocaine."</p>
        
            <p>An investigation has shown the container made its way to New Zealand from Brazil, having transited through Brisbane in Australia before arriving at the Port of Auckland in late May.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the value of the cocaine was $7.65m but it was not known if it was meant for the New Zealand or Australian market.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the 26th TNOC Operational Cell that has been identified and dismantled since 2017," Gollan said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is disconcerting to see overseas transnational organised groups insert their people into New Zealand to facilitate these crimes and demonstrates their willingness to profit from community misery.</p>
        
            <p>"While these TNOC groups continue to evolve and adapt their offending to avoid detection, but so do we, and yet again we were one rung ahead of them."</p>
        
            <p>Customs manager Dominic Adams said the "successful seizure" showed partner agencies like police and Customs are always one step ahead of criminal groups.</p>
        
            <p>"We are ever-vigilant to stopping the harm that dangerous substances such as cocaine can cause our communities."</p>
        
            <p>The two men have appeared in the Auckland District Court and will next appear on 25 June.</p>
