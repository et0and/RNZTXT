            <p>Mega-institute Te Pūkenga is continuing with a multi-million-dollar IT project despite its looming demise.</p>
        
            <p>It said the new finance system will be useful for the institutes that replace it and stopping the project would cause significant cost increases.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pūkenga was created to unite polytechnic-based education and training with work-based industry training and apprenticeships, but the incoming coalition government ordered it in December to stop that work and prepare for disestablishment.</p>
        
            <p>The institute told RNZ it started work on a single finance system for its 25 business divisions in March last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Support, maintenance, and/or replacement of the existing systems over recent years has been poor or non-existent in the former ITP divisions due to lack of investment and resource constraints, with many approaching end-of-life," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Work on a new system began in March 2023 and was well advanced with contractual commitments for three years when Te Pūkenga received the minister's Letter of Expectation in December that year."</p>
        
            <p>Te Pūkenga said it decided to continue building the platform as "it will be fit for any future entity restructure and will enable a faster move to a new structure than the previous 25 finance systems, which have been challenging from a management and reporting perspective, both on a centralised or dispersed model. Any decision not to proceed and retain current system licences would have resulted in significant cost increases".</p>
        
            <p>"This decision was communicated to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) and the minister. The total cost of the project is $13.7 million."</p>
        
            <p>It said the project would provide support and security and streamline finance-related tasks like transactions, reporting, budgeting, and forecasting.</p>
