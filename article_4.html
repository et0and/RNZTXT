            <p>A truck has hit a wall and a blocked lane has led to a buildup of traffic on both SH1 and SH2, the NZ Transport Agency says.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the crash scene around 12.25pm.</p>
        
            <p>The driver had been taken to hospital in a moderate condition and the road is down to one lane, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are significant delays and police advise motorists to avoid travelling in the area if possible.</p>
        
            <p>"It is going to take time to clear the area and a heavy haulage vehicle will be required to remove the truck."</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said the crash was also affecting traffic flows on State Highway 1.</p>
        
            <p>It was also warning of delays as traffic was quickly queuing back to the split between SH1 and SH2 on the Urban Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>In an update just before 1.30pm, it said: "Traffic is continuing to back up on SH1 on both the Urban Mwy and Ngauranga Gorge. Please expect delays of up to 15 minutes when travelling towards Petone."</p>
