            <p>There was anger in the Wellington High Court today at a man who was sentenced in relation to the death of Karori man Rau Tongia.</p>
        
            <p>Tain Tararo was one of six people arrested and charged in relation to the killing on Percy Dyett Drive in the early hours of 20 December 2020.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with possession of a firearm and sentenced to four and a half months community detention and 12 months' intense supervision.</p>
        
            <p>Several members of Tongia's family were gathered in the courtroom during sentencing today.</p>
        
            <p>One lashed out at Tararo and said: "Every day you go to work bro remember though, ok, remember his sons."</p>
        
            <p>"Every day you get to go you look at your little sister and you be thankful for her," a woman said as she burst into tears.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Andru Isac also acknowledged the family during the sentencing.</p>
        
            <p>The judge said that in Tongia's father's victim impact statement, his son's death had ruined his life.</p>
        
            <p>Tongia also left behind three children.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Isac said Tararo was only 19 at the time of the offending and had no previous convictions.</p>
        
            <p>"By your own admission, you were heavily influenced by your partner. At the time you believed the relationship was at risk and you agreed to hide the firearm when she asked you to do so in an effort to preserve the relationship."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Isac said besides cleaning the firearm he did not believe any of Tararo's other actions had been premeditated.</p>
        
            <p>He noted that Tararo helped provide for his mother and younger sister, and was also a patched member of the Mongrel Mob.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm told that being a member of the gang isn't really a priority for you. I sincerely hope so for your sake."</p>
        
            <p>He said, with consideration of factors such as Tararo's age, guilty plea, that he was in full-time work and considered a low risk of reoffending, a community-based sentence was appropriate.</p>
        
            <p>During Tararo's four and a half months community detention, he is allowed out during the day but must be at his address between 8pm and 5.30am.</p>
        
            <p>He also has 12 months of intensive supervision.</p>
        
            <p>The next appearance of others co-accused in the death will be on 13 May 2024.</p>
