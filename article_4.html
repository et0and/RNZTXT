            <p>Hawke's Bay Police have arrested 20 people and laid 100 charges in nine days, following a crackdown on retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>They were apprehended as part of Operation Makipai (Magpie), and will appear in court in the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the charges included multiple cases of aggravated assault, where employees tried to stop offenders and were assaulted in the process.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple search warrants were carried out as part of the operation, but only some stolen property was recovered. Police said that indicated there was a strong receiving market for stolen goods in Hawke's Bay, and that the thieves were likely stealing to order, and exchanging stolen property for other items like drugs.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said their message to offenders was clear.</p>
        
            <p>"If you steal and then assault people in an attempt to get away and avoid arrest we will prosecute you appropriately, including opposing your bail and remanding you in custody where appropriate."</p>
        
            <p>A search at a Taradale Road, Napier property on Thursday resulted in the recovery of items that police would like to return to the shops they were stolen from.</p>
        
            <p>"If you can provide evidence that the items in the photo are from your shop, please contact police and quote file number 231109/9037."</p>
        
            <p>Police said Operation Makipai had now concluded.</p>
