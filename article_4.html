            <p>A fatal New Plymouth fire started on a mattress that was exposed to a naked flame, a specialist forensic fire investigator has told a jury.</p>
        
            <p>Leigh Matthew Frederick Beer is on trial, charged with arson and murder following the death of 21-year-old Emma Field in May 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old is also charged with assault with intent to injure.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleged after an evening of drinking and drug-taking, Beer tipped over a bed which Field was sleeping in, set the mattress alight and left her to burn to death.</p>
        
            <p>Beer has denied the charges, his defence team arguing the case against him is circumstantial and someone else could have lit the fire.</p>

            <p>On Monday, the jury heard from specialist forensic fire investigator, Russell Joseph, who re-constructed the fire scene.</p>
        
            <p>He said based on all known factors, the mattress was set on fire between 10.50pm and 10.53pm "with a naked flame being introduced to a flammable material" long enough that the ignition would be self-sustaining.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleged Beer set the fire using a combination of a cigarette lighter and butane lighter after being left outside the Devon Street West address at 10.46pm by mates who went into town without him.</p>
        
            <p>It said CCTV footage shows him going back into the flat in the divided villa where his partner had earlier gone to bed - upset at his antics at the get-together.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph told the jury he reached his conclusion about where the fire started after systematically ruling out other common sources of ignition including wall sockets, multi-boards, appliances, lights, candles and cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>There was no evidence of an accelerant having been used.</p>
        
            <p>Once alight, he said, the fire would have taken five-to-eight minutes to reach "flashpoint or full fire" but it would have already started to migrate into the hall and towards the flat's second bedroom.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph said there was the potential for Field to have left the bedroom in the first couple of minutes of the blaze, but that "after three minutes it was non-survivable".</p>
        
            <p>It would also have been possible to put the fire out with a fire extinguisher or a fire hose in its early stages, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph's reconstruction, however, showed Field had little chance of getting out of the room.</p>
        
            <p>Field was found on her back facing up at the ceiling while squashed between the exterior wall and the overturned bed and mattress - which she was partially trapped under - and hemmed in by a dresser.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph said people found facing up after fires were either dead before the blaze began or unconscious.</p>
        
            <p>Those found facing down may have made and an attempt to escape.</p>
        
            <p>He did not think Field had tried to escape.</p>
        
            <p>Joseph said the queen-sized bed and mattress could only have been flipped over from the bedroom door side of the room and with quite some considerable force.</p>
        
            <p>This was supported by where the wooden bed slats were found distributed on the bedroom floor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The undersides of the slats were not burned - nor was the carpet under them - which Joseph said was evidence the bed had been flipped before the fire was set alight.</p>
        
            <p>Defence attorney Julian Hannam had few questions for the forensic fire investigator.</p>
        
            <p>But he did want to know whether Joseph could rule out - using patterns of smoke damage - whether or not the front door was closed while the fire was burning for a period of time.</p>
        
            <p>The fire investigator said he could not for a "limited period of time".</p>
