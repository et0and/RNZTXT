            <p>A man has died after a skiing incident at Mount Ruapehu's Tūroa Ski field.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the scene at about 1pm Thursday, but the skier died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>His death has been referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said it has been notified and will be making initial enquiries.</p>
        
            <p>A rāhui will be in place on the ski field till 3pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"The principle of rāhui reflects our tangata whenua ancestral relationship with Mount Ruapehu," Ngāti Rangi said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The rāhui acknowledges the sacredness of our maunga; the sacredness of the loss of life and acknowledges the family's loss.</p>
        
            <p>"This is done by pausing operations to allow quiet time for our maunga to heal these spaces; to uplift the spirt of the deceased and restore the elements to make it safe for visitors to return."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation, which administered the area as part of Tongariro National Park, called it a "tragic loss of life".</p>
