            <p>A Christchurch motel owner says a frightened staff member came to the aid of a critically injured person covered in blood who turned up at reception after being attacked in the street.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating the assault near Aotea Motel on Bealey Avenue shortly after midnight that left blood spattered on the driveway.</p>
        
            <p>Motel owner Manav Sharma said CCTV footage appeared to show the person being chased and attacked nearby, leaving guests to wonder if there had been a gang fight.</p>
        
            <p>"We can see clearly one person chasing the other person. Not a good scene. Literally the person chasing just pushed him down in the middle of the road and then [the attacked person] got up and came over to the motel," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone was thinking of their own safety in the first place and wondering if a gang war had been here, because there was blood everywhere."</p>

            <p>Sharma said the injured person was not a guest, but followed the motel's lights from the street to ask for help.</p>
        
            <p>Their bloody appearance gave his night manager a fright, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When he came to the door the night manager wasn't sure what to do for a split second, we could see the blood everywhere. But within a fraction of seconds they were like, OK the first thing we need to do is call 111 and get some aid to them, their safety is the priority," Sharma said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was fortunate for the guy that he was quick-thinking and followed the lights, came to the reception and that someone was there and was awake, because it was past 12am. Hopefully he is fine, he's in safe hands."</p>
        
            <p>Guests woke to police officers and a crime scene outside their doors this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sharma said he had not seen any sign the violence was gang-related.</p>
        
            <p>Police had finished examining the scene by mid-morning, but a trail of blood could still be clearly seen on the road and footpath leading to the motel.</p>
