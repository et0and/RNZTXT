            <p>Firefighters have now contained a four-hectare grass and scrub fire near Lake Benmore in the Upper Waitaki area of Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says the perimeter has been contained and they are now mopping up hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Incident Controller Michael Harrison said crews were mindful that hot spots needed to be fully extinguished tonight as winds were forecast to increase in the area at the end of the week.</p>
        
            <p>"Crews will also be back in the morning to continue this important work to prevent this fire flaring up again when the fire danger increases," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The fire started in stubble late this afternoon, burnt through paddocks and then moved up a hill into scrub.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today, Fire and Emergency assistant commander Jason Sarich said firefighters were working hard to slow the spread of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said volunteer fire brigades from Twizel, Omarama, Otematata and Lake Tekapo had all responded to the fire, and three helicopters were also responding.</p>
        
            <p>Sarich said initial reports suggested the fire had been sparked by farm machinery.</p>
        
            <p>However, there would be further discussions with the landowner to confirm the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Sarich said farmers and contractors in the area needed to be aware of the high fire risk and that routine activities could cause a spark that would easily set the grass on fire.</p>
        
            <p>He said if machinery work couldn't be deferred then it was best to carry out operations in the early morning, when the temperatures were lower and the humidity was higher.</p>
        
            <p>The whole of the Mackenzie Basin, including the Upper Waitaki area where the fire started, is in a prohibited fire season.</p>
