            <p>Physician associates are accusing doctors and nurses of "ill-informed patch protection" for trying to delay regulation of their profession.</p>
        
            <p>Unions and professional bodies representing doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, along with general practice owners, wrote a joint letter to Health Minister Shane Reti last week, urging him to press pause on plans to regulate physician associates (PAs).</p>
        
            <p>Substituting PAs for doctors or nurses to fill workforce workforce gaps could make patients less safe, they wrote.</p>
        
            <p>But the New Zealand Physician Associate Society said PAs - who have been allowed to practice in New Zealand since 2010 - provided critical support to doctors, helped reduce patient wait times and increased access to healthcare in under-served areas.</p>
        
            <p>President Shelly Collins said there were currently 50 PAs based in 27 clinics nation-wide, working in the same scope of care as their supervising doctors.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge the government to look beyond the vested interests of these professional bodies and consider the evidence and international success of PAs as a valuable part of a comprehensive healthcare solution."</p>
        
            <p>It was important to address both "the inaccuracies presented and the potential underlying concerns these groups may have about shifting roles within the healthcare sector", she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Integrating internationally trained PAs while long-term investments in local training are implemented will help ensure New Zealand's healthcare system remains functional and effective in the short term while building capacity for the future."</p>
        
            <p>The suggestion that PAs should retrain as other healthcare professionals suggested a motive to limit competition and maintain the monopoly of certain professional groups, Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is critical to view these objections for what they are: efforts to maintain existing professional monopolies rather than a genuine attempt to address the healthcare crisis facing New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>A 2010-15 pilot found no adverse patient outcomes across 30,000 patient visits, she said.</p>
        
            <p>According to the society, Cabinet was expected to vote on a proposal to regulate PAs in December.</p>
        
            <p>Gore Health chief executive Karl Metzler, whose organisation has employed PAs since 2012, said the unions' stance was nothing more than "patch protective nonsense".</p>
        
            <p>"You can't go out crying into your hanky about the workforce crisis and then thumb your nose at a solution."</p>
        
            <p>Gore Health would not have been able to maintain the 24/7 emergency department without PAs, Metzler said, adding he would like to see a local training programme running within three to five years.</p>
