        <h2>More education on risks of coastal fishing needed - water safety body</h2>
        <p>
The call for more education comes after a body of one of two men who went missing while fishing from rocks north of Whangārei Heads was found on Friday.

Drowning Prevention Auckland says there are a number of safety measures those fishing off the rocks can take such as going with a friend and knowing how to float.

            <p>A water safety body says more education on the potential risks of coastal fishing activities is needed.</p>
        
            <p>The body of one of two men who went missing on Wednesday while fishing from the rocks at Taiharuru, north of Whangārei Heads was found on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The two men had recently migrated from India.</p>
        
            <p>Drowning Prevention Auckland chief executive Nicola Keen-Biggelaar said the loss of life was devastating.</p>
        
            <p>"Rock-based fishing is often in areas that are remote, very difficult to get to, not understood that conditions can change really, really quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"So if you're not wearing a life jacket, if you're not wearing the right footwear, if people don't know where you are, you really are putting yourself at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Keen-Biggelaar said locals should also be empowered to intervene to check those heading out were properly prepared.</p>
        
            <p>"As a culture, we don't really want to upset someone, we don't want to encroach, we may not think that they could understand us, but I would really love to see us all take responsibility for our local spaces and places that we really understand."</p>
        
            <p>She said new arrivals to New Zealand often experienced an overload of information and many did not prioritise water safety.</p>
        
            <p>After the drowning of two Indian men at Piha last year, Drowning Prevention Auckland has launched a series of initiatives to try to improve water safety in the Indian community.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a life jacket campaign running recently, we advertise on Radio Tarana to try and reach the Indian community more effectively, we've utilised their social media," she said.</p>
        
            <p>No one wanted to see loss of life and their programmes were ongoing, said Keen-Biggelaar.</p>
        
            <p>Drowning Prevention Auckland said there were four key points when undertaking rock based fishing:</p>
