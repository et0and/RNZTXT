            <p>There are severe traffic delays on State Highway 20 after an overheight vehicle hit the Waterview tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>Two northbound lanes were closed.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi NZTA said crews were inspecting the damage to the tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>Long queues were forming as one lane only remained open.</p>
        
            <p>People were asked to delay travel or choose an alternative route.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier three of four northbound lanes had closed because of a serious crash.</p>
        
            <p>They reopened about midday though Waka Kotahi warned delays would take time to ease.</p>
