            <p>Police say there have been no significant issues from a funeral which involved large numbers of Mongrel Mob members in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>The procession started on Thursday morning, going from Cannons Creek, through Tawa, and stopping at Whenua Tapu Cemetery for the service.</p>
        
            <p>The gang members were attending the funeral of a man who died in Tawa last week.</p>
        
            <p>KƒÅpiti-Mana Relieving Area Commander Simon de Wit said about 100 vehicles were involved in the procession from Tawa.</p>
        
            <p>One vehicle was impounded, and one non-operation order was issued. A further 12 infringement notices were issued for driving behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Police said further enforcement action was likely.</p>
        
            <p>Those involved in the funeral had now dispersed, police said.</p>
