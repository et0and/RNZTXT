            <p>Removing free Covid-19 rapid antigen tests amounts to prejudice against those on low incomes, one of the country's leading epidemiologists says.</p>
        
            <p>Until this week, people wanting to check whether they had the virus were able to get RAT tests for free.</p>
        
            <p>Now, they cost about $4 for each test, with a pack of five retailing for upwards of $15.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Baker from Otago University said adding a cost barrier would reduce the level of testing and have flow-on effects.</p>
        
            <p>He told Saturday Morning that low-income people in particular would suffer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be really prejudicing against low-income New Zealanders. So it's going to increase inequity.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that low-income New Zealanders are already having trouble affording the basics. I don't think that the RAT tests will be on that list now, so they're going to miss out."</p>
        
            <p>MƒÅori and Pasifika people already had significantly higher rates of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, even accounting for age differences between the populations, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>Charging for RATs had the potential to exacerbate that.</p>

            <p>He said the move was "reckless" and seemed to be based purely on cost savings.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, he wanted to see "careful analysis" and targeted access to free RATs, particularly for low-income New Zealanders and those with underlying health conditions, to stop cases from overloading hospitals.</p>
        
            <p>"Smart thinking would say 'we have to turn down that tap of cases to protect our health system'... you've got to find ways of preventing those infections, that's the smart way of managing demand on our health system, not just take away essential safeguards."</p>
        
            <p>RATs were "revolutionary" because they allowed people to take control of their health decisions and protect those around them, he said.</p>
        
            <p>For example, people could test as a precaution to make sure they were Covid-free before visiting those at high risk, such as elderly people in rest homes.</p>
        
            <p>RAT testing also enabled timely access to anti-virals for those with underlying health conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Those medicines were only effective if accessed within the first five days of infection, and without testing, many would miss the window, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just going to miss out entirely on this treatment, and then that increases their risk of going to hospital and dying and getting long Covid."</p>
        
            <p>By comparison, the United States has just reinstated free rapid antigen testing across the country.</p>
        
            <p>In announcing the end of the testing scheme in June, Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said "many other countries" had already ceased giving RATs out for free.</p>
        
            <p>Vaccines remained free for those eligible.</p>
