            <p>Five boys, aged between 11 and 13, have been arrested in Auckland after a person was assaulted in their Remuera home on Wednesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Relieving Auckland city east area prevention manager Senior Sergeant David Mayes said police responded to reports of a burglary at a residential address on Ohinerau Street about 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The owner of the property returned home to find five people had allegedly broken into the address and were still inside. When confronted, the suspects have attempted to flee.</p>
        
            <p>"The property owner tried to stop the suspects and was assaulted by one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Mayes said those involved ran from the area, but responding frontline officers, with the help of an Eagle helicopter and a dog unit, found them and took all five into custody.</p>
        
            <p>They have been referred to Youth Aid.</p>
        
            <p>Mayes said the homeowner was taken to hospital as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>"They have since received medical treatment for minor injuries and are now recovering at home."</p>
        
            <p>He said police were providing support to the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand the impact property crime can have however would caution people against taking matters into their own hands.</p>
        
            <p>"In general, the best thing to do is to avoid a confrontation, maintain observations, and call police."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland deputy mayor Desley Simpson was concerned to hear the age of the alleged offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel really sorry for the victim concerned and most concerned that the alleged perpetrators of this crime are children. I think that's a really sad thing.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a bit of shame that crime has come right down to children potentially as young as 11 years of age."</p>
        
            <p>She said this type of crime was unacceptable and had no place in any community, including the community of Remuera.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very concerning when you could come home and you see alleged [offenders] inside your home.</p>
        
            <p>"It must have been traumatic for the homeowner and my thoughts are with them completely."</p>
        
            <p>Simpson encouraged people to make sure their homes and vehicles were secure when going away for the holidays.</p>
        
            <p>"Locking your doors and windows, keeping valuables out of sight, photographing valuable items and keeping them in a safe place... Your vehicles, make sure they are definitely locked or better still, garaging and parked in well-lit areas.</p>
        
            <p>"I think also let your neighbours know what you're doing. Talk to your neighbours, see who's staying, who's going away. Arrange for someone to clear your letterbox and have your gardens up to date, so it doesn't look as if they're completely unkempt when normally they aren't."</p>
        
            <p>She said if anyone saw any suspicious activity they should take note of a vehicle registration.</p>
        
            <p>"It's always better to take the information and it not be needed than the other way around."</p>
