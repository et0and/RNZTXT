            <p>New Zealand's transport agency is asking drivers to check the safety ratings of their cars.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi has updated its safety ratings for most car models based on recent real-world accident data from across New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        
            <p>The ratings judge the likelihood of injuries in a crash.</p>
        
            <p>The agency's principal safety advisor Todd Wylie said a lot of people did not realise how unsafe their vehicles were.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a star rating system, with five stars being the best and one star being the worst," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 40 percent of our fleet are one- and two-star rated vehicles, and we know that those vehicles are highly over-represented in crashes.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that occupants of five-star vehicles are more than twice as safe than they are in  one star vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>The overall safety rating a vehicle received took into account how safe a vehicle was for both its occupants and for other road users, Wylie said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some vehicles obviously look after their occupants really well, but they can actually be really aggressive against other vehicles that they come into contact with."</p>
        
            <p>It was a "common misconception" that safe vehicles cost more, Wylie said.</p>
        
            <p>"Safe vehicles are available in most price ranges."</p>
        
            <p>But he said new vehicles entering the fleet were "generally safer".</p>
        
            <p>"As well as providing better protection for their occupants in a crash, they also have an increased amount of crash avoidance features."</p>
        
            <p>However the age of a vehicle did not necessarily determine its safety rating.</p>
        
            <p>"There are safer cars that are older, and we just really encourage people to check the safety rating of their own vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>Wylie said drivers could check the safety rating of their vehicle - or any vehicle they were interested in purchasing - on the government's Rightcar website.</p>
