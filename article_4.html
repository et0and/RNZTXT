            <p>Labour Party leader Chris Hipkins is speaking to the media after visiting the Sustainability Trust, which offered the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme in the Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>The programme, which was put in place in 2018 by the former Labour government, has been scaled back by the current government.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme covers up to 90 percent of the costs to purchase and install insulation and an efficient heater for homeowners.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
