            <p>Southland's regional council says more funding is needed now to boost flood protections as the region grapples with ageing infrastructure and more frequent extreme weather.</p>
        
            <p>This week marked the 40th anniversary of the 1984 Southland floods, which forced thousands of people to leave their homes, made 1200 homes unliveable and killed more than 12,000 stock animals.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill was cut off by land and some residents had to wait more than a week before they could go back home due to flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The state of emergency lasted weeks, ending in late February with about $55 million paid out in insurance claims.</p>

            <p>Environment Southland said the 1984 floods were a catalyst for extensive flood protection upgrades and maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>But further investment was needed now and into the future as some of the network was at least 30 years old and it was coming under pressure from more frequent and intense weather, the council said.</p>

            <p>Work was underway on the Waihōpai River stop banks to meet the rise in intense sea levels in the Kōreti New River Estuary, and was nearing completion in Wyndham and Mataura.</p>

            <p>Environment Southland chairman Nicol Horrell said the floods last September were another reminder of how important it was to maintain and invest in the region's flood protection network.</p>
        
            <p>"Environment Southland has been working on government co-funded climate resilience projects to upgrade some of the flood protection network, to help ensure towns in our region are more resilient to the challenges of a changing climate."</p>
        
            <p>The different projects including the creation of a 30-year infrastructure strategy would improve resiliency in the face of climate change, he said.</p>

            <p>Residents would soon be able to have their say on future funding during the council's long-term plan consultation.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Southland said flooding was one of the most common natural hazards in Murihiku Southland, and people could sign up for high river watch and flood warning alerts using the Antenno app.</p>
        
            <p>Residents could use the council's website with its natural hazards portal to work out the flood risk for their area.</p>
