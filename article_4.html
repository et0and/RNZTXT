            <p>An Air New Zealand plane has been hit by lightning en route to Bali and has been forced to return to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft landed back in Auckland safely, and is now undergoing standard engineering checks.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand Flight NZ64 which was travelling from Auckland to Denpasar was hit by lightning before being diverted back to Auckland, as a result flight NZ65 from Denpasar to Auckland has also been cancelled, Air New Zealand said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the airline's head of flight operations Hugh Pearce said lightning strikes were not uncommon.</p>
        
            <p>Aircraft were designed with this in mind, and pilots trained for this scenario, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand is now working to re-accommodate customers in both Auckland and Bali on the next available flights.</p>
