            <p>A man has been arrested in relation to the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Kyle Jenkins on a Northland roadside last week.</p>
        
            <p>The accused appeared in the Whangārei District Court on Tuesday morning on a charge of murder with a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>The 20-year-old was granted interim name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>He did not enter a plea and is next due in the High Court at Whangārei on 21 February.</p>
        
            <p>Jenkins' body was found in a creek next to Otaika Valley Road - or State Highway 15 - on the morning of 29 January.</p>

            <p>They appealed to the public to come forward with any information about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>Police working on the investigation, code-named Operation Distant, had set up a dedicated online portal at distant.nc3.govt.nz so people could upload any footage or photos.</p>

            <p>Otaika Valley Road was closed for almost two days following Jenkins' death, which police initially described as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>Friends have left a tribute at the layby, attaching 'Kyle' in painted wooden letters to a guard rail between the layby and the creek.</p>
        
            <p>Jenkins' funeral is on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Maungatapere teenager is understood to have worked in a café in central Whangārei.</p>
