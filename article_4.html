            <p>Organisers say good weather is making for a strong response to this weekend's Countrywide Whale and Dolphin Count.</p>
        
            <p>All over Aotearoa, people are watching the waters for a glimpse of marine mammal activity to contribute to the fifth annual survey.</p>
        
            <p>Event organiser Christine Rose of Cetacean Spotting NZ says exciting reports have been received so far of orca, pygmy blue whales, humpbacks and dolphins.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kapiti coast is normally pretty good. Kaikoura, the Waitemata, Hauraki Gulf are lovely with whales and dolphins. But even more remote places on the Far Northwest coast and even the south coast of the South Island, southern right whales and humpbacks are down there right now."</p>
        
            <p>She says the count serves to provide a snapshot of the animals' activity, as well as building public awareness of the cetaceans.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had humpback reporting in various parts around the country, from the Kapiti coast to the Kauri Coast and, of course, of Kaikoura, where you know, it's a really great whale watching spot, so we've had reports from there as well."</p>
        
            <p>Cetacean Spotting NZ says people can share photos on social media, tagging Whale and Dolphin Watch NZ and partners we.are.tohorƒÅ before 1 July to be in the draw for prizes.</p>
        
            <p>If sea animals are not your thing, there was also a bird count underway.</p>
