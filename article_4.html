            <p>A little blue penguin who swam more than 160 kilometres has found a new home in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The juvenile kororā was found injured from a dog attack on the shore of Kaikōura, having swam from Matiu/Somes Island near Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>He was rescued by the Christchurch's International Antarctic Centre but sustained significant damage to his right eye, which had to be removed.</p>
        
            <p>"He survived quite a long swim across the Cook Strait," general manager David Kennedy said.</p>
        
            <p>"Little blue penguins nest on the shorelines and dogs, if they're off their leads, will find them and attack them."</p>
        
            <p>Penguins rely on their vision to hunt for food, leaving the brave adventurer unable to fend for himself.</p>
        
            <p>Kennedy said staff were able to track his journey via his band number: P-52049.</p>
        
            <p>Now he has been given a new name, Matiu - decided by a Facebook poll - and a new home at the International Antarctic Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Matiu will have plenty of fun friends in his new habitat, Kennedy said.</p>
        
            <p>"They've all got their own characters, every day we ask our penguin keepers what the latest soap opera news is from the habitat."</p>
