            <p>A road safety expert has lambasted a surge in road signs being smashed and vandalised in Canterbury's Selwyn district over the past few weeks as "utter stupidity".</p>
        
            <p>He says motorists are being put in increasing risk after more than 150 road signs were damaged or vandalised on local roads, particularly in the Malvern area.</p>
        
            <p>The swell of sign smashing is putting pressure on police and local officials as tens-of-thousands of dollars worth of damage costs tick up for ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>Selwyn District Council said instances have surged since December, the recent headache estimated at more than $30,000.</p>
        
            <p>Ninety percent of signs defaced include Stop and Give Way signs and other permanent warning signs, including "curve and intersection warning" signs.</p>
        
            <p>Council head of operational delivery Gareth Morgan said a lack of new posts and the high volume of damaged signs had resulted in damaged posts being reinstated as a makeshift solution.</p>
        
            <p>"While this may appear as a suboptimal solution, it ensures that the signs remain visible until our contractors can return with new posts and, in some instances, new signs," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond the financial impact, damaged signs pose a significant risk to road users who rely on them for crucial safety information"</p>
        
            <p>Automobile Association (AA) Canterbury/West Coast Council national chairperson John Skevington said the fact it was happening on country roads was even more dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"What have people got to gain?</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe they need to sit and think about the consequences of removing signs in country intersections.</p>
        
            <p>"They're hard enough to see at times anyway."</p>
        
            <p>He suggested the culprits' actions could be putting their own family members at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"What if [their] own family was hurt or killed just because of one of these stupid actions.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is horrendous, country intersections are getting a lot of attention at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"This increases the risk by about 80 to 90 percent, particularly in the dark."</p>
        
            <p>The council said tampering with the signs could have "severe consequences" and lead to life-threatening situations.</p>
        
            <p>The district's police were regularly reporting missing signs, but identifying those responsible remained a difficult task.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they respond to reports of wilful damage as they arise.</p>
        
            <p>"Theft of or damage to road signs is particularly concerning, given the risk it poses to road users."</p>
