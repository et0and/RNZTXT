            <p>Thieves have stolen $75,000 worth of road safety fences from a suburb on Auckland's North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>More than 60 panels have been stolen from on top of a newly built retaining wall in Albany, between Silver Moon Road and Gills road.</p>
        
            <p>Around 50 fence panels were stolen at the end of last year and more were taken last week, said Auckland Transport.</p>
        
            <p>"The large black metal pool-like fencing panels would require at least two people to dismantle, and their removal would have required a vehicle and taken a fair amount of time," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>They said 10 panels were also stolen from a recently repaired site on Glenvar Road in early November.</p>

            <p>Upper Harbour local board deputy chairperson Uzra Casuri Balouch said the panels were there for pedestrian safety.</p>
        
            <p>"The appalling theft of these panels has put the public's safety at risk, as these fences were protecting pedestrians from the drop-off of a steep embankment," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We're disgusted by the actions of these thieves, and all the thefts have been reported to the New Zealand Police, and the incidents are currently being investigated."</p>
        
            <p>Getting the fences installed took a lot of effort and advocacy from the community, Balouch said.</p>
        
            <p>"More and more you're hearing about these things," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if it's the cost of living crisis, people are stooping to this behaviour, it's disappointing."</p>
        
            <p>A few residents saw the thieves, Balouch said, but they believed they were contractors as they wore high-vis jackets.</p>
        
            <p>Balouch hoped someone would come forward with information.</p>
        
            <p>"They're not small panels, they will turn up somewhere to be sold, melted, so somebody somewhere, in Auckland or whereever, knows that some stolen panels have arrived."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not immediately aware of reports of stolen fencing, but were looking into reports referenced by Auckland Transport.</p>
