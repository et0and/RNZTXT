            <p>KiwiRail has sent in drones to check on damage to a partially collapsed rail tunnel on the West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>The Tawhai Tunnel, south of Reefton, has been closed since 15 June due to a partial collapse.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said a digger operator carrying out planned maintenance on the tunnel on 15 June noticed some crumbling, and exited the tunnel safely before the collapse occurred.</p>
        
            <p>The tunnel was immediately closed.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail's regional infrastructure manager for the South Island, Gary Ikin, said they had begun assessing the damage by sending drones in to get pictures and scan the tunnel to check for any movement.</p>
        
            <p>He said a detailed physical inspection was required to understand the extent of the damage, and scope of repair of the 370m long tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>"Safety is our priority and we need to develop a re-entry plan, which then needs to be approved. This work is underway and we will be liaising with WorkSafe NZ on it."</p>
        
            <p>Ikin said their engineers have also started working on potential remediation options, which would be informed by the outcome of the physical inspections.</p>
        
            <p>He said he could not provide a timeframe for when the tunnel will reopen.</p>
        
            <p>The line was not used for passenger services, and KiwiRail said it was working with affected freight customers.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding," said Ikin.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working closely with them to keep their coal moving to Lyttelton. Coal is now being road bridged from their mines and being loaded onto our coal trains at Ikamatua and Stillwater.</p>
