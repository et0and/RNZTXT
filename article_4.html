            <p>Kiwi musician Finn Andrews and his band The Veils are among the first artists announced for the next Womad festival in New Plymouth in March.</p>
        
            <p>The Veils will team up with classical musicians - Amalia Hall, Ashley Brown, and Somi Kim - of NZTrio in a "special collaboration" at the festival at Brooklands Park.</p>
        
            <p>The UK's Nitin Sawhney - who pulled out of the 2024 event at the last minute due to a medical emergency which prevented him travelling - is also due to appear at next year's festival.</p>
        
            <p>An acclaimed musician, composer and producer, Sawhney is famed for his eclectic and genre-crossing work, which blends Indian music with jazz, dance, R&B, rock and everything in between.</p>
        
            <p>Born in 1964, Sawhney - who studied accountancy - was originally a comic before moving into music in 1993.</p>
        
            <p>A multi-award winner, he has released at least 13 albums and written scores for numerous films, TV series and stage productions.</p>
        
            <p>From Trinidad and Tobago, reggae powerhouse Queen Omega promises to command attention.</p>
        
            <p>Noted for her sumptuous voice and conscious vibe, she combine roots reggae, Caribbean, jazz and soul sounds and has been touring extensively this year.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's folktronic act Amaru Tribe round out the early announcements.</p>
        
            <p>Melbourne-based - but with Colombian roots- they promise a collision of South American, Caribbean and tropical influences.</p>
        
            <p>The Womad Festival will be held at Brooklands Park and the Bowl of Brooklands, New Plymouth, on 14-16 March.</p>
