            <p>A staff member of the University of Auckland is the only one to remain in hospital following a crash on Symonds Street on Monday, that hospitalised three people initially.</p>
        
            <p>A witness earlier told RNZ that the car had swerved as it drove along Symonds Street, before it mounted the footpath, and hit pedestrians and a tree.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, the police said one person remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>The university confirmed that a staff member is still receiving treatment in hospital, while several other injured students are recovering at home.</p>

            <p>"The University is offering its support services to staff and students affected by this incident," a spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>A 20-year-old was arrested on Tuesday and is due to appear in court later this week on three counts of careless driving causing injury, and is forbidden from driving.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told RNZ he saw the car swerving down Symonds Street, before veering onto the pavement outside the university's engineering school.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ a person was sent flying, and another was trapped under the car.</p>
