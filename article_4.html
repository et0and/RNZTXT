            <p>Warning: this story discusses suicide and mental health.</p>
        
            <p>A friend and colleague of Pauline Hanna says she confided that Philip Polkinghorne was sexually demanding and "liked her to stay slim."</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is on trial in the High Court in Auckland, accused of murdering Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>His defence claims Hanna's death was a suicide, but the Crown alleges it was staged.</p>
        
            <p>Clare Thompson, who worked with Hanna at HealthSource before her death, described their friendship.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a lot to do with each other during those last five years, we worked very closely as colleagues, peers, and became friends," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had coffee together and we had the occasional dinner together."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson described Hanna as a high achiever.</p>
        
            <p>"She was immaculately dressed, presented professionally.</p>
        
            <p>"For Pauline it was all about the community she served and she wanted to do the best work for the community."</p>
        
            <p>She described one occasion in which Hanna came into her office in tears while Polkinghorne was away in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in my office and Pauline came to see me, she was very upset and tearful. She had been trying to contact Philip," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"His phone was going to voicemail and she worried he had a romantic relationship with someone and was siphoning money to prepare for a separation."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said Hanna had seen about $2500 leave her bank account, which Polkinghorne had access to.</p>
        
            <p>"She said Philip had [previously] asked her to sign forms she didn't understand... When she asked what they were before he had become evasive.</p>
        
            <p>"She was worried he was doing something underhanded [and] that she wouldn't be able to access that money."</p>
        
            <p>Hanna seemed distraught at the thought of Polkinghorne seeing another woman.</p>
        
            <p>"She came to see me a couple of days after and the Northland incident came up again," Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>"[Hanna told me] that it was nothing new... that Philip always liked women, and while he was away she had broken into his laptop and found a picture of him with another woman."</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne's lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC, asked if Thompson was aware that Hanna and Polkinghorne had both previously participated in group sex.</p>
        
            <p>"Were you aware that prior to [this conversation], sexually their relationship involved partners from outside of their relationship?" he asked.</p>
        
            <p>"No I wasn't."</p>
        
            <p>"Were you aware of trips to Sydney where they would both participate in group sex?" he continued</p>
        
            <p>"That she would see male sex workers on her own?"</p>
        
            <p>"No."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said she and Pauline Hanna last met in person for dinner on 23 March 2021, about two weeks before her death.</p>
        
            <p>"We met at an Italian restaurant down at the waterfront, Pauline spoke to me about how Philip had become quite demanding sexually.</p>
        
            <p>"She said he had taken to coming into her room demanding sex in the morning."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said she knew the couple slept in different rooms.</p>
        
            <p>"She told me previously they had slept in separate rooms for about two years, she wasn't sure if that was connected with Philip's disinterest or that he didn't love her.</p>
        
            <p>"She said the relationship wasn't great, but she couldn't see herself on her own. [She] didn't want to be on her own, she wanted to be married. She said they had carved a very nice life for themselves."</p>
        
            <p>Asked to comment on Hanna's eating habits, Thompson said she kept herself on a diet to remain slim.</p>
        
            <p>"She mentioned the fact there was an expectation to stay slim, that Philip liked her to be slim.</p>
        
            <p>"She was picking at her food and I asked are you still hungry and she said 'yes I'm always hungry'."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson's last communication with Hanna was over text.</p>
        
            <p>"She wished me a happy Easter and that she hoped I was having a relaxing weekend. I responded, but I didn't hear back from her."</p>
        
            <p>Thompson said she understood Hanna and Polkinghorne were in a difficult financial position due to losses at Auckland Eye, where Polkinghorne worked.</p>
        
            <p>"Pauline said during Covid they had lost money... shares in Auckland Eye, and that was increasing Philip's stress.</p>
        
            <p>"She had bought [clothes] and Philip was upset, he [told her] she wasn't to go spending money on her own. Pauline said while she had access to her own money, she was restricted in what she would spend."</p>
        
            <p>Margaret White, another friend of Hanna who worked with her at the Counties Manukau DHB, said she once received an alarming text from Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>"The year before, she had messaged me. [We were] working on something for the next day: 'Sorry I can't work on it today, Philip's become beastly'," she recalled.</p>
        
            <p>"She was very upset... She wanted me to know that if anything happened, and I just remember those words and thinking 'Oh heavens above'. No indication during the call that he was being physical with her, but it was clear that he'd become enraged."</p>
        
            <p>White said Hanna and Polkinghorne's relationship was inconsistent.</p>
        
            <p>"He would disappear, and she would say to me 'He's gone'," White said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then he'd return and he'd be loving and she'd be unbelievably forgiving... When they were good Pauline was so happy, but it didn't last."</p>
        
            <p>She further described Polkinghorne's sexual demands.</p>
        
            <p>"She commented that she felt old and actually not attractive enough for her husband to want to be with her and only her," White said.</p>
        
            <p>"She remarked on a number of occasions that he expected [sex] every morning. She would say she would just lie back and just pretend she was sleeping. Then he would bring her marmalade on toast."</p>
        
            <p>White said she knew Hanna had participated in group sex with Polkinghorne on one occasion, but believed she was not a willing participant.</p>
        
            <p>"She indicated on this occasion that he expected her to partake so she drank a bottle of wine and went along with it," she told the court.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't think it was good for her. I thought she deserved better."</p>
        
            <p>The trial resumes on Monday.</p>
