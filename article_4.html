            <p>The road toll for the Christmas holiday period just ended is on track to be the lowest in years.</p>
        
            <p>The unconfirmed toll currently stands at 13, compared to 22 last year and 19 the year before that.</p>
        
            <p>That figure may increase, however, with one person still in a critical condition on Thursday night after a crash near Morrinsville, and a number of crashes around the country overnight.</p>
        
            <p>They include a single-vehicle crash in Havelock North about 10 pm on Thursday, when a car went down a bank, killing one person and seriously injuring two others.</p>
        
            <p>If the toll was confirmed, it would be the lowest since Christmas 2020, when 11 people died on New Zealand roads during the holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>The official holiday period started at 4 pm on Christmas Eve and ended at 6 am Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, the road toll for the year just ended was also well down on previous years.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Ministry of Transport, the provisional toll for 2024 was 291 - the lowest since 253 deaths were recorded more than a decade ago in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The worst-ever toll was recorded in 1973 when 843 people died on New Zealand roads, at a time when the country's population was significantly lower than it is now.</p>
