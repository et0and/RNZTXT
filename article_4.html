            <p>Several fire crews have attended a fire in an abandoned building which has been destroyed in the blaze in the Levin town centre.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it was alerted to the fire just before 4am today. Crews found a two-storey building on Bath Street well involved when they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said, at its peak, six fire appliances, a ladder truck, and a command unit attended from six fire stations.</p>
        
            <p>Now two fire trucks are attending and one crew will be present for much of the day.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the building was scheduled for demolition and the fire was being treated as suspicious.</p>
