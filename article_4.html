            <p>Police have made two arrests as they continue to monitor a gang gathering in Nelson this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the Mongrel Mob Barbarians have arrived in the area from around the country and are expected to stay until Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Officers monitored vehicles and motorbikes as they disembarked from the ferry on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>One person was arrested for displaying gang insignia on Thursday and another for driving while suspended, when he was stopped at a checkpoint in Pelorus.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said it was pleasing gang members have largely chosen not to wear their patches to the gathering at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere in the country, three others were arrested for wearing gang insignia in public.</p>
        
            <p>Two were in Auckland - one on Hobson Street in the city, the other in Avondale. The other was on Customhouse Street in Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>"All three will appear before the courts in due course," Assistant Commissioner Paul Basham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, police around the country continue to report good levels of compliance with the new laws."</p>
