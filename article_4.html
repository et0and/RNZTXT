            <p>Fire and Emergency says a major blaze at a Hamilton boat storage building is now under control, and a warning about toxic smoke has been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out at 5.30pm at a building on Te Rapa Road, and a large cloud of smoke drifted towards Rotouna and Chartwell.</p>
        
            <p>An Emergency Mobile Alert was sent to warn residents to stay inside with their windows and doors closed to avoid the smoke.</p>
        
            <p>This warning was lifted just after 9pm.</p>
