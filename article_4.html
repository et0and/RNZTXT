            <p>Five people have been hospitalised after a crash in the Auckland suburb of Bucklands Beach overnight.</p>
        
            <p>St John responded with five ambulances, two rapid response vehicles and an operations manager just after 1am on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were taken to Middlemore Hospital in a serious condition, and a fifth with moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>And in the southern North Island, State Highway 2 was closed near Kaitoke, Upper Hutt, after a serious two-car crash near the intersections of Gilbert Road and Waterworks Road.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported around 5am, New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) said.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 2 was closed between Gilbert Road and Waterworks Road, blocking access between Upper Hutt and Featherston.</p>
        
            <p>"This closure will be extended to cover all of Remutaka Hill, Kaitoke-Featherston," NZTA said. "The highway is expected to remain closed for several hours while the crash is cleared, and a police serious crash unit investigation is completed.</p>
        
            <p>"Drivers must follow the instructions of emergency services at the scene. Road users are asked to avoid the area, delay their journeys, or use an alternative route."</p>
        
            <p>Driving between Wellington and Wairarapa could take up to an extra three hours, NZTA said.</p>
        
            <p>It has since reopened, but with a potential backlog of traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Police said one person was taken to hospital in a serious condition, and two with minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>There were also delays on State Highway 59 near Pukerua Bay, with a crash blocking the southbound lane.</p>
        
            <p>"People travelling between Paekākāriki and Porirua should use State Highway 1 as an alternative route."</p>
