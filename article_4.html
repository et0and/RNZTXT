            <p>The same man had also been charged with two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm relating to two other men at the party.</p>
        
            <p>He was jointly charged with his associate, a 26-year-old Gisborne man.</p>
        
            <p>The latter man had been charged with four counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm relating to the four men assaulted at the Lytton Road party, including the two deceased.</p>
        
            <p>The men's court appearances were yet to be confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Police liaison officers continued to support the whānau of the deceased and the victims recovering from their injuries, de Lange said.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a very complex investigation, and our investigation team members have worked hard to get answers for the grieving whānau and friends, and the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>The team appreciated the help they had received from colleagues in other police districts, and from people who were at the birthday party and had come forward with information.</p>
