            <p>A threatening phone call that plunged three Gisborne schools into lockdown on Thursday was a hoax, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>Lytton High School, Riverdale Primary and Campion College all went into lockdown just before school pick-up time after Lytton High received threats via phone.</p>
        
            <p>Parents were told not to collect their children while the matter was resolved.</p>
        
            <p>The lockdowns were all lifted by 3.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, TairƒÅwhiti area commander Darren Paki said police had identified the number the call was made from and spoken to a youth connected to the number.</p>
        
            <p>"We are satisfied that the call is a hoax and there are no ongoing safety concerns for the school or community.</p>
        
            <p>"I commend the work done by the local schools, they all handled the situation with a high degree of professionalism, and I also want to praise the calm manner in which they went about keeping their school community safe."</p>
        
            <p>Police were also speaking to another young person about the matter, which would be referred to Youth Services, Paki said.</p>
