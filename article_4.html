            <p>A large fire at a factory in the Auckland suburb of Ōtāhuhu has now been contained.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were called to the building on McGee Street about 3.20pm on Friday and found it well ablaze.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen trucks and two support vehicles were battling the blaze at its peak, and are still on site dampening down hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the area are advised to keep their windows and doors closed.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists are asked to avoid the area and use any signposted diversions to allow emergency services access to reach the site.</p>
        
            <p>Train services were suspended between Middlemore and Ōtāhuhu because of the fire, which was very close to railway lines. Commuters should check with Auckland Transport about the status of services.</p>
