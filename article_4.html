            <p>Police have detailed some of the "inappropriate" requests for help during mental health callouts that they will no longer be responding to.</p>
        
            <p>A briefing shows they told health officials recently they will refuse "inappropriate" requests under a pullback on mental health from November.</p>

            <p>Police plan a four-phase pullback between November and in to next year.</p>
