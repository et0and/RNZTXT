            <p>More than 100 army soldiers took part in a historic parade in Canterbury on Thursday as the 2nd/1st battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment received new King's and Regimental Colours.</p>
        
            <p>Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro presented the Colours (ceremonial flags) on behalf of King Charles at the Burnham Military Camp.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time the flags had been presented to any New Zealand Army unit since 1997.</p>
        
            <p>2/1 RNZIR Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Sam Smith said it was a significant honour for the battalion, the army and Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"This day is marked as well by an incredibly important aspect that we are getting eight new battle honours emblazoned onto our Colours from our military history which has not been done for these units before.</p>
        
            <p>"Today we are getting battle honours from the New Zealand Māori Contingent, the New Zealand Māori (Pioneer) Battalion, 28 (Māori) Battalion and 27 (Machine Gun) Battalion," he said.</p>

            <p>Smith said the Colours reflected the army's lineage and history.</p>
        
            <p>"Colours in history were the rallying point for a unit or a battalion. So they would go into battle marched in by a junior officer and the battalion would form and work around them to fight against the enemy, so incredibly precious and sacred items at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"As time progressed they started deploying them to the field and in operations less and less until they became very much a regimental thing. But the battalions and the units themselves still went and fought overseas and in wars and they lost people. In World War I and World War II multiple people died in those battalions, and so these Colours now represent those battles where we lost our people across New Zealand or the British Empire."</p>

            <p>Doug Reid, who is 102, is the last known surviving member of 27 (Machine Gun) Battalion.</p>
        
            <p>He was unable to attend the parade on Thursday due to his health, but his son Douglas Reid and grandson Bruce Reid were there on his behalf.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very disappointed that he can't be here, he was really looking forward to coming. For Dad this is really significant," Douglas Reid said.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce Reid said the recognition of his grandfather's unit's battle honours was wonderful.</p>
        
            <p>"He tells me he landed in Egypt when he was 21, he's walked the length of Italy, and it's had a massive impact on how his life formed after the war. It was just the thing you did when you're 19 back in 1941.</p>
        
            <p>"He's a great guy, he's a character, he's really humble. It's massive for us to be here."</p>
        
            <p>Tā Robert 'Bom' Gillies, KNZM, is the last surviving member of 28 (Māori) Battalion, and served at the battle of Monastery Hill.</p>
        
            <p>He was also unable to attend the parade due to health, but his grandson Te Whanoa Gillies was there.</p>
        
            <p>He said his grandfather fought all through the Italian campaign and was also knighted by the Italian government.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a huge recognition for them, very proud and happy to be here to represent for him. I know the family back home in Rotorua will be watching.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty stunning having to get up and inspect [the Colours], seeing it up close and personal was pretty cool, beautiful flag and it's been stitched very well, it's good to be here and celebrate it," Te Whanoa Gillies said.</p>

            <p>Lieutenant Colonel Sam Smith said the addition of these new battle honours was a significant step in recognising the service of the units.</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged it had taken a long time to get to this point.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a lot of history with this, the battle honours board was convened this year to look into why some of this has taken a long period of time and we're now at the point where we have the King's approval to do so and we are able to address the time it has taken. Hence why today is quite a significant day for us to support and enable our full history to be told," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Honorary Colonel 2/1 RNZIR Major General (retired) Evan Williams said the new Colours were the work of embroiderers based in the United Kingdom.</p>
        
            <p>He said the process of sewing and piecing together the flags was very specific and significant.</p>
        
            <p>"The stitching is absolutely intricate. It is all hand-stitched, all the battle honours and the lettering and the images are very, very detailed. The colours that we are farewelling today have lasted 44 years, so that gives you an indication of the durability and resilience that is put into these," Williams said.</p>
