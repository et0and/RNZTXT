            <p>Extra water is being released from the Waimea Community Dam over the next three days.</p>
        
            <p>The release will test two large dispersing valves designed to release water from the reservoir during dry periods.</p>
        
            <p>The dam, which was completed last May, can hold 13 million cubic metres of water when full.</p>
        
            <p>Waimea Water CEO Mike Scott said the two large cone valves have the capacity to release 10 cumecs, which is about the same as a typical winter flow.</p>
        
            <p>Water has been flowing from the dam through a small dispersing valve since early March.</p>
        
            <p>When the extra water is released from this afternoon, there will be a noticeably rapid rise in the water levels in the Lee, Wairoa and Waimea rivers.</p>
        
            <p>Scott strongly advised people to be cautious and stay away from the rivers over the next few days, adding that they should not sit or park close or enter the river while it is elevated and discoloured.</p>
        
            <p>Once the valves are verified, the dam will be fully commissioned.</p>
