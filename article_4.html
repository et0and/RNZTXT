        <h2>Northland's fire ban eased as rain arrives</h2>
        <p>
The decision means outdoor fires can only be lit with fire permits authorised by Fire and Emergency, returning Te Tai Tokerau to a restricted fire season.

            <p>Fire and Emergency has ended the temporary fire ban in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>The decision, enacted Monday morning, means outdoor fires can only be lit with fire permits authorised by Fire and Emergency, returning Te Tai Tokerau to a restricted fire season.</p>
        
            <p>Northland district manager Wipari Henwood said cooler and damper conditions meant it was less likely a fire would get out of control.</p>
        
            <p>The region is under a heavy rain watch, with a low pressure system expected to hit the upper part of the country from Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The restricted fire season covered all of Northland - including the Muriwhenua area, where restrictions were in place all year round.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation land on islands around Northland was subject to a total fire ban at all times of the year.</p>
        
            <p>A restricted fire season means anyone who wants to light an outdoor fire needs a fire permit, which can be applied for at checkitsalright.nz.</p>
