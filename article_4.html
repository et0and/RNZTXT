            <p>The man who sparked a man hunt after murdering Mongrel Mob member Daniel Eliu, 46, at a South Auckland church has pleaded guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas Tahitahi shot Eliu, also known as "Sa-dan", in December 2022 on the grounds of the Papatoetoe Seventh Day Adventist Community Church on Puhinui Road.</p>
        
            <p>About 200 people were at the event at the church.</p>
        
            <p>Tahitahi, who is a Head Hunters patched member, was on parole and was released from prison a month before before the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>He drove to the church from his home in Massey, west Auckland, before picking up another person from Point England along the way.</p>
        
            <p>He walked onto the church grounds with a semi-automatic .22 hidden under a black jacket, court documents show.</p>
        
            <p>Tahitahi fired six shots at Eliu in quick succession, from less than a metre away.</p>
        
            <p>He was arrested 10 days later on 27 December 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Eliu was given urgent first aid but died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Tahitahi appeared at the High Court in Auckland today where he entered a guilty plea for the murder charges.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Geoffrey Venning remanded the man in custody until his sentencing in mid-August this year.</p>
        
            <p>Eliu had spent time in prison, and was the president of the Notorious Chapter of the Mongrel Mob.</p>
