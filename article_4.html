            <p>Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were taken into custody early this morning after an incident involving a stolen car ended with two people fleeing and attempting to hide, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā North Area Prevention Manager, Senior Sergeant Roger Small says at about 2.10am an off duty officer noticed three cars quickly drive off from outside a property in Huapai, north-west of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The officer noticed broken glass on the road and contacted police immediately, Small said.</p>
        
            <p>Police saw three cars, one stolen, travelling on Mahi Road, Helensville a short time later and all three took off quickly when they noticed the police car, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have elected not to pursue and maintained observations on the vehicles."</p>
        
            <p>Small said two of the cars were then spotted by a second police unit travelling southbound on State Highway 1 and a police helicopter monitored them heading westbound onto State Highway 18, before taking the Squadron Road off ramp.</p>
        
            <p>"Two passengers from the vehicle then fled and attempted to hide but were quickly located and taken into custody without incident.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle was spiked but carried along Hobsonville Road until it lost control and the driver, and two remaining occupants, ran through properties on Suncrest Drive, before being taken into custody by Delta."</p>
        
            <p>A 20-year man was charged with burglary, unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and reckless driving.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in Waitākere District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>A 14-year-old was due to appear in Waitākere Youth Court today after being charged with unlawfully getting into a motor vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Two teenagers, aged 15 and 16, were referred to Youth Aid Services.</p>
