            <p>Predator Free Wellington are aiming for a pest-free Newtown and Ōwhiro Bay by the end of 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The push is part of the groups wider project that aims to eliminate pests across the entire Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>The project is split into five phases covering different regions across the capital:</p>
        
            <p>The first phase of the plan was completed in November 2023 and has seen the number of native birds in the area almost double since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout this year Predator Free Wellington (PFW) volunteers have been trapping from Kilbirnie through Hataitai, Evans Bay, Mount Victoria and up to the border for Newtown.</p>

            <p>Project director James Willcocks said they've laid around four thousand bait stations and traps this year.</p>
        
            <p>"By the time we finish with phase two when we get out to the South Coast there in Ōwhiro Bay, we think that's going to look like 14,000 individual devices."</p>
        
            <p>Willcocks told RNZ they'd reached their goal of getting to the Newtown border by this Christmas -- eliminating pests from 405 hectares of land this year.</p>
        
            <p>"That includes Rongotai, Kilbirnie, Lyall Bay, Houghton Bay, Evans Bay," he said.</p>
        
            <p>They are looking forward to launching into the suburb of Newtown in the new year.</p>
        
            <p>Willcocks said they want to have the area south of Mount Victoria to Ōwhiro Bay cleared of pests by the end of next year.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a huge goal when you consider the complexity, you know you've got the urban density of Newtown, we've got Wellington regional hospital with thousands of vehicle movements a day, we've got the zoo in there as well."</p>
        
            <p>This will provide training for phase three when they go into similar urban areas such as Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place.</p>
        
            <p>He said a challenge for the organisation is maintaining the predator-free status of the land they have already cleared.</p>
        
            <p>This was made evident in December 2023 after a male stoat was sighted within Miramar Peninsula, an area previously declared pest-free.</p>

            <p>Using cameras and traps, Predator Free Wellington was able to track down the rogue stoat by July.</p>
