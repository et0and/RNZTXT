        <h2>Police cars, helicopter swarm Auckland suburb</h2>
        <p>
A man has been arrested after residents in Onehunga recorded what appeared to be a car chase involving a dozen police cars.

            <p>Residents in the Auckland suburb of Onehunga have recorded what appears to be a car chase involving a dozen police cars.</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted by an anonymous member to the Onehunga Community Facebook, twelve police cars can be seen pursuing another car.</p>
        
            <p>In a comment on another Facebook post, one resident said they were nearly hit by the fleeing car outside the Onehunga Mall.</p>
        
            <p>Another poster said they saw "20 police cars chase a dude on his rims around Onehunga mall road, helicopter, bikes, cars, the whole lot."</p>
        
            <p>Police said one man is now in custody after officers located a vehicle with mismatching plates.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was seen travelling city-bound on the Northwestern Motorway just before 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Kerry Watson said officers approached the blue Subaru in Western Springs shortly after but the "driver took off from police at speed on Great North Road towards Pt Chevalier."</p>
        
            <p>He said police cars did not give chase, instead the police eagle helicopter was used to monitor the "vehicle's erratic and dangerous driving behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was driven across numerous central Auckland suburbs and the CBD, before heading towards Three Kings and eventually Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>Spikes were deployed on several occasions, puncturing the tyres of the fleeing car.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 3.30pm, the vehicle entered the car park at the Dress Smart shopping centre in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff blocked the vehicle in before taking the male driver into custody," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>Three police vehicles were damaged while attempting to stop the vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"It is pleasing that this matter has been concluded without putting anyone in further harm's way," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The man is now in police custody and charges will follow in due course."</p>
