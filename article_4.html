            <p>On Sunday, the Malaysian government confirmed five Malaysian students were involved in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry and High Commission of Malaysia stand ready to assist should the next-of-kin decide to repatriate the remains to Malaysia."</p>
        
            <p>The University of Canterbury said it was "deeply saddened by the passing of two of our students at Pūkaki this weekend".</p>
        
            <p>Vice-chancellor professor Cheryl de la Rey, in a statement, said two of the university's students were also injured in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>They are in a stable condition in Christchurch Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be working directly with Ōtautahi Christchurch's Malaysian community to ensure they have the support and help they need."</p>
        
            <p>De la Rey encouraged students and staff to prioritise their wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with those involved in the emergency service teams, and members of the public, who responded to the scene."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the New Zealand International Students' Association said their hearts ached for those affected by the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"This heartbreaking event has deeply impacted not only the families and friends of the victims but also the wider Malaysian student community in New Zealand," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"We extend our sincerest condolences to the families and friends of the victims. We grieve with you during this difficult time."</p>

            <p>The road toll this Easter weekend has been everything police do not want to see on the roads, they say.</p>
        
            <p>"Up and down the country, road policing staff have seen drivers overtaking on congested roads, speeding and taking unnecessary risks," says Superintendent Steve Greally.</p>
        
            <p>"Seven people have lost their lives and several others are seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>That's seven families that will never see their loved ones again, seven Easters ruined and seven avoidable deaths."</p>
        
            <p>A further three people have died in crashes in Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>"A crash where people are dead or seriously injured is a horrific scene, and I cannot but commend the staff that respond and serve with utmost professionalism," said Greally.</p>
        
            <p>In Waikato, police were urging drivers to be mindful of agricultural vehicles, which often travel slower that other vehicles on open roads.</p>
        
            <p>Three crashes involved tractors on Saturday and police were asking motorists to be patient and only pass when it was safe to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Federated Farmers Dairy chair Richard McIntyre said a challenge for tractor drivers was pulling over safely for traffic to pass.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes build-ups could be caused because some drivers lacked the confidence to overtake a tractor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police in Bay of Plenty, Southern and Canterbury districts also wanted their drivers to take it easy.</p>
        
            <p>"Slow down - we can't say it any other way.</p>
        
            <p>"Speed is a top contributor to serious injury and death in a crash, and with the Easter Weekend traffic and roadworks, speeding is the last thing anyone should be doing," said Greally.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists should also be taking the conditions into account as they head home today, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In some areas the weather is beginning to turn.</p>
        
            <p>"Sunny Nelson is having one of three bad weather days of the year and we ask anyone travelling in that area to drive to the conditions."</p>
