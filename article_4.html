            <p>Police have searched hospitals and schools across the country after threats were made against a number of organisations.</p>
        
            <p>They have searched Wellington and Bowen Hospital in the capital and Burwood Hospital in Christchurch. RNZ understands police have also been at Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>However, Te Whatu Ora is reassuring people it is safe to attend hospitals as usual.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education confirmed Auckland's Saint Kentigern College was evacuated as a result of the threatening email.</p>
        
            <p>It would not reopen until police have given clearance.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Isabel Evans said they understood the anxiety incidents such as these caused for school communities and ministry offices were open for schools which needed assistance.</p>
        
            <p>Late this afternoon the ministry said it was aware of only one school that received an email threat today.</p>
        
            <p>Evans said St Kentigern College was the only one it knew of to receive an emailed threat.</p>
        
            <p>Some students were sitting NCEA exams at the time, she said.</p>

            <p>NZQA has confirmed around 170 students at St Kentigern were meant to sit exams today and may be impacted by the school's evacuation.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy chief executive Jann Marshall said the impact on students will differ depending on the individual but all will be able to apply for derived grades.</p>
        
            <p>She said other Auckland schools accommodated some Saint Kentigern students to sit exams this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Those students will be awarded the better of the grade they received in the exam and the derived grade supplied by the school.</p>
        
            <p>The safety of students and staff was a top priority, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Each school has its own processes for handling a security lockdown, and these apply during the exam period.</p>
        
            <p>"Students who are unable to sit an exam, or whose performance is impaired because of a security incident, can apply for a derived grade, or their school may apply for derived grades at scale to apply."</p>
        
            <p>PPTA acting president Chris Abercrombie said the primary concern of schools would be ensuring the safety of staff and students.</p>
        
            <p>Police said staff were working with those impacted and would respond based on individual circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>"Police acknowledge how unsettling these emails are for all concerned. We'd like to thank all involved for their cooperation as we investigate these emails."</p>

            <p>Te Whatu Ora's national director for hospital and specialist services Fionnagh Dougan confirmed some hospitals received an "email of concern" earlier today.</p>
        
            <p>"[It] was immediately referred to police for further investigation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff have followed police advice and we are remaining vigilant. Our hospital sites have remained open and all services are continuing.</p>
        
            <p>"Members of the public with appointments at our hospitals or needing emergency treatment should be assured it is safe to attend their local hospital as usual."</p>
        
            <p>Bowen Hospital in Wellington received an email about an unconfirmed threat at 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>The private hospital's management took the threat as serious and enacted safety protocols.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, chief operations officer Stephen Johnston said police were immediately informed.</p>
        
            <p>He said that once on-site, officers did a thorough sweep of the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Johnston said police have confirmed Bowen Hospital is safe.</p>
        
            <p>Medical procedures and any disruptions to patients and staff were avoided, he said.</p>
        
            <p>EAP support is being offered to Bowen Hospital staff impacted by the threat scare.</p>
        
            <p>On 26 July 2022, some North Island schools went into lockdown and moved students off site after receiving phone threats.</p>
        
            <p>Threats were made to five schools in Waikato, Thames Coromandel and Gisborne districts, police said.</p>
        
            <p>No specific risk was ever found.</p>
        
            <p>The next day, bomb threats were made to four schools and at least a dozen the next, causing widespread disruption with many of the schools having to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>The Principals' Federation said those threats originated from an overseas cyberbot.</p>
