            <p>New Plymouth homeowners can expect residential rates rises averaging 9.9 percent if its draft 10-year plan is adopted.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Neil Holdom released his recommendations for the $3 billion draft plan today which included an investment of about $1.9b in water and transport infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>New initiatives included identifying a route for a ring road around New Plymouth to reduce the number of trucks on its streets and planning a second bridge over the Waiwhakaiho River to improve resilience.</p>
        
            <p>New sources of fresh water were also on the agenda.</p>
        
            <p>Holdom said the draft plan focused on investment in core infrastructure designed to future-proof the district but was wary the organisation was grappling with the ongoing impacts of global economic turmoil that had seen costs skyrocket for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a draft plan which we want people in New Plymouth district to read and understand. Then we want to hear what the people we serve think about our plans, what are our community's collective priorities and aspirations and where people believe we could do better."</p>
        
            <p>Holdom said the council was focused on finding a balance between the need to keep rates affordable with investment in critical infrastructure and initiatives that help keep the district on course to achieving its vision of a Sustainable Lifestyle Capital.</p>
        
            <p>"The global fiscal downturn, construction inflation at record levels, interest rates rising, and the cost-of-living crisis has put huge pressure on everyone, and we have to strike the balance between rates affordability and the need to adequately maintain and grow our core infrastructure to service current and future generations.</p>
        
            <p>Improving efficiency, growing non-rates revenue and delivering measurable environmental performance would also be a focus.</p>
        
            <p>"Council is restructuring to align our organisation with our strategy. These changes will ensure we are set up for the changes coming, can better deliver services and investments in our core infrastructure while achieving operational efficiencies of around $100 million over the next 10 years."</p>
        
            <p>Based on the councils current proposals, an average residential rate increase of 9.9 percent was identified in year one, and around 6.9 percent in year two, but the Holdom warned that was to change as tough decisions were made on what stayed in or came out of the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We are reassessing our priorities, taking a more commercial approach by considering where can we generate more non-rates revenue, capture the benefits of growth, work in partnership with mana whenua and deliver better long-term community outcomes."</p>
        
            <p>Council would make interim decisions on the draft plan next week before approving a draft consultation document in February which will go out to the public the following month.</p>
        
            <p>The Mayoral recommendation for the next 10 years is built around five objectives:</p>
        
            <p>Future-proofing our district:</p>
        
            <p> Efficiency</p>
        
            <p> Community development</p>
        
            <p>Sustainability</p>
        
            <p> Paying something forward</p>
