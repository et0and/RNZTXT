            <p>Forty-four percent of New Zealanders plan to spend less over the holidays, a new survey by Westpac shows.</p>
        
            <p>Just 16 percent plan to spend more, and the rest plan to spend the same as last year.</p>
        
            <p>With Christmas around the corner, shoppers like Ben were feeling the pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to reduce where we can," he said. "[We're] not going away, we're staying at home. Just being less extravagant with kids' toys and presents."</p>
        
            <p>He said other living costs took priority.</p>
        
            <p>"For us, it's mainly been mortgage rate rises," Ben said. "It's costing us about $12,000 more a year."</p>
        
            <p>John had similar concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"Mortgage rates, [there's] more money going out," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rather than multiple presents for the children, it's just one or two decent presents. There'll be less under the tree."</p>
        
            <p>Wilga said her family planned to skip the Christmas ham.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything's so expensive," she said. "Christmas lunch is just ordinary now because there's too many of us."</p>
        
            <p>Johnathan said his paycheck was not going as far as it used to.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not a present-buying kind of guy, but definitely with food ... maybe going to Countdown instead of Farro," he said, referring to the high-end grocery chain in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"Inflation has been around 8 percent, I think I'm probably in the majority of people who only got a 2 percent pay rise [this year], so that's a cost of living increase."</p>
        
            <p>Maia was cutting down on her expenses to save more for gifts.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just in between jobs at the moment, finished university and about to start a job, so I'm not really floating in a sea of money," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Less going out to see friends, or going for alternatives rather than going out for a drink or coffee."</p>
        
            <p>Tom said his family saved on presents by doing a gift exchange.</p>
        
            <p>"We do a Kris Kringle in my family, I think if there's eight people you [can] do a Kris Kringle or a Secret Santa you just buy one gift per person," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Westpac consumer banking and wealth acting general manager Helen Ryder encouraged people to be mindful with their money.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of customers who are really thinking about their holiday spending and making some quite sensible decisions around it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we found there was a segment of customers who didn't have a plan yet."</p>
        
            <p>She said there were plenty of ways to cut costs without sacrificing the joy of Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"Decorations really stood out ... reusing those is really good and quite a sustainable option," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're hosting, getting people to bring some food with them so you don't have one person bearing the brunt of that."</p>
        
            <p>Ryder said it was okay to take the celebrations down a notch.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just about having a plan and potentially involving your family," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a conversation about what sort of gifts you're going to buy, how much you're going to spend, just to get everybody on the same page."</p>
        
            <p>She said Christmas was about spending time with family, not money.</p>
