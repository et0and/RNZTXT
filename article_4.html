            <p>A case of measles has been confirmed on Auckland's Waiheke Island.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora said a person with measles went to several locations on the island, a popular destination for tourists.</p>
        
            <p>The two locations visited while the person was infectious were Oneroa Four Square on five separate visits daily from 5 November to 9 November between 3.15pm and 8.30pm and a Unichem Pharmacy on 10 November between 11am and 12.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone in these locations at those times is urged to check they are vaccinated or are immune to measles, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The person with measles and those most at risk of catching it were now in quarantine, Te Whatu Ora said.</p>
        
            <p>"The person with measles has travelled recently to Asia where they are thought to have caught the virus but was not infectious while flying home."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone potentially exposed should watch for symptoms, and if they develop any, stay home and contact Healthline immediately on 0800 611 116 and stay home until they receive advice from public health services.</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms to be aware of included a high fever, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes in the early phase, followed by a rash beginning on the face and gradually spreading down the body to the arms and legs. The rash can last for up to one week.</p>
        
            <p>Medical officer of health Dr Lavinia Perumal said the new case was an important reminder to check if you and your whānau are immune to measles.</p>
        
            <p>"Measles is a serious and highly infectious illness, which can affect adults as well as children and babies.</p>
        
            <p>"The MMR vaccine is the only thing that prevents measles.</p>
        
            <p>"Being immunised not only protects you, but also those around you from becoming seriously ill and from spreading the disease to others, including friends, loved ones and people in your community."</p>
        
            <p>A person was considered immune if they had two doses of the MMR vaccine, Perumal said, or if they had lived in New Zealand before 1969.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone unsure if they had been given two doses of the vaccine could safely be immunised again, Perumal said.</p>
