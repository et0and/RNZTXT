            <p>A homicide investigation following the death of a man who was attacked in Porirua earlier in December is underway.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Kotuku St in Elsdon in the early hours of 1 December, to find 43-year-old Sean Remnant with critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>He later died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Remnant's death had previously been treated as suspicious, but on Tuesday police said they had launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>No charges have been laid, and police wanted to hear from anyone with information, CCTV or dashcam footage around the Kotuku St area that could help the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are continuing to work through a range of information to determine what occurred," they said.</p>
