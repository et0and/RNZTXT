            <p>A person has died in a house fire in Whitby, Porirua, and a second person hospitalised in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>A dog also died in the blaze, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour told RNZ the people who lived in the home were from a tight-knit family who had lived in the area for years. They were lovely, private people, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour said an elderly couple lived in the house.</p>
        
            <p>They said one of the couple had just retired and the other had a recent cancer battle.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's reporter at the scene said the fire had been extinguished.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the Lanyon Place address about 2.20am on Thursday. Eight crews fought the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Just before 8am, Fire and Emergency were still at the scene dampening down hot spots and investigating the house which was unstable.</p>

            <p>A neighbour who got teary while speaking to RNZ said he was not sure who died, but was saddened by their death.</p>
        
            <p>"They were retired, I'd say around the 70ish mark, I guess. But they were nice and friendly, and we always had a chat and the little dog used to sniff through the gate at my little dog, you know ol' Billy the puppy," they said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite living next door he did not hear anything happening, and was shocked to wake up to all the emergency crew on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour also did not hear the fire, but woke up to smoke coming off the roof of the house around 5:30am.</p>
        
            <p>"We were worried about people in the house."</p>
        
            <p>He described the neighbourhood as a quiet and friendly street.</p>
        
            <p>"People will be shocked about it with this sort of thing happening."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were providing support to the family of those involved.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency investigators and police will carry out a scene examination to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
