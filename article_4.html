            <p>Another bout of bad weather is on its way for the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain is expected to hit the west and central areas of the South Island from Thursday morning - lasting until early Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The warning comes after a state of emergency was declared in Westland at the weekend, after rain caused flooding and slips.</p>
        
            <p>It has since been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said a low system is moving back across the country bringing rain with it.</p>
        
            <p>As a result severe weather warnings have been issued for the western ranges and the north-western parts of the Tasman District.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll find that wet weather sticking with us through the day ... I think we'll find that wet weather transfers onto the North Island for tomorrow."</p>

            <p>For Westland around 130 millimetres to 160mm is forecast for the highest parts which while not "high end" will be worth keeping an eye on because it would be faling on already soaked ground.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, temperatures across the board all over Aotearoa will be higher than usual - around 14-15 degrees Celsius, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>For Christchurch's Show Day tomorrow Law is forecasting "a decent one".</p>
        
            <p>However, for those in Taranaki, Bay of Plenty and Auckland some heavy rain can be expected.</p>
