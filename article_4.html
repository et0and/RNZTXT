        <h2>Te Huia supporters concerned funding for service will not continue</h2>
        <p>
Advocacy groups say the train service is "developing well", but the transport minister says it's one of NZ's most heavily subsidised public transport services.

            <p>Supporters of Te Huia - the Hamilton to Auckland train - are planning public meetings over concerns the service will not be funded from July.</p>
        
            <p>However, the prime minister and transport minister will not attend, saying it is a matter for Waka Kotahi/NZ Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>The public transport and rail advocacy groups said they were concerned the government had not earmarked funding for the service from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>The service was launched on 6 April 2021 for a five-year trial.</p>
        
            <p>Public Transport Users Association (PTUA), Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), and The Future is Rail groups have called two public meetings, with the first on 4 May.</p>
        
            <p>Their message to the government was unequivocal: "The Te Huia train must remain operational and be funded to complete its full five-year trial period at a bare minimum," PTUA chairperson Niall Robertson said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the current government did not seem to understand the true value of rail and public transport.</p>
        
            <p>"Thirty percent of the population rely on public transport for mobility and social connectivity. This investment is not questioned in most countries."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson pointed to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon previously calling Te Huia a "white elephant" and said Luxon "doesn't get it".</p>
        
            <p>"Te Huia is developing well. We want it to go forward and prosper further with upgraded trains and new stops like Pookeno.</p>
        
            <p>"Not extending funding will be a significant backward move for people, the economy, and the environment."</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged Luxon and ministers to attend the meeting so the group could explain the benefits to them.</p>
        
            <p>However, both Luxon and Transport Minister Simeon Brown said they would not attend.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said funding for Te Huia was a matter for the Waka Kotahi/Transport Agency board.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was concerned Te Huia was one of the most heavily subsidised public transport services in the country, costing taxpayers $90 per person for each leg of their journey.</p>
        
            <p>CBT's Jodi Johnston said rail reduced congestion, emissions and pollution.</p>
        
            <p>It also made travelling safer, both for motorists and those on the train, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The Future Is Rail Hamilton coordinator Georgie Dansey said with Hamilton now New Zealand's fastest growing city, it must remain connected to Auckland for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Huia and the increase of good public transport options supports the move to a low emissions economy and contributes to New Zealand reaching our climate goals.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Waikato communities need an affordable, low-carbon option to get to work and school and Te Huia provides that."</p>
        
            <p>She said patronage of Te Huia was steadily growing, with more trips being added to support increased use.</p>
        
            <p>"Shortening the agreed to five-year trial period does not give our commuter train a fair go, and if stopped, will instead put more cars on the road, reducing accessibility, increasing congestion and contributing to road pollution," Dansey said.</p>
        
            <p>The meetings will be held in Hamilton this Saturday at 2.30pm at The Ramada By Wyndham, and on 12 May in the Pokeno Hall, Pookeno, at the same time.</p>
