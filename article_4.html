        <h2>Boil water notice remains for Clutha District</h2>
        <p>
Flooding throughout Otago last weekend overwhelmed several water-treatment plants in Clutha District.

            <p>More than 2000 residents in Clutha, Central Otago are still being asked to either boil water or conserve it because of critical damage to the district's infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Flooding throughout Otago last weekend overwhelmed several water-treatment plants there.</p>
        
            <p>Clutha District Council deputy chief executive Jules Witt said water-treatment plants were running again, but it would take time for a supply of the treated water to build up.</p>

            <p>The Kaka Point and Richardson South rural water schemes were both low, he said, so conserve-water notices were in place.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are two that are particularly low, and they've had very low levels in reservoirs for a number of days now, so people may well be getting short of water there."</p>
        
            <p>Households on the Tapanui, Stirling and South Bruce supplies were still under boil-water notices.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be a little bit longer for the boil-water notices [there], because once the water's up to spec, it takes time for it to be flushed through the whole system as well."</p>
        
            <p>Witt said tankers were available for drinking water in communities with short supply.</p>
