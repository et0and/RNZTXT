            <p>Police say the seizure of nearly $15 million in assets after a decade-long investigation deals a notorious Auckland gang a significant blow.</p>
        
            <p>A judge at the High Court in Auckland issued profit forfeiture orders to Head Hunters president Wayne Doyle on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The orders included nearly $275,000 in cash and the Head Hunters' East chapter headquarters on Marua Road, which police restrained in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Also forfeited were properties in Freemans Bay, New Lynn and Mt Wellington, money held in two bank accounts and a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the orders were one of the most lengthy and complex proceedings every undertaken by the Asset Recovery Unit.</p>
        
            <p>"I am delighted with today's decision, which is substantial and deals a blow to the operations of the Head Hunter's largest chapter, based in east Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Coster said the orders confirmed Doyle held a powerful position within the Head Hunters.</p>
        
            <p>"This decision confirms what police have long known in that Mr Doyle sits at the pinnacle of the Head Hunters, and holds an extremely influential position," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mr Doyle set up the East chapter of the Head Hunters so as to promote, and profit from, the criminal offending of its members who pay a portion of their ill-gotten gains directly to him."</p>
        
            <p>The decision found the Head Hunters were an organised criminal group, with members engaging in drug dealing and violent property offending for profit, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This sends a very clear message to all gangs and organised crime groups profiting from the misery they create in our communities - police will come for you."</p>
