            <p>Auckland locals are fuming about the the loss of some public bins across the city.</p>
        
            <p>The council has removed nearly 1500 bins across the city.</p>
        
            <p>It said the move was a money saving exercise but residents were not convinced, and are now asking what they are supposed to do with their rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>Some bins on the Devonport waterfront have disappeared.</p>
        
            <p>Used by dog walkers, weekend and cruise ship visitors - several of the public bins are no more.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola was walking her dog Maddie along the waterfront on Wednesday afternoon, and said it was a crazy decision.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a great inconvenience, I can't understand what great costs it would be to keep them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It surprises me."</p>
        
            <p>She said the bins were frequently used.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a great shame, because I personally use them all the time, and I can't understand why, what costs would be saved," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Penny Kelly was also out dog walking and said a lack of bins could lead to more mess.</p>
        
            <p>"I know there are certain sectors of dog owners who may pick up the poo but they won't take it home, so you'll have little packets all along the way, tucked in trees," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it's a good idea."</p>
        
            <p>Another local said the bins were needed.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's terrible, I don't agree with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council acting general manager of parks and community facilities Jennifer Rose said the initiative was designed to save money.</p>
        
            <p>"Council had some savings targets to meet, and [as] part of those savings targets, we looked at rubbish bin optimisation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a governing body decision that was made to reduce the number of bins that we have to help with some of those savings."</p>
        
            <p>Rose said they had removed about 1400 bins so far.</p>
        
            <p>"We had over 10,000 bins, and at the end of the optimisation project we will be reducing by circa 3000," Rose said.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll still have 7000 bins once it's optimised."</p>
        
            <p>She said the bad feedback had been marginal.</p>
        
            <p>"Generally, we haven't had floods of negative feedback coming through," Rose said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do get the odd thing through Facebook, where somebody's not as happy about a bin being removed."</p>
        
            <p>She recommended those with rubbish drop it in the next available bin, or take it home to sort out and properly throw away.</p>
