            <p>A Christchurch man and his company are facing charges relating to what Internal Affairs claims would be the largest illegal lottery ever identified in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It was alleged the defendants made $11,125,466.65 over a year from selling illegal lotteries online, with prizes such as expensive cars and boats.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement the DIA said under the Gambling Act 2003, prizes that exceed $5000 can only be conducted by a not-for-profit society for authorised purposes and required a class 3 gambling licence.</p>
        
            <p>This was to "ensure the integrity of the operation and protection of participants".</p>
        
            <p>Following a referral from DIA, police have taken action in the High Court against the defendants, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>DIA gambling director Vicki Scott said: "Our strict licensing requirements are there for a reason. We will not hesitate to respond firmly when we see instances of illegal gambling such as unlicensed online lotteries."</p>
        
            <p>"We have no tolerance for those who seek to profit by bypassing the rules."</p>
        
            <p>Charges the man and his company face are conducting illegal gambling, promoting illegal gambling, and making a pecuniary gain from illegal gambling under the Gambling Act 2003 (the Act).</p>
        
            <p>They appeared in the Christchurch District Court on Thursday afternoon.</p>
