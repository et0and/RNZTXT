            <p>The European Union Parliament has voted to ratify the New Zealand-EU Union Free Trade Agreement, but there's still a way to go before it comes into force.</p>
        
            <p>The deal was set to remove 91 percent of tariffs on New Zealand goods into the EU from day one of coming into force, eventually rising to 97 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It did not go as far as beef and dairy farmers would have liked and would require some domestic producers to eventually stop using names such as 'feta' or 'proseco'.</p>
        
            <p>The EU Parliament voted in favour of ratification with 524 votes in favour, 85 against and 21 abstentions - the largest majority in favour of any EU trade agreement since 2011.</p>
        
            <p>But there were still more steps in the EU ratification process and the deal was yet to be ratified in New Zealand too.</p>
        
            <p>However, New Zealand International Business Forum executive director Stephen Jacobi told Morning Report it was still a noteworthy step.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just got to get on now and do the ratification through our parliamentary process here in New Zealand once the Parliament gets back to work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobi said he was surprised by the wide margin of the European vote.</p>

            <p>"The agreement, while it's very good in a number of aspects, for some of those key agricultural products, like dairy and beef, it doesn't offer a lot of liberalisation.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure the European farmers were opposed to it but it probably didn't translate into a lot of votes in the Parliament."</p>
        
            <p>Such give and take was part of trade deal negotiations and this was a very modern deal, Jacobi said.</p>
        
            <p>"To reach 450 million consumers, as it's going to do for us, we had to give a little more than we're used to."</p>
        
            <p>He did not believe this would be the last big deal New Zealand would sign and said there was a "busy" trade agenda ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be different though because the world is becoming more protectionist and inward looking.</p>
        
            <p>"This is another factor for the EU, this is the first trade agreement that they've signed for some time."</p>
        
            <p>Negotiations on the NZ-EU agreement concluded on 30 June 2022 and the agreement was signed on 9 July 2023 in Brussels.</p>
        
            <p>It was expected to come into force by the middle of 2024, once it was fully ratified by both sides.</p>
        
            <p>International Trade Committee chairman Bernd Lange said he was proud.</p>
        
            <p>"Because in this global world of fragmentation, we managed to agree on the most progressive and sustainable trade agreement by the European Union ever. This is a big success."</p>
        
            <p>International Trade Committee member Daniel Caspary said it was a good day for the EU and "global rule-based trade".</p>
        
            <p>"While we live at different ends of the world, the EU and New Zealand are close, trusted, reliable and like-minded partners. Together, we are driving global rules-based trade forward against the backdrop of a worldwide wave of protectionism and isolationism."</p>
