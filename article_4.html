            <p>The official Labour Day weekend holiday period is over and no one died on New Zealand roads, police say.</p>
        
            <p>It is a new record for recent years, with the previous lowest being in 2013 when one person died and 109 people were injured.</p>
        
            <p>The worst Labour Day holiday weekend for deaths and serious injuries was in 1983 when 13 people died and 248 were injured.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, there were six deaths, 2022 saw five deaths, 2021 saw six deaths and in 2020, eight people died, according to the Ministry of Transport.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, New Zealand Transport Agency spokesperson Andy Knackstedt warned people not to be complacent on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>He said even if there were no deaths, those who are seriously injured in crashes can have lifelong impacts.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just asking people to do the basics - drive and travel at a safe speed, to share the driving, make sure you're well rested, and just take the the time that you need to to get home safely."</p>
        
            <p>In earlier holiday road tolls this year, the ministry said seven people died during Easter, four died during King's Birthday, and one died during Matariki.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ is contacting the Ministry of Transport for information on people injured in crashes during the long weekend.</p>
