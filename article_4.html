            <p>A man and woman from Kaikōura have been charged with supplying illicit drugs in the small coastal town.</p>
        
            <p>The 43-year-old man was arrested Friday morning as he attempted to drive home after being in the North Island for a trip police believe was made for the purpose of restocking the pair's supply of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>A search of the man's vehicle uncovered 85 grams of methamphetamine, a small amount of cocaine, and other items consistent with being equipment used in the supply of controlled drugs.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year-old woman was also charged.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Shane Dye said though the quantity of drugs may not be considered large on a national scale, the pair had been dealing on a regular basis to people in the Kaikōura community and causing social harm.</p>
        
            <p>The Tasman Organised Crime Unit executed a search warrant at a Kaikōura address, locating further evidence of dealing in illicit drugs, including 500g of dried cannabis plant, four firearms, ammunition, and several items of gang-related clothing.</p>
        
            <p>The pair are due to appear in Blenheim District Court tomorrow.</p>
