            <p>The Public Sector Union is "alarmed" by a proposal to axe jobs at the Ministry for Ethnic Communities.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry has begun consultations about reducing the number of permanent staff by 14 percent and its work out of regional government offices in Hamilton, New Plymouth, Napier and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>In the run-up to last year's election, ACT - now part of the coalition government - campaigned on abolishing demographic ministries, including the Ministry of Diversity, Inclusion and Ethnic Communities.</p>
        
            <p>The union was not clear how many jobs would be lost, but it understood 32 roles are being proposed to be disestablished, and replaced with 23 new roles.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Ethnic Communities was launched in 2021 after a recommendation of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the 15 March terrorist attack.</p>
        
            <p>PSA national secretary Duane Leo said the important work of the Ministry in safeguarding and strengthening the wellbeing of ethnic communities in Aotearoa New Zealand would be undermined by the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>"The Government promised no cuts to frontline services - every day we are finding out that it was all a fiction.</p>
        
            <p>"The very ministry set up to heal the wounds of 15 March, and strengthen the bonds between our various communities, is pulling back from serving communities around the motu."</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry works to connect ethnic groups with each other, MƒÅori and both local and central government functions - these cuts will increase workloads to a ministry that is already under-resourced. As we become a more diverse nation why is this ministry not getting the funding it needs?"</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the ministry said it was in the process of consulting staff on a proposed change.</p>
        
            <p>"This proposal may change because of feedback; however, the ministry has proposed an overall reduction of nine staff.</p>
        
            <p>"The ministry does not have its own regional offices but has one staff member working from Department of Internal Affairs' offices in Hamilton, New Plymouth, and Napier with a further two staff in the DIA Dunedin office.</p>
        
            <p>"This process is subject to consultation, and it is not appropriate to comment further whilst this process is undertaken."</p>
