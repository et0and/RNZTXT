            <p>The firefighters' union has written to Fire and Emergency requesting a review into a serious multi-property fire in North Auckland this week.</p>
        
            <p>One house was destroyed and three others were damaged on Lees Street, Wainui on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Professional Firefighters Union vice president Martin Campbell said he wanted a review to assess crews' ability to respond to fires in small, close together subdivisions.</p>
        
            <p>It would help determine whether narrow roading, speed calming measures, out of date maps or staffing and workload problems had hampered crews' efforts to respond to the fire in a timely manner, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The ideal solution would be to make sure that the council comes up with a design plan to make sure roads are wide enough to allow fire trucks and other emergency services to get down the road," said Campbell.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023 firefighters warned they could not get their trucks close to burning houses in high-density projects where buildings are packed close together.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell also called for Fire and Emergency to look into staffing shortages.</p>
        
            <p>The Hibiscus Coast was the second largest populated area in Auckland with 70,000 residents - but had only two weekday volunteer fire crews, said Campbell.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like FENZ to look at the community of the Hibiscus Coast and staff it appropriately to other similar communities," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Invercargill has three 24/7 firefighting crews - here we are just trying to get one".</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Te Hiku region manager Ron Devlin said it would "consider the incident" to understand what contributed to the fire on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We continue to work closely with councils and developers on the challenges posed by the intensification of urban development, particularly in relation to building design and firefighting operations," he said.</p>
