        <h2>As it happened: At least 50 homes damaged after Mangawhai tornado</h2>
        <p>
FENZ Northland manager Wipari Henwood says the damage was some of the worst he had seen from a tornado.

            <p>Houses have been destroyed, power poles have been ripped off the base, and trees have snapped like twigs after a storm hit Mangawhai overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Two people from Mangawhai were taken to hospital in a serious condition. One was flown to Auckland Hospital by helicopter and the other was taken to North Shore hospital.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ Northland manager Wipari Henwood said the initial estimate is 50 homes damaged, but he expects that number will go up due to homes and businesses in the wider area damaged by falling trees.</p>
        
            <p>The damage was some of the worst he had seen from a tornado, Henwood added.</p>
        
            <p>"Roofs off houses, trees into houses, trees snapped like twigs, power poles, the concrete power poles all snapped and broken."</p>
        
            <p>Close to 5000 properties were without power in the Mangawhai, Mangawhai Heads and Langs Beach areas overnight. Power has since been restored to all except approximately 250 households on Moir Street and Old Waipu Road.</p>

            <p>Zoe Gimring said she woke to "the loudest roaring" and the sound of all of the outdoor furniture smashing against our deck railing.</p>
        
            <p>"Across the road from us there's part of someone's roof through the neighbour's roof - luckily they weren't home."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) was working through all the calls for help with property damage, and checking homes in the wider area. A specialist drone team had also been called in.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said people should treat all power lines as live, and avoid driving in the area so as not to hold up emergency services.</p>
