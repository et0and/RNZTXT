        <h2>Woman charged after alleged fake 111 call</h2>
        <p>
The 29-year-old allegedly told police there had been a firearms incident - but when officers got to the scene, they realised it was fake.

            <p>An Auckland woman has been charged after allegedly calling police to report a firearms incident that never happened.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they received the call before 9.30pm on Wednesday which resulted in an emergency response to Conifer Grove.</p>
        
            <p>But despite being quick to the scene, it was discovered no such incident had taken place.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Joe Hunter said the organisation was "incredibly frustrated over what occurred".</p>
        
            <p>"We take any incident involving firearms or firearms violence incredibly seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"Like our community, police are concerned when these incidents occur, and we will continue to respond in an urgent manner.</p>
        
            <p>"There are no other words for this callous behaviour and let this be a reminder that anyone identified making such calls could themselves be facing prosecution."</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old would appear in Papakura District Court on Thursday, charged with using a phone for fictitious purposes.</p>
