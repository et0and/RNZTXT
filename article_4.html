            <p>Three men have been jailed over the death of a South Auckland grandmother - two of them for murder, and one for manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>Meliame Fisi'ihoi, 57, was killed in her home in Calthorp Close in Mangere, in January 2020, when she answered a knock at her window. She was shot dead at point-blank range. Their target was her son, Stephen Fisi'ihoi, who was not home at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Friday described her murder as "callous".</p>
        
            <p>Brothers Viliami and Falala Iongi were found guilty of Fisi'ihoi's murder in the High Court at Auckland in December, and their cousin Manu Iongi was found guilty of manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>At their sentencing on Friday, Viliami was jailed for life with a non-parole period of 15 years; Falala also received a life sentence, with a non-parole period of seven years.</p>
        
            <p>Manu Iongi was sentenced to eight years and six months for manslaughter. He had originally been charged with murder too.</p>
        
            <p>Viliami and Falala had previously also been found guilty of reckless discharge of a firearm, as well as wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to a separate incident in December 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Tofilau Fa'amanuia Va'aelua said the investigators welcomed the sentences.</p>
        
            <p>"Today the Operation Truro team acknowledge Meliame's family who have lost a mother and grandmother in tragic circumstances. We are pleased to reach this point some four years after Meliame was senselessly murdered at her home.</p>
        
            <p>"This now brings an end to the court proceedings and we hope that this brings some closure for the family so that they can try to move forward with their lives."</p>
