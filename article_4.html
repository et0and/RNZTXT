            <p>KiwiRail hopes to get a better idea of the extent of the storm damage to the rail bridge over the Rangitata River in Canterbury today, as water levels start to drop.</p>
        
            <p>A section of the 610-metre-long bridge is sagging, after floodwaters washed away one of its support structures on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>All freight services using the bridge have been suspended.</p>
        
            <p>The rail company's chief infrastructure officer, Andr√© Lovatt, said data from drone footage taken on Saturday was being analysed and a recovery plan was under way.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail staff planned to inspect the bridge on Sunday morning - and to also have another, closer look using drones - to confirm what repairs were needed.</p>
        
            <p>But Lovatt said work could not begin until the river receded to safe levels.</p>

            <p>The bridge is an important railway linking Invercargill, Dunedin and Christchurch with about eight freight trains ordinarily travelling across it every weekday, and about five each weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Lovatt said on Saturday he was committed to keeping freight moving for customers and was working with those affected to find alternative options for them.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to run rail services from the north to Christchurch and Ashburton and from the south to Timaru. Connecting rail freight will be managed using road bridging operations."</p>
        
            <p>No passenger trains travel on the line south of Christchurch, he said.</p>
