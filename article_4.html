        <h2>Duck hunting season begins with first wheelchair-accessible maimai</h2>
        <p>
It's the opening day of the game bird season and more than 5000 shooters are expected to turn out today in the Otago region alone.

            <p>Fish and Game is working to make duck hunting more inclusive by opening the first wheelchair-accessible public shooting maimai in the country.</p>
        
            <p>Tens of thousands of duck hunters were expected to try their luck at bagging a feast on Saturday as the opening day of the game bird season begins.</p>
        
            <p>The wheelchair-accessible shelter is near Te Puke and has a concrete path for easy access, Fish and Game chief executive Corina Jordan said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's being led by our eastern team, John Meikle and supported by a range of volunteers and sponsorship and it's gone down really well with a huge amount of excitement and interest in it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>An old maimai site canal was recontoured and widened, a vehicle maintenance track created alongside it, and a flat pad made for the new stand which was ideal for wheelchair access.</p>
        
            <p>A couple of locally known wheelchair users conducted site visits and also helped to advise on access issues and whether the plans were fit for purpose.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Otago Fish and Game officer Bruce Quirey said last year, hunters lost out on bigger catches, because they spent less time in the maimai than usual.</p>
        
            <p>"We do hunter harvest surveys every year and we've sort of realised that some of the hunters have been packing up a bit earlier during the day and ... [missing] out on some opportunities later in the day."</p>
        
            <p>After 20 years of gradually phasing out lead ammunition, this season would also be the first when ammunition must be non-toxic, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The SPCA was also reminding hunters to be responsible this duck season to avoid unnecessary animal suffering.</p>
        
            <p>Its scientific officer Alison Vaughan said hunters should be competent and knowledgeable.</p>
        
            <p>"If there are birds that are shot and injured but not killed, you must track them down, it's unacceptable not to.</p>
        
            <p>"Every year, SPCA inspectors see animals that have been injured and suffered as a result of being shot so it is really important that people are responsible."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Vaughan said shooters must also look out for the actions of others in their group.</p>
