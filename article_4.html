            <p>* This story has been updated to correct an error on one of the figures</p>
        
            <p>Police now have two years worth of data on the types of hate incidents reported across New Zealand - including regional breakdowns and the demographics targeted - but it's unclear when the country will make hate crimes a standalone offence, nearly five years on from the Christchurch terror attacks.</p>
        
            <p>The number of hate incidents reported to police has increased by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Race-motivated abuse made up 83 percent of all complaints over the past two years, followed by incidents targeting people's sexual orientation (9.7 percent), and those targeting people of a certain faith (5.8 percent).</p>
        
            <p>Of the 9351 hate incidents reported between January 2022 and January 2024, more than a third targeted people of Asian descent, followed by 8.9 percent aimed at people of colour and 7.2 percent targeting Maori.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland had more than 3700 cases reported, the highest among all major centres, followed by Canterbury and Wellington, both with about 1100 incidents reported.</p>

            <p>The data comes from 2.5 years of the Te Raranga initiative - a four-year police programme to set up a system of recording hate crimes and improve support to victims.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative stemmed from a recommendation from the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch terror attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, victims continue to feel vulnerable to abuse in the absence of legal protections from hate-motivated incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Rizwaana Latiff - who is of South Asian and African descent, and of Islamic faith - said she frequently experiences racist abuse and that it comes down to a matter of picking her "battles" in terms of reporting it to the police.</p>
        
            <p>She was recently verbally abused by a man at a swimming pool in Hastings who said he didn't want to share a pool with someone of her skin colour, and shouted "f***ing b***, black b****" at her.</p>
        
            <p>Latiff said she experienced racist threats when she ran in the local elections in Hastings last year - including "terrorist" spray painted over her campaign billboards, and threatening notes in her letterbox.</p>
        
            <p>'They were like 'you're coming here, you're taking our jobs'…and they said something about my name, and they said that I was just a piece of black s***," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Latiff has reported some of the incidents to the police, but she questions what actions police can take other than recording the complaint.</p>
        
            <p>She said she would like to see more ethnic liaison officers in the regions.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, hate can be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing, but it is not a standalone offence.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Commission of Inquiry(RCOI) into the 15 March terror attacks had recommended the government to create a separate hate crime offence.</p>
        
            <p>In March last year, the ministerial advisory group monitoring the response to the Commission's recommendations - Kāpuia - wrote to the then Justice Minister Andrew Little, expressing "deep concerns" about the speed of the government's response to RCOI's recommendations relating to hate speech, incitement and hate crime.</p>
        
            <p>Kāpuia chairperson Arihia Bennett said in the letter she was "deeply disappointed" that the government had referred some of this important work to the Law Commission.</p>
        
            <p>Bennett said they had passed on their advice to the new lead minister for the Royal Commission of Inquiry Response Judith Collins, but had not heard back yet.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, former Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon said he wanted the new government to prioritize the legal reforms in hate crimes and hate speech.</p>
        
            <p>"I would encourage the new Minister of Justice to actually make a serious attempt to ensure legislation is put in as soon as possible," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Foon is calling for more accessible channels for reporting of hate incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"I definitely believe that there should be more publicity and communications with our communities in terms of reporting these things separately and making it easy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He is also encouraging more people to report their experiences of hate and prejudice.</p>
        
            <p>"The more information we have, the more effective and efficient, that will inform legislation going forward and how the courts will deal with it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the government's plans for implementing hate crime and hate speech laws, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said in a statement:</p>
        
            <p>"The government is currently focused on its 100-day plan and coalition commitments around restoring justice. All other potential work items will have to considered in due course."</p>
        
            <p>Minister Judith Collins said she would be meeting with Kapuia to hear their concerns.</p>
        
            <p>But she said the coalition agreement with New Zealand First included a policy to stop the work on reforming the hate speech legislation.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell said he would support initiatives by police to reduce the number of hate incidents.</p>
        
            <p>However, the minister would not comment on the latest data on hate incidents and Asian communities being overwhelming targeted, saying these matters are "operational".</p>
        
            <p>He also would not comment on the progress of the Te Raranga programme to date, and whether it is on track to meeting its targets.</p>
