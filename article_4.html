            <p>Nelson's main library has fully re-opened today, more than a year and a half after unexpected seismic issues forced its closure.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson City Council shut the Elma Turner library in June 2022, after the discovery of heavier than expected ceiling tiles that posed an earthquake risk.</p>
        
            <p>The library was re-opened in stages from the following month, but during work on the ceiling, further damage was found to some of the trusses mid last year which delayed the library's full re-opening.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Nick Smith said the strengthening work cost $2.5m, extending its life for up to 10 years while longer term solutions were considered.</p>
        
            <p>"This defers the need to spend $46 million on a new building at a difficult time financially of high interest rates and council facing nearly $60 million in costs from the August 2022 storm. Council now has time to reset the process on finding the right long-term solution for Nelson's central city library."</p>
        
            <p>The council had plans to build a new library on the banks of the Maitai River, but they were scrapped in 2022 after councillors voted not to spend any more on the project over concerns about cost and the site.</p>
        
            <p>Smith said the library re-opening was a significant milestone that came after criticism - with some people questioning whether the library could be successfully strengthened and others thinking the building posed little risk.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was pleased the project had been completed under budget and a month ahead of schedule.</p>
        
            <p>The library now meets 67 percent NBS (New Building Standard) for the ceilings, and 34 percent NBS for the structure, which is expected to give the building a further five to 10 years of life.</p>
