        <h2>The Joker is back, without the Bat</h2>
        <p>
The Detail - Are movie goers Marvelled-out, done with DC? Film and TV producers are betting we're not, with the release of offerings featuring Batman villains, but not the caped crusader himself.

            <p>It's superhero saturation at the box office with Batman's offsiders claiming screen time without Batman.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a solid two decades since the superhero blockbuster took over Hollywood and refused to leave.</p>
        
            <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU, is now the biggest film franchise in history with box office takings approaching the US$30 billion mark and a cultural dominance that seems inescapable.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, on the DC side of the comic juggernaut divide, Joker: Folie à Deux is a sequel to the highly successful movie set in the Batman universe without Batman. Did it work? Based on the initial reviews and box office takings, no.</p>
        
            <p>Is Joker a sign of Hollywood stepping away from the formula that has evolved over the first decades of the 21st century? Or is it just a flash in the pan destined to fizzle out? Is DC set to grasp the crown of dominance from Marvel? Or does that crown even truly exist?</p>
        
            <p>Veteran movie reviewer Darren Bevan has his own take on where the industry is heading.</p>
        
            <p>"Things come in peaks and troughs, there has been a backlash against Marvel and the amount of films they've put out for the same characters. But you have to realise there are audiences for this and if you're a film executive that's what you're chasing."</p>
        
            <p>While a slew of mediocrity from Marvel and a continued failure to launch for DC seems to paint a dire picture, Bevan believes it's far from over.</p>
        
            <p>"People will start to return to superhero films and wisely, the studios that make them will realise that by not swamping the marketplace and by carefully curating a content schedule that's very much tailored towards satiating new audiences rather than overflowing them, that will prove to be the box office gold."</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the cowboy genre of the mid-20th century that dominated Hollywood for its run, it seems superheroes might have more staying power to them as long as executives play their cards right.</p>
        
            <p>Comics scholar Neal Curtis from the University of Auckland has his own thoughts on the direction the genre is moving in and what we can expect. He believes that only a socially progressive angle can see the industry through and it might not have what it takes to move forward.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't have that much faith in the future of superhero films, because I don't have that much faith in Hollywood. I don't think Hollywood is brave enough to do the quite radical films it ought to be doing, it won't do enough of the pro-social stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the films, it's not the genre, it's not the comics… it's not the concept of the superhero that's lacking, it's the courage of movie executives, that's what's lacking."</p>
        
            <p>Only time will tell if the superhero movie is set for a comeback, or if the end is already here. The ball is very much in Hollywood's court.</p>
