            <p>A 27-year-old Canadian has been caught trying to enter New Zealand with 9.9kgs of methamphetamine in his luggage.</p>
        
            <p>He arrived on a flight from Vancouver on Monday and after questioning and a baggage search, Customs officers found methamphetamine concealed in several travel cube bags in his luggage.</p>
        
            <p>The drugs would have been worth up to NZD$3.5 million in street value.</p>
        
            <p>Chief customs officer Ben Wells said this arrest and seizure was a great success for both Customs' frontline officers as well as intelligence and targeting experts who worked behind the scenes to identify potential drug couriers before they even got here.</p>

            <p>"Customs screens 100 percent of all arriving passengers using data and technology to identify individuals who may pose a high risk," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This seizure has prevented significant harm to our communities by stopping methamphetamine from hitting our streets. This is estimated to have prevented up to NZ$11 million worth of social harm and cost to New Zealand communities."</p>
        
            <p>The defendant was charged with importation and possession for supply of a Class A controlled drug, as well as failure to provide passcode to access information on electronic devices.</p>
        
            <p>He was scheduled to appear in the Manukau District Court on Tuesday.</p>
