            <p>If you think RNZ is a place where people unironically wear grey cardigans and socks with sandals, prepare to be dazzled by our collection of NZ music t-shirts.</p>
        
            <p>We're not wearing these just to show our fashion (and music) sense, but to show our collective support for NZ Music T-shirt Day (today - Friday 3 May).</p>
        
            <p>Zealand Music T-shirt Day is all about raising funds for Music Helps, a charity that enables hundreds of music-focused projects across New Zealand, including music therapy, music programmes in aged, respite and palliative care, and music education programmes in schools, prisons and rehabilitation centres.</p>
        
            <p>Hopefully our team will inspire you to show your own support for Aotearoa's homegrown tunes. Here's what they're wearing, and why.</p>

            <p>Music 101 presenter Charlotte Ryan is wearing a T shirt celebrating the music of Tāmaki Makaurau songwriter/producer Frances Libeau aka i.e crazy, and their album Country Justice.</p>
        
            <p>"The album is beautiful, sometimes very industrial sounding - there are lots of textures, layers and samples from news stories and interviews throughout, with dark underlying themes.</p>
        
            <p>"I love the way Frances collaborates with other artists, in her music and also in her merchandise. This t-shirt design is by Tamaki artist Abigail Aroha Jensen."</p>

            <p>TAHI team lead Harrison Pali is wearing the Crowd Pleaser Album Shirt from Tāmaki Makaurau artists Foley.</p>
        
            <p>"I have always admired the time and creativity they put into everything that they do and Ash and Gabe are massive supporters of other local artists. They recently released a new single 'Miss You All The Time' and it's a total earworm."</p>

            <p>RNZ education correspondent John Gerritsen is wearing one of his two Beastwars t-shirts.</p>
        
            <p>"A friend told me Beastwars do a great live gig so a few years ago I went along to a show at the San Fran and was hooked - they really are fantastic. They have mesmerising stage presence and are really tight. They get on stage and just roar out of the gate with a massive sound. I've seen them three times now and will definitely see them again. And they do a great t-shirt too!"</p>

            <p>RNZ Midday presenter Charlotte Cook is wearing a t-shirt showcasing Phoebe Vic.</p>
        
            <p>"Phoebe Vic is a groovy musician from Ōtautahi, Christchurch. But that's just one of many strings to her creative bow. Strange Rituals is her debut EP - produced by another incredible artist in her own right, Emily C. Browning.</p>
        
            <p>"Phoebe's strong voice calls to you and weaves you through her story with a ethereal, sonic kind of vibe. I also just completely love the t-shirt as a strange ritualistic girlie myself!"</p>

            <p>RNZ music content producer Tony Stamp is wearing a full t-shirt by Half Hexagon.</p>
        
            <p>"Half Hexagon are an Auckland-based indie supergroup featuring James Milne (AKA Lawrence Arabia), drummer extraordinaire Julien Dyne (formerly of Opensouls, currently playing with Avantdale Bowling Club, The Circling Sun, and more), and vocalist Yolanda Fagan (of Taite Prize Best Independent Debut winners Na Noise, and Echo Ohs). Their sound revolves around warm synths and Yolanda's lateral vocals, with Krautrock reference points alongside more local ones."</p>

            <p>Executive Editor Digital Rhonwyn Newson is wearing a signed Anika Moa t-shirt.</p>
        
            <p>"This T-shirt is from 2009 - I got it when I went to a Winery Tour at Ascension Winery in Matakana. It's also signed by Dave Dobbyn who played at the same gig."</p>

            <p>RNZ Culture 101 presenter says his Ebony Lamb t-shirt has a heartwarming backstory.</p>
        
            <p>"Ebony Lamb's debut self-titled solo album just got a Taite Music prize nomination but what I really love about this t-shirt is its from 2019 and was a call for 'successful feelings' (the title of one of Eb's songs).</p>
        
            <p>It was an act of prayer and hope a few years before the album finally got released! Artists so have to believe in themselves - give themselves 'successful feelings'."</p>

            <p>RNZ studio operator Ben Pierce is wearing a t-shirt celebrating Christchurch five-piece alt-rock band this dog.</p>
        
            <p>"Their music is reminiscent of The Smashing Pumpkins with acoustic or warm fuzzy guitars, however their vocals are probably the loudest you've ever heard a Kiwi yell. Listen to them for a bit of a Kiwi youth wit. Love the t-shirt design with Godzilla looking aggressive in front of the Christchurch Cathedral, probably similar to the destruction of their live shows."</p>

            <p>Reporter Adam Burns' cosy hoodie showcases Dallas Tamaira aka Joe Dukie.</p>
        
            <p>"Best known as the golden voice of Fat Freddy's Drop, Tamaira returned last year with his first solo release in more than 20 years. The stellar Levels managed to be both fearlessly expansive, while touching on those classic soul tropes (Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, etc). First hearing Dukie's vocal chops on Freddies' "Hope" as an 18-year-old listening to the Green Room 004 compilation, I knew he was made of rare stuff. Still one of Aotearoa's best and brightest."</p>

            <p>RNZ Sunday Morning Jim Mora got his t-shirt from Christchurch band Castaway.</p>
        
            <p>"We interviewed Jackson Stewart from the young Christchurch band Castaway and played their new song Satellite. They were kind enough to send me a shirt!</p>
        
            <p>"The band got together in a hostel at Canterbury University, Wilson House. 'Wilson' was the name of the volleyball that Tom Hanks had conversations with in the film Castaway, so that became the band name! ('Wilson Sporting Goods' was the volleyball's full name, to give proper acknowledgement.)"</p>

            <p>"They push the boundaries and poke fun in their music."</p>

            <p>RNZ Wellington reporter Bill Hickman is wearing a t-shirt repping Shark vs Lion, the solo project of Wellington musician Adam Crawford.</p>
        
            <p>"A well-travelled drummer in the Wellington scene, Crawford has released three albums of guitar heavy, alternative rock. He plays all the instruments himself and his vocals nod towards classic 90's influences, emotive but delivered in a typically low-key New Zealand way. His latest release, 'From Inside' is a huge step up in scope, broadening to include mellow acoustic textures and rich layered vocals all with and undercurrent of weary torment."</p>

            <p>RNZ Afternoons presenter and co-host of the upcoming Aotearoa Music Awards Jesse Mulligan is wearing one of his three Reb Fountain t-shirts.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope this doesn't look like favouritism ahead of the Aotearoa Music Awards. If it's any consolation, I own four The Beths t-shirts."</p>
