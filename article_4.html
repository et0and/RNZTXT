            <p>The jury have reached a unanimous verdict after a nearly three-month long murder trial into the death of Rau Tongia.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume, and Pania Waaka all pleaded not guilty to the murder of Tongia, who the Crown allege was shot in the back while he slept at a house in Wellington's Karori in December 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt-Weston also faced two other charges.</p>
        
            <p>For Weston, the jury reached a verdict of guilty of murder.</p>
        
            <p>For Hunt-Weston, the jury has found her guilty of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and of accessory after the fact to murder, but not guilty to murder.</p>
        
            <p>For Waaka, the jury has found her guilty on the charge of murder.</p>
        
            <p>For Hume, the jury has found her not guilty of either murder or manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>Following her acquittal, Hume was in tears.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth woman was also set to go on trial charged with murder but was excused due to health reasons. Her name is suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>Sentencing will be on 19 September.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was initially scheduled to begin on the 13 May and was set down for eight weeks.</p>
        
            <p>After two weeks of delays, the Crown kicked off its case on 27 May, spearheaded by Crown Prosecutor Sally Carter.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleged in the hours before Tongia's death, he assaulted Weston and his death was a revenge killing.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said in the hours before Tongia's death, Weston was with the fifth woman.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses reported seeing the two women and Tongia at a party, where Weston and the fifth woman were seen kissing.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses said she appeared to be trying to get a rise out of Tongia.</p>
        
            <p>Tongia is then alleged to have assaulted Weston while she was sleeping alone in the woman's bed.</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses testified to seeing Weston with black eyes after the attack and reported a second confrontation then happening in the driveway of Tongia's Percy Dyett Drive address.</p>
        
            <p>Evidence was given that Weston's sister Hunt-Weston and cousin Phoenix Colvin came to the address from Halswell Lodge to get her, along with another person.</p>
        
            <p>There Hunt-Weston admitted to hitting Tongia in the head with a hammer.</p>
        
            <p>She maintained it was in self-defence in response to Tongia attacking Weston again.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV footage tracked Colvin's car between Halswell Lodge and Percy Dyett Drive, then out to Onslow Road - where the Crown alleges that the gun that was used was collected.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleged Tongia was shot in the back while he slept shortly after 4.30am.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV footage tracked Hunt-Weston's car going from Halswell Lodge back to Karori shortly before 4.30am.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleged Hunt-Weston had told Waaka to drive the car, and that a witnessed had seen a person, alleged to be Weston, with a shotgun by the side of Tongia's house.</p>
        
            <p>Google Maps data from Waaka's phone placed it outside the address on Percy Dyett Drive around the same time.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown believed Weston either pulled the trigger or assisted in the shooting, Waaka drove Weston to the address, Hunt-Weston lent them the car to get there, and Hume supplied the gun used.</p>
        
            <p>Waaka has admitted to driving the car.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said the fifth woman was also believed to have been in a bedroom the night Tongia was shot while he slept.</p>
