            <p>Investigators have found a fatal house fire in Southland last week was caused by a heater.</p>
        
            <p>The bodies of a mother and an 11-year-old boy were found on Friday, a day after the fire at a View St property in Manapouri.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said other people remained unaccounted for, but they were now satisfied no-one else was at home at the time of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency district manager Julian Tohiariki said a heater likely came into contact with bedding, and the house had no working smoke alarms at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Mark McCloy said forensic specialists were helping to identify the bodies, which have since been taken to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the initial examination, police along with specialist fire investigators from Fire and Emergency New Zealand conducted a full scale scene examination of the home over the weekend."</p>

            <p>McCloy earlier said neighbours tried to rescue the pair.</p>
        
            <p>"Neighbours at the property attempted valiantly to gain entry to the burning house, but they were unable to and contacted emergency services," he said.</p>
