            <p>Former Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys has died aged 92.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Michael was the Governor-General from 1996 to 2001.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon paid tribute to him on social media in announcing the death.</p>
        
            <p>"His distinguished life of service to New Zealand was one of dedication and reliability," Luxon wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Michael epitomised what it is to be a great New Zealander. Our thoughts are with his family at this time."</p>
        
            <p>Current Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro has also paid tribute to Sir Michael, who guided New Zealand through its first MMP elections.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Michael carried out his vice-regal duties with the utmost care and good humour, and took particular pride in encouraging and supporting the aspirations of young people," said Dame Cindy in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"In carrying out my own duties as Governor-General during the recent election, I took great comfort in knowing I was following the principles Sir Michael so carefully laid out during his term.</p>
        
            <p>"On behalf of all New Zealanders, Dr Davies and I extend our sincerest condolences to Sir Michael's whānau at this sad time."</p>
        
            <p>I’m saddened by the death of Sir Michael Hardie Boys, the 17th Governor-General of New Zealand. His distinguished life of service to New Zealand was one of dedication and reliability. Sir Michael epitomised what it is to be a great New Zealander. Our thoughts are with his…</p>
        
            <p>Sir Michael was born in 1931 in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>A former High Court and Court of Appeal judge, he was chosen to oversee the first two elections held under the MMP system, because of his legal experience.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Michael guided New Zealand into the MMP era," Luxon said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Michael was a figure of stability during a time of significant constitutional change."</p>
        
            <p>He was knighted in 1995 and the following year became the first Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Michael believed Governors-General had a duty to speak out about the community's concerns - which he did, commenting on inequality, family violence and child abuse.</p>
        
            <p>In 1980, he was appointed a judge of the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ in a past interview he found dealing with the variety of people who passed through his court a satisfying experience but did not enjoy passing sentence.</p>
        
            <p>"You're balancing the needs of society and the proper feeling of the victim, that some due punishment ought to be meted out, and the common thread in almost every case was a deprived family background, assaults during childhood, drop out from school, drug abuse ... it's such a familiar, sorry pattern."</p>
        
            <p>When his vice-regal term ended in April 2001, he retired from public life.</p>
        
            <p>"On the role of the Governor-General more broadly, Sir Michael noted 'there is still more to the office than the official smile, the genteel wave and the memory of plumed helmets of yesteryear,'" the Governor-General's office said in its statement.</p>
        
            <p>In accordance with Sir Michael's wishes, a state funeral will not be held.</p>
        
            <p>Further details will follow from the family in due course.</p>
