        <h2>Watch: Police launch community beat teams in Christchurch</h2>
        <p>
Ten new officers are already on the ground, with plans for that to grow to 18.
</p>
        
            <p>New police teams are patrolling central Christchurch, shopping malls and transport hubs to improve safety and prevent retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>Ten new beat police have been on the ground since the beginning of July, with plans for that to grow to 18 over the next few months.</p>
        
            <p>The government's nationwide rollout of community beat teams includes 63 officers in central Auckland, and a further 17 staff in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>At an official launch of the Christchurch community beat team on Thursday, Assistant Commissioner Mike Johnson said the new officers had hit the ground running and had had a lot of successful engagements in their first few weeks.</p>

            <p>This included arresting two prolific shoplifters, recovering stolen property worth more than $1000, and removing 12 young people from a dangerous, derelict building.</p>
        
            <p>"I know security staff in the malls and retailers have told the team they are now happy and feel well supported with the change that we've been able to bring from our presence, and from the work that the staff are doing out and about," Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Lane Todd said beat teams would mostly be based out of the central city police station, with some deployed at major malls and retail areas across the city.</p>

Shoplifting is a major issue at Christchurch malls, said Superintendent Lane Todd.

            <p>Shoplifting was a major problem in Christchurch malls, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been working quite closely with mall retailers in terms of how we can do crime prevention, and the community beat team is going to be able to ensure that we have a lot more presence, but also more reassurance ... as well."</p>
        
            <p>Associate Minister of Police Casey Costello said the beat teams launch was "really about community" and most importantly the Christchurch metro staff.</p>

Beat patrols are about building community connections, Associate Minister of Police Casey Costello said at the launch.

            <p>"It's great to see the new team is now in action and that there is a continued and growing commitment to core, front-line policing functions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a reality that the public and businesses want to see our police. It makes a real difference to making people feel safe, and deterring anti-social and criminal conduct.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a long time since I walked the beat... but although technology has changed a lot since then, at its heart it is still the same. It's about being seen, it's about building community connections and creating safe environments."</p>

Business leader Leeann Watson said people needed to be welcomed back to the city centre.

            <p>Business Canterbury chief executive Leeann Watson says businesses had been advocating for a stronger police presence in the city for some time.</p>
        
            <p>"As we continue to see a stronger presence of our tourism market come back into Christchurch we want to make sure we welcome people back into the central city, into all of those areas that are really important to support our business community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Superintendent Todd encouraged people to keep contacting police to report crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"We rely heavily on our community to let us know when and where things are happening, so we know where to put our people.</p>
        
            <p>"Our regular deployment model - and most certainly where our beat teams will patrol - will be heavily influenced by information we have, and continue to receive, from the public about areas of demand."</p>
