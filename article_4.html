            <p>RNZ has taken out three prestigious honours at the annual Voyager Media Awards.</p>
        
            <p>The awards - held this year in Auckland - recognise New Zealand's best journalism, with categories for reporting, photography, digital and video.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's Guyon Espiner, Farah Hancock, John Hartevelt, Cole Eastham-Farrelly and Hingyi Khong won Best Innovation in Digital Storytelling for their series The Interview.</p>
        
            <p>The team trawled through nine months of interviews with the Labour and National leaders to analyse what their language said about their priorities and obsessions.</p>
        
            <p>It was an "outstanding entry involving serious data wrangling and multimedia production to tell a new story with wit and credibility", the judges said.</p>
        
            <p>"A great example of data translating into an accessible, immersive experience, driving audience engagement."</p>
