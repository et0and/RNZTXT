            <p>Northland police have launched a homicide investigation following the death of a motorcyclist in Otaika.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Shane Pilmer said an investigation had been underway since a member of the public found a body in a creek next to Otaika Valley Road, or State Highway 15, about 5am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The man's motorcycle was found in a nearby layby.</p>
        
            <p>Pilmer believed the man died some time between 7pm and 11pm on 28 January, in the layby opposite the entrance to Otaika Valley Scenic Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem examination and identification procedures were underway.</p>
        
            <p>Pilmer said the investigation team wanted to hear from anyone who had seen the blue-and-silver road bike found parked in the layby.</p>
        
            <p>"We're particularly interested in any sightings of this bike between 8pm on 28 January through to 5am on 29 January," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police also wanted to hear from anyone with dashcam or CCTV footage around key locations between 7pm on 28 January and 5am on 29 January.</p>
        
            <p>The area of interest was along Otaika Valley Road, between the intersections with State Highway 14, Maungatapere, and Loop and Cemetery Roads, in Otaika.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm asking anyone with a dashcam or CCTV cameras to prioritise checking these now, and contact our investigation team."</p>
        
            <p>Pilmer said police would release more details about the victim once the formal identification process had been completed.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team are working with the family, who are coming to terms with their loved one succumbing to foul play … The investigation is still in its very early stages, and our team will work hard to ensure we get answers as to why this homicide has occurred."</p>
        
            <p>Police working on the investigation, codenamed Operation Distant, had set up a dedicated online portal at distant.nc3.govt.nz so people could upload any footage or photos. https://distant.nc3.govt.nz/</p>
