            <p>Legislation introducing a new ram raid offence passed its first reading in August.</p>
        
            <p>The Ram Raid Offending and Related Measures Amendment Bill would add 'smash-and-grabs' to the Crimes Act, and would give police the power to prosecute children as young as 12 with up to 10 years in prison, including for being a passenger, or filming the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Around 70 percent of identified ram raiders were aged between 14 and 17, and a further 12 percent were aged between 10 and 13.</p>
