            <p>A teenager who was missing in Omaha has been found, thanks to members of the public.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Wednesday issued an amber alert for Hugo Wadham, 15, who left a house on Kokopu Street in only his underwear after becoming upset at 11.55pm.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before midday police said he had been located safe and well.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank those members of the public who provided information, which assisted in locating him."</p>
        
            <p>Wadham was described as 183cm tall and of slim build. He was wearing Jockey brand underwear. He has blue eyes and short wavy brown hair.</p>
        
            <p>Police said he had autism and ADHD and there were concerns his mental health could be deteriorating due to medication issues.</p>
        
            <p>"Hugo is verbal, however has been going through periods of 'non-communication' lately."</p>
        
            <p>While he was familiar with the area there were no places he was likely to go and there were concerns he had spent the night outside in the wind and rain.</p>
        
            <p>Police and Facebook launched the amber alert system in 2017 for cases where a child or young person who was missing was at serious risk of harm and public assistance could help to locate them.</p>
