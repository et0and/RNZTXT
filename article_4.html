        <h2>What is (and isn't) open on Christmas Day</h2>
        <p>
I need a last minute Christmas gift, are any shops open? What if I forgot my share of the potluck?

            <p>For most of us, Christmas Day means unwrapping presents, settling in with a classic Christmas movie, indulging in endless glazed ham, and eventually passing out on the couch - basically, it's a day of being lazy all day.</p>
        
            <p>But if you do find yourself needing to venture out, it can feel like a bit of a guessing game as to what's open and what's not. Here's RNZ's guide to what is and isn't open on Christmas Day 2024.</p>

Pharmacies and petrol stations are open as essential services on Christmas Day.

            <p>Christmas Day is one of four restricted trading days in New Zealand, meaning almost all retail shops will be closed. But if you're desperate for a last minute gift, there are a few options.</p>
        
            <p>Petrol stations are generally open as an essential service, and many of them stock small gift items like chocolates, gift cards and novelty items. The same goes for pharmacies, which often hold gifts like candles and skincare sets. But with both, it would pay to check holiday hours first.</p>
        
            <p>If you were hoping for a midnight Kmart run instead, think again - the department store will be closed Christmas Day. However many Kmarts around the country will be operating right up until December 24 - check your local store's opening hours here before you head out.</p>
        
            <p>A last minute potluck dish might prove tricky with most major supermarkets - including Woolworths, New World and Pak n Save - closed on Christmas Day.</p>
        
            <p>However, dairies and fruit shops are allowed to stay open, so there's some room to get creative with dairy snacks - bread, cheese, fruit and dips can go a long way for a little platter contribution.</p>

Takeaways, cafes, and restaurants are all allowed to open on Christmas Day.

            <p>If you're in the mood for fried chicken, you're in luck. Select KFC stores will be open on Christmas Day from 11am - 7pm. You can find the full list of open stores here. Select McDonald's, Dominos and Pizza Hut may be open too.</p>
        
            <p>If local takeaways or fish and chips are more your speed, these establishments are also allowed to open on Christmas Day - just check opening hours ahead of time.</p>
        
            <p>For a sit down lunch or dinner, a 15 percent public holiday surcharge may apply at restaurants and cafes. But it can be well worth going out for the day - many restaurants even serve up special multi-course Christmas menus, complete with Christmas pudding.</p>
        
            <p>If you need your Christmas Day booze, it's a good idea to stock up early - no alcohol is sold or supplied on Christmas Day. And as of 9 December, all off-license alcohol outlets in Auckland will have to stop trading from 9pm every day.</p>
