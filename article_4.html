            <p>Some of the whales that were refloated at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay today have already become stranded again.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 40 pilot whales were stranded on Monday - the surviving 24 were refloated around midday Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation operations manager Ross Trotter said the whales had re-stranded as the tide headed out.</p>
        
            <p>He said they would not be able to be refloated until high tide on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"The ones who have stranded, we'll just be looking after their welfare now and trying to keep them as comfortable as we can until we get another opportunity when the tide comes back."</p>
        
            <p>But with the rest of the pod also milling around, more whales could become stranded yet.</p>
