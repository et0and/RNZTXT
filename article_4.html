            <p>Police have arrested and charged a second person over the death of Ramandeep Singh.</p>
        
            <p>Singh's body was found in Royal Reserve park in Massey early on Monday morning. A post mortem has revealed that he died as a result of injuries he received in an assault.</p>
        
            <p>A 17-year-old has been charged with murder and will appear in the WaitƒÅkere District Youth Court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The arrest comes after a 26-year-old man, also charged with murder, appeared in court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Singh was a 25-year-old who had lived in New Zealand since moving from India in 2018 and he had been working as a contractor for Armourguard.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Aaron Proctor said police were continuing to piece together the events leading up to his murder.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team has been working hard, day and night, to bring justice for Mr Singh whose life was senselessly cut short while he was going about his job," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Singh's family had been advised of the latest arrest, he said.</p>
