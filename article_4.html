            <p>A worker was threatened during an early-morning robbery at an Auckland petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating following the robbery at Caltex in Western Springs, which happened just after 7am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said a group of "several people" threatened the station attendant, who activated a fog cannon and "moved to a secure place".</p>
        
            <p>The employee was "shaken but unharmed", police said.</p>
        
            <p>"The offenders stole things before fleeing in a vehicle that was found abandoned by police a short time later."</p>
        
            <p>The Caltex has been contacted for comment.</p>
        
            <p>This is the second time the petrol station has been robbed in less than a year.</p>
        
            <p>In May 2023, two people targeted the petrol station in what police described as a "violent attack".</p>
        
            <p>They smashed their way through the night pay window, then assaulted the night worker on duty, leaving him with minor injuries.</p>
