            <p>The Ministry of Defence has begun auditing its handling of hazardous materials such as rocket fuel and tonnes of old ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>It has done just a single audit in the last decade, which found shortcomings and shortcuts that had to be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Uncertainty over hazardous substances and work safety laws had held up auditing more regularly as is required.</p>
        
            <p>"The legal framework ... remains unclear," the ministry told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"However, Defence has engaged with the EPA [Environmental Protection Authority] and WorkSafe to ensure the work could be undertaken in a way that meets the spirit and intent of both Acts."</p>
        
            <p>Phase one of the audit in the South Island was aimed to be completed later this year, with the North Island second phase to start a few months after that.</p>
        
            <p>The eight-year gap since the last audit in 2016 coincided with revelations about contamination with heavy metals, and PFAS 'forever' chemicals around bases, including in ManawatÅ« and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force ended its investigations a couple of years ago into the cancer-linked PFAS compounds locked into groundwater by the use of banned firefighting foam.</p>
        
            <p>"Across the Defence estate it is not possible to quantify the liability nor to establish any need for remediation," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigation of PFAS contamination is a routine part of investigations preliminary to earthworks for construction activity across the defence estate" and were not separated out.</p>
        
            <p>Finding and fixing water contamination is costing billions of dollars in the US and Europe.</p>
        
            <p>A new study shows Australia is among the hotspots for the toxic manmade chemicals, however, New Zealand was omitted entirely from the maps reproduced in the journal Nature Geoscience.</p>
        
            <p>"Our study doesn't have any data from NZ," University of New South Wales told RNZ.</p>
