            <p>Displaying gang patches in public places will not be tolerated, police say, once new laws come into effect on 21 November.</p>
        
            <p>Police had been meeting with gangs to discuss the changes, assistant commissioner Paul Basham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Gangs are well aware that once this law comes into effect, they are not allowed to wear a gang patch in public.</p>
        
            <p>"Police staff have spoken to gang leaders and made it clear that anyone breaching the new laws can expect enforcement action."</p>
        
            <p>If police came across anyone wearing gang insignia in public, the excuse of ignorance would not be taken as a defence, Basham said.</p>
        
            <p>Police dubbed the nation-wide operation to enforce new laws Operation Nickel and Basham said the police's gang disruption unit had been set up and was ready to go.</p>
        
            <p>"These teams are situated nation-wide and are focused on disrupting criminal gang activity.</p>
        
            <p>"They will be gathering evidence of criminal behaviour including breaches of the Gangs Act," Basham said.</p>

            <p>Calls for service would still be prioritised, Basham said, which could mean a breach would occur and police would not be able to attend at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"In these cases, wherever possible we will be gathering available evidence to follow through with enforcement action at a later time."</p>
        
            <p>The gang disruption units would follow up on reports of breaches and do search warrants to recover patches and insignia.</p>
        
            <p>Laws passed under the Gangs Legislation Amendment Bill would also allow police to issue dispersal notices and non-consorting orders to stop gang members from associating or communicating for up to three years.</p>
        
            <p>"Our message is simple - Parliament has passed a law, it's our job to enforce the law, and we will be enforcing it.</p>
        
            <p>"If you don't want to have enforcement attention from police, don't breach the law," Basham said.</p>
