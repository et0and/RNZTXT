            <p>Meteorologist John Law said southerly winds would remain until later in the week, which meant cooler temperatures and cloud around eastern parts of the motu.</p>
        
            <p>Cool southerlies would stick with us for at least the rest of this week, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The good news is I think for this week that although we still have got some cool air still with us we should hopefully find there is still some drier weather and some sunshine to come, those southerly winds I think will still keep a bit more cloud around those eastern places of both islands."</p>
        
            <p>A significant drop in temperatures overnight in the central North Island, with Taupo dropping to 5℃ this morning at 6am.Similar temperatures are expected tomorrow morning.Stay up to date with the weather forecast for your area https://t.co/Yjbq0jgaoz pic.twitter.com/gGoToA4Bt7</p>
        
            <p>The high for Wellington on Monday was about 16C, while in Auckland the forecast high was 22C, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So still not bad for the time of year, but definitely not quite the summer temperatures we'd like to see."</p>
        
            <p>The strong sea swells that had been plaguing the Cook Strait ferries would continue for the next few days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The low pressure that had been driving the southerly winds that caused big swells in the Cook Strait should slowly start to move away towards the east, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So yes we're going to keep hold of those southerly swells as well, but as we go through the week they should start to settle down so things should get a bit better there as this low pressure drives out towards the east, the winds start to ease off and hopefully find a change in wind direction for the end of the week."</p>
