            <p>Twenty-five firefighters are working to extinguish a house fire in Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were called to the blaze just south of the town of Tapawera just before 4.30am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>When the crews from Tapawera, St Arnaud, Wakefield and Richmond arrived, the house fire was well-involved.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said there is extensive damage to the home - but due to working smoke alarms, all occupants got out safely.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator will attend this morning as a cause has not yet been determined.</p>
