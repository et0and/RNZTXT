        <p>

            <p>Queenstown's mayor has been talking to the government about the option of a congestion charge on tourists driving around town.</p>
        
            <p>The tight-packed tourist town has opened a new arterial route in, but is struggling to find funds to extend it.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Glyn Lewers has had meetings with the Finance and Infrastructure ministers - the latter, Chris Bishop, is also now the new Transport Minister - and says all options are on the table, including congestion charges, though Lewers stressed it would not apply to locals.</p>
        
            <p>"Technology's moved on - you can start looking at how you can do user charging and differentiate between the tourist versus the local," he told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"There's all sorts of different ways ... and I think that's an open discussion that this government's pretty keen to have.</p>
        
            <p>"We've already had discussions."</p>
        
            <p>The new arterial opened on Thursday was only about 1km long.</p>
        
            <p>At a cost of at least $128m, it was one of the country's most expensive stretches of road.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown put up $50m of that sum, but locals would be paying off the rest for decades.</p>
        
            <p>Even so, the road stopped shy of the main shopping street, and there was no funding to extend the arterial - just a little money for design and buying land after 2029.</p>

            <p>"We'll continue to lobby for funding to complete the full route," Lewers said.</p>
        
            <p>Speeding up the arterial's extension depended on the outcome of the talks with government.</p>
        
            <p>These had covered options such as congestion or other user charges, diverting part of any new tourist levy, or central government stepping up more.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether we bring the construction forward or not is completely up to how those options develop, and if they develop," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Nationally, congestion charging depended on legislation changes and new technology being developed by NZTA.</p>
        
            <p>Of the main cities, Auckland was closest to adopting such a charge, where motorists were charged a few dollars per trip on some streets at certain times.</p>
        
            <p>Lewers told RNZ that even the stage that opened on Thursday was enough to unlock business potential, by freeing up the old route in, Stanley Street, for more public transport.</p>
        
            <p>But "full town centre transformation" depended on the two further unfunded phases, he added.</p>
        
            <p>A full arterial including a bypass one block over from the main street had been talked about for 20 years.</p>
        
            <p>Construction of the first phase took several years - it had "taken longer and cost more than we expected", Lewers said.</p>
        
            <p>"But we know this investment is an important one for our future."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown is a tourism bastion but was struggling with inadequate roads and water services.</p>
        
            <p>The government has put road building and tourism among things at the centre of its 2025 plan for growth.</p>
        
            <p>"Tourism has a massive role to play in our growth story - and I want the government to work with the sector to make that happen.," Christopher Luxon said in his State of the Nation speech.</p>
        
            <p>Nicola Willis has listed ways the government will make it easier for tourists to come in.</p>
        
            <p>Lewers has said if tourist numbers went up, "I would expect a very serious investment in actually accommodating those visitors."</p>
        
            <p>Two councillors - one district, one regional - have called for constraints on housing and business development while infrastructure problems are addressed.</p>
        
            <p>Willis had promised to work with communities, and Lewers said she really understood the issues.</p>
