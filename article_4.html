            <p>A Wellington primary school is raffling off tickets to see pop star Taylor Swift in London, with the total first prize worth more than $20,000.</p>
        
            <p>Clyde Quay School's prize includes two premium tickets to the concert on 19 August, flights to London, seven nights of luxury accommodation, and $1500 spending money.</p>
        
            <p>The school's parent-teacher association (PTA) chairperson, Phernne Tancock, said fundraising was tricky in the current economic environment and it was necessary to think outside the box.</p>
        
            <p>Clyde Quay School usually run a travel raffle each year, but with Taylor Swift fever sweeping the country, the PTA joked that tickets to one of her concerts would be a more tempting prize.</p>
        
            <p>What started as a joke soon became reality when a member of the PTA managed to source two of the highly sought-after premier tickets through a concierge friend in London.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we knew we had the golden tickets of our era, we pooled our bake-sale money and the rest is history."</p>
        
            <p>The school are calling the jumbo raffle prize the "Trip of an Era", after Swift's worldwide Era's Tour.</p>
        
            <p>Tickets cost $25, with fewer than 800 of the original 4500 tickets remaining up for grabs as of midday.</p>
        
            <p>All proceeds will go towards an upgrade of their school hall, which will have toilets and a kitchen installed.</p>
        
            <p>The hall also needs to be made suitable for use as a temporary classroom while leaky classrooms are fixed.</p>
