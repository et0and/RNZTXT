            <p>A collaborative research project with scientists in Japan could be the solution to Wellington's quake-prone buildings.</p>
        
            <p>A team at Canterbury University is among the recipients of a $300,000 government grant to investigate earthquake and volcanic disaster resilience.</p>
        
            <p>Engineer Thomas Lim said collegues in Japan have made a lot of progress on retrofitting buildings to make them more resilient to seismic shaking.</p>
        
            <p>The mutli-disciplinary team aims to design modular bracing to strengthen concrete-framed buildings, such as those found to be earthquke-prone in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Fourteen social housing blocks are among about 600 buildings in the capital that need strengthening.</p>
