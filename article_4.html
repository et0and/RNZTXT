"Mild temperatures and clear skies will provide prime dog walking and bike riding weather," MetService says.

            <p>The weekend outlook is fine for most of the country, with no warnings or watches for severe weather in place.</p>
        
            <p>Showers - particularly in upper parts of the South Island and lower North - were expected to mostly fizzle out by the end of Friday, according to forecasts by MetService.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland on Saturday would be "fine, apart from showers in the afternoon", followed by three days of sunny conditions.</p>
        
            <p>A few showers will fall in Tauranga on Saturday, easing by the afternoon, followed by a fine Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton had a chance of showers on Saturday, but would be otherwise fine ahead of a warm and sunny Sunday. Good news for the final day of the Maadi Regatta at nearby Lake Karapiro, MetService said, "without too much more disruption" from the region's famous fog.</p>
        
            <p>The scattered rain across Wellington would clear by the weekend, with nothing but light winds interrupting the summer-like weather on Saturday, and some "fresh northerlies" on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch's sun will come on Saturday, followed by some cloudy cover on Sunday and southerly winds. A similar fate awaits Dunedin, with light winds and sun on Saturday, and a few clouds on Sunday bringing the change of showers.</p>
        
            <p>"Blue skies over Wellington's CubaDupa and Christchurch's Round the Bays will hopefully encourage a bustling turnout," MetService meteorologist Michael Pawley said in an update on the forecaster's website.</p>
        
            <p>"For those without weekend plans, the mild temperatures and clear skies will provide prime dog walking and bike riding weather, and you could even take your Nana for a coffee."</p>
        
            <p>A "deep low and associated front approach slowly from the Tasman Sea" midway through next week, MetService said, with minimal risk of severe weather.</p>
