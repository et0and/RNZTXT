            <p>The health sector is reporting frustration at unchanging mortality rates for babies and mothers in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The annual Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee (PMMRC) report was released on Tuesday by Te Tāhū Hauora Health Quality & Safety Commission, which covers the years 2006-2021.</p>
        
            <p>The report includes reveals nearly 10,000 deaths and hundreds of babies diagnosed with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy (disturbance of brain function).</p>
        
            <p>PMMRC chairperson John Tait told Morning Report unaddressed inequities meant Aotearoa New Zealand's perinatal death rates had remained unchanged for the past 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>That was an ongoing frustration and exhaustion across the sector, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The PMMRC's report series had produced a vast volume of data revealing significant inequities in perinatal clinical outcomes relating to demographic and socio-economic factors, including ethnicity and poverty.</p>
        
            <p>"The main problem that we have is the inequities and if we could somehow address that problem then we may be able to address the perinatal loss," Tait said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we look at Māori, Pacific, Indian, women under the age of 20, and those living in high deprivations, they all have significantly higher perinatal losses than other population groups. And so that's the area that really needs to be looked at."</p>
        
            <p>Tait said this was the fifth review which he had been involved with and he questioned why stakeholders had not implemented changes from previous recommendations over the year.</p>
        
            <p>"We need some meaningful change by the stakeholders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We present it (the report) every year and every year we say these figures are dreadful and then nothing substantial happens".</p>
        
            <p>He urged the government and Ministry of Health to all look at solutions and system changes that could be actioned to address the review's findings.</p>
        
            <p>Some things he believed would help included: Better access to ultra sounds, better access to services, different ways to get services into the community and getting rid of co-payments for ultra-sounds.</p>
        
            <p>He said suicide was the highest cause of maternal deaths and and he felt this was a "resource problem".</p>
        
            <p>He said accessing mental health resources was "extremely difficult" for new mothers.</p>
        
            <p>He believed there were only eight to 10 beds for new mothers with significant mental health issues and there was a need for about 30 such beds nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>The report also found a small, statistically significant trend upwards in neonatal encephalopathy rates.</p>
        
            <p>Those of New Zealand European ethnicity were 67 percent less likely than wāhine Māori to die by suicide.</p>
