            <p>About a year before Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao's body was found on a Greenpark farm, police searched the area and discovered nothing of interest, a court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>Bao, 44, vanished on 19 July 2023, and her remains were found in a shallow grave in farmland on the outskirts of Christchurch in July this year.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Tingjun Cao, 53, is charged with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>Cao sacked his lawyers and is now representing himself at his High Court trial.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the court heard from Senior Constable Dean Stevenson, who was involved in searching the Greenpark farmland six days after Bao was last seen because tyre tracks had been seen on a paddock.</p>
        
            <p>"We searched the boundaries of that farm area on Clarks [Road] Hudsons Road... the boundaries of that property down to an entry place into a paddock and then through some of that paddock area," Stevenson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing of interest was located on that occasion?" Crown prosecutor Pip Currie asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Not that I am aware of," Stevenson said.</p>

            <p>Cao, via an interpreter, asked a number of questions of the witness during cross-examination.</p>
        
            <p>He asked if, during the search of the farm where Bao's remains were later found, Stevenson ever "smelled any scent around that area".</p>
        
            <p>Stevenson said there was plenty of scent around that area from trees and such, but the search team did not pick up any scent of a decaying body.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Justice Lisa Preston told the jury Cao planned to conduct his own defence and that she believed it was in the interests of justice to proceed with the trial.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was no change in Cao's position from the beginning of his trial - that he said the evidence did not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown case was that Cao killed Bao on the day she vanished, after arranging to meet her at a home for sale in Hornby.</p>
