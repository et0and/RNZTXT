            <p>The driver of an Audi A3 escaped a spectacular crash in Hamilton largely unscathed today, after the car went up a bank, through a metal fence and crashed into a parked car, before finally coming to a halt on its side.</p>
        
            <p>Both cars were extensively damaged in the incident, which happened at about 3.20pm at the Hamilton Radiology carpark on Tristram St.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who worked nearby said she heard a loud bang and ran outside to investigate.</p>
        
            <p>"I just heard a loud crash. It was very loud. And I just ran outside to make sure everyone was all right."</p>
        
            <p>The worker said she saw the black Audi on its side and a man climbing out of the driver's side window.</p>
        
            <p>Police, St John and Fire and Emergency attended the scene, but it appeared no-one else was injured or trapped.</p>
        
            <p>It also appeared nobody was in the parked car at the time.</p>
        
            <p>A motorist, who was driving past moments after the crash, said he noticed leaves and grass in the southbound lane as he approached a roundabout near Pak'n'Save.</p>
        
            <p>That was when he saw the Audi crashed through the fence and into the Toyota Yaris.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who declined to be named, said he saw three or four teenagers on the grass bank walking away from the smash and breaking into a jog.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was unclear which direction the car was heading in when it crashed, but a northbound vehicle would have had to cross a grassed and raised traffic island and another lane with oncoming traffic before it could go up the bank and through the fence into the private carpark.</p>
        
            <p>Police at the scene said they were unsure yet exactly what happened.</p>
        
            <p>St John said they dispatched an ambulance and rapid response unit and transported one person in a moderate condition to Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>It was the second crash in a matter of days in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>An earlier incident involved a car crashing into the corner of a two-storey house on River Rd earlier this week, leaving a giant hole in the side of the house.</p>
