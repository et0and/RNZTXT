            <p>Police have identified a man found dead on a remote Far North beach.</p>
        
            <p>The man's body was found by a member of the public at Mitimiti, on Northland's west coast, on 19 December, prompting police to call for help identifying him.</p>
        
            <p>In particular, they wanted to hear from anyone who went fishing near Te Pua Pua Creek, just south of the Whangapē Harbour entrance.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesman said the man had now been identified, and his death had been referred to the Coroner to make a determination on the cause.</p>
        
            <p>A three-day rāhui on fishing and gathering kai moana in the area, declared by the hapū of Mitimiti, Whangapē and Pawarenga, ended on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers of the annual Mātihetihe Marae fishing competition said the event would start as planned on 28 December, but fishing would take place outside the rāhui boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>The contest would start with karakia to acknowledge the tūpāpaku (deceased) and whānau pani (wider family).</p>
