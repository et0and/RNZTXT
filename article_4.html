            <p>Creating a sculpture from fragments of ruined homes is an important step to commemorate the havoc wreaked by Cyclone Gabrielle on the Muriwai community, those involved say.</p>
        
            <p>Their community was shattered with landslips destroying homes and the deaths two volunteer firefighters.</p>
        
            <p>Now, Muriwai residents are using salvaged materials from unliveable category three properties to build a commemorative sculpture - marking the tragic events of almost two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Workshops have been running every Saturday for the past few weeks under the guidance of well known Kiwi artist Jeff Thompson whose works are showcased at Gibbs farm and in Te Papa.</p>
        
            <p>Every Saturday the Muriwai surf club fills with locals who come together to make something beautiful - with the remains of their destroyed homes.</p>

            <p>Sixty-eight homes have been marked as Category three in Muriwai, most of them are in the process of being demolished, while others will be transported elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>The idea of a sculpture made out of salvaged materials was dreamt up to give to those who lost their homes like Pipi and her family.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, we were one of the families who were displaced immediately after the cyclone our house was hit by a landslide from behind."</p>
        
            <p>Pipi was also part of the local rescue efforts on the night of the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>She said the idea of a commemortative sculpture felt right.</p>
        
            <p>"It feels like a good idea and a bit special to make sure that we do have something to commemorate such a - well, remember such a huge event that affected so many people out here."</p>

            <p>Long term resident Erin Griffin is a keen mosaic artist running today's workshop.</p>
        
            <p>Each person gets a tile and then smashes or cuts pieces to fit inside a design of their choice.</p>
        
            <p>They are encouraging residents to bring along their own items to remind them of their old homes.</p>

            <p>"A lot of people are doing what they love about Muriwai sunsets or the numbers of their houses.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gonna be great when it's up and people can go and look at it and and say, well, I did that tile and that plate or that tile was in our bathroom."</p>
        
            <p>Today Pipi's breaking up a tile and using piano keys salvaged from her family home for her piece.</p>
        
            <p>Others like Jacqui have brought along a family sign that used to live outside the front door.</p>

            <p>"This was a a something that we had at the front door and when I went back to see the house just before it was was bulldozed, this was still there, but just lost garden. Yeah. When this came along I thought ohh, I know what I'll use."</p>
        
            <p>Jacqui said for a while things have felt extremely lonely in Muriwai but the workshops have been a chance to take her mind off things and simply have fun.</p>
        
            <p>"Last week, there was a different group here and I got asked to join their book club, so that was lovely there's a real vibe here of people who know and love the community this is a really powerful doing this."</p>

            <p>For Lead artist Jeff Thomson it was a no brainer when he was asked to be part of the project.</p>
        
            <p>"I never even hesitated to say no I just said yes straight away."</p>
        
            <p>He came up with several ideas for the sculpture but said there was one clear winner as voted by the community.</p>
        
            <p>His vision for the end product is five or six abstract standing columns up to four metres high made up of all sorts of materials from bricks and tiles to taps and letterbox numbers.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson has been granted permission to go into demolished homes to photograph and collect material for the sculpture.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just empty shells of houses, it's very sad, actually, when you think people used to live there and they've had to move out and move on, certainly has changed a huge number of people's lives.</p>
        
            <p>"For me, it's been a very humbling experience I'm very aware of the fact that there's a little bit of sacredness of these sites."</p>

            <p>Ground works are underway next to the Muriwai Ranger's Station for the sculpture and it is hoped about three of the columns will be unveiled in time to mark the two year anniversary of Cyclone Gabrielle on 13 February.</p>
        
            <p>Before the final project will finish up at the end of March depending on whether they can reach their fundraising goal of $22,000.</p>
