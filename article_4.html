            <p>An imported brand of baby biscuits has been recalled because they may contain animal droppings.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety says the Morinaga brand Manna Bolo baby biscuits should not be eaten.</p>
        
            <p>"The concern with these biscuits is that they are marketed at babies and young children, who could get seriously sick from bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella if they swallow animal droppings," deputy director-general Vincent said.</p>
        
            <p>"These products should not be eaten. People can return them to the place of purchase for a refund or, if that's not possible, throw them away."</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms of salmonellosis and E. coli infection include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fever, headache, nausea, and throwing up.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone concerned their child has eaten the biscuits was advised to contact their health professional or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for free advice.</p>
        
            <p>So far there are no reports of illness or complaints, Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>The biscuits are sold nationwide at Wholesale Club stores and ethnic supermarkets and have been removed from shelves. They have not been re-exported.</p>
        
            <p>"Japanese food safety authorities are responsible for this matter, and we have not been informed which type of animal dropping this might be," Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>The products were also recalled in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p>
