            <p>Police have been in contact with the family of Baby Ru following RNZ's story about the case, after nearly three months of no communication.</p>
        
            <p>The toddler, now known as Nga Reo Te Huatahi Reremoana Ahipene-Wall, died of serious head injuries at Hutt Hospital in October.</p>
        
            <p>No-one has yet been charged over his death - the result of blunt force trauma to his head, either inflicted by a weapon or by slamming his tiny skull on a hard floor or table, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau told RNZ they had not been given a police update since early January and were upset it was taking so long.</p>
        
            <p>The toddler's great aunt Sarah Jane Reremoana told RNZ earlier this week that the lack of progress was frustrating for the whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts are shattered, especially not hearing from the police since early January."</p>
        
            <p>But on Friday, Nga Reo's uncle Ngatanahira Reremoana said police had been in touch following the publicity.</p>
        
            <p>"Our family are still devastated and still healing. It's been five months today and it's just like it happened yesterday."</p>

            <p>They were also waiting for Oranga Tamariki's review into the case, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki said the report was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>In a written statement to RNZ, chief social worker Peter Whitcombe said the death of Baby Ru was "a tragedy", and their thoughts were with his whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to work alongside other agencies to review our collective response to Nga Reo and his whānau."</p>
        
            <p>"While the police investigation continues, we are very limited in what we can comment on publicly."</p>
