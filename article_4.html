            <p>City Gardens Apartments in central Auckland was issued with a dangerous building notice last week due to fire risks.</p>
        
            <p>The building's body corporate is confident that the notice can be lifted today and that residents won't need to move out.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of the 16-storey apartment building were told by Auckland Council they would need to vacate the building by Monday 22 April due to significant fire safety risks.</p>
        
            <p>Today, they will find out whether they need to leave their homes, depending on whether the issues - including defects with fire alarms and escape routes - have been resolved, and the building passing a council inspection.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands that contractors have been brought on over the past week to fix the issues, with staff from several fire protection companies on site yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>The body corporate's lawyer Tim Rainey told Morning Report he was confident the issues had been fixed, and that the dangerous building notice could be lifted today.</p>
        
            <p>"Fire experts have assured me last evening that all of the work necessary to make the building continue to be safe for operation has now been done, and we're pretty confident this morning - when the council inspects we're going to have the notice lifted.</p>
        
            <p>"But in any event, where things sit at the moment, I can assure the residents and occupants of the building that it's safe and they won't have to move out prior to Monday next week," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The building has not had a warrant of fitness since 2017, and in August 2023, a fire and emergency audit found a raft of compliance breaches including inadequate fire protections between apartments and different levels, defective fire alarm and sprinkler systems and a low-pressure fire hydrant that would struggle to tackle fire on the upper floors of the building.</p>
        
            <p>A more recent inspection by Fire and Emergency early this month found that a sprinkler had been set off in the building without triggering the building alarm or notifying fire crews, and car park stairs were open to potential car fires which could block the way of the apartment building.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said it was working on remedial work with the building owners.</p>
        
            <p>Council building consents manager Ian McCormick told Morning Report recent events at the building heightened council's respons, including a sprinkler activation that did not trigger the fire alarm.</p>
        
            <p>He said the building had had a raft of maintenance, plumbing and fire protection issues over many years.</p>
