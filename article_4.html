            <p>An Otago community at risk of flooding, earthquakes and liquefaction has generally high levels of readiness - but newcomers and visitors may not be as resilient, a new report has found.</p>
        
            <p>Strategic planning is underway to help communities at the head of Lake Whakatipu, including Glenorchy, adapt to natural hazards.</p>
        
            <p>The Otago Regional Council has released the first phase of its socio-economic impact assessment, which found the community was well-functioning and motivated.</p>
        
            <p>The community had access to a range of skills and resources to support them in the short term, but it was likely they would need external support to respond and recover in the longer term.</p>
        
            <p>"The community is largely aware of the unpredictability of nature and that living in the area means being susceptible to natural hazard events. Most research participants demonstrated a high level of preparedness," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>It detailed a number of vulnerable sections of the community, including tourists, older people, temporary or low-income workers, the unemployed and families without extended family in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The community had become increasingly reliant on tourism and hospitality, both of which were susceptible to natural hazards given the expected impacts on the environment and access, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"A major natural hazard event also has a potential to impact visitor confidence to return to the area. A key issue for the community both socially and economically is therefore the resilience of access to/from, and within the Head of Lake Whakatipu area, as this is key to the community's social and economic wellbeing."</p>
        
            <p>Otago Regional Council natural hazards manager Jean-Luc Payan said the assessment would inform their work and the strategy, and it was requested by the community.</p>
        
            <p>"This study highlights the depth of local knowledge and resources in the community, and an already high level of resilience, as well as some vulnerabilities.</p>
        
            <p>"Adaptation planning is community-centred, so this report helps both the council and community make more informed decisions about how to adapt."</p>
        
            <p>The report built on the technical studies and engagement with the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It gathers information on the social and economic baseline of the community and explores how social and economic wellbeing could be impacted by natural hazard events.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes community cohesion and readiness, awareness of the hazards, the risks they present, and the ability to recover from a natural hazard event," Payan said.</p>
        
            <p>Glenorchy Community Association chairperson John Glover said the study captured the lived experience and knowledge base of the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working as a community on a number of fronts to increase our readiness, resilience, and subsequent response to the natural hazards that all of us living here are very much aware of."</p>
        
            <p>The assessment will be presented to the council's safety and resilience committee on Wednesday.</p>
