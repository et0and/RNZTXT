            <p>If you thought naming your beloved pooch or feline Luna was innovative think again - as it's the most popular pet name in New Zealand for the sixth year in a row.</p>
        
            <p>The most popular pet names for 2024 have been revealed by the New Zealand Companion Animal Register (NZCAR), including classics such as Bella, Milo and Charlie.</p>
        
            <p>NZCAR noted a growing trend in pets being named Bluey, Bandit, Bingo and Chilli due to the popular children's show Bluey.</p>
        
            <p>The top ten names for pets in 2024 are Luna, Bella, Milo, Charlie, Coco, Daisy, Poppy, Nala, Molly and Frankie.</p>
        
            <p>Along with animals named after the show Bluey appearing in the register this year, New Zealanders continued to name their pets after characters from The Lord of the Rings franchise with 17 Frodo's being registered, 13 Bilbo's, two Gollum's and one Gandalf.</p>
        
            <p>Pet names possibly inspired by the All Blacks' included 20 Ardie's, 18 TJ's and seven Razor's, NZCAR said.</p>
        
            <p>It was fascinating to see how popular culture shaped pet names each year, NZCAR general manager David Lloyd said.</p>
