            <p>Auckland has experienced it's driest March for 15 years and there's a warning that mandatory water restrictions could be implemented as soon as June.</p>
        
            <p>Storage in Auckland's dams has dropped below 60 percent after their catchments in the Hūnua and Waitākere Ranges experienced the driest March since 2010.</p>
        
            <p>At this time of year levels would normally be at 74.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare head of water Sharon Danks told Morning Report the soil was really dry around Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>While Auckland has had some rain lately, Danks said it probably would not be enough to start filling the dams again.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's seven-day average water demand was currently 472 million litres per day.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklanders should be conservative with their water use before mandatory restrictions in June, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Think about things like shorter showers - if everyone reduced their showers by a minute, then we'd save 20 million litres a day.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're watering your garden use trigger nozzle, water the garden at night time when the evaporation is less and things like that."</p>
        
            <p>Watercare was maximising flows from the Waikato River source as opposed to the dams, she said.</p>
        
            <p>While Watercare was hoping not to need future restrictions, it would be somewhat reliant on the weather over the next few months.</p>
        
            <p>Rainfall was forecast to be average to dry over the next couple of months.</p>
        
            <p>"It's better not to have mandatory restrictions so if we can do all we can before June to reduce water demands than that would be great."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland councillor Richard Hills, chair of the policy and planning committee, said Watercare was keeping the council well informed - "they're fixing leaks in record time and their water savings messages are working well".</p>
        
            <p>"But we are relying on all Aucklanders to help out by reporting leaks and continuing to prevent water wastage. If we all do our bit, we can make a huge difference."</p>
