        <h2>New Plymouth wastewater officials fed up with 'fatbergs'</h2>
        <p>

            <p>New Plymouth officials say they're fed up with "fatbergs", after the congealed masses that caused roughly 70 percent of local wastewater network blockages last year.</p>
        
            <p>Fatbergs are large solid masses that form in pipes from fats, oils and grease washed down kitchen sinks, said New Plymouth District Council Three Waters Network Manager Jaco Beeslaar.</p>
        
            <p>Along the way it collects random items also flushed into the wastewater system, such as wet wipes and sanitary products, to cause larger and messier clogs.</p>
        
            <p>"Our team dealt with 125 blockages in 2024, most of which could had been avoided.</p>
        
            <p>"We've already had to clear seven fatbergs since the New Year alone."</p>
        
            <p>In early January there were two wastewater overflows at The Valley shopping centre at Waiwhakaiho, said Jaco, caused by food fat from a privately owned sewer pipe entering the network.</p>

            <p>"Sewage overflows can contaminate the soil and streams, and people might not be able to swim or collect kai for a while in the affected area. It also costs money to remove the blockage and clean up the site," said Jaco.</p>
        
            <p>The council are imploring locals to remember to only flush the three Ps: pee, poo and toilet paper.</p>
        
            <p>Before washing plates and roasting pans scrape cooking fat into your food scraps bin or compost and place strainers in your sink to catch food scraps, said Jaco.</p>
        
            <p>"It'd be great if we could end 2025 with a lot fewer blockages than last year - which is something the public can help us with."</p>
        
            <p>Each year the local New Plymouth Wastewater Treatment Plant treats about eight million cubic metres of wastewater - the equivalent of four billion two-litre milk bottles.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth District Council maintains 631km of wastewater pipes, serving nearly 26,000 properties.</p>
