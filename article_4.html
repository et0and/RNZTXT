            <p>Three men have been arrested after large vegetation fires in Waipawa earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Three significant fires were sparked from fireworks being shot out of the window of a vehicle as it drove along Hautope Road on 7 September.</p>
        
            <p>The flames were then fanned by strong winds.</p>
        
            <p>The three 23-year-old men from Hawke's Bay will appear in the Hastings District Court on Tuesday with charges of arson.</p>
