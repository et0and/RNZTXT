            <p>A Marlborough gymnastics coach has admitted to sexually assaulting several young girls over the past decade in Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>Gregory Pask pleaded guilty in the Blenheim District Court today to 29 charges of sexual offending against several girls, and producing objectionable material in Blenheim between 2014 and September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough CIB Detective Sergeant Ash Clarke said Pask was a well-known figure in the Blenheim community and had continual contact with children and young people for many years.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to appear for a further hearing on 5 March and will be sentenced in April 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke said while Pask had pleaded guilty, he understood no convictions would take back what had happened to the victims.</p>
        
            <p>Police believed there might be more people affected by Pask's offending and asked anyone affected to come forward and report it to them.</p>
        
            <p>Clarke said victims could contact police on 105 or visit their local police station and quote the file number 230903/8087.</p>
