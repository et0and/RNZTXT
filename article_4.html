        <h2>Bendy bus to be tested on Wellington's most popular route</h2>
        <p>
Buses on the number 2 route will get longer instead of higher, as the Karori and Seatoun tunnels cannot accommodate double-deckers.

            <p>A bendy bus will hit Wellington's streets next week to test their future use on the city's most popular route.</p>
        
            <p>The number 2 bus runs between Karori and Miramar/Seatoun and is the capital's busiest bus to catch, with demand for it still increasing.</p>
        
            <p>Double decker buses cannot be added to deal with the demand due to the size of the Karori and Seatoun tunnels.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, five electric articulated buses (commonly known as bendy buses) will be introduced next year to run between Karori and the end of Courtenay Place.</p>
        
            <p>To test the infrastructure along the route, Metlink will drive a bendy bus - borrowed from Auckland - on 23 and 24 January.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second time a trial such as this has been tested on the route, with similar testing having been done in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a test of common diversion routes during road closures to confirm suitability.</p>
        
            <p>The bendy buses will have 65 percent more capacity than the current buses on the number 2 route.</p>
