            <p>Wallabies,  an Australian pest, could  cause millions of dollars of damage to farmland and a new indication there's one near Cambridge is causing concern.</p>
        
            <p>How it got there, no one is sure, but it might have had human help.  </p>
        
            <p>Waikato senior biosecurity officer Dave Byers told Afternoons a local resident who has also lived in Tasmania (where wallabies are abundant) was certain about spotting one on the side of a road. </p>
        
            <p>Specially trained dogs from the Ministry of Primary Industries were taken to the area and twice indicated they could detect a wallaby had been there. </p>
        
            <p>It was likely to be a single animal which was a long way from where they were usually found on the other side of the Kaimai Ranges. </p>
        
            <p>"It's likely to be an escaped pet or one someone has intentionally liberated over there."</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies were a pest because they ate pasture needed by other animals and they damaged the understory of native forests, eating seedlings. </p>
        
            <p>"They're not too selective about what they eat, and they eat things down very low to the ground."</p>
        
            <p>Wallabies had often been kept as pets in the past but people were more aware now they shouldn't.  </p>
        
            <p>One was not too much of a threat to the environment but the area would continue to be monitored, Byers said. </p>
        
            <p>"The ideal would be that we would be able to locate it and shoot it on sight and that will be problem solved." </p>
        
            <p>Wallabies are prominent in South Canterbury in the South Island while in the North Island the Bay of Plenty is their stronghold, especially around the lakes and the Whakarewarewa Forest. </p>
        
            <p>MPI, Department of Conservation and the Waikato Regional Council were working together to try and prevent them taking hold in Waikato. </p>
        
            <p>Anyone who spotted one should report it, Byers said. People could Google 'Report a wallaby' and use the link to provide details of the sighting. </p>
