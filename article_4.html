            <p>More nutritional supplements will soon be available for people with inherited metabolic diseases.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac is funding a wider range of supplements - including some for the first time - from 1 February.</p>
        
            <p>Inherited metabolic diseases are genetic, lifelong conditions that can cause compounds in the body to build up to toxic levels and lead to adverse effects such as cognitive impairment.</p>
        
            <p>Those with such diseases often need to follow very restrictive diets and use specific supplements to meet their nutritional needs, Pharmac's pharmaceuticals director Geraldine MacGibbon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that people living with inherited metabolic diseases, like phenylketonuria, will benefit from a greater choice of supplements to support their health and wellbeing," MacGibbon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect approximately 120 people in New Zealand will use these supplements in the first full year of funding, increasing by approximately three to four people each year."</p>
        
            <p>It was pleasing to offer more treatment options considering the "significant restraints" of Pharmac's budget and its ability to make new investments, MacGibbon said.</p>
        
            <p>The new treatments, supplied by Cortex Health and Vitaflo, were suitable for people with a range of diseases including:</p>
        
            <p>Advocacy groups and clinicians provided feedback in response to Pharmac's original proposal to fund the supplements, MacGibbon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard there is more to consider regarding access to these treatments, so we will continue these conversations with the health sector and the affected communities."</p>
