            <p>Looking for love on Valentine's Day could end up breaking the bank and your heart.</p>
        
            <p>BNZ fraud investigator Nicholas Vryenhoek said romance scams were more common than people thought, especially around Valentine's Day, when lonely hearts might be most vulnerable to a sophisticated scam.</p>
        
            <p>"These scams affect people across all walks of life - young, elderly, professionals, retirees - no-one's really safe from these," he said. "Scammers are incredibly sophisticated at targeting people when they're most emotionally vulnerable, unfortunately."</p>
        
            <p>While relationship scams primarily involved romantic relationships, criminals also exploited friendships.</p>
        
            <p>He said anyone could become a victim, as criminals would go to great lengths to provide evidence to support their fake personas, including bogus social media profiles and doctored documents, like boarding passes or letters from fake employers.</p>
        
            <p>One of the best defences was to avoid keeping the romance secret and beware of any requests for money.</p>
        
            <p>"Share it with people and, if there are warning signs that you might have missed because you're emotionally invested, they'll spot them for you."</p>
