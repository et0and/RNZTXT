            <p>One of the leaders of the Gloriavale Christian Community has told an inquest into the death of a young man in 2018 that he never saw any serious bullying of him.</p>
        
            <p>Sincere Standtrue, 20, was found unresponsive in Gloriavale's paint shop where he worked, in October 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Standtrue later died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Alexandra Cunninghame was presiding over the inquest into his death in Greymouth, which included whether his death was accidental or self-inflicted, and his mindset at the time he died.</p>
        
            <p>Today the inquest heard from Peter Righteous, a servant or senior leader, at the community.</p>
        
            <p>Righteous was a teacher at Gloriavale between 1986 and 2022, and was one of Standtrue's teachers for four years when Standtrue was aged between 10 and 14.</p>
        
            <p>He said Standtrue was hard of hearing and often did not wear his hearing aid. He described Standtrue as slow.</p>
        
            <p>Righteous said they did, however, have experience in dealing with people with disabilities, and took care to help Standtrue.</p>
        
            <p>In response to a question over whether Sincere was bullied by the other students at Gloriavale, he said he thought the interactions were typical for primary aged kids.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a bit of teasing, a bit of ragging, but on the whole Standtrue seemed to get on well with the other children.</p>
        
            <p>"Boys will do things behind your back but I never saw any outright bullying ugly behaviour. They all teased each other. I never saw any outright ugly bullying of Sincere Standtrue, and if I had seen some I would have dealt with it."</p>
        
            <p>The inquest has heard previously from Standtrue's sister Rose, that he was often isolated, shamed, bullied and beaten at the Christian community.</p>

            <p>Brian Henry, the lawyer for Rose, asked Righteous why Standtrue had been denied the opportunity to take Gloriavale's commitment vow.</p>
        
            <p>Henry said the commitment vow was a rite of passage.</p>
        
            <p>People in the Gloriavale Christian Community could not marry unless they have taken the vow.</p>
        
            <p>Righteous said the opportunity was delayed, not denied, and Standtrue needed further growth to manage his anger.</p>
        
            <p>He said Standtrue was having issues with his anger, and he could not take the vow until he had more maturity.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the points for the commitment vow was for our women folk. There was no way anyone could marry Sincere Standtrue if he had anger issues."</p>
        
            <p>He said Standtrue would have had guidance on the issue from a older member of the community who lived in the same accommodation block, and there was talk of him doing an external anger management course.</p>
        
            <p>The Coroner Alexandra Cunninghame asked Righteous about Sincere Standtrue's personality and temper.</p>
        
            <p>She asked Righteous would describe Sincere as impulsive.</p>
        
            <p>Righteous said he would, and referred to an incident in which he had thrown a sewing machine over a railing, and incidents where he saw him lash out at people in anger.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
