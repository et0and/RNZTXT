            <p>Paid parking signs have been popping up around Tauranga despite the council pausing plans to extend parking charges.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, 22 January, contractors installed signs for paid parking on Tauranga's city fringe.</p>
        
            <p>About 22 signs were erected on Monmouth St, Anson St, McLean St and The Strand at a cost of $4600.</p>
        
            <p>This is despite Tauranga City Council delaying plans to extend the paid parking from Third Avenue up to Arundel Street, and from McLean Street up to Monmouth Street.</p>
        
            <p>The charges were meant to come into force on 26 February, but a decision to delay them was made at a meeting in November.</p>
        
            <p>Commission chair Anne Tolley said there was a "huge amount" of community concern about the parking.</p>
        
            <p>The commission was not convinced of a case for extending the paid parking in the CBD when there was still a lot of parks available, Tolley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Normally you put paid parking in when you're trying to manage [spaces] and get turnover.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got good turnover in the centre of the city, so there's no need to try and extend that at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Council parking strategy manager Reece Wilkinson said the job for erecting the signs was logged in early October before the commission postponed the extension.</p>
        
            <p>"It has slipped through the system and the signs are being removed today [Tuesday]."</p>
        
            <p>The cost of the installation was included in the council's general maintenance work but worked out to be around $4600, including GST, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilkinson said the council would know the exact number of signs incorrectly installed by the end of the day when removal was complete.</p>
        
            <p>The commission will be reviewing the parking strategy in March.</p>
