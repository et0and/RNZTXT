'And to Clarke, let's finally get married,' Ardern said when she left politics.

            <p>Former Prime Minister Dame Jacinda Ardern and fianc√© Clarke Gayford have been engaged since 2019, but called off their wedding ceremony amid the Covid-19 Omicron outbreak in January 2022. Will they get their happy day this summer?</p>
        
            <p>There's been coalition talks with Winston Peters, a Premiership, a baby, a pandemic, a landslide victory and a shock resignation - so a little old wedding to her long time love should be a stroll up the aisle for Dame Jacinda Ardern.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald understands the former prime minister, 43, and her TV presenter beau Clarke Gayford, 47, will wed this month.</p>
        
            <p>Gayford laughed when the Herald asked about the nuptials this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't believe you thought you could call up and I'd just tell you all."</p>
        
            <p>The Gisborne native said he had "nothing to add", while Ardern couldn't be contacted.</p>
        
            <p>Others with knowledge of the ceremony are also remaining tight-lipped about the wedding's details.</p>
        
            <p>But the Herald has been told the event will take place at a vineyard in Hawke's Bay - more than 200km away from their originally planned ceremony which was scuttled by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>No bookings are available to the public on the day of the wedding in mid-January.</p>
        
            <p>The invite list is set to feature many of Ardern's former colleagues in the now-opposition Labour Party; including party leader Chris Hipkins.</p>
        
            <p>The couple began dating in 2014 after Gayford, a marine enthusiast and host of Fish of the Day and Moving Houses, contacted the then-Labour list MP about proposed legislation in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>Gayford popped the question five years later with his grandmother's ring on Mokotahi Hill in northern Hawke's Bay, as Diplomatic Protection Service officers kept watch nearby and a local dog tried to eat the chocolate he'd packed for the occasion.</p>

            <p>The cliff-top proposal came 10 months after the birth of the couple's daughter Neve and 18 months after Ardern became the country's second youngest Prime Minister when the then-Labour Party leader formed a coalition with Peters'-helmed NZ First.</p>
        
            <p>They'd made no plans "at all" for the wedding, Ardern told media after news of the engagement broke almost two weeks after the Easter proposal, when a ring was spotted on her left middle finger during a ceremony at Pike River.</p>
        
            <p>"I have absolutely no idea", she said, when asked when the wedding would be.</p>
        
            <p>Her words would prove prescient.</p>
        
            <p>Less than a year later the Covid-19 pandemic kicked off a round of restrictions that included lockdowns, border closures to those without citizenship or residency, and an at-times oversubscribed managed quarantine system for Kiwis coming home.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's wedding would eventually be booked for the 2022 summer, with the venue understood to be the farm homestead at Nick's Head Station, 25km south of Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>The luxury rural estate, at which Grammy Award-winner Lorde was also understood to be on hand to entertain the couple's loved ones and friends, is owned by US hedge fund billionaire John Griffin and his wife Amy.</p>
        
            <p>But the arrival of the Omicron variant in late January 2022 and subsequent move to the red traffic light system - which restricted gatherings to fewer than 100 - spoiled the pair's plans.</p>
        
            <p>"Such is life", Ardern said of their decision to call off the wedding.</p>
        
            <p>"I am no different to, dare I say, thousands of other New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>The three-time Mt Albert MP had previously described herself as "the least-engaged bride", with Gayford in charge of organising the nuptials, but vowed there were no plans to delay their vows indefinitely.</p>
        
            <p>When she resigned as prime minister almost a year ago, citing exhaustion, the bride-to-be included a special message to Gayford alongside promises to try and find ways to "keep working for New Zealand" and take Neve to her first day of school.</p>
        
            <p>"And to Clarke, let's finally get married."</p>
