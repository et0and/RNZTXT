            <p>Robyn Malcolm has won a best actress award at a film festival in France.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm won the award, in the International Panorama section, at the SÃ©ries Mania Film Festival in Lille.</p>
        
            <p>She was recognised for her performance in After the Party, a series she co-created with writer Dianne Taylor.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time an entry from New Zealand had been considered for an award at the festival.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm said it was a proud moment after she decided 10 years ago to stay in Aotearoa because she was committed to telling New Zealand stories.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a long way away and you really feel that when you're in a festival in the middle of France. You feel a long way away.</p>
        
            <p>"But the fact that that story connected - and it really connected to predominantly French people who were watching it - just made New Zealand feel really close. So it was wonderful, wonderful."</p>
        
            <p>After the Party follows Penny, played by Malcolm, who accuses her husband Phil of a sex crime against a teenager - but no one believes her.</p>
        
            <p>The festival described Malcolm and her co-star Peter Mullan as an "incredible pair" who "deliver a remarkable story about the weight of accusation and truth".</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm said the award has motivated her to create more stories to connect with different audiences.</p>
        
            <p>"This kind of recognition is just proof that the story and the show connected," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's what's driving us now, is that we're going 'OK, so, what are some other stories that we can tell that will have meaning for us and for an audience?'"</p>
        
            <p>Cuts being made in the film and TV industry would make it even harder to tell those stories, she said.</p>
