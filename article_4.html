            <p>Most New Zealand universities' enrolments fell in 2023, but Lincoln University has reported strong growth.</p>
        
            <p>Its annual report showed it had more than 3000 full-time students, a figure it last reported in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Enrolments at the campus near Christchurch last year were 24 percent higher than the year before. Close to half the total were postgraduate students.</p>
        
            <p>Lincoln's annual report said it made an operating surplus of $1.6 million last year.</p>
        
            <p>The university, which specialises in agricultural and environmental subjects, said enrolments have continued to grow this year.</p>
        
            <p>A briefing from the Tertiary Education Commission earlier this year warned higher education and research were at risk from university cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Some universities have reported losses and have been making large cuts to staffing and courses.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Otago in March reported an enrolment drop for the third year running. Massey has cut more than 600 courses after declaring a deficit of $45.5 million last year.</p>
