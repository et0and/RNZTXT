            <p>New Zealand has been granted official access to a global network of satellites to support rapid disaster responses.</p>
        
            <p>NEMA - the national emergency management agency - received "user status" from the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The satellites have already been used by Foreign Affairs in the response to the lethal landslides in Papua New Guinea in May.</p>
        
            <p>The charter is a venture between 17 space agencies, and is run currently out of Canada and Germany.</p>
        
            <p>Ottowa recently allocated more than billion dollars to its space agency.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand already got charter satellite help twice at home in 2011, following the Christchurch quake and the Rena oil spill.</p>
        
            <p>The charter wrote to NEMA on 3 July with a user guide "in case your organisation requests a charter activation for support to a major disaster in your country", an OIA response showed.</p>
        
            <p>Joining the charter group was a key objective following Cyclone Gabrielle, NEMA said.</p>
        
            <p>"Activating [it]... is crucial for accessing freely available data during immediate response periods."</p>
