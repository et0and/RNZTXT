            <p>Warning: The contents of this story discusses suicide</p>
        
            <p>Bruises on Pauline Hanna's arm could show she was grabbed and held before she died.</p>
        
            <p>The murder trial of former eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne is continuing at the High Court at Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is accused of killing Hanna, his wife, and staging her death to look like a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Kilak Kesha was called to the witness box on Tuesday morning to outline the post-mortem he performed on Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>"Before the post mortem starts we do a complete body CT scan, then we start with an external examination," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"After that's completed, I do an internal examination where I systematically dissect every organ."</p>
        
            <p>During the external examination, Kesha noted marks on Hanna's eyelids and face.</p>
        
            <p>"[There were] small pinpoint red contusions or haemorrhages," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We commonly see them when there's an obstruction to the neck veins, when you occlude these superficial veins the blood continues to go to the head, but it can't come back, [which causes ruptures]."</p>
        
            <p>He also noted that Hanna's tongue was protruding past her teeth.</p>
        
            <p>"We commonly see protruding tongues during hangings," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When there's a hanging the larynx is pushed up and back, forcing the tongue to come forward."</p>
        
            <p>Hanna also had scrapes and marks on her nose and right arm.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see on the bridge of her nose some discolouration or markings, and on the left side of the nose you can see some discolouration," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of reasons [that can happen], she may have fallen and hit her nose, or someone may have struck her nose."</p>
        
            <p>On her arm, bruises indicated she may have been grabbed.</p>
        
            <p>"We see [bruises like these] quite often if someone is held and those are the finger marks on the arm," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You're not saying they are, but they could be?" Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey asked.</p>
        
            <p>"That's correct," Kesha replied.</p>
        
            <p>Kesha explained the bruises had not yellowed at the time of his examination. He said yellowing typically occurred after three days.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
