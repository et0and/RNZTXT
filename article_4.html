            <p>People are being asked to avoid central Taupō after a gas leak.</p>
        
            <p>The police said cordons were in place in a 800-metre radius around Horomatangi Street and south to the lakefront.</p>
        
            <p>They included the intersections of Horomatangi Street, Ruapehu, Tamamutu, and Titiraupenga Streets, and the lakefront.</p>
        
            <p>Those in buildings in that area were being told to stay inside with the windows closed and air conditioning off.</p>
        
            <p>Two fire and emergency crews were called to the scene at 9.30am. One has since left.</p>
        
            <p>More to come ...</p>
