        <h2>Supply ship heads to Chatham Islands with much-needed fuel</h2>
        <p>
The island group, 800km east of the South Island, had run out of petrol after bad weather forced a barge to turn around.

            <p>A ship has left Nelson bound for the Chatham Islands with diesel supplies - and a small amount of petrol.</p>
        
            <p>The Chatham Islands had run out of petrol and its diesel supplies are running low after bad weather forced a barge to turn around earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Another ship, the Seaworker, was expected to arrive on the island with supplies on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Monique Croon said there was a chance this vessel's journey could also be disrupted by bad weather, but residents were confident the ship would make it.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, there was about a week's worth of fuel left on the island.</p>
