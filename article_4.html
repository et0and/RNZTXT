            <p>Two men have been arrested after fleeing police in a stolen car - towing a caravan - in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Police were told the vehicle had been stolen from a Khandallah address just after 5am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>They attempted to lay road spikes but the driver dodged the spikes.</p>

            <p>Police said they allegedly drove at the officer who laid them, but the officer was not harmed.</p>
        
            <p>A vehicle pursuit was initiated but abandoned by police.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle - which tipped the caravan - continued south through Northland and down into Aro Valley.</p>
        
            <p>
The men eventually crashed the car near Grant Road after damaging multiple parked vehicles.

            <p>Mark Dean is on holiday from Canada and was woken to the commotion outside.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard a loud bang about 5.15(am), there was a police car... no sirens, just his lights, and I believe he had a colleague down the bottom. I believe the bang got worse and then I went out to have a look and there was a car coming down and ended up with that blue car being crushed at the bottom and the police then went away."</p>
        
            <p>"The chap whose car it was says it started on another road up here and it seemed like it was a random act of demolition going down the street," Dean said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was disappointed something like this has happened while he was on holiday.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't expecting anything like that in that sense , it's a quiet street normally and the people have been fabulous," Dean said.</p>
        
            <p>Danuka Gunawardena said he was surprised when he came outside on Tuesday morning and saw all the destruction.</p>
        
            <p>"It's looking really terrible, a lot of cars have been damaged on the side of the road. Luckily our car is not. But there's like 10 cars probably damaged on the road," Gunawardena said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to park my car outside at all going forward," Gunawardena said.</p>
