            <p>Greytown's drinking water infrastructure is at increasing risk of failure.</p>
        
            <p>Its only bore is in such a poor condition that Wellington Water said it was "in too fragile state to take offline to undertake an upgrade" in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are now being asked what multimillion dollar solution they would prefer for Greytown.</p>
        
            <p>The cost would be shared by all South Wairarapa ratepayers who can be connected to district water supply.</p>
        
            <p>The cheapest option on the table was to build an additional bore in Soldiers Memorial Park, utilising existing infrastructure, at a cost of $3-4 million.</p>
        
            <p>This proposal would remove the temporary container for the existing plant from the main car park and replace it with a new containerised plant located away from the parking area, returning the carpark to the community.</p>
        
            <p>The other options were to build a new water treatment plant and bore on the old borough council yard on West St for between $5.8-6.8m, or to buy new land in the Kuratāwhiti St area and build a new water treatment plant and bore for between $6.1-$7.3m.</p>
        
            <p>Greytown's existing water infrastructure was at Soldiers Memorial Park.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the existing bore pump and motor were "in a very poor condition, at increasing risk of failure, and needs replacement".</p>
        
            <p>The ageing treatment plant and equipment were also in a very poor condition and needed to be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, it is not possible to undertake maintenance of the existing pump or bore without disrupting water supply to Greytown.</p>
        
            <p>Without regular maintenance, the bore is an an increase risk of failure.</p>
        
            <p>Last April, Wellington Water ran an initial engagement with the intent to build a new bore within Soldiers Memorial Park, but this was knocked back by a council committee due to the cultural and historical significance of the site.</p>
        
            <p>The site was bought by the Greytown Borough Council in 1919 to serve as a war memorial.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a view that the proposal lacked a strategic approach to investment in Greytown's water treatment and delivery.</p>
        
            <p>Should this option be progressed, the timeframe to build was estimated to be 1-2 years.</p>
        
            <p>Should the council choose to pursue the old borough council yard option on West St, it would take 2-3 years to consent and build.</p>
        
            <p>This parcel of land was home to the Greytown Menz Shed and its future use was a bone of contention for many in the Greytown community last triennium.</p>
        
            <p>Some wanted the land to be sold for commercial development and others wanted it retained.</p>
        
            <p>The final water project option involved buying new land in the Kuratāwhiti St area and would have an estimated construction timeframe of 3-5 years.</p>
        
            <p>New wastewater and stormwater connections would be needed for each option.</p>
        
            <p>The council froze new connections to wastewater this year because the Greytown wastewater plant is at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>In its consultation, which launched on Monday, people were asked whether the project should be funded through a district-wide targeted rate or a mix of this and a Greytown targeted rate.</p>
        
            <p>Under a district-wide targeted rate, the most expensive option would add up to $146 to the annual rates bill.</p>
        
            <p>The cheapest option would add up to $80 per year.</p>
        
            <p>For the mixed targeted rates option, Greytown ratepayers would pay up to $275 for the most expensive option while residents living in the other South Wairarapa towns would pay up to $80.</p>
        
            <p>The project is listed in the council's Enhanced Annual Plan for this year and is partially budgeted for.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation would close on 9 October.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the consultation, the council would host a public event at Soldiers Memorial Park on Saturday, 28 September between 10am - 12pm.</p>
