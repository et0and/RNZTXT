            <p>Auckland's City Rail Link has had its first test run overnight, with the train successfully travelling from Waitematā Station on the Western/North Auckland Line.</p>
        
            <p>The city's underground rail network officially opens in 2026, with significant testing and work being undertaken beforehand.</p>
        
            <p>A three carriage train left Britomart going under Auckland Central and past new stations at Te Waihorotiu and Karanga-a-Hape, to Maungawhau Station.</p>
        
            <p>It was travelling deliberately slowly to allow technicians to complete underground checks and balances on tunnel clearance, power supply and signalling, said City Rail Link.</p>
        
            <p>The train made five successful trips overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown had described the test run as a momentous achievement.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good to see progress being made because Auckland deserves a public transport system that will deliver benefits for Aucklanders and visitors alike," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've always said I was determined to get the project finished and over the line, and we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said it was good to see progress being made on the project.</p>
        
            <p>
Significant testing and work was still to be undertaken before the opening in 2026.

            <p>KiwiRail's programme director for City Rail Link Bevan Assink said the tests would accelerate over the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes brake testing on what is one of the steepest sections of railway in New Zealand, recovery procedures and the start of hands-on training for drivers," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The start of CRL dynamic testing in the tunnels closely follows another key milestone - the successful completion of KiwiRail's latest stage of its network upgrade programme, where significant progress was made with major network rebuild works over the summer holidays."</p>
        
            <p>Work on the underground included testing complex tunnel ventilation systems, tunnel supervision and security, lighting, communications upgrades and hands-on training for metro drivers and station staff.</p>

            <p>Auckland Transport's director for public transport and active modes Stacey van der Putten said the network would better connect Aucklanders to the places they want to go when it opens next year.</p>
        
            <p>"The test train has made the first direct, easier journey that tens of thousands of people will be making every day," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But before that happens, we've still got a lot of work to do to make sure journeys on Auckland's new railway are safe, reliable and seamless from day one."</p>
