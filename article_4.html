            <p>The University of Auckland Centre for Brain Research is opening the Autism Research Clinic, which will offer genetic diagnosis for autism.</p>
        
            <p>Clinic director and University of Auckland senior lecturer Dr Jessie Jacobsen said the new centre was a big step toward making genetic diagnosis for autism widely available in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobsen, along with other researchers, recently published the results of the genetic analysis of 201 New Zealanders who had been diagnosed with autism.</p>
        
            <p>It found a variation in a gene known to cause autism for 13 percent of participants, and variant genes likely to cause autism for another 16 percent of participants.</p>
        
            <p>The clinic plans to offer genetic sequencing for autism, and then help patients access individually tailored support. Initially it will work only with those who already have an autism diagnosis.</p>
        
            <p>"The genetic tests provide an opportunity to refine that diagnosis, which is important, so care can be tailored to their individual needs," Jacobsen said.</p>
        
            <p>"It also allows people to plan for their futures and can help them qualify for support from other agencies "</p>
        
            <p>It is expected to enrol at least 50 children and their parents in the first year.</p>
        
            <p>Jacobsen said in five years, with significant funding, it was hoped the clinic would meet the demand for genetic diagnosis for autism across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to improve early and accurate diagnosis, because it helps people have far better long-term outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>"For some people, genetic testing provides an answer after a lengthy, drawn-out diagnostic journey and that can be a real relief."</p>
