            <p>Two separate house fires in the eastern suburbs of Christchurch have been contained.</p>
        
            <p>The first, a two-storey house in Phillipstown, was "well ablaze" when Fire and Emergency responded about 7.45am on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency shift manager Ryan Dawson said it had initially responded with two firetrucks from the Christchurch City fire brigade, but a further two firetrucks - one from Spreydon and one from Woolston - were sent following a second alarm.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was extinguished by 8.18am.</p>
        
            <p>Dawson said a fire investigator had attended the scene and completed an investigation.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not being treated as suspicious but the cause was unknown.</p>
        
            <p>Later on Wednesday afternoon, Dawson said crews had responded to multiple 111 calls of a house on fire in North New Brighton shortly before 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>The house was also "well ablaze" when three firetrucks - two from the Anzac Station and one from Woolston - arrived.</p>
        
            <p>An additional firetruck as well as a support vehicle was then sent to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>One firetruck, the support vehicle, and a fire investigator remain at the site in North New Brighton.</p>
        
            <p>It is also not being treated as suspicious, but a fire investigator is still working to determine the cause.</p>
        
            <p>"Both these incidents serve as a reminder for people to ensure they have got working smoke alarms, and to create, or practice their three-step escape plan," Dawson told RNZ.</p>
