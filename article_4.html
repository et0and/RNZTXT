            <p>The term "waka jumper" has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
        
            <p>The colloquial phrase, which is used almost exclusively in New Zealand politics, is among several new words the dictionary has included in its latest update.</p>
        
            <p>It defines a waka jumper as a member of Parliament who moves from one political party to another during a parliamentary term.</p>
        
            <p>The dictionary says that the phrase has been in use since 1999.</p>
        
            <p>"Waka jumping (1999) is the name for this practice of party switching, and a waka jumper (1999) is a member of Parliament who engages in it."</p>
        
            <p>The most recent waka jumping legislation passed in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>Other New Zealand words added to the dictionary included:</p>
        
            <p>There has been an increase in the number of te reo Māori words being added to the dictionary with experts saying it's a sign of the times as more Māori and non-Māori use certain words.</p>
        
            <p>Other new regional words and phrases that the dictionary has added this round include the Welsh interjection of disgust 'ych a fi' and 'towel' as slang for the Guyanese one-thousand-dollar bill.</p>
