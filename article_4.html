            <p>Ten pilot whales have stranded at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Eight were still alive after becoming stranded on Tuesday, however, they were in "pretty good health", Department of Conservation Golden Bay operations manager Ross Trotter said.</p>
        
            <p>They received the report about 6.30pm on Tuesday about the stranding in an area known as Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit.</p>
        
            <p>Weather conditions on Wednesday were favourable with rain falling which would help keep the whales cool, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah and iwi were assisting DOC as they worked towards a possible refloat around 4.30pm prior to high tide at 5.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>He said rescuers had not seen these whales at Farewell Spit previously. However, it was clear they had stranded in another location before.</p>
        
            <p>"They are showing signs of having been sunburnt and have healed over, so possibly in the last few weeks they have been beached somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>While there were many theories about why strandings happened so often at Farewell Spit, the shape of the bay was a possible factor, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A pod of pilot whales was refloated several times in December.</p>
        
            <p>Not all of them survived.</p>
        
            <p>Among those that did, some were seen in the area even after being refloated again.</p>
