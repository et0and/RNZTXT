            <p>Auckland Transport says train services in the city have now resumed, however, there will be disruptions for the rest of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Train services across all lines were suspended on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>But AT has warned commuters to expect further delays and cancellations this afternoon and this evening due to ongoing industrial action.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Auckland Transport rail franchise manager Craig Inger said a track infrastructure issue at Middlemore railway station on Wednesday morning, as well as industrial action, resulted in the temporary suspension of all train services.</p>
        
            <p>The track issue was fixed by 10am but as part of their industrial action unionised Auckland One Rail staff would not work any shifts that varied from their master roster which meant Auckland One Rail was unable to provide any train services from about 10.30am, he said.</p>
        
            <p>AT appreciated the disruptions were extremely frustrating and it wanted a resolution to industrial action as quickly as possible, he said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Rail and Maritime Transport Union general secretary Todd Valster said about 500 One Rail staff they represented had been striking since Saturday, 8 June.</p>
        
            <p>It was in the best interest of workers, the public, and AT to resolve the issues workers had raised, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been bargaining for nine months. We want to get things back to normal as quick as they can be."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, AT was operating two rail buses on the Eastern Line and another two on the Southern Line to provide alternative transport while KiwiRail worked to resolve the problem.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the Eastern line earlier told RNZ their train was stuck at Middlemore Station for about 50 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>An AT spokesperson said a points fault, which occurred at Middlemore about 7.30am, during peak hours, meant that crew couldn't get to where they needed to be.</p>
        
            <p>He said the Eastern line was the first to be suspended, and followed by the rest of the lines.</p>
        
            <p>Customers were advised to use the Journey Planner to find out what scheduled bus services would get them where they needed to go.</p>
