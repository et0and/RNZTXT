            <p>Two arrests have been made in Waikato in recent weeks linked to fake banknotes.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the first was made on 9 September when a 33-year-old man tried to use counterfeit notes at a number of stores.</p>
        
            <p>They were of mixed quality - some passing the "tear test" - but most could be spotted as fakes due to "crudely cut or non-existent" hologram images.</p>
        
            <p>He was remanded in custody, and will face charges of obtaining by deception and possessing forged bank notes when he appears in Hamilton District Court on 2 October.</p>
        
            <p>The second suspect was arrested on Thursday night following a burglary on River Rd in Claudelands. The 38-year-old man was charged with burglary and possessing a forged bank note, and was due to appear in court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The police statement on the cases came a day after a fake $100 note was found at a charity shop in Auckland on Thursday. A woman entered a shop on Remuera Road at about 2pm, police said, and purchased a few items with the fake note. It was only later that volunteers realised the money was counterfeit.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City east area prevention manager Inspector Rachel Dolheguy said retailers should take a look, feel and tilt approach to identifying genuine bank notes.</p>
        
            <p>"To avoid falling victim to fake cash, we are asking retailers and the public to boost their knowledge around banknote security and report any fraudulent notes they come across," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dolheguy said retailers should not accept notes they believe could be fake.</p>
        
            <p>"If you find you've already received a counterfeit note, put it in an envelope to avoid handling it further and get in touch with police."</p>
