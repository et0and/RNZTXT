            <p>Local Return Services Associations need to "reorient" themselves to be more focused on veterans, their chairperson says.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as two dozen clubs in Auckland and around the country look to quit the national body.</p>
        
            <p>The Napier branch has already voted to break ranks citing a year of disharmony.</p>
        
            <p>RSA chairperson Martyn Dunne told Checkpoint there was some disharmony with Auckland clubs but no formal steps had been taken for the Napier RSA as of yet.</p>
        
            <p>Dunne was "confident" the issues with the Auckland branches could be worked through - but admitted changes needed to be made to put veterans first.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association has about 250 volunteers who worked as district support managers - reaching out to veterans to support them.</p>
        
            <p>But Dunne said he wanted to see clubs themselves reorientate their focus and make veterans the main priority.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of them are very successful commercial enterprises and some of them actually have let looking after veterans become less important than we feel it should be," Dunne said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some highly successful ones, some great places where there is community involvement etcetera etcetera, we want them to actually refocus totally on the veterans."</p>
        
            <p>Dunne was asked if the RSAs had just become pubs along the way.</p>
        
            <p>"They're certainly commercial hospitality enterprises and I know what's going to happen on Thursday (Anzac Day) as my inbox last year was just inundated after a couple of articles by contemporary younger veterans, and not necessarily all younger veterans, who say 'I didn't feel welcome, I didn't really get what I wanted out of it'."</p>
        
            <p>Dunne said it was time the RSA sat down and discussed what it wanted to look like.</p>
        
            <p>This could include establishing veterans support centres, he said.</p>
