            <p>Two men are due to appear in Rotorua District Court on Friday in relation to an incident that saw police threatened.</p>
        
            <p>Police said when they arrived at a Rotorua address where an assault had been reported, they were confronted by a number of gang members.</p>
        
            <p>They said the gang members approached them aggressively, with one man threatening to retrieve a gun.</p>
        
            <p>The officers left the house for safety reasons and were unable to investigate the reported assault, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were able to make follow-up inquiries on Thursday and searched three addresses in relation to the events.</p>
        
            <p>A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with disorderly behaviour, obstruction and unlawful assembly.</p>
        
            <p>Police also seized a firearm at that address.</p>
        
            <p>Another 19-year-old man at a second address was charged with disorderly behaviour, obstruction and unlawful assembly.</p>
        
            <p>A slug gun was seized from the third address, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said their inquiries were ongoing.</p>
