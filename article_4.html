            <p>Dunedin City Council has voted to keep its indebted council-owned lines company Aurora Energy following public pleas not to sell the "family's silver".</p>
        
            <p>The company owns and operates the network that delivers power across Dunedin, Central Otago, and Queenstown Lakes.</p>
        
            <p>The sale proposal was aimed to reduce debt and create an investment fund that could produce millions each year - Aurora Energy has a forecast debt of $581 million by mid next year.</p>
        
            <p>But the majority of public submissions wanted to keep the company, saying it was a strategic asset and it should not be privatised.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Jules Radich put the motion forward at a meeting on Wednesday, telling councillors that they did not have the mandate to sell the community's asset after such strong opposition.</p>

            <p>Most ratepayers he had spoken told him they would rather pay higher rates and deal with the discomfort but keep the strategic asset than sell it and reduce rates, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The decision was not unanimous with councillors Lee Vandervis and Cherry Lucas voting against retaining Aurora Energy.</p>
        
            <p>Vandervis said keeping the company was the wrong decision that would increase debt, increase rates and diminish their opportunities in the future.</p>
        
            <p>He believed they would revisit their decision in a few short years as they could not afford rate rises to keep funding Aurora's debt and need for investment.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Carmen Houlihan called the decision a "no brainer", saying the council would regret selling the asset.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Brent Weatherall voted to support the community's call to retain, but said the family's silver was riddled in debt and he was concerned about the current and forecast debt of Aurora and the impact that would have on ratepayers into the future.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Steve Walker believed this would be one of the council's biggest decisions as it would have ramifications for years.</p>
        
            <p>It was in the best long-term, financial interest to retain this strategic asset, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Bill Acklin voted in support, but said it would not mean smooth financial sailing and he was worried about the impact it would have on rates.</p>
        
            <p>Lucas said Aurora Energy was a profitable company but questioned whether the council could cope with funding the investment it needed into the future and with the lack of dividends it would provide in the short to medium term.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Holdings Limited - which owns Aurora and is owned by the council - recommended the sale back in March, saying it would mean more consistent income, less debt, reduced risk by diversifying its portfolio, and attracting a premium price.</p>
        
            <p>Aurora had not delivered a dividend to the Dunedin City Holdings since 2017.</p>
        
            <p>The council consulted the public between March and May, receiving 760 submissions with the majority wanting to keep Aurora and 22 percent of submissions wanting to sell the lines company.</p>
        
            <p>In the meeting agenda, staff said Aurora was increasing in value and generating a profit but it would need a lot of investment in the coming years and was in debt.</p>
        
            <p>"That expenditure will consume operating cash flows and require more debt, and any dividend in the short to medium term would need to be funded by debt," council staff said.</p>
        
            <p>The report listed the potential reasons to keep Aurora, saying it aligned with the majority of public submissions, that Aurora was a profitable company and that value was expected to increase over time if investments were made, the potential for future dividends, and the company as a strategic asset.</p>
        
            <p>But council staff did not recommend either option, saying it was a challenging decision given the public sentiment and the financial challenges ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"One option sees council retain a profitable company that requires ongoing capital investment in at least the medium term, but is then likely to be in a position to provide council with a cash dividend," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>"On the other hand, the independent advice from DCHL directors is that a premium price is likely if Aurora is sold now and the council would receive a higher income in the short to medium term through having a diversified investment fund."</p>
