            <p>A former Auckland eye surgeon accused of murdering his wife appeared to be in a relationship with a Sydney sex worker, a detective says.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne is on trial at the High Court at Auckland, accused of murdering wife Pauline Hanna and staging her death as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The defence argues Hanna ended her own life after struggling with depression for many years.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Andrew Reeves continued giving evidence on Monday, telling the court the first communication police found between Polkinghorne and sex worker Madison Ashton was in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>He said a document showed Polkinghorne made an $800 payment for a "one hour girlfriend experience" Ashton offered.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves said Polkinghorne communicated regularly with Ashton in the days after his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>WhatsApp messages were sent between the pair after 5 April 2021, the day Hanna died.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves suggested Polkinghorne had deleted messages from his phone, but they were found on a phone belonging to Ashton.</p>
        
            <p>However, Reeves said the messages were "scrambled", "unreadable", and "difficult to make sense of".</p>
        
            <p>Police also recovered iMessages between Polkinghorne and Ashton starting from 17 April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>On that date, Ashton sent Polkinghorne attachments related to a plastic surgery procedure she was set to get done.</p>
        
            <p>He said she would look "more than sensational" and "drive a tsunami of lust".</p>
        
            <p>Ashton responded with a heart emoji.</p>
        
            <p>On 23 April, they sent messages to each other about their relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"If you passed away I wouldn't leave the house ever again," she said.</p>
        
            <p>He replied: "Darling, you and I aren't going anywhere, we are going to last 100 years."</p>
        
            <p>Ashton sent Polkinghorne a property for sale in New South Wales on 25 April.</p>
        
            <p>"Interesting, something to talk about," he replied.</p>
        
            <p>Later messages showed them planning a vacation at a luxury lakeside lodge in Mount Cook.</p>
        
            <p>In one, Ashton said 14 months was a long time to not be together in any relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne replied that they would see how the trip went.</p>
        
            <p>"There may be commonality or there may not," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ashton asked if he was breaking up with her.</p>
        
            <p>"Sounds like you are breaking up with me what the f..k?"</p>
        
            <p>"F..k no, Christ, never," he replied.</p>
        
            <p>On 28 April, Polkinghrone told Ashton he wanted her to meet his sister, calling it "a big step".</p>
        
            <p>Ashton's two phones were seized by police on 30 August 2021 while she was staying with Polkinghorne at the Mount Cook lodge.</p>
