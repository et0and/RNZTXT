        <h2>Patience bears fruit as couple reopen cyclone-hit produce business</h2>
        <p>
The roadside sign is worse for wear and the shelves are still a little bare, but Springfield fruit and vege shop is back in business.

            <p>The roadside sign is worse for wear and the shelves are still a little bare, but Springfield fruit and vege shop in rural Hastings is back in business.</p>
        
            <p>For 15 years, Diane and Nicolaas Slagter's Pakowhai Road store has been a popular stop for residents.</p>
        
            <p>Since Cyclone Gabrielle destroyed everything they had, the shed housing their shop had also become their home.</p>

            <p>Next to the makeshift kitchen, the produce chiller also keeps their milk cold - and behind that is their bedroom, with their home next door gutted.</p>
        
            <p>It will be a while yet before they can move back in. But they have at least slowly begun to resurrect their livelihood.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't figured out how to work the cash register yet," Diane Slagter said with a laugh.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll get there."</p>
        
            <p>
Supplies are limited at present.

            <p>Stock was limited, but it was a start, Nicolaas Slagter said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got cauli, cabbage and broccoli.</p>
        
            <p>"Today I picked two cucumbers, and I picked some fresh peas, and nearly two packets of beans.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's it. And eggs!"</p>
        
            <p>With the beanstalks flowering and some consistent sunshine, he knew it was time to open the doors once more.</p>
        
            <p>"This morning I picked two packets of beans, tomorrow it could be three or maybe even four, because with this heat they do grow."</p>
        
            <p>Most of the $2 broccoli, cauliflowers and cabbages were snapped up before lunchtime, but those seeking raspberries were out of luck.</p>

            <p>The plants were completely wiped out in the floods, Nicolaas Slagter said, and they would be lucky to have any this summer.</p>
        
            <p>They were what Springfield was most famous for.</p>
        
            <p>"They've got a particular flavour, and you know what the flavour is because you have chickens running in them, and the chicken poo does something.</p>
        
            <p>"Same with the cabbages and the caulis over there, just the flavour of it."</p>
        
            <p>While flooding and silt ravaged the Slagters' home and livelihood, it had come in handy for growing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good stuff, you turn it into the ground. Rotary hoe it and plough it and look at it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Locals were supporting the Slagters by spreading the word that Springfield has opened.</p>
        
            <p>Jade Peterson and her colleague nabbed a cabbage, a broccoli and a dozen eggs, after seeing a post on Facebook about the shop.</p>
        
            <p>"We're both Hawke's Bay locals, and it's been a rough year, so seeing these stores popping back up again is really heartening," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The owners were glad to be back.</p>
        
            <p>The smile and wave from Nicolaas Slagter every time the door bell rang said it all.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good, eh darlin'?" he said, smiling at his wife.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a beginning, it's a beginning," she replied.</p>
        
            <p>"You feel something's happening."</p>
