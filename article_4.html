            <p>Buses in Timaru will be the first to try out a new national ticketing system which aims to introduce a single payment system across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The National Ticketing Solution, to be known as Motu Move, is an initiative by the New Zealand Transport Agency and 13 public transport authorities.</p>
        
            <p>It will allow travellers to pay using contactless debit and credit cards, and digital payment methods on public transport.</p>
        
            <p>The system will be introduced to Timaru's metro bus services from December, followed by Timaru school buses and the Temuka service in January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It will then be brought in in Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury Regional Council acting chairperson Craig Pauling said Timaru was fortunate to be the first region in Aotearoa to launch Motu Move, which will eventually become the one ticketing and payment system for public transport across the motu.</p>
        
            <p>"Being able to pay with a contactless credit or debit card will make using public transport easier for all customers, and means that visitors and first-time users won't need to worry about buying a separate prepaid card. We also know that the data we get from Motu Move will help in planning future routes and service improvements," Pauling said.</p>
        
            <p>Following completion of the Canterbury rollout, the rest of the country will follow region by region.</p>
