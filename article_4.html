            <p>In the past six months, the Chief Ombudsman has received nearly a thousand complaints about requests for official information from government agencies.</p>
        
            <p>Figures released by Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier show the main complaints were about full and partial refusals of information, and delays in making a decision.</p>
        
            <p>There have been fewer Official Information Act (OIA) requests, 759 down from 848, but more requests under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act (LGOIMA) in the past six months, 229 up from 174.</p>
        
            <p>Of the OIA complaints - more than 600 were from individuals, 80 from media and 41 from other sources - including nine complaints from members of Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand was the most complained about government agency, with 92 complaints about the handling of requests, followed by police with 84 complaints.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora is slashing the number of communication staff it employs. There were 173 people in its communications and engagement team a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>There were 52 complaints made about school boards - with half of those relating to delays in making decisions or inadequate responses.</p>
        
            <p>There was also a significant proportion of complaints about school boards in the previous six months ending June 2023, with 84 complaints received, including two bulk requests involving a number of schools.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 229 complaints made under the LGOIMA in the six months to December, the majority related to Auckland Council at 32, followed by Ruapehu District Council at 26, and Wellington City Council at 20. There were also 18 complaints about requests for official information from council-controlled organisations.</p>
