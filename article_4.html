            <p>Nelson City Council is ending a heritage project at Founders Park - a decision it says it took to keep rates rises at a manageable level.</p>
        
            <p>But a union says there has been a lack of transparency around that decision and the collection is integral to preserving the cultural heritage of the region.</p>
        
            <p>The collection - which is based at Founders Heritage Park and overseen by Te Papa - is made up of items collected from the people and businesses of Nelson since 1986.</p>
        
            <p>The council-funded Reorganisation Project began five years ago to make sure the objects were properly restored, catalogued and safely stored.</p>
        
            <p>With a budget of about $1 million, it was not possible to keep the project going while making savings in other areas, chief executive Nigel Philpott said.</p>
        
            <p>"Like all councils, we are faced with high inflation and interest rates and our starting point for the rates increase in the 2024-2034 Long Term Plan was as high as 32 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not a number I can realistically take to the Nelson community during a cost-of-living crisis, and staff have worked extremely hard to find savings across the board that have brought that figure down to 8.2 percent."</p>
        
            <p>He said all affected staff had been offered other jobs, and the items would remain stored at Founders Park until the council was in a better position to do something with them.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Public Service Association said ratepayers should be consulted on the decision to end the project, given the collection was made up of objects of significant local importance.</p>
        
            <p>The project was critical in safeguarding Nelson's history, organiser Ian Hoffmann said.</p>
        
            <p>For the past five years, the collections team had diligently undertaken the restoration, cataloguing, and storage of many of the items.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a legal and ethical obligation for the council to act as stewards of these donated or loaned items, ensuring their preservation and accessibility to the public.</p>
        
            <p>"The decision to mothball the collection jeopardises this obligation, putting both staff and the objects at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Hoffmann said the union wanted Nelson City Council to reconsider its decision, prioritise transparency, and engage the community in discussions regarding the future of the heritage collection.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are encouraged to make submissions on Nelson's long term plan before 28 April.</p>
