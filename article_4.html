        <h2>West Auckland's discoloured water 'still safe to drink'</h2>
        <p>
Watercare says sediment and mineral build-up are likely causes of the discoloured water and work is underway to return it to normal.

            <p>The discoloured water coming out of taps across West Auckland is not a health risk, Watercare says.</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Ranui, Kelston, Glen Eden and Henderson reported discoloured tap water on Friday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Watercare said in a social media post it was flushing the network and "working as quickly as possible to get your water supply back to normal".</p>
        
            <p>The council-controlled organisation thanked residents for their patience.</p>
        
            <p>While the water looked "different" to normal, it was "still safe to drink", the post said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our rigorous water sampling programme confirms that all the water we supply is compliant with the Drinking Water Standards of New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The most common cause of discoloured tap water was minerals like iron and manganese that naturally built up in pipes, Watercare said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some increased flow rate or a change in direction of the water flow can stir up these minerals and create a yellowish tinge in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"There is also work underway in surrounding areas which can stir up sediment in the pipes."</p>
