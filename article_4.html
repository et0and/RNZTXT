            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has sold another investment property - potentially making a significant tax-free capital gain.</p>
        
            <p>Records show the Grey St property was last purchased in 2015 for $620,500.</p>
        
            <p>It was sold on 25 November. The sale price has not been made public yet but the property was advertised for $930,000. Homes.co.nz gave it an estimated value of $970,000.</p>
        
            <p>That means Luxon may have made about $300,000 on the sale - although from that gain he would have had to have paid for the costs of sale, including real estate commission, and he may have had work done to the property.</p>
        
            <p>Kelvin Davidson, chief property economist at Corelogic, said if Luxon sold it for the current CoreLogic estimated value of $905,000, that would be a gain of around 45 percent from purchase price in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking at Onehunga in general, its median value overall has gone from $723,050 in May 2015 to $1,057,100 now - also a gain of around 45 percent. So at face value, nothing special or spectacular here - his property just moved in line with the market."</p>
        
            <p>The current government has unwound the 2021 tightening of the bright-line test, requiring investors to hold a property for two years to avoid an automatic tax on gains, instead of the previous 10.</p>
        
            <p>But Luxon would not have been caught even by the longer test.</p>
        
            <p>He purchased the property in May 2015, and the bright-line test was introduced in October that year for property purchased as of that date.</p>
        
            <p>However, if he had been captured, it would have been a significant bill.</p>
        
            <p>If it was assumed that Luxon netted a profit of $250,000 on the Grey St sale, that could have been tax of $97,500. The bright-line test is applied at the individual's marginal tax rate - in Luxon's case that would be the top tax rate of 39 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In August, he sold another Grey St property for $930,000.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon also sold his apartment in the Kate Sheppard complex, near Parliament.</p>
