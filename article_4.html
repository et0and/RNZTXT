            <p>One man is dead and another rescued after a birthday fishing trip went wrong in South Otago when their boat overturned.</p>
        
            <p>The men were brothers-in-law on a 60th birthday fishing trip.</p>
        
            <p>The vessel, a fibreglass runabout, turned over in rough conditions as the pair approached the Catlins River sand bar, near Pounawea, this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police, volunteers, rescue vessels from Coastguard Bluff and Coastguard Dunedin and a rescue helicopter joined the short search for the men.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement this afternoon, police said emergency services were alerted about 10.40am and confirmed that a body had been found on a nearby beach.</p>
        
            <p>A second person on the boat was found on rocks nearby. A dog was also bought to shore.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to extend our thanks to the volunteers and members of the public who assisted in today's rescue efforts."</p>
        
            <p>The man was flown to Dunedin Hospital in a moderate condition, a spokeswoman for Hato Hone St John said.</p>

The boat - a fibreglass runabout - has been recovered and taken to a police station.

            <p>Surat Bay Lodge co-owner Ester Johnson told an Otago Daily Times reporter and photographer at the scene the pair were brothers-in-law who were celebrating a 60th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>She said she watched the boat go slowly for a time this morning in an area known to be rough.</p>
        
            <p>"And I thought to myself, 'What the hell are they doing?'"</p>
        
            <p>Johnson said about half an hour after seeing the boat, she heard the fire brigade and hoped it wasn't for the fishermen, but then realised that someone may have drowned.</p>
        
            <p>The area is known to be dangerous, with drownings and near-deaths previously reported after vessels capsized.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions were rough this morning, though it was not too windy.</p>
        
            <p>It was the third time a boat had rolled crossing the bar in recent memory, Ms Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for Hato Hone St John said the ambulance service was notified of a water incident at 10.38am and sent a first response unit, one manager, one ambulance and one helicopter to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for Fire and Emergency NZ said one crew from Owaka was sent to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The boat had been recovered from the water, police said.</p>
