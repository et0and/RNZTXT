            <p>Police are seeking information about a break-in at an Ōtara preschool where windows and property were smashed and items stolen.</p>
        
            <p>Ōtara Community Preschool was broken into some time between 9am on Saturday 7 December and 6pm the next day.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Counties Manukau East area prevention manager Inspector Rakana Cook said nine internal windows were smashed and a microwave oven and computers were knocked to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"This type of behaviour is quite frankly disgusting."</p>
        
            <p>"This is an awful situation, a preschool has been left footing the bill for this crime and children are now without their belongings and educational resources."</p>

            <p>Cook said the offenders seemed to be destroying property just for the sake of it.</p>
        
            <p>Police had already spoken to a number of people who had come forward in connection to the incident, but would now like anyone who had not yet spoken to them to come forward, Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working hard to identify and locate those responsible for this senseless crime."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information can contact the police on 105 or via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and citing reference number 241208/6023.</p>
