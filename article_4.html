            <p>New Zealand is experiencing its highest peak in Covid-19 cases since December 2022, professor Michael Baker says.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the ministry reported 6146 new cases of the virus and 19 further deaths.</p>
        
            <p>That was a substantial increase on the number of cases reported the previous week - which stood at 3922.</p>
        
            <p>The data came from wastewater testing, Baker said, but hospitalisations were also up.</p>
        
            <p>"We're up to about 35 people a day going to hospital with this infection," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Baker told RNZ's First Up one in three people are still contagious five days after testing positive for the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the recommended isolation period now only being five days, Baker suggested people still getting a positive Covid-19 test wait to test again on day 6 or 7 before going back into society.</p>
        
            <p>"The biology hasn't changed," Baker said, but there was more pressure for people to go back to work and school.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said he would like to see money in this week's Budget going towards the Covid-19 response.</p>
        
            <p>It was important for health and productivity that the government continued to fund booster shots, RAT tests and the anti-viral medication.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as people had to pay for these, low income households would miss out.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said it had to remain fair and equity had to be maintained.</p>
        
            <p>Prioritising booster shots was also important, Baker said.</p>
        
            <p>People over the age of 30 were eligible for a booster every six months.</p>
        
            <p>And while it would not stop someone from becoming infected with Covid-19 and potentially passing it on, the immunisation activated parts of a person's immune system that could help stop them getting seriously ill.</p>
        
            <p>Baker also encouraged mask wearing - especially N95s - that have a good seal around the mouth and nose.</p>
        
            <p>A recent study Baker took part in proved face masks really did help reduce the spread of respiratory infections.</p>
