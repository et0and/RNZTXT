        <h2>'Music is a divine gift,' Teremoana Rapley says</h2>
        <p>
Being able to make music is a "tupuna-sent gift," according to the award-winning musician.
</p>
        
            <p>Being able to make music is a "tupuna-sent gift," says award-winning musician Teremoana Rapley.</p>
        
            <p>"When I make music, it's actually a divine gift, and it's not something that I'm actually in control of," she told TAHI presenter So'omālō Iteni Schwalger at the Pacific Music Awards in Auckland on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>"And so for me, repressing it for such a long time and supporting all these other people for so many years, I felt my tupuna were kicking my butt and telling me to hurry up and get it out there."</p>
        
            <p>Rapley, who is of Kiribati, Aitutaki, Rarotonga, Mangaia and Jamaican heritage, received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the awards.</p>
        
            <p>While she started her music career as a teenager in the late '80s, performing with hip hop group Upper Hutt Posse, Rapley mostly took a supporting role, working with acts like Moana and The Moahunters, Dam Native, Mark de Clive Lowe, Che Fu and King Kapisi (her husband, Bill Urale).</p>
        
            <p>She said she was grateful for being able to build a career in a fickle industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes you don't make money from music, and so it's not something that I would ever rely on."</p>
        
            <p>In April, shortly after being awarded the Independent Spirit Award at the Taite Music Awards, Rapley revealed that she was living with inoperable brain cancer.</p>
        
            <p>She said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award was "pretty crazy".</p>
        
            <p>"It's like I got made redundant from my council job and then I started getting acknowledged in the music industry. So maybe that's what I needed to do.</p>
        
            <p>While Rapley has been working on her own debut album for many years, she said "there's no plan" when it comes to making her own work.</p>
        
            <p>"I just do what I do.</p>
        
            <p>"When I'm working for other people, production and doing other people's albums, sorting it out for them, I'm very logical in how I do things. When it comes to myself, I do it how I feel, and if, if I don't feel like doing it one day, then I just don't do it.</p>
        
            <p>"Now that I don't have a job, I'm like, 'oh, my job is now music, so I should probably do that every day'. And so for that, I'm very grateful to be able to do that right now.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't do things for awards, and I don't do it for applause, and so for me, this [winning the award] is a bonus… it's like icing on the cake that I didn't know that I needed."</p>
