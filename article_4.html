            <p>Violent incidents at Middlemore Hospital's emergency department have nearly halved with extra security guards on the job around the clock.</p>
        
            <p>In a bid to curb assaults at hospitals over summer, Minister of Health Dr Shane Reti last month announced extra support for EDs until the end of February.</p>
        
            <p>Middlemore was one of eight "higher-risk" EDs that received five extra security staff - and a further 24 EDs received between two and five additional guards.</p>
        
            <p>The hospital recorded 13 reports of abuse last month, which was a big drop from the 22 in December 2022, said acting chief medical officer Dr Andrew Connolly.</p>
        
            <p>Of those, only one situation was classified as serious: a punch-up between two visitors outside the ED.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been here for just under half of the month of December, so it's too early to draw major conclusions, but we're very pleased," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a message that seems common throughout the country, that the feedback from frontline staff has been overwhelmingly positive."</p>
        
            <p>The guards' presence alone seemed to have helped, said Connolly - and he wanted them to become a permanent fixture.</p>
        
            <p>"If I had a crystal ball, I would expect that by the end of February we will be seeing significant improvements that are attributable to the increased number of security staff.</p>
        
            <p>"So, yes, we would like to see this become normal business."</p>
        
            <p>An emergency physician at Hawke's Bay Hospital shared that wish.</p>
        
            <p>Long wait times and growing patient frustration had led to more and more instances of abuse and violence, said Dr Scott Boyes.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a day-to-day part of our work now, you know, these confrontations, high stress environments, overcrowding.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't even incident report a lot of the things that happen, just because it's now become such a commonplace scenario."</p>
        
            <p>Because of that, Boyes could not say whether things had improved in his ED - but he "definitely" felt safer with the two extra guards.</p>
        
            <p>"Having that extra level of support and security just makes everyone feel a little bit more comfortable that things aren't going to escalate out of control."</p>
        
            <p>But verbal abuse and violence would not go away with extra security guards, said New Zealand Nurses Organisation president Anne Daniels.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, it sent a message to the public that hospitals were not safe, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I cannot blame people for getting angry and upset for waiting.</p>
        
            <p>"They come to us in primary healthcare and the hospitals because they need help, and we're not giving it to them when and where it should be given."</p>
        
            <p>The money was better spent on addressing the dire shortage of medical staff - and extra security was just a band-aid solution, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The way forward is only by having a health system that works for the people when and where it's needed, reduces the wait times, and provides safe care.</p>
        
            <p>"And we can only do that if we have enough nurses, doctors and allied health staff, mental health staff; so that's where the money needs to go."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora said it had not yet gathered the data to ascertain whether the extra security had made a difference.</p>
