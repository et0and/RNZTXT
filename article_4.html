            <p>Thunderstorms are moving up the country and are due to hit much of the North Island as temperatures start to drop.</p>
        
            <p>"We currently have an active front that is impacting the country," MetService meteorologist Dom Barry told Morning Report on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"It has affected the likes of Westland already this morning - there have been quite a number of active thunderstorms there already.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was in place for the Westland and Grey districts and Southland from the Oreti River westwards until 8am.</p>
        
            <p>Barry said the front was moving toward the likes of KƒÅpiti, Taranaki and the northern parts of Waikato and Taumaranaui.</p>
        
            <p>"We're expecting that to affect the rest of the North Island throughout this afternoon and into this evening.</p>
        
            <p>It was was hot everywhere with Kawerau reaching 32 degrees. Lots of 30's across the country pic.twitter.com/ueQkXxc7aG</p>
        
            <p>"We're also expecting the possibility of some thunderstorms for the Canterbury region this morning as well."</p>
        
            <p>The thunderstorms weren't expected to reach the severe category, but Barry encouraged people to keep up to date on the MetService website and app in case that changed.</p>
        
            <p>There would be a rain for "a lot of places" - though the downpours would miss Hawke's Bay and Gisborne, Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Cooler weather was starting to arrive after Monday's scorching heat that saw Wellington airport breaking its January record with 29.6C, and Kawarau hitting 32C.</p>
        
            <p>"Temperatures are starting to drop [for] the majority of the country," Barry said.</p>
        
            <p>Wanaka and Queenstown would get to 18C or 19C, with an overnight low of 4C.</p>
        
            <p>The heat had set up a "perfect mixture" of conditions for thunderstorms in parts of the lower North Island on Monday, with warm moist air from the north and the atmosphere a little unstable, meaning the air could rise.</p>
        
            <p>"That air could rise up really high and generate some really, really intense downpours in some areas."</p>
