            <p>An Auckland man says he is reeling after four armed robbers ransacked his flat last week, demanding money and valuables.</p>
        
            <p>Binh Hoang says the group stormed the house, threatened his housemates with weapons and broke down his bedroom door during the "terrifying" home invasion.</p>
        
            <p>The police are asking the public for any information about incident, which happened on 2 January in the suburb of Flat Bush.</p>
        
            <p>Hoang and four other people live in the rental property which was targeted.</p>
        
            <p>He described hearing screaming at about 9.45pm as four people barged into the house.</p>
        
            <p>He said the group first made their way to the garage, where they held a gun to his housemate's head and threatened her with a crossbow-like device.</p>
        
            <p>"She couldn't say anything... she didn't even know English so she didn't know what they were saying," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hoang said two of the assailants shepherded her and another housemate into a small bathrooom, while the others searched the house for valuables.</p>
        
            <p>Hoang and his father - who was visiting from Vietnam - tried to barricade themselves behind his bedroom door upstairs.</p>
        
            <p>
Binh Hoang says the robbers left behind a 'mess' of broken locks and damage, including to his bedroom door.

            <p>"We were basically just trying to hold the door...and then I picked up the phone and gave 111 a call. I said 'we've got a thief in our house'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>As he was talking to the police, Hoang said the assailants broke through his door and demanded money from him and his father.</p>
        
            <p>He said one of them was holding what looked like a rifle.</p>
        
            <p>"I just froze at that point," Hoang said.</p>
        
            <p>Hoang said the group fled with a small amount of cash and paperwork from his room, and he and his and father's passports.</p>
        
            <p>He said they also took a gold necklace, a bank card and car keys from the other housemates, and left behind a "mess" of broken locks and doors.</p>
        
            <p>The police arrived minutes after the group left, Hoang said, but the offenders have not been caught.</p>
        
            <p>Hoang has started a Givealittle page to fundraise for a trip to the Vietnamese embassy in Wellington, to replace his and his fathers' passports.</p>
        
            <p>The group of housemates have decided to leave their flat later this month and all move elsewhere - largely out of fear of a repeat robbery.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what's going to happen, if [the robbers] are going to be caught... so of course it does feel a bit scary," Hoang said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the police said they were still working to establish the circumstances of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>They asked anyone who heard any suspicious activity in the area at the time to get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>Police data shows 54 people were the victims of aggravated robberies at dwellings in Auckland from September 2023 to September 2024.</p>
