            <p>Auckland police say they have caught three men with $2700 of shoplifted loot, after a sticky fingered Boxing Day spree.</p>
        
            <p>Staff at a store in Albany's Greville Road spotted and reported two men leaving with items they had not paid for, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>They left in a car driven by a third man, which officers spotted parked nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Items believed to be from the store were spotted in the car, which was then searched, with officers turning up a haul of clothing, perfume, food and toys they said were stolen.</p>
        
            <p>"All of these items have been returned to their respective stores," the police spokesperson said in a statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Shoplifting charges were laid against a 31-year-old man, and a 34 year-old-man, as well as a 33-year old man who also faces a charge of aggravated assault.</p>
