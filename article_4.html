            <p>Eligible New Zealanders are now able to apply for a working holiday visa to Japan twice in their lifetime, which was only allowed once before.</p>
        
            <p>The new rule came into effect at the start of this month, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Applicants should be between 18 and 30 years age and cannot be accompanied by dependants or children and must meet some health requirements.</p>
        
            <p>The programme intended to make it possible for young people from Japan and its partner countries and regions to spend holidays while working to supplement their travel in each other's territory, the website of the Japanese foreign ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>"The programmes are designed to provide the youth with wider opportunities for them to appreciate the culture and general way of life in the partner countries/regions for the purpose of promoting mutual understanding between Japan and its partner countries/regions," the ministry said.</p>
        
            <p>The ministry noted that working holiday visa holders should be aware of what work they were allowed to do, otherwise they could be violating Japanese laws.</p>
        
            <p>"The working holiday programmes participants are strictly prohibited from working at bars, cabarets, nightclubs, gambling establishments and other premises affecting public morals in Japan."</p>
        
            <p>Japan first started the working holiday programme with Australia in 1980, and as of 1 December 2024, it was providing the programmes to 30 countries and regions.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from New Zealand, the new twice-in-a-lifetime rule also extends to applicants from Canada, Denmark, Austria and the UK.</p>
