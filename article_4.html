            <p>Firefighters continue to battle the blaze which has destroyed a farm building by the Hurunui River, near Cheviot.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency was alerted around 1pm to the fast-moving scrub fire near Cheviot.</p>
        
            <p>Crews from Cheviot, Hurunui, Waipara, Scargill and Motunau were at the scene, plus a command unit from Christchurch and heavy machinery diggers.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the flames had jumped the Hurunui River but it was hoped that a large hill would slow down the fire.</p>
        
            <p>It had already burned through around 100 hectares of vegetation.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency incident controller Bruce Janes said there were still pockets of active fire being extinguished and "the long hard slog" of mopping up hotspots was underway. The air attack had finished but diggers were still on site.</p>
        
            <p>"Our aim is to have the perimeter fully secured by dark," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's strategy of escalating resources sent to vegetation fires paid off today, said Janes.</p>
        
            <p>No houses were damaged but a farm building, which had been part of an old railway station, was destroyed by the blaze. It was being used to store hay, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Janes said one crew would patrol the fire overnight and up to 25 firefighters would be back tomorrow to continue mopping up.</p>
        
            <p>They would be supported by heavy machinery and one aircraft would be available if needed.</p>
        
            <p>He said the fire began on the side of SH1, and its cause was under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a vegetation fire south of Timaru has also been contained by Fire and Emergency.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews received a call just after 3pm Saturday afternoon of a vegetation blaze in Beaconsfield Road, in Paraeroa.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said four water tanks and two pumping trucks attended the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said crews remain in the scene monitoring hot spots, but the blaze has been contained.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters spent last weekend extinguishing fires at Amberley, Loburn and on the Waimakariri Riverbank, northwest of Christchurch.</p>
