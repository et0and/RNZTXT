            <p>The government is changing rules to make it easier for lines companies to remove trees near powerlines, to prevent outages during high winds and storms.</p>
        
            <p>The move would ensure the power stayed on, particularly during severe weather events, Energy Minister Simeon Brown said. The changes will come into effect in September.</p>
