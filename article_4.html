            <p>A flight from Christchurch has been forced to circle over Invercargill after instruments indicated a landing gear fault.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said the Bombardier Q300 plane delayed landing on Saturday afternoon while checks were carried out.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services on the ground were also put on standby.</p>
        
            <p>The flight landed safely, just over an hour behind schedule, shortly before 3pm.</p>
