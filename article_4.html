            <p>Greater Wellington has activated its fire risk warning system which could see parks close if the danger gets too high, meanwhile, a restricted fire season has been declared for all of the Wairarapa.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council first implemented wildfire safety measures last year.</p>
        
            <p>The fire risk levels use a colour-coded system, from green for low risk to red for extreme risk, which triggers restrictions on park access and activities.</p>

            <p>Last year the warning system saw regional parks such as Baring Head, Parangarahu Lakes and Red Rocks temporarily closed to the public due to the extreme fire danger.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to reduce the risk of someone being caught in a wildfire in regional parks. We understand that partial or full closure of our parks is disruptive, but our priority is safety," Greater Wellington's manager for ecosystems and community David Boone said.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody can outrun a wildfire with Wellington wind behind it."</p>
        
            <p>Boone said the team would monitor wildfire risk levels regularly during the fire season by considering factors like temperature, humidity, grass dryness, and recent rainfall to evaluate how easily a fire could ignite and spread.</p>
        
            <p>"Closing a park is not a decision we take lightly, so if you see a closure, please look after yourself and your whƒÅnau by staying away."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency community risk manager Phil Soal said wildfire safety measures were becoming increasingly normal.</p>
        
            <p>"Climate change is contributing to weather extremes including hotter, drier summers. The increased fire risk that this weather initiates is the new normal," Soal said.</p>
        
            <p>"Fire and Emergency urges people to be particularly cautious with fire and spark causing activities this summer, and to check the fire risk in their area at Check it's alright."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ placed the entire Wairarapa into a restricted fire season on Monday morning, until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Last week it had placed parts of the region into a restricted fire season and signalled further restrictions were likely.</p>
        
            <p>A restricted fire season means anyone who wants to light an open-air fire will need a fire permit.</p>
        
            <p>Soal said Wairarapa was continuing to rapidly dry out.</p>
        
            <p>"Hot dry windy days are drying out the vegetation, creating a high fire danger across the region," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The conditions meant escaping fires would be fast moving and very hard to bring under control.</p>
        
            <p>Soal said permitting fires with strict conditions helped to reduce the risk of unwanted fires, but he encouraged people to hold off lighting fires at all where possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask people to also avoid activities that can generate heat and/or sparks and cause fires, such as mowing the lawns, welding or grinding, and using vehicles in long dry grass, particularly during the hottest parts of the day," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"These all have the potential to start a devastating wildfire."</p>
