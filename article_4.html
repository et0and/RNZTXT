            <p>Transpower is erecting a temporary tower and says it is on track to deliver more power to Northland by Saturday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands of people had their power cut on Thursday after a pylon fell over.</p>
        
            <p>It was largely restored on Friday, but households and businesses were asked to keep conserving power, with repairs taking place over the weekend.</p>

            <p>Posting on its Facebook page on Saturday, Transpower said its crews planned to move one of the lines from the fallen tower across to the temporary tower.</p>
        
            <p>"Our crews have been working hard to get additional power through the Northland."</p>
        
            <p>A Transpower spokesperson said it was aiming to have the temporary pylon running by Saturday afternoon, but the process was "complex and challenging".</p>
        
            <p>Both the local power companies - Top Energy and Transpower - said they managed to get through Friday night thanks to households conserving power and hot water.</p>

            <p>A Northpower spokesperson said customers had been "fantastic" and Saturday morning's peak had been easier due to it being the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Northpower customer and community general manager Rachel Wansbone said there had been no issues overnight or on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The network is stable and we've been able to keep things running as normal. We have asked the public to conserve energy and they've done a great job at that.</p>
        
            <p>"It has meant that we have had no outages overnight and that's kept everyone in supply."</p>
        
            <p>Wansbone said Channel Infrastructure's Marsden Point fuel refinery was back online but other industrial plants such as Golden Bay Cement and Fonterra remained closed for now.</p>
        
            <p>A Top Energy spokesperson said hot water had been restored by 10pm on Friday night and "no one should have had a cold shower this [on Saturday] morning".</p>
