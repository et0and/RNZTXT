            <p>Ashburton Intermediate School has dropped a rule requiring students to get a uniform pass to wear a pounamu at school.</p>
        
            <p>The school rule was criticised online over the weekend, with reports of students needing a pass to wear a pounamu, and needing to present the pass whenever it was requested.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Brent Gray said the school had been made aware that part of the uniform pass system was culturally inappropriate.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was grateful to people who raised the issue, and it had been rectified immediately.</p>
        
            <p>A response and apology to the school and Māori community had been issued, and any offence caused was deeply regretted, Gray said.</p>
