            <p>Police are warning Hawke's Bay locals that a large number of gang members are gathering for a funeral.</p>
        
            <p>A number of gang members met at the Palmerston North Hospital on Tuesday where a high-ranking Mongrel Mob leader had died over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The man's funeral would be held in Napier over the following days, police said, and more gang members would be visiting the region.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said extra staff from across the Eastern District and neighbouring districts had been called to help monitor the funeral.</p>
        
            <p>They reiterated that visitors wearing gang insignia would be arrested under the recent Gangs Act.</p>
        
            <p>One person had already been arrested for wearing a Mongrel Mob t-shirt on Tuesday, but police determined he was not part of the group attending the funeral.</p>
