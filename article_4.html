            <p>Emergency services have rushed to an "incident" in Christchurch, which RNZ understands is a sudden death.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are responding to an incident at an address on Grassmere Street, Papanui.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said they were called to the address at 1.15pm on Thursday. They said one ambulance and one operations manager responded.</p>
        
            <p>A reporter at the scene saw several uniformed officers travel down the driveway at the address, but some officers had since left.</p>
        
            <p>Police said further information will be released when we are in a position to do so.</p>
