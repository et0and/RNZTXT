        <h2>Antarctic penguin found in Wellington heads home</h2>
        <p>
Adélie was released in the Cook Strait on Monday after being found on Petone Beach last month.
</p>
        
            <p>It's a tale that's captured the hearts of Wellingtonians - a lost Antarctic penguin, too hot and too far from home.</p>
        
            <p>However, the little black and white Adélie, which turned up on Petone Beach last month suffering from heat stress, was now successfully swimming its way south (hopefully).</p>

            <p>Department of Conservation and Wellington Zoo staff released the bird from the Lady Elizabeth IV police launch in Cook Strait yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A video shows the Adélie leaping - as if from an ice shelf - from its cage and into the water, before quickly disappearing.</p>
        
            <p>Zoo staff, who have been caring for the bird, said she "took off in the right direction straight away, ready to make a dent in her journey back home to Antarctica" - about 3000km away.</p>
        
            <p>The release was the second effort to liberate the bird. A recent attempt on Wellington's south coast was abandoned when she began to overheat.</p>
        
            <p>
Wellington Zoo staff involved in the release said the bird headed off in the right direction.
