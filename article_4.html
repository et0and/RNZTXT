        <h2>Watch: Auckland's Gulf Harbour Country Club building on fire</h2>
        <p>
A local resident saw the blaze from his bedroom window and says the flames kept "getting bigger and bigger".
</p>
        
            <p>A golf shop at the vacant Gulf Harbour Country Club caught fire overnight, and was extinguished by six crews.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said they sent four engines just before 3am after receiving multiple calls.</p>
        
            <p>Those crews called for back-up while en route.</p>
        
            <p>A total of six crews worked on the blaze at the golf shop which was about 10sqm in size. It was put out just after 4am.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would be returning to the scene this morning.</p>

            <p>Local resident Greg Taylor, whose home was about 400 metres from the scene of the fire, said he woke to see the blaze from his bedroom window.</p>
        
            <p>"It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was not too surprised given the buildings had been empty since the middle of last year.</p>
        
            <p>He feared the main country club building would be next.</p>
        
            <p>"The building itself is completely abandoned, just about every window's been smashed."</p>
        
            <p>Residents had reported it to police and the council, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The club, a former training ground of world champion Lydia Ko, was abruptly closed last July.</p>
        
            <p>Plans to redevelop the golf course and country club have been off and on, and an application was made to put its owners into liquidation in April.</p>

            <p>The club and its redevelopment has sparked a strong reaction from local residents who formed a society to challenge any possible redevelopment into housing.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Councillor John Watson said people had broken in and caused damage to the abandoned club in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a degree of vandalism," he said. "People have broken in and vandalised things."</p>
        
            <p>Some parts of it had been boarded up, but its isolated location surrounded by golf course meant it was a sitting duck for break-ins.</p>
        
            <p>The council could play no role in securing the building, as it was still private property, said Watson.</p>
        
            <p>"The council has certainly been made aware, has made inspections at times, but it is still the responsibility of the owner."</p>
        
            <p>He said the feeling among locals was that it was being left to degrade as part of an eventual plan to turn the land into housing, which many locals strongly opposed.</p>
        
            <p>Community group Keep WhangaparƒÅoa's Green Spaces (KWGS) said they were appalled and saddened by the overnight fire.</p>
        
            <p>"The community has been calling on authorities and the owner to secure the clubhouse buildings since the golf club abruptly closed in July 2023," it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Since then the clubhouse has been subject to extensive graffiti and vandalism. KWGS supporters have been disappointed that no attempt has been made to fence the clubhouse site off and make it secure."</p>
