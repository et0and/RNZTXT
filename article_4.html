            <p>Whānau of a man who lay dead in his Kāinga Ora unit for a week were unable to bury him in the Cook Islands because of how long it took to find his body.</p>
        
            <p>Tairo Puangi, 42, died between 24 April and 2 May 2019, at his unit in Auckland's Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the length of time before he was found, his cause of death could not be ascertained, Coroner Tania Tetitaha ruled.</p>
        
            <p>Puangi lived alone in the apartment building, which has now been torn down, and dealt with long-term mental health issues, including schizoaffective disorder and addiction.</p>
        
            <p>His sister, Terani Puangi, said her brother was "a big unit" and his mental health issues could make him intimidating or aggressive to those he did not know.</p>
        
            <p>She said he was "never the same" after their dad died when they were teenagers. She said the more recent deaths of their brother and mum made things worse.</p>
        
            <p>Puangi had been arrested in 2018 for assaulting his tenancy manager and witnesses described him as "lonely" and missing his mum, who had lived nearby.</p>
        
            <p>Terani Puangi said he remained close to her and their other sisters, one of which would catch up with him weekly for lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"We talked regularly and he'd always be asking us for money to buy food. He loved his food - he'd been a chef in Rarotonga when he was younger and was a great cook.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a funny guy and I'll always remember him cooking for us every Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>In the days before his death, Puangi visited his doctor for his monthly anti-psychotic injection and no concerns were reported.</p>
        
            <p>In the early hours of 24 April, neighbours heard banging for five to 10 minutes coming from his unit and noticed his bedroom window was broken and there was a bad smell.</p>
        
            <p>A tenant reported the broken window to the tenancy manager as he was worried the windowpane could fall and hurt someone. He was told to contact customer support.</p>
        
            <p>Five days later, customer support emailed the tenancy manager to follow up the tenant's concerns about the window and not seeing Puangi for days.</p>
        
            <p>The tenancy manager tried calling Puangi but there was no answer. He visited the unit and took photos of the glass but did not knock due to Puangi's "risk rating".</p>
        
            <p>The next day emergency powers of entry were granted to the unit so the window could be fixed.</p>
        
            <p>On 2 May, Kāinga Ora staff and a locksmith went into the unit to find it in disarray and Puangi dead.</p>
        
            <p>Terani Puangi said her sister had been calling him and had visited the apartments to see if he was there.</p>
        
            <p>"We ended up getting a call from an officer we knew that we needed to head there and that's when we found out he was dead."</p>
        
            <p>Due to decomposition, Terani Puangi said the family were not able to fly his body to Rarotonga to be buried on family land.</p>
        
            <p>Her brother loved Rarotonga and his heritage, she said, so the decision was upsetting.</p>
        
            <p>"Seven days lying there is too long. It's sad knowing he had to wait to be found."</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora told the Coroner welfare checks on tenants were not conducted until 2021, and they believed the response to concerns about Puangi and his death were "adequate".</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Tetitaha said Puangi was a "vulnerable tenant" due to his mental health background and his absence should have generated more investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Kāinga Ora classified his mental unwellness as a risk instead of vulnerability - if a welfare check was done on April 24, his death may have been prevented.</p>
        
            <p>"He shouldn't have been excluded from support measures due to his mental unwellness."</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Tetitaha recommended Kāinga Ora reviewed its policies and its definition of vulnerable tenants to include mental health conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Urgent checks should be done on vulnerable tenants when concerns are raised."</p>
        
            <p>Terani Puangi said she had come to terms with the situation and there was nothing to be done.</p>
        
            <p>"It is what it is, I just hope Kāinga Ora have learnt from this and it doesn't happen again."</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora said it supported the Coroner's recommendations.</p>
        
            <p>John Tubberty, Kāinga Ora's regional director for Auckland Central and East, said changes to the way they worked had been made.</p>
        
            <p>"Further improvements to enhance the way we support at risk or vulnerable customers are being explored."</p>
        
            <p>Tubberty noted as a landlord, there were limitations to the welfare role Kāinga could play as tenants had the right to peaceful enjoyment.</p>
        
            <p>"If they provide us with medical information we record that and any associated vulnerabilities and use that to inform how we respond when concerns are raised."</p>
