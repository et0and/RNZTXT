            <p>A Wellington cyclist was left relying on good Samaritans after his bike was punctured by drawing pins scattered on a cycleway.</p>
        
            <p>Tacks on the cycleways have been an intermittent problem for Wellington cyclists over the past few years.</p>
        
            <p>Over the weekend several cyclists took to social media to report tacks being strewn across cycleways around Cambridge Terrace and Evans Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Cyclist Jeremy Rose's e-bike was punctured by tacks on the Evans Bay cycle path on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>He has recently undergone chemotherapy and has balance issues, so he finds the cycle lanes easier to ride on.</p>
        
            <p>Rose said he did not have a puncture repair kit on him, and even if he did, he said with his health the way it was, he would not have been able to use it.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just it was the last thing I needed really," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said a couple going past offered to help him, and a man named Nick replaced the damaged tube on his bike.</p>
        
            <p>Rose said the actions of what he termed the "tack tosser" were irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"It's also the intent," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that someone has purposely gone out to ruin your day. It doesn't make you feel good."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said it was aware of the social media reports and was encouraging the public to report any tacks they come across on the city's cycleways.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a very serious issue, not only for costs to repair a tyre, but the big issue here is safety, especially as these cycleways are used by young children and parents with toddlers."</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said a cyclist who got a flat tyre caused by a tack while travelling at speed faced the risk of serious injury.</p>
        
            <p>"Offenders could face fines or prosecution.</p>
        
            <p>"We encourage the public to report it immediately to our contact centre on 499 4444 so they can arrange for contractors to sweep the site, and for it to be included in reports to police."</p>
        
            <p>Police, when asked if any of the tacks on cycleways had been reported to them, said they were aware of at least one report made in December.</p>
