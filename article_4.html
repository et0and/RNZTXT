            <p>A 31-year-old man has been arrested after the theft of medical gear from an ambulance helicopter in Mosgiel</p>
        
            <p>In the early hours of Sunday 12 January, a bag containing critical medical equipment and supplies was stolen from the Queenstown rescue helicopter, which was forced to hold-over at the North Taieri base due to bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>The head of Helicopters Otago dipped into his own pocket to pay for a $10,000 reward to catch whoever stole the supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters Otago chief executive Graeme Gale told RNZ on Thursday that he would be honouring his commitment.</p>
        
            <p>Police say a search warrant was executed at a Dunedin address on Wednesday, where the 31-year-old was arrested at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The man is alleged to have also been involved in two other burglaries in the Dunedin area the early hours of the morning Sunday 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to appear in Dunedin District Court today charged with three charges of burglary and two charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.</p>
