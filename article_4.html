            <p>More than 60 Muriwai homes are being pulled apart as Auckland Council moves into the final stages of storm recovery.</p>
        
            <p>More than a year after Cyclone Gabrielle rendered them uninhabitable, the first batch of homes purchased by Auckland Council under the category 3 buyout scheme are being demolished, deconstructed or relocated.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai Stickered Residents Group chairperson Mike Hibbert said it was an emotional time, as residents reflected on the trauma of the storm.</p>
        
            <p>"Families seeing their houses being demolished or removed is obviously pretty intense," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're confronted with your house of, say, 30 years being deconstructed ... you're back there living it all over again."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council's deputy group recovery manager Mace Ward said the removal of the homes would have an enormous impact on the tight-knit community.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a small community of 1400 people, and over 60 homes will no longer be in this community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sixty families won't be here any longer."</p>
        
            <p>Mike Hibbert said many would be forced to move.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a small community with a small number of houses available for sale," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"People are making those big life decisions. They're thinking [about moving] to the east coast or somewhere else closer to town. It's really hard on the community. It's horrible to say goodbye."</p>
        
            <p>Though some homes would be demolished, Ward said the wrecking ball was a last resort.</p>
        
            <p>"Where we can, the first priority is to see if we can relocate a home in total," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The next best outcome is to deconstruct the materials for reuse, and the final option is a demolition."</p>
        
            <p>Among the companies working with the council on deconstruction was the Trow Group, founded by Saia Latu.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was important to treat each house with respect.</p>
        
            <p>"Before we start any of these projects we have a karakia," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Each house has a story, kids grew up, grandparents come here for holidays ... there's a lot to consider when doing what we do. We always look at it like it's our own home."</p>
        
            <p>Latu's team was deconstructing a house on Domain Crescent, which was hit by a slip during the cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>He said the previous owners left a lot of memories behind.</p>
        
            <p>"They didn't have a lot of time to get the stuff out, they just ran," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the owners come through. They spent the three days we were deconstructing moving stuff. They recovered jewellery, taonga, a passport ... There was a car that was underneath [the slip] as well."</p>
        
            <p>The house would be gone in a matter of weeks, but its materials - the timber, the concrete and the glass - would be recycled and reused.</p>
        
            <p>"The reason why we deconstruct it in such a way is so they might have some comfort knowing their home that they lived in isn't just being smashed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The timber, it's beautiful timber. Why would you throw that away? The price of materials in New Zealand are through the roof."</p>
        
            <p>Ward hoped the council would find some use for the land, too.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be on a case-by-case basis, but in this case for future safety it will never be built on again," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a rural community so a wastewater treatment system might go on that land ... or a garage."</p>
        
            <p>He hoped residents would feel a sense of closure after 15 months of uncertainty.</p>
