            <p>A cannabis grower's stash has gone up in smoke after an ill-advised call to the cops.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 2am on Tuesday morning, police received a call reporting a theft from a resident in Mahora, Hastings. They had just seen a balaclava-clad man with a butcher's knife stealing plants from their Williams Street property.</p>
        
            <p>Police quickly located the suspect, who had stuffed something into a green waste bin.</p>
        
            <p>Police looked in the bin and found a cannabis plant "the size of a big Christmas tree".</p>
        
            <p>After taking the suspect back to the station they returned to question the informant, and found more cannabis, triggering a search warrant - finding "several other cannabis plants, buds and seeds inside the address, and several more plants in the backyard".</p>
        
            <p>"To add to the informant's woes, they lost a second lot of cannabis after police confiscated the remaining plants, buds and seeds back to the station," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded by charging the informant with cultivating cannabis and possessing cannabis utensils.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged thief, a 35-year-old man, was charged with aggravated burglary and will appear in court later this month.</p>
        
            <p>"Enquiries are continuing, but the cannabis tree won't see Christmas," police said.</p>
