            <p>Heavy fog in Auckland is delaying flights and affecting ferry services, and MetService says the low cloud will take a while to clear.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Airport said about 30 domestic regional flights had been cancelled and 27 domestic regional flights had been delayed.</p>
        
            <p>Fog restrictions were still in place at Auckland Airport after sunrise as low cloud blanketed parts of the city.</p>

            <p>One flight to Christchurch and another to Wellington have also been affected by the fog.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic flights to Dunedin and Queenstown have not been affected, nor have any international flights.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were urged to check the airport's website for latest arrival and departure information.</p>
        
            <p>Ferry services were affected by the heavy fog, with a number delayed for up to 30 minutes, and two services cancelled - the 7am Gulf Harbour to Downtown and the earlier Downtown to Beach Haven.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said a combination of light winds and the sun being very low in the sky would mean the fog would take a while to clear, but it is forecasting the fog to lift by this afternoon.</p>
