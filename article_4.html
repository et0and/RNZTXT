            <p>The death of a man in his 70s on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing this morning would have been upsetting for everyone involved, a shuttle operator says.</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu Scenic Shuttles owner Colin Baker said he was told the 71-year-old hit his head after tripping over at Red Crater and died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said he had cancelled his shuttles for Tuesday due to bad weather on the crossing, including high winds and poor visibility.</p>
        
            <p>"I got a phone call from another operator who told me what had occurred and said, 'if you have people up here you're going to need to come and pick them up'. They were being turned around at Red Crater to go back to the start. The r훮hui was put in place immediately."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said he had seen many people die on the crossing in the two-and-a-half decades he had worked there, and each death was difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel for all of the people who were up there, who went to [the man's assistance] and for those who have to go up there to help with the recovery. I really feel for those guys and girls."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police confirmed a person died on the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called shortly before 9.30am.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the best efforts of those involved, the person died a short time later."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation was asking hikers to use alternative tracks following the death.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, DOC said all hikers in the area were asked to consider using alternative tracks during the r훮hui "to show respect".</p>
        
            <p>The r훮hui is in place on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing until sunrise this Friday.</p>
