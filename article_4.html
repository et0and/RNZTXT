            <p>Neighbour Kelly Lambert was startled awake when gunshots rang out from across the street.</p>
        
            <p>"I just woke up at about 6:35am and heard five gunshots really loudly," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My husband went out the driveway and heard some screaming [so] we rang the police."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a shock to have something like this happen so close to home.</p>
        
            <p>"It definitely gave me the shivers, because the gunshots were quite deafening.</p>
        
            <p>"But I think the police have it under control... I'm not afraid for our safety."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident, Saf Khan, was also woken by the gunshots.</p>
        
            <p>"I heard five gunshots in rapid succession, it was pretty loud at that time of the morning so I'm sure it woke up a lot of people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you hear gunshots that close to your house it is a bit concerning, we go for walks down that street so it's very surprising."</p>
        
            <p>Neighbour Adam Alkhatib feared his peaceful neighbourhood was becoming unsafe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite worrying... I've been here for a long time and it's never been like this," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's definitely a spike in crime, we feel a lack of safety."</p>
