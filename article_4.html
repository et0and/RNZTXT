            <p>The Hawke's Bay Regional Council has voted unanimously to keep its Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>Under new government legislation, any council wanting to keep or establish a Māori ward must hold a poll with its constituents.</p>
        
            <p>Council chairpesron Hinewai Ormsby said Wednesday's vote was a significant step towards ensuring Māori representation and participation in the region's decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>"Having Māori councillors at the table not only empowers Māori voices and views, but also enriches the diversity and quality of the Council's decisions. These seats have brought a Māori worldview to a place where it has a voice and a vote," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Co-chairpeople of the council's Māori Committee Mike Paku and Katarina Kawana were pleased with the decision.</p>
        
            <p>"Māori constituencies are a vital mechanism to ensure that the voices and perspectives of Māori are heard and respected at the council table, and that the issues and opportunities that affect Māori are addressed effectively," Paku said.</p>
        
            <p>The Heretaunga District Council has also agreed unanimously to keep its Takitimu Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>The Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori wards/constituencies) Amendment Act requires all councils with Māori seats to make a choice to either run a binding poll about the future of Māori wards at the 2025 local government elections, or dissolve the constituencies at the 2025 elections.</p>
