            <p>A Cook Strait ferry operator hopes to have a one-metre hole in the hull of one of its ships repaired by tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander's Kai훮rahi was damaged during berthing ten days ago, causing hundreds of cancelled bookings.</p>
        
            <p>The accident happened just days after another Cook Strait ferry - Bluebridge's Connemara - hit a wharf while leaving Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander's general manager of operations Duncan Roy said repairs to Kai훮rahi were progressing well.</p>
        
            <p>"Ultrasonic weld-testing is underway today and we are on track to return the ship to service on Thursday night or earlier. We appreciate everyone's patience and understanding while our team works to get Kaiarahi back into safe service as quickly as possible."</p>
