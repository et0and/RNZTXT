            <p>Two people have been arrested after fleeing police, reportedly in possession of a gun.</p>
        
            <p>Police said officers signalled for a vehicle carrying two people to stop in Stokes Valley around 1pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle did not stop, and while police did not give chase, it was spiked on White Lines East Road in Lower Hutt a short time later.</p>
        
            <p>The car was then found abandoned on Pirie Crescent.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public reported seeing one person running away carrying a gun, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said one of the occupants of the vehicle then allegedly stole a truck, before being caught in Kiwi Street.</p>
        
            <p>A firearm has been found at a Tirangi property and a second person taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there was no ongoing threat to the public, but they would be in the area while scene examinations were carried out.</p>
