        <h2>NZ warned military op could see civilians killed</h2>
        <p>
Judith Collins was told there was no way to rule out "collateral damage" if New Zealand joined a coalition conducting strikes against Houthi rebels. Audio

            <p>The government was warned Yemeni civilians could be killed in an operation in which New Zealand is involved to protect shipping in the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>The coalition announced in January that the Defence Force would be sending a team of six to take part in the United States-led strikes against the Houthis and provide maritime security in the area.</p>
        
            <p>In the three months since they deployed, members of the team have been involved in destroying Houthi helicopters, underground weapon storage facilities and air defence systems.</p>
        
            <p>The government decided to send a team to join the group after the US chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown Jr, requested a meeting with New Zealand Chief of Defence Air Marshal Kevin Short on 6 January.</p>
        
            <p>The US was seeking "military contributions to a new coalition" that would conduct "kinetic operations" - in other words, military action with lethal force against Houthi targets.</p>
        
            <p>The government announced the decision to send a deployment two weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>Documents released to RNZ showed officials asked Defence Minister Judith Collins to decide between two options, both six-month deployments.</p>
        
            <p>The recommended option was 'a targeting team of up to six personnel' - including intelligence analysts, mission planners and a legal advisor - who would work alongside partners to enable the coalition to carry out strikes on Houthi targets.</p>
        
            <p>It was seen as the better option because it would allow the Defence Force to provide a contribution of "notable operational value".</p>
        
            <p>The inclusion of a legal advisor was seen as important to provide additional assurances that New Zealand's Rules of Engagement were not "transgressed" during planning of lethal force operations.</p>
        
            <p>The second option was to only send two people in planning and targeting roles. A contribution of this size would have been seen as largely tokenistic and not as significant, the documents showed.</p>
        
            <p>In an aide memoir to Collins, officials said contributing to a team was in New Zealand's interests but was not without risks.</p>

            <p>Those specific risks were redacted from the documents.</p>
        
            <p>A cabinet paper also talked of risks that were removed, but noted there was a threat to "personnel deployed to operational headquarters" in the region.</p>
        
            <p>One of the documents also showed there was no way to rule out civilian casualties, but the consideration of "collateral damage" would be a critical step in the planning of such attacks focused on Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen, or across the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>The officials also told the minister any Defence Force personnel involved in the coalition would be in the "targeting chain" - in other words, planning an attack which could cause Houthi fighters deaths or injuries, supply chain problems or wider disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>The documents showed the six-month deployment was expected to cost $655,000 and not have an impact on the Defence Force's ability to respond to other needs in New Zealand or the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Since the deployment began, the coalition has destroyed many Houthi assets.</p>
        
            <p>Official updates from US Central Command detail two occasions where New Zealand has been involved.</p>
        
            <p>On 3 February, US, United Kingdom and allied forces including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand conducted "strikes against 36 Houthi targets at 13 locations in Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist-controlled areas of Yemen".</p>
        
            <p>Those strikes managed to hit multiple underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, unmanned aerial vehicle storage and operations sites, radars, and helicopters.</p>
        
            <p>On 24 February, the same coalition conducted strikes against 18 Houthi targets in Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist-controlled areas of Yemen.</p>
        
            <p>The targets included Houthi underground weapons storage facilities, missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial systems, air defence systems, radars, and a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>US Central Command also detailed other events where the US and "coalition forces" shared the daily numbers of attacks they were under or targets they struck in a day.</p>
        
            <p>It was unclear if New Zealand was involved in that coalition.</p>
        
            <p>There have been no reports of civilian casualties in any of the updates since New Zealand joined the coalition.</p>
        
            <p>Officials told the government New Zealand had strategic interests in being involved in the coalition because it protected the free flow of trade to and from the country.</p>
        
            <p>The documents said some exporters had already reported lost orders because of the delays caused by avoiding the Red Sea.</p>
        
            <p>It also noted that insurance and transport costs had increased with anticipated implications for the competitiveness of New Zealand exports and the prices consumers would pay for imported goods.</p>
        
            <p>The Suez Canal and Red Sea is a hugely important shipping route for trade with Europe and North Africa - specifically agriculture exports.</p>
