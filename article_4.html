            <p>A man belonging to the Killer Beez gang has been arrested after trying to avoid a South Auckland police checkpoint on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the suspect's vehicle turned around to avoid going through the routine checkpoint, and accelerated away when officers approached.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle was driven erratically and at times using the wrong side of the road with its headlights off," Inspector Rakana Cook said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The police Eagle helicopter tracked the vehicle to a property on La Trobe Street, Pakuranga.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver has fled from the vehicle and was quickly located on the street by officers and taken into custody without further incident."</p>
        
            <p>His vehicle was impounded for six months. The 34-year-old suspect was charged with failing to stop, reckless driving, possession of cannabis and driving while forbidden, and will appear in Manukau District Court on 16 May.</p>
        
            <p>"It is incredibly fortunate no member of the public was seriously injured as a result of the driver's actions," Cook said.</p>
