            <p>Firefighters are confident a large vegetation fire burning on Tiwai Peninsula, near Bluff, is under control.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which began on Thursday, was burning over 1200 hectares of scrub and valuable conservation wetland, with a perimeter of 18 kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 firefighters were at the scene on Thursday, as the fire grew in size due to higher temperatures and winds.</p>
        
            <p>Two crews remained on site overnight to monitor the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>The fire poses no immediate threat to people, homes, the Tiwai Point smelter or the Tiwai Bridge, a spokesperson for Fire and Emergency said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency incident controller Hamish Angus told Morning Report on Friday the outlook was "pretty good".</p>
        
            <p>"We just had a bit of a look up there this morning and,, things look pretty contained and controlled. We haven't got any visible flames at the moment, so things are looking really good."</p>
        
            <p>It was too early to determine a cause just yet, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a couple of fire investigators coming out here this morning,, so I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of all of that."</p>
        
            <p>Cooling pumps for the aluminium smelter were threatened by the blaze, but they had been so far protected.</p>
        
            <p>"Tiwai is well used to this - certainly this isn't the first fire down here, so they do have other options [for] generation… It wouldn't have been a catastrophe, but certainly one of their priorities today is supporting the power contractors to get in there and get the lines connected to pumps."</p>
        
            <p>The primary job now for firefighters would be establishing a "cold perimeter" and knocking out any heat sources before the wind picks up, forecast for later in the week.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty much time now for the real grunt work to start."</p>
