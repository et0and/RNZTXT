            <p>Three iwi representatives who will sit on Tauranga City Council committees have been welcomed to their roles.</p>
        
            <p>Late last year, elected members voted to reinstate tangata whenua representatives and their voting rights to the council's three committees.</p>
        
            <p>A pōwhiri was held for Arthur Flintoff, Rohario Murray and Jacqui Rolleston-Steed at Wairoa Marae on Wednesday, 26 March as part of the council's tangata whenua committee meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Environmental planner Flintoff will join the city's future committee. He is a board member of Ara Rau Tangata and was a SmartGrowth adviser for four years.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Rohario Murray was appointed to the audit and risk committee. She was on the council's strategy, finance and risk committee from February 2021 until May 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Rolleston-Steed joins the city delivery committee. She is the director of the Bay of Plenty Regional Public Service Commission and worked at Bay of Plenty Regional Council for 22 years.</p>
        
            <p>The tangata whenua representatives would be paid $1085 a meeting which included any needed preparation and $542 for a workshop or "approved duties".</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Mahé Drysdale said the councillors involved in the selection process were impressed with the quality of the candidates.</p>

            <p>The skills and knowledge the iwi representatives would bring would be a benefit for Tauranga, he said during Wednesday's meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"We will make better decisions for the city."</p>
        
            <p>Drysdale said it was a pleasure to welcome them to the team.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you for putting your hand up, picking up the tea towel and serving your community."</p>
        
            <p>The relationships the council was building with Tauranga iwi and hapū were fantastic, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to work with anyone that wants to make our city better. We're very into working in partnership to achieve our goals."</p>
        
            <p>The request to reinstate tangata whenua representatives to council committees was made by Te Rangapū Mana Whenua o Tauranga Moana, a collective that represents the 17 iwi and hapū in Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi representatives had been appointed to council committees since 2016 and were given voting rights in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>At December's meeting, Te Rangapū chairwoman Matire Duncan said tangata whenua representation was a legal requirement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Local Government and Resource Management Acts, not preferential treatment.</p>

            <p>"It reflects a commitment to shared decision-making and inclusivity, which are vital for our community's future."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Tauranga MP Sam Uffindell came under fire from Duncan for his proposed equal voting rights bill.</p>
        
            <p>Uffindell said the draft bill was intended to stop any move away from the principle of equal suffrage where each person got an equal say in electing people.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Duncan said the bill risked undermining the Crown's obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        
            <p>It appeared to be a reaction to councils granting tangata whenua representatives full voting rights on committees, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This bill misrepresents Māori representation mechanisms as special rights rather than corrective measures to address the ongoing effects of colonisation and ensure meaningful partnership between the Crown and tangata whenua."</p>
        
            <p>Uffindell said he disagreed with giving voting rights to any unelected members on council committees, whether on "racial lines" or "expertise lines".</p>
        
            <p>"At a higher level, I believe in equal suffrage and … to be on a local council, you need to be elected to be on that local council."</p>
        
            <p>The tangata whenua representatives will join their committees from Monday, 31 March.</p>
