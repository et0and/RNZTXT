            <p>Watercare is urging West Auckland residents to begin storing water due to work which may cause discolouration.</p>
        
            <p>The council agency said from 8pm until 8am Sunday, they would be working to bring a pump station back into service, to help keep local water storage reservoirs topped up more easily through summer.</p>
        
            <p>Water flowing through the pipes at a faster rate may stir up sediment in the pipes and discolour the water temporarily, which may affect the network on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"In response, we will be flushing water through the pipes to remove the discoloured water," Watercare said, adding that they expected any instances of discoloured water to be brief.</p>
        
            <p>Areas that may be affected by this include Henderson, Te Atatū South, Te Atatū Peninsula, Ranui, Swanson, Massey, West Harbour, Whenuapai, Greenhithe, and Herald Island.</p>
        
            <p>While water discolouration is unlikely to cause sickness, Watercare is recommending residents have bottled or stored drinking water on hand for tomorrow morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Discoloured water due to maintenance work on the water network does not contain any bacterial pathogens that could harm public health. The discolouration in such cases is caused by naturally occurring minerals.</p>
        
            <p>"We carry out frequent water quality tests at various locations across the Auckland region as required by the Ministry of Health to ensure that drinking water continues to meet health standards and remains safe to drink."</p>
        
            <p>Discoloured water may also stain garments, so Watercare recommends that residents check the colour of the water during the work period before doing their laundry.</p>
        
            <p>On its website, it states people could take a shower even if they experience discoloured water but they may prefer to bathe before the works begin.</p>
        
            <p>Those who experience discoloured water on Sunday morning should run their taps for 10 minutes, but if it does not clear they should email Watercare (TriangleRoadPS@water.co.nz) to send a crew to their area.</p>
