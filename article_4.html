            <p>A Kiwi ex-pat who tortured his three-year-old son in Australia is set to be deported to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>And a member of his family says the Christchurch community where he is likely bound should be on high alert.</p>
        
            <p>Jason David Ogier, 53, was jailed for two and a half years in 2007 for repeated assaults on his son, including deliberately burning him with a cigarette lighter, pulling out a fingernail with a pair of pliers and rubbing chilli powder on his skin.</p>
        
            <p>The abuse took place between 2004-06.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly two decades later, in 2022, Ogier was jailed for 20 months after he pleaded guilty to seven charges of using electronic communication to expose a child under 16 years in an indecent manner.</p>
        
            <p>That offending is believed to have triggered the cancellation of his Australian visa.</p>
        
            <p>A close family member who didn't want to be identified, told Stuff "absolutely everyone" in the Christchurch community should be on "high alert for themselves, children and businesses".</p>
        
            <p>"He is highly obsessive with children and hurting them.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest I feel a huge relief that he will no longer be in Australia."</p>
        
            <p>Ogier's mother, who lives in Invercargill, said she didn't have anything to do with him, but had heard he had spent the past year in a detention centre in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff understands he is estranged from most of his children. According to his Facebook profile he has six daughters and five sons. At least two of those children are Balinese.</p>
        
            <p>Ogier's horrific abuse of his son made headlines in Australia when he was jailed in 2007. According to the Brisbane Times, some of the offending was committed while his wife was in hospital giving birth.</p>
        
            <p>To discipline his son for not eating dinner, Ogier rubbed chilli powder on his back, causing the skin to blister at their Perth home.</p>
        
            <p>The newspaper reported he burned his son's hand with a cigarette lighter and when the finger became infected Ogier pulled the nail out with pliers, causing it to bleed.</p>
        
            <p>Ogier also kicked his son with steel-capped boots and slapped his head from side to side, asking his other children if they wanted to join his game of "tennis".</p>
        
            <p>When the three-year old boy had supposedly not finished his house chores, Ogier repeatedly beat him with a clenched fist, knocking him to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>However, the couple never sought medical help for his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The Magistrate noted Ogier's harsh treatment as a child by his own father who was a violent alcoholic and policeman.</p>
        
            <p>Police prosecutor Sergeant David Murphy said Ogier had shown no remorse.</p>
        
            <p>"(They are) barbaric acts of cruelty perpetrated on his own child, a defenceless, three-year-old boy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Sydney Morning Herald Ogier tried to deny the abuse, which led to the Magistrate saying the then father of nine had no empathy for his children.</p>
        
            <p>His wife at the time, Belinda Ogier, also pleaded guilty to one count of neglect.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the offending, the Ogiers were on community-based orders for a 2005 assault on their 11-year-old son.</p>
        
            <p>In 2014 the Australian government made amendments to the Migration Act, which meant any non-citizen sentenced to 12 months in an Australian prison was liable for deportation on bad character grounds - even if they'd completed their time behind bars years earlier.</p>
        
            <p>Those deported were nicknamed '501s' after the section in the act that dealt with bad character.</p>
