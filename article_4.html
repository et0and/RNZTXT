            <p>The silt is gone and the road into the seaside village of Herbertville is under repair after Cyclone Gabrielle struck last year, but the pub - a key part of the community - remains closed.</p>
        
            <p>The village - located on the remote lower North Island east coast - did not escape the force of the February 2023 cyclone.</p>
        
            <p>Logs damming the Wainui River caused flooding that swept through the campground, several houses and the pub - the Herbertville Inn.</p>
        
            <p>Its doors have mostly remained shut since, and new owners Darren Minnoch and Kristy Shute feel the responsibility to reopen.</p>
        
            <p>"This will be, probably for a lot of the locals, the final thing for things to be up and running," Shute said.</p>
        
            <p>"Life can go back to normal - what it was like before, because this is the hub of the community."</p>
        
            <p>The swollen river left mud throughout the pub - in the bar, the outdoor area, the kitchen and the accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Minnoch and Shute are ready to buy the building materials needed for repair work, as they look towards a late-winter opening.</p>
        
            <p>"Realistically, I'd like it to be open in three months, to do the floor and just give it a lick of paint and make it more welcoming in its appearance and its interior," Minnoch said.</p>
        
            <p>They plan to change the pub's name to the Herbertville Saloon and want to turn it into a venue for live music, including hosting high school battles of the bands.</p>
        
            <p>Minnoch is a music veteran and has played in pubs around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He discovered the Herbertville pub one summer. He asked if he could play his guitar in the outdoor bar, the then-owners said yes and he kept coming back.</p>

            <p>With plenty of work needed on the property, which dates to the 1950s after the original building burned down, Minnoch and Shute are planing a gradual reopening.</p>
        
            <p>"To start, the kitchen and the bar floor are priority, and then I'm going to concentrate on one accommodation room at a time," Minnoch said of his plan for the next few weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"It terms of it opening it will definitely be maybe part of the bar and the garden bar first - anything it takes to get open as soon as possible," Shute said.</p>
        
            <p>The mud has gone from the pub, and while there is damage, some essentials - including the chiller - are intact.</p>
        
            <p>It did briefly trade for a few days over New Year, but had to shut again because of licensing issues and for its refurbishment, so it will be a while between drinks for locals.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been really supportive," Shute said.</p>
        
            <p>"Just before the sale went through, before we went unconditional, a group of them arranged a working bee and they came here and cleared all the grounds. It was amazing - just to get us open."</p>
        
            <p>Plenty of hard work was also required to get the Herbertville Campground open - it closed for non-permanent residents for two months last year while 16 truck loads of silt were removed.</p>

John Sedcole says a dry summer has helped the village recover.

            <p>Manager John Sedcole said some cabins were damaged.</p>
        
            <p>"We waited until after winter and put 200 tonnes of metal on the driveway because it was just dust or mud depending on what the weather was like each day.</p>
        
            <p>"Cabins got cleaned up pretty quickly, and the toilet block and kitchen were operating for residents within a week."</p>
        
            <p>After a wet few years this summer stayed dry, and the village was humming.</p>
        
            <p>"In December and January we had over 2000 people through the motorcamp - not all at once of course.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest night was probably New Year's Eve, when we had nearly 400 people in the campground."</p>

Andy Cumming says the weeks of silt clean up were tough.

            <p>Andy Cumming now lives over the road, but he was staying in a campground cabin when Gabrielle struck.</p>
        
            <p>"I was very lucky I'd just raised it the year before and re-piled it. If I didn't I would have been under water."</p>
        
            <p>After the cyclone he was one of several permanent campground residents who helped Sedcole with the silt clean up.</p>
        
            <p>"I did probably a month, six weeks. By that stage, doing it every day and looking at it every day, I had to get out of here for a week and a half because I was going to lose the plot."</p>
        
            <p>Herbertville is nearly complete again - but the scarred road in and out of the village serve as a reminder of Gabrielle's power and the continuing clean-up.</p>
