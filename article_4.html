        <h2>MetService rolls out storm and fire notifications for app</h2>
        <p>
The weather monitoring agency says the feature is partially a response to the widespread confusion during last year's floods in Auckland.

            <p>MetService will send notifications to people in the paths of extreme storms or in areas with a high fire risk.</p>
        
            <p>The weather monitoring agency is rolling out the feature in its app, which will notify users if a severe storm is on its way to their current location.</p>
        
            <p>MetService weather communication head Lisa Murray said the feature was partially a response to the widespread confusion during last year's floods in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"It's close to a year since the devastating impacts of the Auckland storms, closely followed by Cyclone Gabrielle," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These notifications are one of the ways we're aiming to warn more Kiwis of dangerous weather."</p>
        
            <p>She hoped the early warnings would give people time to react and protect themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, the quicker the public can get information [and] the more information they can get gives them what they need to make decisions to protect their families, their properties and their livelihoods," Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>The impacts of climate change were pushing the agency to step up its warning systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Climate change obviously has been feeding into our weather warnings for a long time, it's why we changed to a colour-coded warning system in 2019 and introduced the red warnings," Murray said.</p>

            <p>Notifications were the next step, maximising the amount of time people had to react and seek shelter.</p>
        
            <p>"The most important thing for people to do [when they get a notification] is to react and take immediate action," Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>"If it's a wind warning, tie down the trampoline or secure tiles on the roof. If it's a rain warning, check gutters or drains to make sure they're clear."</p>
        
            <p>Murray said people who had the notifications enabled would receive the alert as soon as the warning was issued.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has also partnered with Fire and Emergency to include fire danger warnings.</p>
        
            <p>"More and more weather is causing these really extreme conditions in regards to wildfires, you have the winds that will spread the fires, the dry conditions," Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>To avoid unwanted notifications, users will only be notified if their current location or home is in the danger zone.</p>
        
            <p>"They will be tailored to wherever you are in the country, if you're in a region where a red warning is issued you'll receive a notification," Murray said.</p>
        
            <p>Given the impact weather had on wildfires, Murray said working with FENZ seemed like a "very good partnership".</p>
        
            <p>An update to MetService's app is expected to roll out from Thursday.</p>
