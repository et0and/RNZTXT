            <p>Parts of the country are in for another scorcher, with a heat alert for Auckland and Te Kuiti expected to hit 30C.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has a heat alert in place for Auckland, with high sustained temperatures predicted.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said most of the upper North Island, including Whitianga, Tauranga, and WhakatƒÅne, would see warm temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>For locations under a heat alert, MetService said it advised to keep hydrated, seek shade, check in with vulnerable people and look after pets and livestock.</p>
        
            <p>A cold change was expected on Friday and Saturday, Wotherspoon said, with a cold front moving up the country.</p>
        
            <p>It would see temperatures drop in the South Island before picking up again early next week.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said Alexandra and Taumarunui were forecasted to go from highs of 29C on Wednesday to just 18C and 19C respectively on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"For those planning an extended weekend ahead of Waitangi Day, early indications suggest that, aside from the occasional shower in Fiordland, a ridge of high pressure is poised to bring settled weather on Monday and Tuesday for the rest of Aotearoa New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Taurange Airport was the hottest location, recording a maximum temperature of 30.4C.</p>
        
            <p>Twizel hit 30.1C.</p>
        
            <p>Springs Junction has the coldest minimum temperature, at 5.7C.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury will move to a prohibited fire season from midnight on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said that meant no open-air fires were allowed and all fire permits were suspended.</p>
        
            <p>District Commander Dave Stackhouse said there have been several significant fires in Canterbury recently, and hot, dry, windy weather was expected to continue for the next two months.</p>
