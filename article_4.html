            <p>Lawyers on both sides of an appeal involving murder charges more than two decades old have agreed all convictions should be quashed.</p>
        
            <p>As the appeal enters its second day, lawyers for Gail Maney, Stephen Stone, Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen, will debate whether it will end in a retrial or an acquittal.</p>
        
            <p>The four were convicted in 1999 for the murder of Deane Fuller-Sandys.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the court heard arguments from the appellant's lawyers that the evidence against them was irrepairably contaminated, as witnesses lied repeatedly and police investigators shaped their statements.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing ended on Wednesday morning and the justices reserved their decision.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, lawyers on both sides agreed there was no remaining reliable evidence implicating Maney in the homicide.</p>
        
            <p>The only evidence linking her to the homicide of Fuller-Sandys is the witness statement of a woman, who has name suppression, and later recanted. She died last year.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Crown lawyer Mark Lillico confirmed they would not be seeking to uphold that conviction - and while there was a case against Maney for assault, "the Crown isn't going to pursue a case against her for that".</p>
