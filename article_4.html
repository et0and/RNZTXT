            <p>A dozen vehicles at a car dealership in Christchurch have been damaged by a wave of grain when a silo collapsed at a neighbouring flour mill.</p>
        
            <p>Champion Flour said it was working with local authorities to determine what caused the grain storage to cave in at its Moorhouse Avenue site in Addington on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Cullen of neighbouring Value Cars Warehouse said about 12 mostly older trade-in vehicles were damaged by the wave of grain that spilt out onto the vehicles near the row of silos.</p>
        
            <p>Cullen said Champion Flour had been in touch and had engineers assessing the site for safety before clearing the debris.</p>
