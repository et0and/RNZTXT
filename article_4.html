        <h2>Wakefield, Brightwater residents asked to cut water use to bare minimum</h2>
        <p>
The appeal is being made as overloaded pumps compromise the water supply in the small towns near Nelson.

            <p>Wakefield and Brightwater residents are being told to urgently restrict their water use - after overloaded pumps have compromised the water supply in the small towns.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the Wakefield Water Treatment Plant was shut last Monday to investigate potential contamination in one of its wells.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman District Council waters and wastes manager Mike Schruer said in order to meet demand after the closure, water in Wakefield was being supplemented by the Brightwater scheme, while in Hope it was being partially supplied by the Richmond scheme.</p>
        
            <p>But the high usage caused two of the three pumps to become severely compromised - with the supply losing around 72 cubic metres of water an hour.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, we are trying to source replacement equipment and reallocate duty pumps from the network which will potentially alleviate the issue."</p>
        
            <p>The affected area is currently under Phase D water restrictions - but residents were being asked to only use water for emergency needs - drinking, sanitation, medical, health and safety for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>Initial test results from the Wakefield Water Treatment Plant had come back clear, so Schruer said it was beginning the process of re-opening the plant and restoring the network to its original system.</p>
        
            <p>"However, the capacity issues we are facing need immediate action.</p>
        
            <p>"As we work as quickly as we can to rectify the working order of the pump, water users in Brightwater and Wakefield can help us prevent a more serious situation by restricting their water use to the bare minimum."</p>
