            <p>A significant drop in visitor numbers and hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain means Hawke's Bay's Splash Planet will close five weeks early.</p>
        
            <p>The iconic outdoor water park - which is usually open until the end of March - will instead shut its doors this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council says by the end of January, Splash Planet had seen 15,000 fewer visitors than the year before - resulting in more than $500,000 in lost revenue this season.</p>
        
            <p>Last month the council defended its $45 entry fee, saying it was in line with other adventure parks.</p>
        
            <p>It said a run of cold, wet weather was likely to blame for the low numbers, but said the cost of living could be a factor.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said closing now would limit the ratepayers' bill to make up the shortfall to $230,000.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important to make sure that we're not burdening the ratepayer. We're under huge financial pressure and with the five weekends coming up, knowing that the weather isn't going to be fantastic, we'd be best to cut our losses and finish early."</p>
        
            <p>It was a hard decision, she said, but the most pragmatic one to avoid incurring more debt.</p>
        
            <p>The council said ratepayers contributed $1.4 million a year to run the facility, with $3.3 million needed from sales through tickets and retail.</p>
        
            <p>"This year's sales had only reached $2.2m by the end of January, leaving ratepayers to pick up the extra. The team had managed to make savings of $232,000 over the season, mostly in staff costs as a result of lower visitor numbers."</p>
        
            <p>It staying open until the end of March could have seen a blowout of $320,000 or more compared to the $230,000 in extra funding needed by closing now.</p>
        
            <p>The cash to make up the deficit would be found in operational savings.</p>
        
            <p>The council said those with tickets in March would be offered a refund or the opportunity to visit this weekend.</p>
