            <p>Healthline's doctor services and specific Covid-19 helpline have come to an end.</p>
        
            <p>Both were set up by the Ministry of Health as part of the country's Covid-19 response, and run by Whakarongorau Aotearoa New Zealand Telehealth Services.</p>
        
            <p>They later came under Health NZ Te Whatu Ora upon its formation in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Funding for the services finished on 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ's Martin Hefford said the public health system was changing the way it responded to Covid-19.</p>
        
            <p>Covid would be managed as "business as usual" and treated in a similar way to other communicable diseases, like SARS, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"From 1 July, there will be no Healthline doctor support, but Healthline nurses and paramedics will continue to provide expert, trusted health advice, treatment, and information," Telehealth Services chief operating officer Brian O'Connell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Callers seeking a prescription or other doctor support, will instead be told to contact their GP, a pharmacist, or a virtual doctor service."</p>
        
            <p>Hefford said the change would allow Health NZ to refocus on other parts of the health system.</p>
        
            <p>Regular doctor's practice fees would also be reinstated for Covid-19 healthcare visits for people aged 14 and over from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>However, Covid-19 vaccines and rapid antigen tests (RATs) remained free for everyone over five years old.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone needing Covid health advice or support could call Healthline on 0800 611 116.</p>
