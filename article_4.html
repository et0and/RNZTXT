            <p>The West Coast and South Island headwaters will see "significant" rainfall this weekend, with orange heavy rain warnings in place until Saturday, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>Although much of New Zealand would experience warmer-than-usual temperatures over the coming days, a front would bring heavy rain to western and southern parts of the South Island, the forecaster said.</p>

            <p>Westland's mayor said the district was prepared should heavy rain cause disruption and flooding.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Lash said it had been raining steadily in the district on Friday, and there was already surface flooding in South Westland, with more rain forecast for the ranges overnight.</p>
        
            <p>"Regional council river management staff are already in place in all the key areas in South Westland, police are now in place in all those towns in case they are needed. We are not waiting to see if we are going to end up with a Civil Defence situation - we are getting everybody on the ground."</p>
        
            <p>Lash said organisations were keeping a close eye on the situation.</p>
        
            <p>She was aware there were a number of people visiting the region who may not be familiar with the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"People from overseas aren't used to driving in these conditions, and you can come around a bend and then you've got a foot of water in front of you, and if you are travelling at speed, you can end up off the road.</p>
        
            <p>"And we just ask as normal in these conditions that people drive with caution, and if you don't need to be out in the dark of night, on the roads if there is surface flooding, then they don't put themselves in that position."</p>
        
            <p>Police said flooding had closed a number of roads in the Haast area on Friday night. They were asking people to be extra cautious.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Emergency Management Mark Mitchell said hydrologists were keeping a close eye on the Waiho River in Franz Josef as heavy rain continued to fall.</p>
        
            <p>MetService had issued an orange rain warning for Westland, with the region forecast to get up to 400 millimetres of rain by noon Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell had travelled to the West Coast to visit Franz Josef to see how the Waiho River coped with the forecast deluge.</p>
        
            <p>He said the river was the biggest area of concern.</p>
        
            <p>It looked okay on Friday night, he said, but hydrologists were monitoring it as heavy rain was set to build.</p>
        
            <p>Mitchell said Westland residents should stay off the roads unless it was absolutely necessary to travel.</p>
        
            <p>Westland's emergency operations centre remained on standby.</p>
        
            <p>The following orange heavy rain warnings are in place:</p>
        
            <p>There is a moderate chance of upgrading to a red heavy rain warning for Westland, a low chance for Canterbury, and a minimal chance for Grey, Buller, Fiordland and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>There is a strong wind watch from midnight Friday to noon Saturday for the Canterbury high country, where northwest winds may approach severe gale in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>Northwesterlies could also become severe in Wairarapa, Wellington and Marlborough, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>It sure was a warm night across Aotearoa New Zealand, with Oamaru 20 degrees at 7am!The warm trend rolls into Saturday.https://t.co/Yjbq0jgaoz pic.twitter.com/Xx9m9UGhSD</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, warm temperatures will cover New Zealand, with fine, dry and warm conditions in the east and north, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Temperatures in some places, such as Hawke's Bay, could reach 30 degrees Celsius.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday, the North Island would be partly cloudy with isolated showers, and rain developing in the southwest later. Apart from areas affected by heavy rain warnings, the South Island would see fine spells and isolated showers.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, there would be rain in the west of the North Island, with heavy falls, and a few showers elsewhere. The South Island would see rain developing in the southwest and fine spells and isolated showers elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris said much of the country was already experiencing warm and humid conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"That is going to help to drive this very heavy rain we are going to see along the West Coast of the South Island through the rest of Friday into Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"Some parts of the Westland Ranges might see up to 400 mm of rain in around 27 hours until midday on Saturday so it is going to be quite an intense bout of rain."</p>
        
            <p>The wet weather would make its way across to the North Island on Sunday but it was not expected to be as heavy.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as the country is experiencing warmer than usual temperatures, with hot air travelling across the Tasman from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"Some areas on the east coast of both the North and South Islands are beginning to get quite dry and we've had a run of warm temperatures that do look to extend into the weekend with the strong northwesterlies, which does bring an increased fire risk so people need to be a bit more careful."</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Emergency Management manager Claire Brown said it's closely monitoring the severe weather forecast for Westland on Friday through to Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not unusual for these areas to receive these amounts of rainfall, however as always, we need to be closely monitoring and ready to activate, if need be, particularly for the Westland district."</p>
        
            <p>An agency briefing took place Friday morning to share information and planning arrangements. Community coordinators had been contacted and West Coast Emergency Management was working closely with partner agencies</p>
        
            <p>People were being warned rivers may rise quickly, surface flooding and slips are possible and driving conditions could be hazardous.</p>
        
            <p>The Milford Sound Highway has been closed as a precaution over fears warm rain and melting snow could lead to end-of-season avalanches.</p>
        
            <p>MetService and NZ Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi warned motorists around Clutha and Southland they may also strike very wet conditions on Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA system manager for the central South Island Mark Pinner said people should check its traffic pages before setting out, and be prepared to take a break if rain got hard and made visibility poor.</p>
        
            <p>Highway crews were ready for the heavy rain and watching spots like Muddy Creek in Otago, State Highway 6, where slips have caused overflowing onto the highway in the past.</p>
