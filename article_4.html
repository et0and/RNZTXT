            <p>Domestic violence is no laughing matter, but humour can help guide audiences through such otherwise unacceptable subjects, Italian comedian and writer Paola Cortellesi says.</p>
        
            <p>In her directorial debut There's Still Tomorrow, a 1940s husband and wife do jazzy dance moves to a contemporary love song as he physically attacks her.</p>
        
            <p>While it is hard to watch this "dance of the blows", Cortellesi tells Susie Ferguson, it gets to the heart of the problem of domestic abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"[The scene] depicts a kind of ritual that has been happening in this woman's life for a long time. A cycle repeating again and again ... It's something weird but all of this film is weird."</p>
        
            <p>Filmed in black-and-white, Cortellesi's movie takes audiences into Roman life in 1946 - the historic year Italian women got the vote.</p>
        
            <p>This was a time when, without financial independence, Italian women were often "prisoners" in abusive marriages, expected to sacrifice their own lives and take care of large families.</p>
        
            <p>In 1940s Italy, husbands physically abusing their wives was considered "completely and totally normal", Cortellesi says.</p>
        
            <p>Delia - the character she plays in There's Still Tomorrow - is a working-class mother-of-three who, having been taught she is worthless, sometimes justifies suffering daily violence and humiliation from her husband Ivano (Valerio Mastandrea).</p>
        
            <p>At the start of the film, Delia's only apparent desire is for her teenage daughter Marcella (Romana Maggiora Vergano) to marry a boy from a good family, Cortellesi says.</p>
        
            <p>But after she realises Marcella might be about to fall into the same cycle of male domination and abuse that she has endured, a personal revolution is ignited.</p>
        
            <p>Too often, women justify their partner's violence because they feel ashamed of speaking out, Cortellesi says.</p>
        
            <p>For her, the greatest gift of releasing There's Still Tomorrow is getting people talking about a problem that still causes a lot of suffering around the world, including here in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>At publicity screenings, people stood up and spoke about how it reflected their own suffering, having once cowered in a bedroom listening to their mother being abused, or escaped living as a 'Delia'.</p>
        
            <p>"If someone can find the courage to denounce [their abuser] or take her life into her own hands and do something, this is my greatest goal."</p>
        
            <p>Happy and proud that more than 5.5 million Italians have seen There's Still Tomorrow, Cortellesi is especially heartened that at least half of those were men.</p>
        
            <p>"This isn't a film against men - on the contrary. It's an invitation to walk together."</p>
