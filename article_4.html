        <h2>Relief over opening of $130m road in Queenstown</h2>
        <p>
Years of roadworks have frustrated residents, businesses and tourists as the alternative to the existing route in from Frankton has been built.

            <p>Queenstown's long-awaited $130 million new road into the growth-challenged tourist town centre is opening on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>But there is no funding to carry on with the original plan for two more stages to lessen regular jams in the main shopping street itself.</p>
        
            <p>Several years of roadworks have frustrated residents, businesses and tourists as the alternative to the existing route in from Frankton has been built.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been quite difficult to be honest," said Cr Gavin Bartlett, chair of the district council's infrastructure committee.</p>
        
            <p>The new arterial, on the hillside a block up from the existing route, will open in stages through the day to make sure traffic is flowing, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>It still has several more months of work to do on some side roads and stormwater, so traffic cones will remain a feature there.</p>
        
            <p>Costs more than doubled from the original $50m the Crown put in for the project. Locals have worn the extra costs.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the revamp not being a cure-all, Bartlett said residents would be relieved.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking forward to getting things a bit more complete and, you know, people can move around a bit more freely I guess than they've been able to for the last few years."</p>
        
            <p>The new road delivers growing numbers of vehicles into an unrevamped town centre.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be a similar situation to what's currently existing now, and there are times when traffic is backed up through town relatively often, and that's where I guess the benefit of what was proposed in the other two stages would come into play," Bartlett said.</p>
        
            <p>"The aim was to try to move the traffic out of the town centre."</p>
        
            <p>The arterial has been talked about since the early 2000s. While stages two and three have no funding allocated for construction, there is some funding for them in the long-term plan from 2029.</p>
        
            <p>Another growth choke point for the town is sewage disposal.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council has upped the pressure there, taking the district council to the Environment Court over breaches around disposing treated wastewater near the Shotover and Kawarau rivers.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council called this its "highest priority investigation".</p>
        
            <p>Bartlett said he hoped to hold a workshop on sewage for councillors next week, which he expected would consider a recent call for a pause on development.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Quentin Smith said a pause on housing and other developments should be considered until a "clear and workable" plan for the sewage was in place.</p>
        
            <p>The town's water treatment plant has been hit by plant failures and is undergoing an upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>But even so, this does not solve the disposal problem, after waste has been through the plant.</p>
        
            <p>The district council has set aside $77m under the long-term plan for an overall solution.</p>
        
            <p>But Smith said the problem was that would take years, and the compromises were happening now.</p>
