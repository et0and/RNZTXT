            <p>A trio facing charges related to the wrongful conviction of Alan Hall in the 1980s have entered not guilty pleas to all charges.</p>
        
            <p>Hall was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1985 for the murder of Arthur Easton, but acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2022 and paid $5 million in compensation.</p>
        
            <p>In August, assistant commissioner of investigations Paul Basham said three men had been charged.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been in contact with the Hall and Easton families through this process, and we have advised them of today's development," he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The three men were excused from appearing in Manukau District Court on Tuesday morning, on medical grounds, by Judge Ali'imuamua Sandra Alofivae.</p>
        
            <p>Their lawyers - David Jones KC, Fletcher Pilditch KC and Paul Wicks KC - all asked for interim name suppression and the trio were granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>Alofivae granted the men interim name suppression, as well as suppressing their occupations and the charges they face.</p>
        
            <p>The men will next appear in court on 29 November.</p>
