            <p>Firefighters have put out a house fire in Christchurch, which sent smoke billowing across the city.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said they received multiple calls about the blaze in St Martins, from about 11:45am on Labour Day.</p>
        
            <p>Two fire crews responded to the Wilsons Road South address, but had finished at the scene before 2pm, a FENZ spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Only one residential dwelling was involved, he said, and no one was in the building at the time.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would be back at the site tomorrow.</p>
