            <p>A man who drove erratically across Auckland this morning before crashing into another car and being arrested by armed police was wanted on more than 20 warrants.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man fled in his car from officers near Auckland Airport at 8am on Tuesday, and hit a member of the public's car near Totara Vale on the North Shore 50 minutes later before it was brought to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>Officers near Auckland Airport had identified it as a vehicle of interest, and approached it to speak with the occupants, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Waitematā East Area prevention manager Inspector Tim Williams said the car fled at high speed.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers have elected not to pursue the vehicle and a short time later Eagle has observed it travelling at speed on State Highway 20," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver has continued on through Auckland and into the North Shore, where it exited and briefly went into a nearly underground carpark where it's believed passengers were dropped off."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the car kept driving dangerously, overtaking traffic, running red lights and driving on the footpath.</p>
        
            <p>It was spiked near Totara Vale, but continued driving, and hit a member of the public's vehicle, causing minor damage.</p>
        
            <p>The tyres eventually disintegrated, and armed units, including the Delta dog team, arrested the 38-year-old driver.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to appear in North Shore District Court tomorrow on a number of charges.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said it was incredibly lucky no one was injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Other road users should not expect to have their safety put at risk like it was this morning during peak hour traffic. It's completely unacceptable."</p>
