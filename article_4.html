            <p>A Hawke's Bay man is shocked after he was trespassed from his local supermarket following raising concerns about trollies blocking the fire exit.</p>
        
            <p>Tony Hughes was visiting New World Havelock North earlier this month when he noticed the fire exit was blocked by trollies filled with reduce to clear goods and some baskets of clearance goods on the floor.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes snapped a couple pictures of the fire exit and showed it to the store manager as he finished his shopping.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report  he asked the manager if they would clear the exit and they agreed and thanked him.</p>
        
            <p>However, when Hughes next returned to the store about 10 days later he noticed the fire exit was once again blocked.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really a rinse and repeat, where I took a photo, went up to checkouts and asked to speak to a manager and again showed them a photo and asked them to sort it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last Sunday, he popped into the store to get some bread and milk. This time he didn't look at the fire exit but on his way out the store security guard stopped him and trespassed him, Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I asked why he said it was because I had taken photos around the store and that I was trespassed," Hughes said.</p>
        
            <p>He was told to contact the store owner to try to get the trespass reversed but hasn't.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that I had been punished for doing the safe thing which just absolutely flabbergasted me."</p>
        
            <p>Morning Report tried to contact the store owner but messages weren't returned.</p>
        
            <p>FoodStuffs said in a statement for security reasons its teams are alert to any unusual behaviour, including individuals photographing entry and exit points without explanation.</p>
        
            <p>"For privacy reasons we don't discuss individual customer matters but generally speaking, the decision to issue a trespass notice is made when there are genuine safety or security concerns," FoodStuffs said.</p>
        
            <p>"We encourage anyone with concerns or questions about what they see in-store to speak directly with a store manager or use the contact details provided on our in-store signage. We're always happy to listen and address any issues as quickly as possible."</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the photos were only ever shown, until after he was trespassed, to the store manager.</p>
        
            <p>"I would shop there again. It's my local supermarket, I do like the place. I just don't like how they're treating customers in terms of their health and safety," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said since sharing his story online, he has had a staff member tell him they had been complaining for months about the fire exit being blocked internally.</p>
        
            <p>"I think this was hopefully a bit of a wake up call for them."</p>
