            <p>Wellington police have brought in extra staff to deal with a spate of serious crimes in the region.</p>
        
            <p>This week alone there has been a suspected murder-suicide in Roseneath, a body found outside a property in Northland and a driver ramming several police cars, injuring five officers in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in March, police launched a homicide investigation after 63-year-old Abdul Nabizadah was found with serious head injuries on a Miramar street, and later died.</p>

            <p>Wellington police district commander Corrie Parnell said 15 more investigators had been brought in to help. There are more than 1000 officers in the district.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had an unusual spate of serious investigations in recent weeks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That said, each one of those investigations are all in their own right, there's no inter-link between those enquiries."</p>
        
            <p>The police were well equipped to deal with them, Parnell said.</p>
        
            <p>He reassured the public they were safe.</p>
        
            <p>"[The investigations] are well within hand of the Wellington policing district and we will continue to bring those to the conclusion for everyone."</p>
        
            <p>Police had received overwhelming support from the public in relation to their recent investigations, he said.</p>
