            <p>Two people have been rescued from a boat after it capsized while crossing the Manukau bar in Auckland on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public alerted the coastguard to the capsized boat just after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>The Coastguard's air patrol and a police helicopter monitored the situation from above, while Coastguard Waiuku volunteers were sent to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, a person on a jet ski managed to rescue one person.</p>
        
            <p>The Westpac Rescue Helicopter rescued the other person.</p>

            <p>Rough sea conditions made it impossible to recover the upturned vessel.</p>
        
            <p>The Coastguard applauded the skipper's actions, saying they had logged a trip report and both individuals onboard were wearing lifejackets.</p>
        
            <p>"The skipper of the capsized vessel did the right thing by logging a bar crossing trip report with our Operations Centre at 1:44 pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Per our protocols, if we hadn't heard from them by 2:14 pm, we would have initiated a search and rescue response.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily, a member of the public called us first."</p>
        
            <p>The Coastguard reminded all boaties about the importance of logging a trip report when crossing a bar, carrying two forms of waterproof communication including an EPIRB and/or a PLB, and always wearing a lifejacket.</p>
