            <p>For four years a local resident has been asking New Plymouth District Council to cut a giant pohutukawa tree branch that is blocking ambulance access to his driveway.</p>
        
            <p>Over time, one branch from a giant pohutukawa tree growing on a council berm outside 83-year-old Colin Harvey's place has grown to the point that it is blocking some access.</p>
        
            <p>That meant when Colin's wife Jill needed urgent medical attention the ambulance could not get past.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know it was a problem until I called the ambulance about four years ago and the ambulance driver came down the driveway and said, 'Oh, I can't get [the] ambulance down because the tree's in the way'," Harvey told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"So since then I've been trying ... to get something done about it."</p>
        
            <p>Harvey said his wife has needed the ambulance three times and ambulance staff have had to use their neighbour's driveway.</p>
        
            <p>He said that was unsatisfactory.</p>
        
            <p>"It's two narrow strips on concrete with grass on the sides ... sloping away. So if the ambulance came off those concrete strips down the neighbour's driveway, it would get stuck.</p>
        
            <p>"It would need a tow truck to pull it out."</p>
        
            <p>Harvey said he liked the pohutukawa tree and he did not want to see it go, just the branch that was causing problems.</p>
        
            <p>"The tree's been a good old tree over the years ... [the council] seem to think I [want] the whole tree to go.</p>
        
            <p>"But 10 to 12 branches come off this big tree and having just one branch cut off it doesn't really matter."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the struggle with council, he said he had not been tempted to give the tree a hack himself.</p>
        
            <p>He was worried about other people resorting to getting rid of the tree altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"The wife got a call this morning and said somebody would come in and poison the tree for me, well I don't want that to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's] a bit of worry [that] some nutcase will poison it."</p>
        
            <p>Harvey did get a visit from the council today, but he said at the moment he was in limbo, "nothing's happening".</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, New Plymouth District Council said it had already removed some of the tree's lower branches hanging over the driveway but that it was a notable tree protected by the district plan.</p>
        
            <p>However, after an arboriculture specialist visited the property this afternoon, the council said it would take another look to see if the large branch could be removed in a way that would not compromise the native tree.</p>
