        <h2>Father son duo makes ancient waka discovery</h2>
        <p>
Buried in the sand and floating down the river, pieces of an ancient waka have been found, but their origin and age remains a mystery.

            <p>A father and son have made the discovery of a lifetime - an ocean-voyaging waka on Rēkohu/Chatham Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The significant archaeological find included 450 pieces, some with unique carvings and braided rope which suggests the waka could be very old.</p>
        
            <p>The specific origin and age remain a mystery, with local iwi and Moriori offering different theories on its history.</p>
        
            <p>Vincent Dix, father of Nikau Dix, said they did know that three bits of timber tested were all from New Zealand trees.</p>
        
            <p>He said they made the finding at the nearby river, accessed through their farm.</p>
        
            <p>"My son and I were just loading the boat up and taking the dogs for a run up the beach, and just after a big rain, and yeah, that's when Nikau my son saw the bits of timber washing down the river."</p>

There have now been 450 pieces collected.

            <p>Dix said the timber looked really well persevered.</p>
        
            <p>"It had strange holes and notching and things in them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we gathered, I don't know, four or five pieces that day, and we went back after the storm and the rain and we found a few more bits and Nikau found this craved piece, we'd call it a head piece but it could be anything - we knew then it was a significant find."</p>
        
            <p>"We are up to about 450 pieces... and there's so much more down there but, you know, we just haven't got the time now to carry on digging so the sites all been closed up and, you know, secured as best as we can."</p>
        
            <p>
Some pieces of the waka have recovered from the site, with larger pieces expected to be uncovered.

            <p>Dix said Archaeologist Justin Maxwell, who is leading the project, had his theories and hunches but wanted science to tell the story.</p>
        
            <p>"We do know that we have three bits of timber tested and they were all New Zealand trees.</p>
        
            <p>"That's about as much as we know so far."</p>
        
            <p>He said at there were bits of timber being sent off to be dated.</p>
        
            <p>When asked how Chatham Islands locals were finding it, Dix said they were loving it.</p>

Three of the pieces are from New Zealand trees.

            <p>"People are absolutely enjoying it and loving it, you know, it's sort of been a great project to be honest.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got so many volunteers and people willing to help out, it's been fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>But it's pretty much all over to experts now, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The only access to the waka is through our farm so, you know, we'll always been involved in it and sort of, you know, we want to make sure it stays on the Island and you know, we're quite interested in making sure that's a community project and it stays that way".</p>
