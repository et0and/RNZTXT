            <p>A new initiative is aiming to break down barriers holding Northlanders back from signing up for a career with the police.</p>
        
            <p>The plan does not include doughnuts, but it does involve a lot of coffee.</p>
        
            <p>For the past three days police have been basing themselves in cafés around the Far North as part of their novel recruitment drive.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Roger Dephoff said he had so far brought his caffeine-fuelled mission to Breaking Bread café in Kaikohe, Mussel Rock in Kaitāia, and Sharp Café in Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about supporting new recruits, and people looking at joining, to just let go of their apprehensions and give it a go. It's letting them realise they have the potential and to not let anything hold them back.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of guys are a bit whakamā [shy] about joining. They think probably they're not fit enough, they're not academically ready, but they'll surprise themselves."</p>
        
            <p>Dephoff said the café setting helped put people at ease.</p>
        
            <p>"We're human, we come with the same stories they do, so if they can relax enough to come and talk to us, that's great."</p>
        
            <p>Dephoff, who was based in Kawakawa, said he first tried to join the police when he was 19.</p>
        
            <p>However, self-doubt set in and he did not finish the application process, only trying again in his 30s.</p>
        
            <p>He wished he could have called into a cop café for advice or reassurance when he was younger.</p>
        
            <p>"I got quite a way through the recruiting process but as a 19-year-old I still had doubts of myself.</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have an initiative like this, so there was nothing to reassure me that I was doing all right.</p>
        
            <p>"If I'd been put at ease, or just made to feel a bit more comfortable, I probably would've continued my journey at 19. I wouldn't have waited until I was 33 to actually push the button."</p>

            <p>Among those keen to find out about signing up was Max from Waipapa.</p>
        
            <p>Aged 19, he was the same age as Dephoff when he first wanted to join.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to wake up in the morning and feel like I can make a difference … to come home from a long day and have done some good, rather than having the next day be the same as the last," Max said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, John, originally from the Shetland Islands but now living in the "paradise" of Kāeo, was chasing a lifelong dream of joining the thin blue line.</p>
        
            <p>He had been a part-time police constable in Scotland and had volunteered as a firefighter for many years in New Zealand and the UK.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something I've always fancied doing. I've tried it a couple of times and not made the grade each time so I thought, well, I'll give it another go."</p>
        
            <p>Police recruitment specialist Nyree Hobson said she had been pleased by Northlanders' genuine interest.</p>
        
            <p>Many people thought about signing up but did not take it any further, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've found that when you are face to face with people they tend to open up a bit more … We've had quite a few who have applied before.</p>
        
            <p>"They they just want to discuss how we can help prepare them a bit more to get through the process."</p>
        
            <p>There was just one downside of the cop café initiative, and that was the sheer amount of caffeine Dephoff had ingested during the week.</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ caught up with him in Kerikeri he had switched from his usual flat white to something that looked suspiciously like it had chocolate sprinkles on top.</p>
        
            <p>"It's actually a cappuccino. I'm going to lie and say in the last three days I've averaged three coffees a day. I'm jacked up on caffeine quite a bit."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who missed out on a free coffee but is keen to find out more about joining the force can head to newcops.govt.nz.</p>
