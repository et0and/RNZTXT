            <p>Police in Papakura have helped reunite a rider with his beloved scooter, 10 years after it was originally stolen.</p>
        
            <p>Counties Manukau response manager Senior Sergeant Clive Wood said officers had located a young person riding a scooter, which had been reported stolen from a property in Whangārei a decade earlier.</p>
        
            <p>He explained he had just recently bought it from Facebook Marketplace, Senior Sergeant Clive Wood said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were quite upset after learning the scooter was stolen, so police assisted in tracking down the seller and negotiating regarding the money."</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully, the money was reimbursed."</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Clive Wood said the registered owner had parked the scooter behind his friend's house in Whangārei and had forgotten about it.</p>
        
            <p>By the time he realised it was stolen, it was too late.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff contacted the owner after locating the scooter, which came as a huge surprise to him given the length of time.</p>
        
            <p>"When he picked it up from Papakura Police Station he was extremely grateful, and we were stoked to be able to return it to its rightful owner."</p>
