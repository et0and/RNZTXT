            <p>A resident in Auckland's Mount Albert describes waking up on Friday morning to the sound of popping, as the house next door went up in flames.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Saint Lukes Road about 7.10am to a well-involved house fire.</p>
        
            <p>No injuries were reported.</p>
        
            <p>The fire closed multiple roads around the area, detouring buses and motorists.</p>

            <p>A man in the neighbouring property told RNZ emergency services responded quickly to the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>"We were woken up in the morning to the sound of popping noises, we poked our heads out the window and saw the house at the back was alight so we rushed around at that point," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"My wife called emergency services, and then they were here in under two minutes, very quick."</p>
        
            <p>His property was undamaged, but the smell of smoke was strong.</p>

            <p>The man said he and his wife were in a rush to get out of the house, and to alert other neighbours to the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty shocking," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We knocked on their door just to tell them about what was happening as well.</p>
        
            <p>"There were bystanders coming by, knocking on doors as well, so people had come in to help pretty quick, and then the fire brigade arrived shortly after."</p>
        
            <p>The westbound lane of the Saint Lukes Road reopened about 9am, along with Taylors Road and Albertson Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked motorists for their patience.</p>
