            <p>A drink driver who blew nearly 10 times the legal breath alcohol limit was caught in Cromwell during an "alarming" weekend on Otago roads for police.</p>
        
            <p>The 45-year-old man was found uninjured after a single-vehicle crash on the Clyde-Alexandra Road on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in the Alexandra District Court charged with dangerous driving and excess breath alcohol third and subsequent.</p>
        
            <p>A police operation over the weekend targeting high-risk driving issued more than 50 speeding tickets in coastal Otago, including to five drivers who clocked more than 40km above the speed limit.</p>
        
            <p>Officers also pulled over seven drivers who blew above the legal breath-alcohol limit.</p>
        
            <p>Two drivers who blew nearly triple the legal limit had been summonsed to appear in the Dunedin District Court, and the other five received infringements.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Karl Hemmingsen said it was shocking and dangerous behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"Drink driving and speeding are dangerous actions that can have disastrous consequences. We see too many preventable deaths on our roads," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want everyone to have a good time, but not at the expense of putting yourselves or others at risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Have a pre-plan to get home safely, have a charged phone, so you can book an Uber, taxi or call a friend to come and get you, ensure you have cash for if your phone dies and you need to book a taxi.</p>
        
            <p>"Our aim is to prevent tragic consequences on our roads, not to issue the most infringements."</p>
        
            <p>He urged motorists to drive to the conditions and remember the speed limit was a limit, not a target, especially in winter conditions.</p>
