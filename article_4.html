            <p>Police have crushed six gold-plated motorbikes seized from the Comancheros gang.</p>
        
            <p>The Harley-Davidsons were seized during Operation Nova, a major organised crime operation, in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Police then sought a court order to crush the bikes and sell the remains under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act.</p>
        
            <p>They were also granted permission to destroy seven personalised plates.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first application of its kind, Commissioner Andrew Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>In other cases, the police financial crime group would ask a court for assets to be forfeited. Those assets would then be sold on with proceeds going to the consolidated crime fund.</p>
        
            <p>However, the fact the motorbikes and plates were so distinctive meant police took a different approach, Coster said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is our view that the design of the motorcycles, and the personalised plates, are very distinctive and are exclusively linked to the Comancheros.</p>
        
            <p>"It is highly likely both the bikes and licence plates would end up back in the hands of the Comancheros.</p>
        
            <p>"It would defeat the purpose of the action police have taken in this investigation."</p>

            <p>The bikes, valued at $96,000, were destroyed on Friday along with the plates.</p>
        
            <p>Coster said the proceeds from any scrap metal sales would go to the consolidated fund.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be of some reassurance to police and the public that this decision means these bikes, purchased with the proceeds of crime, will not end up back in the wrong hands."</p>
        
            <p>Aside from the motorbikes, police restrained more than $2.6 million in assets during Operation Nova.</p>
        
            <p>That included more than $400,000 in cash, four Range Rovers, a Rolls-Royce, a Mercedes-Benz, an Audi, designer products and jewellery.</p>
        
            <p>Eighteen people were charged with a range of offences, including importing methamphetamine, money laundering, unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, and participating in an organised crime group.</p>
        
            <p>In February, a former Comancheros secretary convicted as part of the operation was deported back to Australia.</p>
