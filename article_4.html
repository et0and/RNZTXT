            <p>One person is dead and another in hospital following a "disorder incident" in Auckland's Mt Albert on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to He Ana Way around 1.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Upon arrival, two people were located with injuries ranging from serious to critical," Detective Senior Sergeant Lisa Anderson said. "Sadly, despite efforts from emergency services, a male died at the scene."</p>
        
            <p>The second person was taken to hospital with serious, but not life-threatening injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will have a visible presence in Mt Albert this afternoon, and likely tomorrow, as our investigation progresses," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"While at this stage, no arrests have been made, we do not believe there is a wider risk to the public in relation to this incident. It is understood those involved were known to each other."</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter said the police appeared to be focusing on an alley behind a KƒÅinga Ora development.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be speaking to those in the area who witnessed what has occurred and we encourage anyone else with information that may assist to please contact police as soon as possible," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Mount Albert MP Helen White said what happened was shocking and upsetting.</p>
        
            <p>White said had been speaking with police, and had been told it was a family harm incident and there was no danger to the public.</p>
        
            <p>Residents said they were feeling unsettled after the day's 'tragic' altercation, but still felt safe despite the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>One woman, who wanted to be remain anonymous, lived at her property adjacent to the Kainga Ora housing development.</p>
        
            <p>She was home at about 1pm when the violence broke out, and she could hear parts of the altercation.</p>
        
            <p>"I was working away at my house and I hear a very loud crash," she said, "which sounded like a large piece of glass breaking, certainly larger than a drinking glass, and later on I heard one [angry] woman and maybe two."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was not something uncommon to come from the housing development, and she often heard yelling loud and clear from her backyard.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't surprise me because we often do hear altercations going on from down back there," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's one person we've heard more than other people who is very unpleasant, swears loudly and it just sounds very violent, it's quite unsettling."</p>
        
            <p>Having lived in the neighbourhood for 37 years, she said it had become an "unpleasant atmosphere," but admitted it was still relatively safe.</p>
        
            <p>"You're more likely to lock the door than I used to be, absolutely," she said, "I think that I understand that the people who live down their have their own problems and its with each other and I don't really feel like they're out to get us."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident, Mike, said it was an upsetting thing to happen in the community...</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly sad anytime somebody dies in circumstances as they appear to be there," Mike said.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the violence wouldn't tarnish the reputation of the social housing.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't necessarily feel unsafe or anything along those lines," he said, "it makes me a bit sad because its obviously mixed housing in there and with that may come a bunch of prejudice against having Kainga Ora housing nearby.</p>
        
            <p>"People will, in some circles, turn to that and be critical of it. I think that's a shame because I think that it's an outlier example and you can find these things happen anywhere in the city."</p>
        
            <p>Police have been asked if the person who died and the person hospitalised were residents of the Kainga Ora development.</p>
