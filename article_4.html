            <p>The Department of Conservation is going ahead with cuts to its Chatham Islands team.</p>
        
            <p>In May, it announced a proposal to halve the number of permanent, full-time staff on the islands to five, and merge the Chathams team with the Wairarapa district.</p>
        
            <p>Following staff consultation, DOC has now confirmed the merger but said the number of staff based there year-round will be reduced from 11 to seven, instead of five.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said the changes were to improve staff wellbeing on the Chathams and were not being driven by cost savings.</p>
        
            <p>It believed the change would strengthen its partnerships with imi, iwi and other stakeholders and improve the way it worked alongside the community.</p>
        
            <p>It said there were plans to also improve conservation and biodiversity operations on the islands, and bolster staff over the busy summer period.</p>
        
            <p>"This larger team of highly skilled and motivated workers on island over summer will be able to provide the best conservation outcomes we can for this unique environment, for the same level of financial investment," DOC said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Around 20 contractors, volunteers and seconded staff would be based in the Chathams over summer.</p>
