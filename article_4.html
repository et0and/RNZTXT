            <p>Former National Party minister and America's Cup campaign director Anthony "Aussie" Malcolm was the subject of multiple complaints of historical child sexual abuse and was under police investigation at the time of his death, Stuff can reveal.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm, 83, died recently in Whangārei following a short illness, his family said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a really big personality, and he impacted positively hundreds of lives through immigration, through his work with refugees, there will be a lot of people whose lives he will have touched and you know, we're all going to miss him," one of his daughters said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"The tōtara has fallen."</p>
        
            <p>But Stuff can reveal Malcolm was the subject of multiple complaints of historical child sexual abuse, which police were investigating at the time of his death.</p>
        
            <p>It's understood the investigation was launched as a result of matters raised during the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care.</p>
        
            <p>The allegations against Malcolm are thought to date back as far as the 1980s. The complainants were boys aged under 16 at the time.</p>
        
            <p>In response to a series of questions about the investigation on Friday, police said as a result of the Royal Commission of Inquiry recommendations they were considering how to manage and investigate new historical complaints of abuse in care.</p>
        
            <p>"Police will not be speaking about individuals or their cases, and survivors need to be assured we will treat each investigation confidentially and with the care and attention it deserves," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The National Party said it was unaware of any allegations against Malcolm.</p>
        
            <p>A member of Malcolm's family declined to comment.</p>
        
            <p>Private investigator Clinton Bowerman said he was an advocate for several people who'd made complaints to police about Malcolm, and had supported them through the Royal Commission of Inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were "somewhat overwhelmed" by the news of his death.</p>
        
            <p>"We confirm the situation is developing and people may come forward publicly in the near future with more information," Bowerman told Stuff on Friday</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm served in the Muldoon Government, working as a Cabinet minister with varied portfolios - including railways, health and immigration.</p>
        
            <p>He had come to Parliament after training as a social worker and then ran an advertising company.</p>
        
            <p>Post-Parliament, he turned his passion for yachting into a fourth career, managing New Zealand's first challenge for the America's Cup.</p>
        
            <p>Born in Australia, Malcolm moved to New Zealand as a child and attended Wellington College where his classmates nicknamed him "Aussie". The name stuck with him his whole life.</p>
        
            <p>In 1975, Malcolm defeated Labour's Mike Moore to win the Eden electorate for the National Party, a seat he would hold for three terms.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, National Party president Sylvia Wood said Malcolm had shown huge commitment to Aotearoa. As associate transport minister, he was responsible for creating the electrified rail system which still operates in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"It is always challenging for the families of politicians but the legacy Aussie has left on our Party and New Zealand is a testament to the sacrifices they, and Aussie made," she said.</p>
        
            <p>His political career came to an end in 1984, when Labour reclaimed the seat in a landslide election.</p>
        
            <p>His work as a director of New Zealand's first America's Cup campaign saw the team secure the largest sporting sponsorship of the time, bringing in millions to fund the team.</p>
        
            <p>Although Sir Michael Fay later took over management of the Kiwi campaign, Malcolm was instrumental in assembling a team of yacht designers that included Bruce Farr, Ron Holland and Laurie Davidson to create the world's first fibreglass 12-metre yacht.</p>
        
            <p>Team New Zealand went on to place second in the 1987 Louis Vuitton challenger series.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm remained involved in yachting, and was a member of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron for more than 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>He also went on to pursue a diverse range of business ventures.</p>
        
            <p>He founded the immigration consultancy Malcolm Pacific, and co-founded the country's biggest diving company, in Northland, Dive! Tutukaka. The dive company became a key asset for Northland's growing tourism industry.</p>
        
            <p>His business interests extended across manufacturing, medical insurance, aquaculture and yacht building.</p>
        
            <p>Malcolm is survived by three daughters, a son and six grandchildren.</p>
        
            <p>His wife, former Auckland City Councillor and interior designer Astrid Malcolm, died in 2000, aged 58.</p>
