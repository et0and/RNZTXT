        <h2>Arsenic in Ohinemuri River remains greatest health risk</h2>

The river turned orange with contamination from a historic mine last week.

            <p>Arsenic continues to be the most problematic element in the Ohinemuri River.</p>
        
            <p>The river turned orange with contamination from a historic mine on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Regional Council said it had tested for all 30 heavy metals, and results showed no cyanide or mercury contaminates. However, there were minor detections of antimony and thallium, and copper and zinc at elevated levels.</p>
        
            <p>Regional compliance manager Patrick Lynch said the arsenic levels, while still elevated, had dropped significantly compared to the levels detected in samples taken on 23 August when the orange bloom appeared.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was still sediment built up at the mine entrance, and a lot of sediment had accumulated in the stream below the entrance which flows directly into the Ohinemuri River.</p>
        
            <p>This means more orange plumes can be expected during rain events, although it is unlikely the plumes will be of the scale seen last week.</p>
        
            <p>Lynch said that if people see orange water and sediment, they should assume it is contaminated and not touch it.</p>
        
            <p>"Clear water is good - the monitoring shows the levels of arsenic in the clear running water is well within drinking water and ecological protection guidelines for fresh water," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Senior scientist (Environmental Chemistry) Jonathan Caldwell said the greatest health risk regarding the elevated arsenic levels in the sediment was from ingestion (eating or drinking it). However, due to the high iron content of the sediment, the arsenic will be well bound up and is more likely to be excreted than taken up by the body.</p>
        
            <p>"Arsenic can make its way into the food chain via uptake by fish and shellfish, but it typically converts into a less toxic form," Caldwell said.</p>
        
            <p>Arsenic is typically not absorbed very well through the skin.</p>
        
            <p>"This route of exposure to arsenic would increase if you had broken skin or an open wound," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Antimony and thallium are typically associated with gold mining. Copper and zinc were at levels similar to what could be seen in urban storm water.</p>
        
            <p>The sediment involved comes from a mine entrance associated with the Comstock Low Level Drive, an exploratory mine started in 1896 and which never proved profitable. Mining at the drive site stopped in the early 1900s.</p>
