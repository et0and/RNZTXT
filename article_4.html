            <p>Police say thieves put people's lives at risk by taking critical medical supplies from a rescue helicopter in Otago.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenstown rescue helicopter was burgled at the Taieri Airfield over the weekend after taking a critically ill patient to Dunedin Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The helicopter's medical supply stores were raided and a bag containing drugs and other items was taken.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters Otago chief executive Graeme Gale said bad weather prevented the crew from flying back so they were forced to hold over in base.</p>
        
            <p>"If the helicopter and crew had responded to an incident unaware that the bag had been taken, there could have been fatal consequences," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>This afternoon he told RNZ: "I'm furious and steaming mad about some low life that came onto the airfield, then also enter into an aircraft - both of those are CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] offences for a start - and then remove a very critical component to the rescue service that we use on every critical mission that we go on."</p>
        
            <p>Acting area investigations manager Detective Sergeant Hayden Smale said an investigation was underway and anyone with information should contact police.</p>
        
            <p>"Beyond putting the lives of air ambulance patients at risk by taking these essential medical supplies, some of the drugs stolen pose a significant risk to anyone who may choose to take them recreationally," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The wrong combination or dosage could potentially be fatal, and we urge extreme caution for anyone who may come into contact with these stolen medical supplies."</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone who might have information about the burglary, or those involved.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information can get in touch via the police's 105 service, quoting reference number 250112/9460.</p>
        
            <p>Information can also be anonymously through Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
