        <h2>Wellington woman gets home detention for ex's manslaughter</h2>
        <p>
The couple's 20-year relationship was "violent and angry", with police attending more than 50 callouts to their home over the years, the judge said.

            <p>Wellington woman Donna Henry has been sentenced to a year's home detention in the High Court in Wellington after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of her former partner.</p>
        
            <p>The man, whose name is suppressed, was fatally stabbed at a home in the Upper Hutt suburb of Brown Owl in September last year.</p>
        
            <p>Judge David Boldt said police had attended more than 50 family violence callouts to the couple's home - identifying Henry as the victim in more than 30 of those instances.</p>
        
            <p>He described the pair's nearly 20-year relationship as "violent and angry" at times, and said the victim had struck Henry "two or three times" as they fought on the day he died - but in that instance Henry had not called police.</p>
        
            <p>"Unlike the dozens of other times when arguments between you two had become violent [this time] you went to the kitchen and got a knife. When you couldn't find one in the drawer, you didn't pause, you went to the knife block," Judge Boldt said. "Arming yourself escalated the things to a new level with terrible consequences."</p>
        
            <p>Boldt said Henry stabbed the man once in the chest and called her sister to tell here what she had done before calling 111.</p>
        
            <p>Ambulance crews were unable to prevent the man from dying at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The victim's family fought back tears as they read impact statements on Friday, remembering him as a true bushman and a role model.</p>
        
            <p>His mother spoke of receiving "the worst call one could ever get" when her grandson called her to tell her his father had been stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>"No parent should have to bury their children," she said. "We're all so heartbroken. A year on and I still sit and cry for him thinking about the what if."</p>
        
            <p>She addressed Henry directly during her statement.</p>
        
            <p>"How could you do this to his family? I do not understand why you didn't call the police like every other time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The man's daughter said she was haunted by the "unbearable pain and trauma" inflicted by her father's death.</p>
        
            <p>"You shattered my entire world. I lost my sense of trust. Now who do I ring when I'm down and out? I will miss his smile, infectious laugh and unwavering support.".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Boldt cited Henry's remorse and the need to not inflict further harm on the couple's "already traumatised" children in converting a two-year prison sentence to home detention.</p>
        
            <p>Henry was not to contact the victim's family - excluding the couple's immediate children - and attend drug and alcohol counselling as a condition of her home detention.</p>
        
            <p>Henry hugged her counsel, lawyer Lucie Scott and supporters in the courtroom after the verdict was delivered.</p>
        
            <p>The victim and the children had permanent name suppression.</p>
