            <p>A palliative care nurse with Access Home Health says she was very reluctant to leave her dying patients and go on strike on Monday, but felt she had no choice.</p>
        
            <p>About 150 New Zealand Nurses Organisation workers employed by Access Home Health were on strike Monday from 8am to 5pm seeking pay parity with Te Whatu Ora nurses.</p>
        
            <p>NZNO delegate Linda Ewbank said the nurses, who visit and support patients at home, have been in protracted bargaining with Access for more than a year without any inroads, and they have now had enough.</p>
        
            <p>"Members are fed-up. The decision to strike was made because we have reached our wits' end. For a year we have been patient. Every day our nurses go the extra mile for the people we care for. Now we have no other choice but to put our family's needs first. This strike is really about the workers getting paid a fair wage. Quite frankly we're asking for a cost-of-living increase, but their offer is not even close to that."</p>

            <p>On a cold and rainy day in Christchurch around 30 nurses and supporters held a protest on Lunns Road in Middleton.</p>
        
            <p>One of those was nurse and union delegate Anna Anderson-Davy, who works with palliative patients in their homes.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a very difficult decision to go on strike.</p>
        
            <p>"I very much am grieving today for the fact that I am not there for my patients who are very unwell, so for me personally it has been a really big deal to strike. But also I wouldn't not be here because I think it's important and we just want Access to listen to us, and to come up with an offer of a pay increase."</p>
        
            <p>She said she did think Access valued them as nurses, but was not willing to put its hand in its pocket to cover a pay increase.</p>
        
            <p>Sarah Crook is a district nurse with Access Home Health, and a union delegate. She said her role covers things like helping people with wound care, catheters and medication in their homes.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were quite a bit behind the nurses who work for Te Whatu Ora in pay rates, and want parity.</p>
        
            <p>"A nurse is a nurse, and we should be of equal value."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on its website Access says it fully supports its nurses action to seek pay parity with Te Whatu Ora nurses.</p>
        
            <p>It said the industrial action would not affect services delivered by its support workers in people's homes and communities, and the care delivered by support workers will be delivered as normal.</p>
