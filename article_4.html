            <p>They said Brayden was the cherished son of Scott Allen and Erin Ellis, was deeply loved by stepdad Zane Ellis and stepmum Jocelyne Allen, and had an "extraordinary" bond with his younger brother Ajani.</p>
        
            <p>"He was the most fun-loving, out-of-this-world character who truly lived life to the fullest, and his loss is incomprehensible to us all. The love between a parent and a child is beyond measure, and Brayden filled his parents' lives with joy, laughter, and endless love."</p>

            <p>"We will hold on to his memory, his love, and his adventurous spirit forever."</p>
        
            <p>The family requested that in lieu of flowers, donations could be made to the Nelson/Marlborough Rescue Helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Later on Tuesday police named 19-year-old Jamie Marama Cunningham of Picton as also having died in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Police said inquires into the circumstances of the crash were ongoing.</p>
