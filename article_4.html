            <p>A judge has told a man accused of stealing critical medical supplies from an Otago rescue helicopter that he was "talking nonsense" in court.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old, who had interim name suppression, appeared via video link at the Dunedin District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>At his last court appearance, the man made a sovereign citizen speech after sacking his lawyer and opting to represent himself.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday he pointed at the camera and asked "Who is that person talking to?", to which Judge Deidre Orchard replied "you".</p>
        
            <p>The man then repeatedly asked if there was anyone by the name of "you" in court, before the Judge put the man on mute, saying he was talking nonsense.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared to continue speaking even though he could not be heard in court.</p>
        
            <p>The Judge told the man he was "very silly" not to have legal representation, because he was not going to be able to defend himself effectively.</p>
        
            <p>She noted that he had called himself a sovereign citizen, warning that route went "nowhere further than a brick wall" in court.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents showed the man was accused of burglary at the Taieri Airport yard, Cash Converters, Dunedin's Torpedo 7, Off The Chain, 2 Degrees, and another Dunedin address between 1 January and 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>He was accused of stealing items worth $809 from Rebel Sports Dunedin, taking a Queenstown Cleaners Ltd van, and taking a painting and decorator's van two days later.</p>
        
            <p>The man was also alleged to have taken a cleaning company's van on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>He was accused of resisting police and failing to supply identifying details on the day of his arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The man was remanded in custody until his next court appearance in April.</p>
