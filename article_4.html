            <p>An e-scooter caused a fire in an Auckland CBD apartment on Thursday morning, Fire and Emergency says.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were called to the building at the corner of Cook and Nelson streets about 5.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters rescued two people who were asleep in an apartment where the e-scooter had caught fire, Assistant fire commander Barry Thomas said.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 300 residents were evacuated, he said.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency said the fire was in an apartment on the 9th floor.</p>
        
            <p>Investigators would look into whether the e-scooter was charging or had been damaged in some way, Thomas told Morning Report.</p>

            <p>Though there was a lot of smoke, the fire itself didn't go beyond the apartment, and was mostly extinguised by the sprinkler system, he said. The bedroom containing the e-scooter had the most damage.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas said one of the people rescued from the apartment was assessed by St John ambulance and the other declined treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Five fire trucks were at the building before 6am when smoke could be seen coming out of the top of the apartment block and from a vent on the roadside.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't like having to evacuate people from a large block at that time of the morning but it really was necessary at this time," Thomas said.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuated residents have been allowed to return to their homes.</p>
