            <p>A leak has caused a partial ceiling collapse in Dunedin Hospital where sterilisation equipment is stored.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said it was caused by an issue with fitting in a water pipeline in the above floor. This pipeline carries water to the steriliser units.</p>
        
            <p>Diversions were put in place within the hospital, and the leak repair was completed on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after the government announced in September there would have to be changes to the planned redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital because it couldn't be delivered within the current budget of just under $1.9 billion and the cost could possibly blow out to $3b.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ Te Waipounamu Regional Head of Infrastructure Dr Rob Ojala said Te Whatu Ora worked with its clinical and operational teams to ensure the disruption was minimised.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this situation may be upsetting for some patients and staff and we apologise for any disruption caused.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge Dunedin Hospital is an ageing facility and with that comes challenges with infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand has been instructed by ministers to develop options that will deliver modern, fit-for-purpose health facilities to enhance clinical safety and enable new models of care, and that can be achieved within the budget outlined.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working urgently to present initial options analysis and advice for ministers to consider as soon as possible." Dr Ojala said.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said funding was allocated to the sterilisation area months ago, as he was aware of the repairs that were needed.</p>
        
            <p>"In that area, we actually applied funds several months ago to the sterilisation area, because we are aware that it had deficits, so we already tackled that months ago and that's in progress, and approved by the Commissioner." Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he remains committed to building Dunedin Hospital within the $1.9b budget.</p>
