            <p>Allegations of physical assault and coercion have emerged from the set of Taika Waititi's Apple+ series Time Bandits.</p>
        
            <p>Charlyne Yi, who plays Judy on the show, has alleged on Instagam they were "physically assaulted multiple times by an actor, as well as psychologically abused".</p>
        
            <p>Yi also claimed they were gaslit by coworkers, producers and HR, and "coerced to quit" the project, which was filmed in New Zealand in 2022 and 2023.</p>

            <p>In a second Instagram post on 15 May, Yi laid out their claims, not naming anyone in particular.</p>
        
            <p>"My abuser pressed his body on me from behind, to the point I had to dig my feet into the ground to keep my stance during rehearsals and filming. I tried to shove him off. And he pushed down harder, and harder, till I felt my lower back compress, sending sharp pains through my whole body."</p>
        
            <p>Yi claimed the actor later "pressed his body on me again knowing of my injury, and changed blocking during filming even though it would ruin continuity".</p>
        
            <p>Time Bandits is based on the 1981 film of the same name. The series is produced by Paramount Television Studios, with Jermaine Clement serving as an executive producer.</p>
        
            <p>Paramount has issued a statement in light of the allegations, noting: "The safety of our cast and crew is very important to us, and we take all concerns that are raised to us very seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"At the time of the complaint, Paramount Television Studios conducted a full investigation regarding allegations that were brought to our attention. While all investigations are confidential and we cannot comment on specifics, additional steps were taken to address concerns.</p>
