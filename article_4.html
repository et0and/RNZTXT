            <p>A bystander said they had been upstairs completing renovations when they heard the commotion at about 1.45pm on Brandon Street.</p>
        
            <p>They said the driver - an older woman - was shaken, but appeared uninjured.</p>
        
            <p>The shop was empty at the time, and was not in use.</p>
        
            <p>The place is being cleaned up and secured until repairs can be done.</p>
