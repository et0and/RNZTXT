            <p>The Defence Force says nearly 100 personnel will be involved in specialised training in Europe by the middle of the year, under the government's extension of support to Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>It has now been two years since the conflict began.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has provided regular intelligence, logistics and personnel to the United Kingdom and Europe.</p>
        
            <p>Specialist teams have been helping to coordinate donated military aid and contributing to infantry training for recruits to the organisation Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
        
            <p>Land Component Commander Brigadier Matt Weston said volunteer Ukrainians arrived with little to no military experience and after five weeks of training, left as soldiers.</p>
        
            <p>Weston said Defence Force personnel were pleased to contribute their skills.</p>
        
            <p>"As our personnel help prepare Ukrainians for the realities they will face in war, they are also increasing their connections with partner nations and growing their professional skills to best support those they are working with and alongside."</p>
        
            <p>As well as extending its support on Thursday, the New Zealand government was also providing additional funding.</p>
        
            <p>The extension will have up to 97 Defence Force personnel conduct specialised training in Europe from July this year in combat casualty care, combat engineering, leadership, and maritime explosive ordnance disposal training.</p>
        
            <p>Personnel have trained more than 2700 recruits for the Armed Forces of Ukraine infantry since contributions to the UK-based programme began in June 2022.</p>
        
            <p>An artillery training team was the first on the ground, followed by training groups for infantry.</p>
