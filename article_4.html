            <p>Covid-19 rapid antigen tests (RATs) will be available free until at least the end of June.</p>
        
            <p>The current national supply of RATs was due to run out in February, with a question mark over whether the government would pay for more.</p>
        
            <p>But Health Minister Shane Reti on Wednesday said Te Whatu Ora/Health NZ would purchase 5 million more to distribute for free.</p>
        
            <p>"These free RATs will be available through the established national network of distribution providers, comprising of health providers and some pharmacies."</p>
        
            <p>He would take advice from officials about whether the RATs would be funded after that, noting that many other countries no longer had widespread free Covid-19 testing.</p>

            <p>"This approach will ensure New Zealand continues to have good stocks of tests available as we enter winter," Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>The extra tests will paid for out of existing budgets for Covid-19 services. So far during the pandemic, 125 million RATs have been distributed for free across Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"No decisions have been made regarding the supply of RATs beyond June 2024," Nick Chamberlain, head of the National Public Health Service, said.</p>
        
            <p>"We strongly encourage people to make the most of the continued free access, and to keep testing if they feel unwell or think they may have Covid-19. We also encourage them to report their RAT result, as confirmation of a positive result enables people to be connected with any help and support they might need and provides vital insight on the number of active Covid-19 cases across the country."</p>
        
            <p>After rising post-Christmas, the daily number of infections in New Zealand has begun trending downwards.</p>
