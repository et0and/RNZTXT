            <p>A man shot dead in front of his kids was not present at a gang-related brawl believed to have led to his killing, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Hori Gage, 27, was killed in a car outside an address on Croyden Ave, Palmerston North, on 6 August.</p>
        
            <p>A Friday night Black Power versus Mongrel Mob gang fight two days earlier outside Castle 789 pub saw a Black Power president suffer non-fatal stab wounds.</p>
        
            <p>Gage, a member of the Mongrel Mob, was "preparing for a day out with his family and kids" when he was killed in retaliation, police said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigations have revealed Hori Gage was not involved in the Friday night altercation - rather he is believed to have been targeted due to his involvement with a rival gang," Detective Sergeant Dave Wilson said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported the gang fight was Mongrel Mob retaliation for the killing of a member earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they believed "a number of people" were behind the murder, and have "received several valuable pieces of information from 105, Crime Stoppers, and direct reports, some of which include CCTV footage of the vehicles of interest previously shared and sightings of the vehicles on the day of the murder".</p>
        
            <p>A gold Nissan Teana was seized in Auckland. Police believe this vehicle carried people "involved in the aftermath following the Friday night incident".</p>
        
            <p>They were also seeking more information and sightings of the Teana, registration number GSA66, that weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Last week they said a silver SsangYong Rexton and a silver Subaru Legacy station wagon were used in the aftermath of the murder.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 105 or online using 'update report' referencing file number: 230806/2952.</p>
