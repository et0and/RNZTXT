            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation after a woman died following an alleged assault in the Waikato town of Ngāruawāhia this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to a fight involving several people on Waipa Esplanade near the intersection with Newton Street about 1.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometime later, a critically injured woman was taken to the ambulance station on Jordan Street," Police Detective Senior Sergeant Nigel Keall said.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the best efforts of first responders, the woman died before she could be airlifted to hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Scene examinations are in progress on Waipa Esplanade, where the woman, 42, may have been injured, and at the Jordan Street location where she died.</p>
        
            <p>There is a large police presence in the area and cordons are in place at both scenes.</p>
        
            <p>"We know these events are unsettling for our communities and those involved, and officers will be carrying out reassurance patrols in the area," Keall said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information is asked to help via their website or call 105 and use the reference number 241227/6958.</p>
