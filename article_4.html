            <p>Correction: This story originally misidentified a secondary school principals association as a secondary school teachers association. </p>
        
            <p>A teacher shortage is disappointing but no surprise, the head of a secondary school principals' association says.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education said schools were likely to be short 1250 primary and secondary school teachers this year, after it mistakenly under-counted demand by more than a thousand teachers.</p>
        
            <p>President of the Secondary Principals Association Vaughan Couillault said data released this week reflected what secondary school teachers were already experiencing on the ground.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was not a shock at all. There was obviously a change in those projections from a primary school perspective, but that again reflects what [secondary] colleagues have been saying on the ground, and the data analysts have caught up."</p>
        
            <p>Both teachers and the ministry team who made the error were disappointed, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite disappointing and quite a significant miscalculation for our primary colleagues."</p>
        
            <p>Secondary schools were less affected, he said, because they had experienced supply issues for the last decade.</p>
        
            <p>Couillault said secondary schools had tried to address those shortfalls by "going hunting in other jurisdictions... So you go hunting overseas and I know that there has been some work done from a Ministry of Education perspective and trying to target certain markets offshore."</p>
        
            <p>The preference "for all of us" was still to train local teachers and to grow our own humans to teach our own children.</p>
        
            <p>"But that's a medium- to long-term solution, not a not a short term one."</p>
        
            <p>Schools were having to cut courses or make classrooms bigger to adjust, or ask non-specialist teachers to teach specialist courses, he added.</p>
        
            <p>Teaching remained a "fantastic, wonderful career choice", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every job can be challenging and there's far more uplifting moments than there are ones that that keep you down."</p>
        
            <p>Couillault said a bi-partisan, common-sense approach to education was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's continue to work with policy makers and people who make cabinet-based decisions to value the importance of health and education...[they] are the two big public goods we've got to get right, and we've got to have some bi-partisan approaches to it where you're not being pulled from one direction to another based on the change of a government or a coalition agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"We need a real bi-partisan approach that's commonsensical, and we get that public good provision of education right, for all of the children we care for."</p>
