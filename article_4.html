            <p>Where do I belong? It's a question every human being has to answer for themselves but one that can be especially painful for transgender people.</p>
        
            <p>Before coming out as non-binary in their late 20s, Auckland creative Perrin Hastings felt like an alien in their attempts to present as a "Kiwi bloke".</p>
        
            <p>In the new video series The Gender Agenda, Hastings takes viewers on a fun, informative journey of discovery about trans and non-binary lifestyles.</p>
        
            <p>Making the show helped Hastings relax into their own identity after decades of unease, they told RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>"I am now far more comfortable in who I am today and that would not be the case without this documentary happening."</p>
        
            <p>As a child, Hastings "trusted the adults" on what was acceptable behaviour for a boy and did not have the tools to talk to their family about gender dysphoria.</p>
        
            <p>After they came out as gay, uncomfortable feelings persisted, until in their late 20s Hastings realised they were non-binary.</p>
        
            <p>"I was like 'Okay, but what does that mean?' It's such a broad term and often hard to understand for people, and even identifying with it can mean so many different things. What does that actually mean for me?"</p>
        
            <p>
"A lot of the rangatahi I work with don't feel comfortable at home, their marae or just walking down the street," takatƒÅpui activist Quack Pirihi tells The Gender Agenda.

            <p>As a young adult, Hastings said, they started introducing the idea of being non-binary to the family gradually.</p>
        
            <p>"I started with just slipping in 'Hey, I wore a dress the other day' and 'Christmas is coming up. I would be interested in someone buying me some makeup - here are some brands'. Just slipping in these little things to get them used to, 'hey, I'm a bit gender non-conforming'.</p>
        
            <p>"Later it become a more serious conversation about 'Hey, this is how I like to be referred to. This is how I see myself, identity-wise' and just guiding them through that."</p>
        
            <p>In the future, Hastings is excited to help guide and support other young non-binary Kiwis - either on The Gender Agenda or as a community advocate.</p>
        
            <p>"There are so many stories out there that need to be shared. If I can be a conduit of that, if I can be the person who's making funny noises between all the wisdom, then I would love to be that."</p>
