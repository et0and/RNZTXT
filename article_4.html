            <p>Sublime with Rome will head to Coroglen, near Whitianga, on 30 December, with support from the Flaxxies.</p>
        
            <p>They'll see in the new year at Brew Year's Eve - Brewtown in Upper Hutt on 31 December, before starting the new year off at Black Barn in Havelock North on 2 January.</p>
        
            <p>Finally they will play at Bay Park Arena at Mount Maunganui on 3 January- both dates will have Elemeno P in support.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, Sublime with Rome frontman Rome Ramirez shared his "absolute displeasure" in postponing their new Zealand shows over summer due to "unforeseen circumstances". It came amid news the band were calling it quits at the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from Ramirez to Billboard at the time read: "After almost two remarkable decades, I am announcing my departure from Sublime with Rome at the close of 2024. The upcoming performances over the next year will allow us to reflect on countless incredible memories together!"</p>
        
            <p>They were slated to perform seven shows, including at indie festival Le Currents in Taup≈ç, Rock The Bowl in New Plymouth as well as the Coro Classic in Matarangi.</p>
