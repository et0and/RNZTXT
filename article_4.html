            <p>A woman missing from Hamilton for almost 24 hours has been found, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Cassandra Clarkin was found safe just after 3.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, police issued an appeal for sightings of the 49-year-old, who was last seen at an Ōhaupō Rd rehabilitation residence in Glenview at 4.30pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton Police Senior Sergeant Simon Cherry said Clarkin lived at the home after suffering a traumatic head injury in a car crash last year.</p>
        
            <p>Police had held serious concerns for her.</p>
        
            <p>"She's potentially been out all night in 4 to 5 degrees Celcius temperature. It was very foggy overnight and in the early morning," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a number of reasons why police are concerned for her welfare.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe she's under medication and quite vulnerable due to previous injuries she sustained so we've got real concerns about her welfare and where she is."</p>
        
            <p>He was unsure why Clarkin left the residence and said her brother in Auckland had been notified of her disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>Two Land Search and Rescue (SAR) teams were deployed to the area, west of the central city, as well as the Police Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Police also asked residents in the area to check any sheds, garages and outbuildings on their properties and any CCTV footage in case Clarkin had sought shelter overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Cherry said as the day went on police grew increasingly more worried.</p>
        
            <p>By 3.45pm, police issued another update reporting that Clarkin had been found safe.</p>
        
            <p>They thanked the public for their assistance.</p>
