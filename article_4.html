            <p>Two police officers and two other people have been injured after a vehicle crashed into the site of an earlier crash.</p>
        
            <p>Four people were taken to hospital after the incident west of Whangārei on State Highway 14, at Maungatapere, Superintendent Matt Srhoj said.</p>
        
            <p>Several police officers were at the scene of an earlier single car crash, he said, about 8.40pm on Saturday, where the driver of the first car to crash was talking to a police officer inside a patrol car.</p>
        
            <p>"A second vehicle has veered across the road and collided with the front of one of the patrol vehicles. Both the Police officer and the first driver received minor injuries," Srhoj said.</p>
        
            <p>"Another police officer received moderate injuries after being hit as he attempted to evade the out-of-control vehicles. The driver of the second vehicle also received minor injuries."</p>
        
            <p>Police are investigating what caused the crash and whether charges will be laid, but believe the driver lost control of the vehicle, Srhoj said.</p>
        
            <p>All of the officers had been wearing high-visibility gear, and the police vehicles had their flashing lights on, Srhoj said.</p>
        
            <p>All four people taken to hospital had been discharged by late morning Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"We are extremely grateful that our staff are all going to be okay... We are lucky not to be dealing with a fatality here." Srhoj said. "They will be sore for a while, but their injuries could have been much worse. We are supporting them and their families while they recover at home."</p>
        
            <p>On New Year's Day, a police officer was killed and another was seriously injured when a car crashed into them in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Thirteen people lost their lives on New Zealand roads during the recent holiday period, which officially ran from 4pm, Tuesday 24 December until 6am Friday, 3 January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Last year's provisional road toll was 291, the lowest in a decade.</p>
