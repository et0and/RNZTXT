            <p>A new pro bono legal network is set to boost the amount of support available for people who cannot afford to pay for a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>The Framework for Collaborative Pro Bono in Aotearoa is led by Te Ara Ture, a division of Community Law which connects people who need advice with volunteer lawyers.</p>
        
            <p>The initiative aims to address gaps in legal aid, motivate more lawyers and firms to work pro bono, and advocate for legal reform.</p>
        
            <p>So far six firms have signed up: DLA Piper, Gilbert Walker, Holland Beckett, Luke Cunningham Clere, Russell McVeagh and Simpson Grierson.</p>
        
            <p>Each firm had agreed to a voluntary target of at least 25 hours of pro bono work per full-time lawyer each year.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ara Ture director Sabrina Muck said the framework would provide access to justice for vulnerable communities who otherwise had nowhere else to go.</p>
        
            <p>"As a profession, we are well aware of the high levels of unmet legal need in our society," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The launch of the collaborative framework offers an identifiable and structured pathway for lawyers across New Zealand to engage in providing pro bono services."</p>
        
            <p>Community Law chief executive Sue Moroney said the approach was "groundbreaking" and would benefit those who currently slipped through the cracks.</p>
        
            <p>The threshold for legal aid was very low, so many people missed out, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are people who sit above that income threshold, but still there is no way that they can be affording to pay $300 and $400 an hour for a lawyer to address their issues," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They might be issues about losing their job, or perhaps there's a marriage break-up or a relationship break-up, and they need some legal support around that, so these are the sorts of issues that are really fundamental to people's day to day lives," Moroney said.</p>
        
            <p>She expected the initiative would gain momentum and the number of firms signed up would grow quickly.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ara Ture said the network was inspired by models in the United Kingdom and Australia which each provided more than 500,000 hours of pro bono work last year.</p>
