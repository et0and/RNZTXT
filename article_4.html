            <p>Two people killed in a motorsport crash both inherited their love of cars from their fathers.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen-year-old driver Brooklyn Horan and his 35-year-old co-driver Tyson Jemmett died after their car veered off the road at the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were in a two-wheel drive Ford Fiesta with a less than two-litre engine, according to event documents.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Jemmett said his nephew Tyson had inherited his enthusiasm for the sport.</p>
        
            <p>"It started with his father, he's been involved with motorsport for a very long time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And Tyson obviously followed, and took over his father's rally car."</p>
        
            <p>Tyson Jemmett had lived overseas for a number of years but had returned to racing upon coming back to New Zealand, Peter Jemmett said, mostly with the Targa Rally.</p>
        
            <p>"He was always a very vibrant person, very outgoing. He was very much into homebrewing, he was very good at it - he did it in London while he was overseas and he made many batches in New Zealand," Peter said.</p>
        
            <p>"I just think he was an outstanding young lad really, in his prime."</p>
        
            <p>Peter said the family was devastated. He said Tyson had married his long-time partner Lucy last year after more than a decade together.</p>
        
            <p>Brooklyn Horan also had familial ties to the sport - his father Raana Horan came second in last year's Rally Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Professional motorsport racer Greg Murphy said the teenager was a joy to be around, and had a "really infectious smile".</p>
        
            <p>"[He was] just a wonderful young man who had been brought up incredibly well and just loved getting out there and enjoying his motorsport.</p>
        
            <p>"His dad's a very good rally driver as well and he was following in his footsteps there and participating and doing all sorts of amazing things behind the wheel.</p>
        
            <p>"He was doing lots of different disciplines of the sport too and was clearly going to be a successful driver in his own right as he got more and more experience."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, champion rally driver Hayden Paddon took to social media saying it was "numbing" to hear of the accident.</p>
        
            <p>"Brooklyn, for someone so young, with so much talent and a huge future in the sport who I am sure would have gone all the way. You were the future of our sport but also one of the nicest and most humble young man I have ever met. Your career may have only just been starting but you had already left your mark!"</p>
        
            <p>He described seeing Tyson at the World Rally Championships events several years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Tyson, you were one of the true passionate rally fans. I remeber [sic] you at the WRC events throughout 2017 and 2018 waving the Kiwi flag and supporting us through thick and thin, always pushing the sport of rallying forward in the media. A great business, sporting and family man."</p>
        
            <p>Paddon - who was also introduced to the sport at a young age by his father - said he was "lost for words".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure Possum will be the first to meet you both up stairs and shake your hand," he said, referring to Peter 'Possum' Bourne - a world-class rally car driver who died in 2003 while driving in non-competitive circumstances on a public road.</p>
