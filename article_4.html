            <p>A Glen Innes man has been arrested and charged with 27 counts of fraud, all of which relate to Facebook Marketplace.</p>
        
            <p>Police had issued a warrant for the arrest of the 26-year-old man in relation to a number of fraud incidents across TƒÅmaki Makaurau in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday night, police searched an address in Glen Innes, found the man and arrested him.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in the Auckland District Court today and faced 27 charges of fraud, all of which were alleged to relate to sales on Facebook Marketplace.</p>
        
            <p>The man's bail has been opposed by police.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Bolton, Auckland City CIB, said the arrest came when police were seeing a "concerning" amount of reports of people being duped by other users of Facebook Marketplace.</p>
        
            <p>"While it is a very successful buy and sell platform, it's also a successful hunting ground for criminals to buy items using a fake bank transfer or sell items that don't exist and don't deliver.</p>
        
            <p>"Every day, our officers in the Financial Crime Unit are assessing and, unfortunately, filing files where a fake bank transfer has been used by these offenders.</p>
        
            <p>"We've noticed the fake images have become more and more convincing, which means more people have fallen victim to their trap."</p>
        
            <p>The unit was seeing up to 60 such reports a month relating to this type of crime, Bolton said.</p>
        
            <p>"These types of scams are notoriously difficult for police to investigate so we are urging those who use the buy and sell platform to exercise caution and do their due-diligence first.</p>
        
            <p>"Prevention will always be the best tactic to avoid becoming a victim."</p>
        
            <p>Police advised people using buy and sell platform to:</p>
        
            <p>If you believe you are or have been a victim of fraud, contact the [www.police.govt.nz/use-105 police], or call 105 and report the matter.</p>
