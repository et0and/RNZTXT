        <h2>'Could be equally devastating' - Are we at the risk of a megaquake?</h2>
        <p>
A seismologist says New Zealand is unlikely to have a megaquake such as the one Japan is on high alert for, but a lesser quake could still be more devastating.

            <p>A seismologist says New Zealand is unlikely to have a megaquake such as the one Japan is on high alert for, but a lesser quake could still be more devastating.</p>
        
            <p>Japan's meteorological agency issued its first-ever megaquake warning around the country's southern Pacific coast on Friday following a 7.1 magnitude tremor.</p>
        
            <p>A magnitude-5.3 quake has since hit Tokyo and eastern parts of Japan.</p>
        
            <p>Megaquakes have a magnitude of 9.0 or more happen where two plates push against each other.</p>
        
            <p>Seven to 7.9 is classified as a major quake, while quakes of magnitude 8.0 to 8.9 are registered as great.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science seismologist John Ristau said it was unlikely the North Island's Hikurangi subduction zone would generate a megaquake.</p>

            <p>"The big threat [there] though is that this is maybe the only place in the world where a major population centre actually sits right on top of one of those subduction zones."</p>
        
            <p>John Ristau said the Hikurangi could still cause a quake of 8.5 magnitude, which could be much more damaging than a megaquake given the faultline ran under the Wellington and Wairarapa region.</p>
        
            <p>"But you don't even need to be talking about a subduction zone - when the Alpine fault or the Wellington fault eventually rupture there will be aftershocks through major population centres and these could be equally devastating."</p>
        
            <p>He said Japan's first-ever megaquake warning was likely to be precautionary, although evidence suggested there was a higher chance of a big earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>Japan had a five percent chance of having another large quake, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"What [the Japanese government] is saying now is that the probability of having an earthquake a similar size or larger is increased, which is actually true. The most likely time to have a large earthquake is right after you've just had one."</p>
        
            <p>Ristau said a 7.2 quake happened in Japan two days before the Tohuku 9.1 magnitude megaquake and tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people in 2011.</p>
        
            <p>"This is probably what has prompted the warning they've put out [this week]."</p>
        
            <p>He said the most powerful quake ever recorded was the 1960 Valdivia megaquake off the coast off Chile, estimated to be a 9.5 magnitude.</p>
        
            <p>Ristau said if he was in the area of Japan where the megaquake warning had been issued he would "probably go about my day-to-day life, but just have it in back of my mind that this is a possibility.</p>
        
            <p>"It's probably a good time to check your earthquake supplies, and make sure you are prepared just on the off-chance this might happen".</p>
        
            <p>It was sensible for people living in a country like Japan or New Zealand to have supplies anyway, and to know what to do in the event of a large earthquake or tsunami warning, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"Drop cover hold and if there's strong or long shaking, around the coast that could mean a tsunami. Long or strong, get gone."</p>
