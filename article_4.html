            <p>The government is considering proposals submitted by the advisory group on retail crime, promising "big" measures in how New Zealand tackles such offending.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith, who launched the group in September, said he would be making an announcement on the proposals "in due course".</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post on 12 February, the minister subsequently promised that "big things [are] coming to combat retail crime".</p>
        
            <p>Over the past year, New Zealand's Asian communities have expressed frustration on the slow progress in tackling crime impacting their businesses.</p>
        
            <p>In response, advisory group on crime was created with an operating budget of $1.8 million a year for at least two years, led by former Crime Prevention Group president Sunny Kaushal.</p>
        
            <p>Other members included Dairy and Business Owners Group vice-chair Himanshu Parmar, Michael Hill national retail manager Michael Bell, Foodstuffs North Island retail and property general manager Lindsay Rowles and Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young.</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal said the group had submitted several proposals to the government for consideration.</p>
        
            <p>"In line with the group's mandate to develop evidence-based recommendations to tackle urgent issues related to retail crime, we have submitted proposals related to the defence of property in the Crimes Act to the ministers," Kaushal said.</p>
        
            <p>"Work on other issues is under way, and we are going to run workshops across the country with retailers, hospitality sector, service stations and other businesses affected by retail crime."</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal said the advisory group on crime had engaged with a cross-section of stakeholders, including Woolworths, the Motor Trade Association, the New Zealand Security Association, the Waikato Retailers Association and the New Zealand Indian Business Association, among others.</p>
        
            <p>Simon Bradwell, head of communications at the Motor Trade Association, said the organisation had forged an alliance with the Dairy and Business Owners Group called Safer Shops "to speak with a united voice".</p>
        
            <p>"We have proposed [that] crime against a retail worker should be a standalone offence," Bradwell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last year, we appeared before the [Justice] Select Committee to argue [that] offenders who post video of their crime on social media should be disqualified for any deduction for remorse at sentencing."</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young, a member of the ministerial advisory group, wanted a specific team to be assembled to address youth offending.</p>
        
            <p>"While the government has put in place the highly publicized academies ... this only addresses a small percentage of the youth offending and at a restricted age," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"A more wholistic approach is required to target juvenile offending to address the issue prior to the behaviours being set in place," Young said.</p>
        
            <p>"[Solutions need to focus on] all aspects of a young person's life from attendance at school, access to healthcare when needed, appropriate housing and nutrition," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many juvenile offending starts at 11 or 12 years of age, highlighting the need for early intervention."</p>
        
            <p>Retail NZ had filed submissions on the use of facial recognition technology and the role of security guards to the advisory group, Young said.</p>
        
            <p>These suggestions included strengthening trespass legislation and providing clarity on the application of reasonable force to recover stolen goods, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Jaspreet Kandhari, general secretary of the New Zealand Indian Business Association, called for security guards to be equipped with non-lethal weapons such as taser guns or pepper spray to serve as a deterrent.</p>
        
            <p>"In certain high-risk areas, having non-lethal weapons could help guards neutralize potential threats without escalating the situation to lethal force," Kandhari said. "This can be a strong deterrent for theft, armed robberies and violent behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>But before that could happen, the Waikato Retailers Association called for security guards to receive comprehensive training on the proper use of these weapons to ensure they were deployed responsibly and only in appropriate situations.</p>
        
            <p>"Clear legal guidelines must be established governing the use of these non-lethal weapons to prevent misuse and ensure guards are protected from liability when they act appropriately," the association said in its submission.</p>
        
            <p>Gary Morrison, chief executive of the New Zealand Security Association, called for urgent action from the government "in increasing the penalties for those who assault or abuse security officers, first responders and other front-line staff".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Woolworths New Zealand spokesperson revealed that the supermarket operator had invested $45 million in security measures over three years in response to the increased violence and aggression experienced, including team safety cameras, push-to-talk radios, trolley lock systems, fog cannons, double-entry gates and anti-sweep shelving.</p>
        
            <p>"[Woolworths] recorded a 9 percent increase in violence and aggression in our stores from July 2023 to July 2024, with a 50 percent increase in physical assaults," the spokesperson added.</p>
        
            <p>Kaushal hoped his team would lead efforts to reduce retail crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Our guiding principle is to create a zero-tolerance response to retail crime," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeking certainty of consequences," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Criminals need to know they will be held accountable if they offend, and this is what hard-working Kiwis expect."</p>
