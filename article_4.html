            <p>Auckland Council says it has applied "extreme prudence" to it's hiring process over the last few years, despite spending $7.4 million on recruitment over the past 12 months.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff have come under fire from mayor Wayne Brown this week, who raised concerns at the group's recruitment expenses.</p>
        
            <p>Documents provided to RNZ from council show in the year ending November, Auckland Council Group hired 3049 staff including about 1742 new staff.</p>
        
            <p>External recruitment providers accounted for two percent of the hires during that time.</p>
        
            <p>The total cost to the organisation includes $3.9 million spent by council's internal talent acquisition team, $1.7 million from external recruiters across council, TƒÅtaki Auckland Unlimited, and Eke Panuku, $950,000 from Auckland Transport, and $750,000 from Watercare.</p>
        
            <p>The figure also includes advertising, probity checks like drug tests and police checks, supporting diversity of recruitment and the issuing of employment contracts.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Chris Darby has defended the spending, saying recruitment was a vital chore for the group.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a big organisation, around about 7000 people, that's excluding Watercare and Auckland Transport," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We deliver hundreds of services everyday, real core services, to Aucklanders that they expect to have work when they demand them, everyday of the year."</p>

            <p>Darby said council had suffered serious financial pressures after the Covid-19 pandemic, including a long period of restructuring.</p>
        
            <p>He hundreds of jobs at council had been dis-established, with some reconstructed to merge multiple roles into one.</p>
        
            <p>"When you do that, you have to go out and re-advertise that position," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said council had an efficient recruitment team, performing to the standard Aucklanders expected.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm actually confident that we're on the right track," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The dividends are showing up, we've got a much more efficient recruitment team."</p>
        
            <p>Darby described council's in-house recruitment unit as a vital cog in the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Council said it had improvements to its recruitment processes underway, expected to come into effect by the end of June 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It said the improvements would reduce the number of steps in its process by half, saving 18 days in the time it takes to hire, and delivering $600,000 in savings per annum.</p>
