            <p>A teenager remains in a critical condition after being rushed to hospital from a Christchurch ice-skating rink on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A Givealittle page attributed to those close to the girl said the 13-year-old fell and sustained an "unsurvivable" head injury while on a school ice-skating trip at Alpine Ice Sports Centre.</p>
        
            <p>The police said she remained in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to Alpine Ice Sports Centre in Brougham St centre shortly after 11am Tuesday morning. Two ambulances and a rapid response vehicle attended.</p>
        
            <p>The ice rink reopened on Wednesday after closing on Tuesday following the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Haeata Community Campus principal Dr Peggy Burrows said the school had not had confirmation of their student's status, confirming the accident happened on an "EOTC" (education outside the classroom) trip.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that many whānau and ākonga will be affected by this uncertainty and by this tragedy. We will update our school community as soon as we have an official notification.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with the… whānau at this time."</p>
