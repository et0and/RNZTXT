            <p>A wildfire in north Canterbury is spreading again, fanned by strong winds.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said five helicopters were being used to battle the blaze, which had been burning since Thursday night in a forestry block north of Waipara.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters had managed to contain the fire, which has burnt through more than 100 hectares, on Sunday morning before the winds picked up.</p>
        
            <p>"High gusty winds have caused multiple break-out fires this afternoon," Fire and Emergency said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The fire has jumped the containment line and is now not contained and not controlled.</p>
        
            <p>"We are putting all our resources into bringing the fire under control, including five helicopters responding."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, a 300ha vegetation fire in the Waikari Valley forced the evacuation of properties in Waipara.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency asked people not to light outdoor fires and for anyone who had lit one recently to ensure it was fully extinguished.</p>
