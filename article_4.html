            <p>Nelson police have charged a man with murder after a fatal attack in Stoke earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>James Whitikau Barton died in hospital after being found with critical injuries in Orchard Street on the evening of 10 November.</p>
        
            <p>A week later a white BMW linked to the incident was recovered by police.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old accused was due to appear in court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked the public for their help with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"The information we received was valuable in piecing together what happened on the night Whitikau died and enabled us to come to this result," Detective Inspector Lex Bruning said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Bruning said the 48-year-old victim and the accused were believed to be known to each other</p>
