            <p>Tens of thousands of protesters are expected at Parliament today, as Hīkoi mō te Tiriti reaches its final destination.</p>
        
            <p>It's the end of a nine-day trek for many who oppose the Treaty Principles Bill, whish is being sponsored by the ACT party.</p>
        
            <p>Those walking are flying hundreds of tino rangatiratanga flags, while many drivers are tooting as they pass the hīkoi.</p>
        
            <p>Participants are aged from young children to the elderly.</p>
        
            <p>Here's a sample of some of those taking part.</p>
