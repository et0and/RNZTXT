            <p>Locals in the Coromandel township are shocked and saddened by a fatal shooting that has "rocked" the community.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to The 309 Road just after 2pm Friday, where two people were found with gunshot wounds. One later died and another was airlifted to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A man has been arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder. Police were not seeking anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>A man who previously lived on the road for 15 years said it had rocked the tight-knit community.</p>
        
            <p>"The people that I lived with up there, were really close and this is going back 30 or 40 years when I first met them. It was a shock, an absolute shock to hear it.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't know anything about it. I was downtown shopping yesterday and was just getting into my car and a friend was having a cup of coffee and he called me over."</p>
        
            <p>At the bustling Saturday farmers' market, one woman said she thought everyone was quite distressed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very unusual for that sort of thing to happen here. It's a really peaceful community, a lot of eccentrics but a really peaceful place.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's rocked us, especially now, with holidaymakers coming. I think people are a bit worried that people are going to think that it's a dangerous place to be. But it truly isn't. I think everybody's feeling very sad, honestly, very sad."</p>
        
            <p>Waiau residents would be reeling, Coromandel MP Scott Simpson said, and it was not the way they would want to start their Christmas season.</p>
        
            <p>"The 309 Road is a really special part of the Coromandel," he said. "It's an unsealed metalled piece of road - it's in many respects like Coromandel [that] used to be in classic years gone by.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a tight-knit community and I'm very much feeling for those people who live in and are part of that community as we come to terms with this news."</p>
        
            <p>A former army medic gave CPR to one of the victims.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who did not want to be named, told Checkpoint that he was serving customers at his small business when someone told him they had heard gun shots.</p>
        
            <p>The man said he found an injured man near the edge of his property. He put him in the recovery position and got a compression bandage, for what looked like a gunshot wound, before starting CPR. The victim did not survive his injuries.</p>
        
            <p>He said he later noticed there was a second man, who appeared to be a "young lad" in his 20s, who had a gunshot wound to the upper chest. He was later airlifted to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The man said 120 children were on-site celebrating the end of the school year.</p>
        
            <p>He did not think they would have seen anything as they left through a different exit on the property.</p>
