            <p>The theft of a unique sculpture of the movie character Yoda from a Wellington home this week is "heartbreaking and disappointing", says one of the co-ordinators of a local Star Wars fan community.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the metal jedi master was taken from a Madras Street property in the Wellington suburb of Khandallah on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Kristy Glasgow, who runs Star Wars New Zealand (SWNZ) with her husband Matt Glasgow, said she did not know the owner and heard about the theft on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"But I imagine, putting that much work into a statue, they must be a big Star Wars fan or a big Yoda fan."</p>
        
            <p>The Star Wars community was very creative but the sculpture was particularly distinctive, she added.</p>
        
            <p>"It looks incredible and I can imagine there would be a lot of people thinking to themselves I would actually commission something like that for my backyard if I knew somebody who was able to work like that."</p>
        
            <p>The Star Wars community was highly creative, with many people producing everything from lifesize figures of droid robots, to costumes and canvases, but the Yoda sculpture was particularly distinctive.</p>
        
            <p>"Metalwork is so unique, and it's such an incredible statue. We fans have a lot of Star Wars collectibles within our homes [but] it would be really fun to have more collectibles in our gardens and outside the houses that we decorate with Star Wars things [inside]. It's a real shame to hear that something that somebody's clearly put a tonne of work into has been stolen."</p>
        
            <p>"It's clearly a labour of love, something that they've spent just absolutely hours and hours on."</p>
        
            <p>Police said the sculpture would not have a high scrap metal value, and the theft had left the owner understandably upset.</p>
        
            <p>Glasgow said given the sculpture's size she thought it was probably still in the Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>"I really hope that the item can be recovered. It's getting media attention and it's very recognisable. I hope they leave it somewhere so that the owner can recover it because I can only imagine how heartbreaking this must be for the person who put all of that work and effort into it."</p>
