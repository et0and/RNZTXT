            <p>Three people were arrested in a police operation in Tūrangi Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that teams from Taupō Police executed a search warrant at a Tūrangi property with links to the Mongrel Mob.</p>
        
            <p>Officers seized nine stolen firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, a collection of stolen property and drugs.</p>
        
            <p>During the warrant, cultivation equipment was also seized from the property.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want drugs in our community or guns in the hands of gang members - we want to send a clear signal that we will disrupt this kind of criminal activity, which only harms people," Detective Sergeant Paul Meharry said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Police have charged an 18-year-old man with burglary, a 35-year-old woman with drug-related charges and a 29-year-old man with three counts of receiving stolen property and drug-related charges.</p>
        
            <p>Further charges are likely. All three are due to appear in the Taupō District Court on 8 May.</p>
