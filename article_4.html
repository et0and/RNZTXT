            <p>Water is back on in Auckland hospital's main building after it was cut overnight as contractors repaired a burst pipe.</p>
        
            <p>The water was shut off in building 32 from 6pm on Wednesday while a leak in ward 38 was fixed.</p>
        
            <p>The building houses operating theatres and maternity delivery suites.</p>
        
            <p>Temporary portable sinks were available in some operating theatres and bottled water and hot water in urns had to be delivered.</p>
        
            <p>The toilets were still working but patients who could not use them were given disposable bed pans and bottles.</p>
        
            <p>Executive director at the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists, Sarah Dalton told RNZ the pipe burst some time Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Dalton said it was unclear when the water was turned back on, but it was a "relief".</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora said patients continued to receive high-quality clinical care.</p>
