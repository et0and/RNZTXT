        <h2>Air NZ bomb scare: 'Why don't you let us off the plane?'</h2>
        <p>
A passenger on board the plane at the centre of the bomb threat says they found out what was happening from a news report.
</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on board an Air New Zealand flight at the centre of a bomb threat says they only found out when they saw a news broadcast about the plane they were sitting in.</p>
        
            <p>Australia's 9 News said flight NZ247 arrived from Wellington about 5.40pm local time (7.40pm NZT) on Saturday, with a tactical operations unit, paramedics and firefighters all called to the scene. The plane had 154 staff and passengers on board, the channel reported.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's Penny Nel was on the flight, heading to Sydney to see her daughter and her husband - she had not seen them since before the Covid-19 pandemic began.</p>
        
            <p>"So it was an important and exciting trip," she told RNZ, and plain sailing until it landed in Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>"As we landed, we literally came to a stop and the pilot came over the intercom. He said ... there's a slight problem, there's a security issue and we have been told to hold where we are."</p>
        
            <p>Passengers thought there must be an issue at the airport terminal itself - perhaps King Charles' arrival the same day.</p>
        
            <p>That was about 5.50pm Sydney time. After an hour, the person next to Nel showed her a news broadcast indicating a bomb scare.</p>

            <p>Nel thought it must be nearby, but her fellow passenger said no - it was their plane.</p>
        
            <p>At that point, people started to wonder what was going to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the passengers did get very agitated and he was very scared, but he was very vocal and it did take a few of the cabin crew - who were excellent - to just calm him down and get him to lower the tone, because obviously he was causing anxiety amongst the rest of the passengers.</p>
        
            <p>"Of course, the issue was, 'Why don't you let us off the plane if there's a bomb?'... I think everyone was thinking that."</p>
        
            <p>At that point, those on board began to notice a lot of vehicles - police cars, ambulances - and people in high-vis jackets.</p>
        
            <p>"It all started getting rather real, I think, at that point."</p>

            <p>A "really good group of people" on the plane managed to retain a good sense of humour and pragmatism, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The cabin crew were excellent, just sort of keeping us updated as they could. The pilot was really good."</p>
        
            <p>After they eventually disembarked they were made to line up against a wall with their bags in the middle of a room as a sniffer dog checked them all.</p>
        
            <p>Each passenger was then taken aside by a police officer and individually asked personal questioned.</p>
        
            <p>They waited another hour for their luggage to arrive on the carousel, "so that must have also been going through some sort of screening, I should imagine".</p>
        
            <p>Nel said it was a "little bit disconcerting".</p>
        
            <p>During the individual interview process, those conducting them were kind and supportive, Nel said.</p>
        
            <p>"They were not intimidating. Very polite... they couldn't have been more professional... we actually felt very assured at them being there."</p>
        
            <p>As for what triggered the bomb threat response, Nel said "There may have been a note on the plane - that is what caused this - so we all sort of gathered the note had been picked up on the plane".</p>
        
            <p>"As to what point that happened we are not sure. I wouldn't have noticed anything during the flight, though there was a slight bit of movement near the cockpit, I'd say probably 15 minutes before we landed. I thought 'Oh, there's lots of activity up there', but that was about all."</p>
        
            <p>When she was interviewed after the flight, Nel was asked if she had seen a note anywhere, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully it was just a ruse and it was just somebody playing the silly goat and causing such a huge amount of disruption."</p>
        
            <p>Nel did not think she would sleep much the night following the scare.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel a little bit wound up ... just the adrenaline still going."</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, Air NZ said it was aware of "a security incident" on board the flight, the airline's chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Standard security protocols were followed. Emergency services assessed the aircraft after it landed and passengers were able to disembark.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to this incident NZ248, the return flight to Wellington was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>"Air New Zealand apologises for the inconvenience caused to customers on both services. The safety and security of all passengers and our crew is our utmost priority."</p>
        
            <p>Nel said she had received a "very nicely worded" and "quite a long" email after the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 40 emergency services vehicles were at the scene when the plane landed, including bomb squad cars and armed police, 7News said.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Police said in a statement on Sunday morning "Officers ... attended Sydney International Airport shortly before 5.30pm (Saturday 19 October 2024), in response to an aircraft incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Considerable NSWPF resources were deployed to the scene; however, most have since been stood down."</p>
        
            <p>The Australian Federal Police said in a statement it "responded to reports of an incident on board a flight enroute to the airport".</p>
        
            <p>"Upon landing, the aircraft was isolated at the end of a runway away from the airport's terminals. A thorough search of the aircraft, as well as the luggage and all passengers on board, was undertaken and nothing suspicious was found.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigations are continuing."</p>
