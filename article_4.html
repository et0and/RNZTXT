            <p>State Highway 1 north of Auckland has reopened fully, after a man who allegedly stole a vehicle was involved in a multi-vehicle crash, with two people injured.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency said just after 3pm on Sunday the Northern Motorway was closed from Oteha to Silverdale due to a crash on the in the northbound lanes</p>
        
            <p>At one point, Google Maps said traffic was backed up as far as Albany.</p>
        
            <p>The road was reopened by 7:15pm after the serious crash unit carried out a scene investigation.</p>
        
            <p>A man who was involved in the multi-vehicle crash near Dairy Flat on the Northern Motorway was arrested for stealing the vehicle in Point Chevalier, police said.</p>
        
            <p>At about 2:40pm on Sunday, officers responded to Walmer Road, Point Chevalier, after a man tried to steal a vehicle from an elderly woman, they said in a statement. He then stole a vehicle from a second person on the same road. Luckily no one was seriously injured in the incidents.</p>
        
            <p>Police used their Air Support Unit as well as traffic cameras to monitor the vehicle on the Northern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Daniel Meade said a formal pursuit using police cars was not used due to safety concerns. Instead, officers tried to spike the vehicle's wheels - however the driver did not stop.</p>
        
            <p>"At around 3pm the driver came to a stop following a multi-vehicle crash where the vehicle has rolled," Meade said.</p>
        
            <p>Two people, including the offender, received moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"While the offender was travelling along the northern motorway he has allegedly damaged a number of vehicles and knocked a motorcyclist off of their bike," Meade said.</p>
        
            <p>St John confirmed two people were transported to North Shore Hospital with moderate injuries.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA earlier warned those travelling in the area should "expect long delays travelling northbound in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Drivers should avoid the area and consider using Dairy Flat Highway as an alternative route.</p>
