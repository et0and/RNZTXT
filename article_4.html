            <p>Police are urging the parents of school children to talk to their kids about the dangers of going to and from school.</p>
        
            <p>The 2024 school year starts tomorrow for many schools.</p>
        
            <p>Police are reminding parents of the risks around schools when driving, urging them to be attentive, as children can often be unpredictable and appear out of nowhere.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, National Road Policing Centre director Steve Greally said reminding kids to check for vehicles by looking left and right, and encouraging them to use the marked school crossing were important ways of keeping them safe.</p>
        
            <p>"It can often be overlooked but reminding or informing our kids to check for vehicles by looking left and right and encouraging them to use the marked school crossing are important to keep them safe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We never want to see or hear of any unfortunate events that involve young people in and around schools, which is why it's crucial for parents to pass on these valuable safety tips."</p>
        
            <p>Greally also reminded motorists that the speed limit was 20km/h when passing a stationary school bus and 30km/h when passing schools.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they, as well as schools across the country, wanted to ensure every child could make it to and from school safe and unharmed.</p>
