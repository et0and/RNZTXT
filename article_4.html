            <p>A new community pool is to be built in the Christchurch suburb of St Albans, 18 years after the previous one was demolished.</p>
        
            <p>In 2007, the Christchurch City Council demolished the 70-year-old Edgeware Pool, despite passionate opposition from the local community.</p>
        
            <p>The rebuild comes after years of campaigning and fundraising by St Albans Pavilion and Pool Incorporated.</p>
        
            <p>Chair of the group, Lynne O'Keefe, said the small group kept the rebuild alive for many years to get to this point.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a really big moment because it has been years in the making, it's been a small group that has kept it alive, but there's also more and more people coming into it now.</p>
        
            <p>"There's also been incredible support from tradespeople, that have a connection to the pool."</p>
        
            <p>A building consent was lodged at the end of 2024 and construction will hopefully begin within the next few months, she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was hoped the $3 million facility, once completed, would help local children improve their swimming skills.</p>
        
            <p>"So we've got a school round the corner, so they can take their children, [once a] week, every year, swimming.</p>
        
            <p>"But, if those children don't have easy, continuous access to water, they just don't gain any confidence," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The new facility will include a 25-metre pool, a learners pool and a manu pool.</p>
