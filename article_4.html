        <h2>Pivotal meeting could decide fate of Christ Church Cathedral</h2>
        <p>
The rebuild, which faces a shortfall in the tens of millions, is likely to be halted after the government declined further funding.

            <p>A meeting will be held on Monday which may decide the future of the earthquake-damaged Christ Church Cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>On 9 August, the government said it would not put more money towards the restoration of the cathedral, making it likely that work would now grind to a halt.</p>
        
            <p>The Christ Church Cathedral Reinstatement Limited group had requested $60 million from the government to help meet a $85m shortfall on the project.</p>
        
            <p>In response to the government decision, CCRL said mothballing was now likely, but that its meeting in Christchurch on Monday would look at all the options.</p>
        
            <p>The group would make a further announcement on the future of the reinstatement this week.</p>
        
            <p>The same week as the government decision was handed down, the Christchurch City Council agreed to fulfil its commitment to release $7 million it had collected from a targeted rate towards the reinstatement of the cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>CCRL said it had also asked the council to pause that funding until a decision had been made on the future of the project.</p>
        
            <p>The council will also hold a public-excluded workshop on Tuesday to discuss the future of the cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of the planned restoration of the cathedral has risen dramatically in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>In 2017, the cost was estimated at $104 million. That rose to $154m in 2020, then to $248m following a review in April 2024.</p>
        
            <p>At that point CCRL said it had a shortfall in funding of $114m and needed to secure $30m by August or it would need to look at mothballing the project.</p>
        
            <p>The group later conducted a scope review, agreed to in a six-hour synod meeting in June, which would lower seismic strengthening and scrap some elements of the original plan. That review cut the shortfall to $85 million.</p>
        
            <p>That shortfall assumed further fundraising and a contribution from the church.</p>
        
            <p>A proposal to inject $16.2 million by selling off church land and buildings was also agreed at June's synod.</p>
