            <p>Southland police have charged two men with illegal street racing following reports of vehicles travelling at three times the speed limit.</p>
        
            <p>Police were alerted to a vehicle that crashed into a paddock after failing to make a turn at a corner on Grove Burn Road in November.</p>
        
            <p>It was believed to be involved in illegal street racing.</p>
        
            <p>Police said vehicles were believed to have been travelling about three times the 50 kilometres an hour speed limit before the crash.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, officers conducted searches at addresses near Tuatapere and Winton, speaking to two men and impounding their vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>The two men aged 18 and 19 are due to appear in Invercargill District Court next month, and police said further charges were likely.</p>
        
            <p>They were committed to holding illegal street racers to account.</p>
        
            <p>Not only did street racing keep residents awake and damaged the roads, but it placed drivers, passengers, bystanders, and other motorists at extreme risk, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were keen to hear from members of the public who witnessed it.</p>
        
            <p>People could call 111 if it was happening at the time or use the 105 service for non-emergencies.</p>
