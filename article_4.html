            <p>A group of abuse survivors, accompanied by two horses, have marched into Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) offices in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Among the protesters' demands is that ACC reforms eligibility for coverage for abuse survivors, immediate redress and an end to government's boot camps.</p>
        
            <p>The about two dozen survivors of abuse in care and their supporters marched from the Bridge of Remembrance to ACC to deliver a letter calling for change.</p>
        
            <p>Advocate Ken Clearwater said survivors seeking ACC-funded care for trauma faced a six to eight month wait and some had been denied coverage.</p>
        
            <p>"One psychiatrist's report for a survivor of abuse by a Catholic priest at St Joseph's school here in Christchurch said cover declined - sexual abuse not connected to the mental injury," Clearwater told the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a 7-year-old boy in the care of the church... who was sexually abused over three days by a priest but the psychiatrist said the sexual abuse was minor."</p>

            <p>Clearwater questioned whether some of those making the assessments had the necessary and correct training to deal with the trauma suffered by abuse survivors.</p>
        
            <p>Survivors were also still being ignored and kept in the dark, despite the promises from government ministers, agencies and politicians, Clearwater said.</p>
        
            <p>"Survivors have been silenced for years. We've finally got the most amazing document from the Royal Commission, which is being ignored."</p>
        
            <p>Survivors needed immediate redress and the government's boot camps experiment needed to end, he said.</p>

            <p>Piwi Beard was also concerned about the use of boot camps.</p>
        
            <p>"It's never worked and never will and the worry for me is they've gone silent on the outcomes," the survivor of abuse in girls homes said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not helping whānau find solutions. I'm a great believer in whānau for whānau, whānau-led. Whānau have the solutions, we just need to resource them and what's happening is they're not doing that - they're uplifting and putting up barriers for whānau to fail."</p>
        
            <p>Clearwater delivered his letter calling for change to ACC.</p>
        
            <p>"You spend 30 years talking about this stuff, but you don't know who's listening."</p>
