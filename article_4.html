            <p>From his family home in Houston, Texas it takes Bryan Caldwell about eight minutes to ride his scooter to work at NASA's Johnson Space Center.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington-born research scientist has led earth-based "analogue" missions for the US space agency for six years, helping to prepare astronauts for the conditions of space in simulated isolation.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, there is high anticipation in the air at NASA about the next planned trip to the moon in September 2025, Caldwell said.</p>
        
            <p>"The excitement is not just the idea of going back to the moon - it's the idea of putting the first woman and the first person of colour on the moon as well … I'm really proud to be part of that endeavour," he told Sunday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>Since Artemis 1 successfully orbited the moon without a crew in 2022, excitement has ramped up about the Artemis 2 mission, Caldwell said.</p>
        
            <p>His job is to find out not what would break astronauts on the two to three-year journey but to discover which personality groupings might best endure its physical and psychological challenges.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to understand how to keep our astronauts safe living close to the moon and living on it. That's the big drive at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Sending astronauts to Mars - "the next step" Caldwell said - is definitely more of a long-term target.</p>
        
            <p>"We have this joke that every time somebody mentions Mars it's going to be another 20 years before we get there."</p>
        
            <p>Although Caldwell himself has now "aged out" of going to space as an astronaut, he'd love to possibly go on a commercial spaceship one day.</p>
        
            <p>"If I got offered a seat to orbit the Earth for three days, I'd be putting my hand up for sure."</p>

            <p>Raised in Upper Hutt, Caldwell his wife Shannon Huse and their two kids now live a 35-minute drive from central Houston.</p>
        
            <p>Their five-bedroom home, just around the corner from Neil Armstrong's place, is in the "Apollo neighbourhood" replicated in the 2018 Armstrong biopic First Man.</p>
        
            <p>With real estate prices much lower than in NZ, it cost under US$230,000 when they moved in, Caldwell said, and previously belonged to "Apollo wife" Harriet Eisele who was married to astronaut Don Eisele.</p>
        
            <p>In their spare time, Caldwell, a former lighting designer, and Shannon, a former theatre critic, like to see live theatre shows and also catch the Houston Astros baseball team.</p>
        
            <p>Although he's not a big fan of American football - "Rugby is so much faster and cooler and more visceral" - the family also head every Friday night to their son's high school football stadium to watch him march and play trumpet.</p>
        
            <p>He and his wife are "not really sports people", Caldwell said, but the halftime show, which features flag-spinning and cheerleading, is still a fascinating sight for the Kiwis.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just so much pageantry and pomp and ceremony."</p>
