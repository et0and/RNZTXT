            <p>A jury has watched footage of former eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne questioning if he put too much expectation on his wife before she allegedly took her own life.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is accused of murdering his wife and staging it as suicide.</p>
        
            <p>But the defence argues she took her own life.</p>
        
            <p>In the High Court at Auckland, a video was played of Polkinghorne's interview with police from the day Hanna was found dead.</p>
        
            <p>In the interview, the retired eye surgeon questions whether he put too much expectation on his wife during the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out.</p>
        
            <p>He wondered if he encouraged her to do to much, including pushing her to write something on home dialysis, something she had instituted as a policy at Middlemore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe I put expectations on her to do those things," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because that's what I'd do.</p>
        
            <p>"She was tired, maybe she didn't want to do that job, maybe she just thought I got my rocks off listening to that stuff at night, maybe I just should never've let her do it."</p>
        
            <p>He wondered if he could have listened more to Hanna's concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"She vocalised her concerns, but maybe I just didn't listen to what she was saying to me," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe I just didn't listen."</p>
        
            <p>During the police interview, Polkinghorne received a call from his friend barrister Tony Bouchier.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Ilona Walton, who conducted the police interview, took the phone and left the room to speak to Bouchier.</p>
        
            <p>She did not tell him Polkinghorne was under police suspicion, only that he was being interviewed as a witness.</p>
        
            <p>After the phone call, Walton asked Polkinghorne if the scene examination could continue at his home, to which he said he wouldd have to ask Bouchier about that.</p>
        
            <p>Walton appeared before the court earlier in the trial, and was once again on the stand to be questioned by defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield asked why Polkinghorne was not advised he was under suspicion during his interview with police.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite those suspicions, he wasn't told that, when you took him to the police station, he was considered a potential suspect?" Mansfield asked.</p>
        
            <p>"In my mind, there were plausible explanations at that time that he could have provided," replied Walton.</p>
        
            <p>Walton said she did not update Polkinghorne on what was happening at his house while he was being interviewed.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
