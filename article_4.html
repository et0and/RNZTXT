        <h2>Damaged battery blamed for recycling centre fire in Queenstown</h2>

            <p>An incorrectly disposed-of battery is believed to have caused a fire at Queenstown's recycling centre.</p>
        
            <p>The initial Fire and Emergency investigation indicated the fire was sparked by a loader running over a lithium battery, while it was gathering up material last week.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenstown Lakes District Council said the fire threatened the recycling building on Glenda Drive, after a similar incident at its Victoria Flats landfill two weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown Lakes District Council spokeswoman Laura Gledhill said the fire served as a reminder of the dangers of improper battery disposal.</p>
        
            <p>"Batteries, in particular those containing lithium, can easily ignite, especially when damaged," she said. "We urge everyone to make sure they recycle or safely dispose of their batteries at designated drop-off points to prevent incidents like this from happening again.</p>
        
            <p>"Never throw a battery in any bin. While the source of this particular fire was unable to be confirmed, it's highly likely that it was a battery and that's a risk we can't afford to ignore."</p>
        
            <p>The council said 12 of 13 waste-related fires last year were likely linked to batteries, which had a serious impact on landfills, transfer stations, recycling depots and rubbish trucks.</p>
