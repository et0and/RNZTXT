            <p>The jury in the trial of a Christchurch man facing 30 sexual offending charges has asked the judge for advice on what happens if they can not reach a unanimous or majority verdict on all charges.</p>
        
            <p>John Hope Muchirahondo is facing 21 charges of sexual violation by rape, and nine of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection and one of not providing access to a cell phone.</p>
        
            <p>The jury has been deliberating for nine days.</p>
        
            <p>The jury has already lost one member due to illness, and on Wednesday they asked what happened if they could not reach a unanimous decision and were advised they could return a majority verdict.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the jury said in a question, that the judge had said in her summing up that if they could not reach a unanimous or majority verdict on all charges she would have further directions for them, and they asked what that further advice was.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston advised the jury could be discharged on certain charges if they could not reach a verdict on those, and they could deliver a verdict on other charges where a decision was reached.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Preston also asked the jury to take more time if they thought they could reach a verdict on any of the undecided charges, and the jury has continued to deliberate this afternoon.</p>
