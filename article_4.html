            <p>The assault and shooting of a man at a bar in Pakuranga Heights in a quiet neighbourhood has shocked the community.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were called to Dunrobin Place in Highland Park about 9.55pm on Thursday, where three men assaulted a man before a shot was fired.</p>
        
            <p>The victim was taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Enquiries are now ongoing to determine the full circumstances of what has occurred including who is responsible," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Thursday, police said they were told a gun was fired at a vehicle outside a Mt Eden restaurant, after a confrontation between two groups, resulting in a police chase towards Manurewa, before three people were arrested.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understood the later shooting occurred at Applejack's Bar and Eatery, in Pakuranga Heights, near Highland Park.</p>
        
            <p>The chair of an Auckland local board said the shooting was not normal for the area.</p>
        
            <p>Howick Local Board chair Damian Light told RNZ most crime in the area was not like Thursday night's shooting.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's one of the reasons - obviously and understandably right - it sparks concern from local residents, because it doesn't happen often, which is a good thing, but when it does happen it does sort of worry people."</p>
        
            <p>The shooting had taken place in a popular area, he said: "Highland Park's kind of right in the middle of East Auckland, so it is a popular area."</p>
        
            <p>Applejack's did not wish to comment when contacted by RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Light urged members of the community with concerns to go to the police, rather than look on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"In all these instances, it's understandable that people are concerned, and there's a lot of misinformation and social media goes nuts, and people start putting stuff on there," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Not everything that people read or see is necessarily true, and it's really important that we let the police do their job."</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged anyone with information about what happened to take it to the police, rather than post it online.</p>
        
            <p>"Putting it on Facebook's not helpful," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in a statement they did not not believe the two shootings on Thursday were linked, but said they were keeping an open mind as they investigated both.</p>
