            <p>Chrysler Stevens-Mark's whƒÅnau posted on social media that he was at Evans Funeral home in Gisborne on Thursday, where a service was planned at 2pm for his friends "and the wider community that wish to pay their respects".</p>
        
            <p>"The whaanau will then take our boy home to the whaanau homestead where he will lay for two nights."</p>
        
            <p>That would be reserved for whaanau and close friends, they said.</p>

            <p>Stevens-Mark would then "make his final journey home" to Te Iti O Haua Marae in Waikato, where he will lie for one night before his burial on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a tangi for the second man who died in the fight, Kane Taare-Gray, was underway in Uawa Tolaga Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The police have laid serious assault charges against two men - a 25-year-old and a 29-year-old. But no one has been charged yet for the deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were admitted to hospital after the brawl, but just one remained on Thursday and was in a stable condition, Te Whatu Ora said.</p>
