            <p>Fire investigators and a police forensics team are examining a home in Whang훮rei where a man died in a suspicious house fire overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The house, on Thomas Street in Tikipunga, was cordoned off and under police guard on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A car was destroyed and a house damaged in the early morning blaze, reported at 3.09am.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters from Whang훮rei and Kamo extinguished the flames and located a man inside the house. He died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>At 4.55am, just over two hours later, firefighters were called to another car fire, just a couple of blocks away near the corner of Vinegar Hill Road and Harrison Drive. That vehicle had been parked on the roadside in a new subdivision.</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigators at the scene told RNZ they had confirmed the second car fire had been deliberately lit.</p>
        
            <p>The earlier house fire was also being treated as suspicious, the investigation still in its early stages.</p>
        
            <p>A specialist police forensic team was examining the house before it would be turned over to investigators Fire and Emergency NZ.</p>
        
            <p>It was not immediately clear if the fire had spread from the car to the house or vice versa.</p>
        
            <p>The K훮inga Ora home was still standing but damaged on one side, and fire had spread throughout the interior.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Al Symonds said the male occupant suffered critical injuries, and died despite the efforts of first responders.</p>
        
            <p>He said Tikipunga residents could expect to see an increased police presence on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police had already spoken to witnesses in the area at the time of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"A scene guard has been in place this morning while a scene examination was commenced, and this will remain in place today as our enquiries continue," Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem examination and formal identification of the victim would be completed in the coming days. Until then police could not release further details about the deceased, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Symonds urged anyone who was in the area at the time, or had information about the fires, to contact police as soon as possible. .</p>
