            <p>Four people have been killed in a crash on State Highway 5 near Rotorua</p>
        
            <p>Seven people were in the two cars involved in the collision at Whakarewarewa about 7.50pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Two people are still in hospital, one in critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police said three people died at the scene, while another was taken to hospital and died later.</p>
        
            <p>The circumstances leading up to the event were still being investigated, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua mayor Tania Tapsell said the stretch of SH5 where the crash occurred was not dangerous.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's why our communities in Rotorua feel so shocked about this," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a road that's used very often, we have a lot of people that travel for work around the region and around our communities, it's a very busy rural area.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just devastating to see that something has gone wrong."</p>
        
            <p>She described the deaths as tragic and sudden.</p>
        
            <p>"It just really is so sad to lose people so close to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Tapsell urged any drivers who felt tired on the road to pull over and have a rest.</p>
        
            <p>"We really just encourage you all to look after yourself, but the many other people travelling on the roads at this time too."</p>
