            <p>An investigation has been launched after a fire tore through the building that housed Tokora's Trees Tavern pub in Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were called to the blaze at about 2am on Sunday, where they found the derelict building to be "well involved" in fire.</p>
        
            <p>There were 13 fire trucks "ranging from Taupō to Ngāruawāhia" at the scene at one point.</p>
        
            <p>Tokoroa fire chief Dave Morris said given the size of the blaze and the requirements for regular swaps for crews using breathing apparatus, teams from across the central North Island were called upon.</p>
        
            <p>
Fire and Emergency NZ were called to the fire at about 1.51am on Sunday morning.

            <p>Once the fire had been contained, firefighters spent much of Sunday morning dampening down hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigators have attended the site, but the cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.</p>
