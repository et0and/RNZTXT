            <p>Police are looking through footage filmed at a 21st birthday party in Gisborne that left two dead and three injured.</p>
        
            <p>Chrysler Stevens-Mark and Kane Taare-Gray were killed during a 100 person brawl at the party on Lytton Road on 23 March.</p>
        
            <p>Investigators were making steady progress and have now spoken to most of those who were at the party, police said.</p>
        
            <p>They would continue to have officers in the area.</p>
        
            <p>They said police still wanted to hear from anyone who was at the party or anyone who had photos or videos.</p>
        
            <p>The police have laid serious assault charges against two men - a 25-year-old and a 29-year-old. No one has been charged yet for the deaths.</p>
