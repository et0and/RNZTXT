            <p>A teenage girl has been rescued by helicopter after falling from rocks at a popular Kerikeri swimming hole.</p>
        
            <p>The accident occurred at Charlie's Rock, on the Waipapa River, about 3.50pm.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokeswoman said the 15-year-old fell about six metres onto rocks, hurting her head and hips.</p>
        
            <p>The Northland Rescue Helicopter winched her out of the swimming hole, which is accessible only on foot, just before 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>She was airlifted to hospital. Her condition was not immediately known.</p>
        
            <p>A LandSAR search and rescue team was also sent to the area in case she needed to be carried out.</p>
        
            <p>A witness said the girl was intending to jump, hesitated, and fell down the rocks.</p>
        
            <p>She was conscious but complained of being unable to feel her legs, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Charlie's Rock is a deep swimming hole formed by a waterfall dropping over the edge of an ancient lava flow.</p>
        
            <p>A series of basalt columns about five to six metres above the water are popular jumping-off points but accidents have occurred in the past.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, a 20-year-old man drowned after he was believed to have hit his head on an underwater rock during a jump.</p>
        
            <p>Charlie's Rock, which is regarded as the best freshwater swimming spot in Kerikeri, is accessed via a 15-minute walking track along the river starting on Landing Road, near Waipapa Landing.</p>
