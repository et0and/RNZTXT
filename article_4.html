            <p>An argument between two motorists spiralled into a violent series of events, culminating in vehicle damage, threats and a liquor store robbery, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The incident began unfolding in Auckland's Glenfield on Thursday, when a 22-year-old man got in a "verbal altercation" with another driver.</p>
        
            <p>"The man ... then followed the victim's vehicle in his own car, throwing several items out of his window at the vehicle, including alcohol containers and a hockey stick, which damaged the vehicle," Waitematā east response manager acting senior sergeant Andy Godsalve said.</p>
        
            <p>"He continued to follow the victim's vehicle for several kilometres, causing them much concern."</p>
        
            <p>The man then drove to a Northcote liquor store and told the worker there that he had a knife, Godsalve said.</p>
        
            <p>From there, his actions allegedly grew more violent.</p>
        
            <p>"He picked up of bottle of alcohol and smashed it on the floor before allegedly stealing a further eight bottles of alcohol, worth over $400," Godsalve said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police were quickly on the scene, with officers witnessing the man pull a car jack tool from his pants and allegedly threaten the liquor store worker with it.</p>
        
            <p>"He was arrested as he exited the store with the alcohol, and later blew an excess breath alcohol reading of three times over the legal limit."</p>
        
            <p>The man has been charged with wilful damage, theft, threatening behaviour, possession of an offensive weapon, driving while disqualified, and driving with excess breath alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in the North Shore District Court on Friday and was due to reappear on 14 November.</p>
        
            <p>"The public has the right to feel safe, and I'm very happy the alleged offender will be held to account for his actions," Godsalve said.</p>
