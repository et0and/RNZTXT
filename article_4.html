            <p>An advocate for people affected by fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is welcoming a new qualification for frontline professionals, but says financial support for training is critical.</p>
        
            <p>The country's first microcredential qualification to meet the needs of people with FASD has been approved, as well as two associated skill standards.</p>
        
            <p>The neural disability is caused by pre-natal exposure to alcohol and is more prevalent than autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy combined.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 3000 babies are born a year with FASD in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>FASD Care Action Network chairperson Dr Leigh Henderson said she was "enthusiastic" about the "ground breaking news" as it would combat a lack of knowledge and understanding about the condition.</p>
        
            <p>It would also specifically address the needs of those affected, instead of treating all neurodiversities the same, she added.</p>
        
            <p>Henderson said "frontline professionals" - such as those working in sectors like social services, health, justice and education - feel under-educated about the disorder, and that can have a detrimental effect on those with it.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people have heard of it but they don't know what it means. Without that understanding, the expectations that are put on people with FASD, or lack of accommodation, can have a major detrimental affect on those individuals."</p>
        
            <p>The health minister's commitment to the FASD 2016-2019 action plan in April was welcome news, but it was essential this time the plan includes funded training for professionals, Henderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't happen previously - apart from the training we have provided as a charity. So we're really hoping there will be funding available through that action plan to support those initiatives."</p>
        
            <p>Training workshops previously run by the action network had generated "huge interest" with 200 people attending, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a real enthusiasm from professionals to understand about FASD, so hopefully there'll be significant uptake."</p>
        
            <p>Training was also important for the "wellbeing" of people with the condition, she added.</p>
        
            <p>"Without early and appropriate intervention they can have quite difficult life courses.</p>
        
            <p>"They have an increased risk of mental health, suicide, involvement in the justice system, addiction and homelessness.</p>
        
            <p>"So, that lack of understanding has a huge affect on broader society as well."</p>
