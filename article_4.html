            <p>The public is being asked to watch out for counterfeit money after four people were arrested for passing off fraudulent cash in Auckland on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A woman was found with $1200 worth of fake notes under her clothes along with two others who made purchases with the forgeries in Warkworth and Ōrewa, north Auckland on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā North Area senior sergeant Roger Small said the forged bank notes had allegedly been handed to staff, with legitimate currency being handed over as change.</p>
        
            <p>"All were sitting in the same parked vehicle in Warkworth, which we had identified as a vehicle of interest connected to earlier offending.</p>
        
            <p>"Of the five people in the vehicle, three were identified as having allegedly used counterfeit bills.</p>
        
            <p>"One occupant had $1200 worth of fake notes hidden in her undergarments."</p>
        
            <p>Two women, aged 33 and 25, are yet to be charged.</p>
        
            <p>A 37-year-old man has been charged with possessing a forged banknote and using a forged document. He will appear in the North Shore District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>The same day another man stole tobacco after a shopkeeper in Sunnyhills in east Auckland refused to accept a forged bill.</p>
        
            <p>Counties Manukau East Area Commander inspector Rod Honan said a man had allegedly tried to pay for "tobacco products" with a counterfeit note.</p>
        
            <p>He said the man fled the scene but was later located by the Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>After making follow-up enquiries at an address in Pakuranga, the suspected vehicle arrived on the scene, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We signalled for the driver to stop but he took off at speed, and we decided not to pursue due to the manner of driving.</p>
        
            <p>"The police Eagle helicopter was able to locate this vehicle and direct police staff to it in Māngere.</p>
        
            <p>"We also found a firearm in the back of this vehicle," Honan said.</p>
        
            <p>The 33-year-old man has been charged with unlawfully carrying or possessing a firearm, restricted weapon or explosives and failing to remain stopped for an enforcement officer. He is to appear in the Manukau District Court today.</p>
