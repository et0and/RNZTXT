            <p>Pharmac says introducing a new ADHD medicine and removing the renewal criteria for another would help benefit 13,000 people in five years.</p>
        
            <p>It is seeking feedback on funding the drug lisdexamfetamine, known as Vyvanse, and to scrap the renewal criteria for stimulant medicines used in ADHD treatment by 1 December.</p>
        
            <p>Director of advice and assessment Dr David Hughes said more than 6000 people will benefit from this in the first year.</p>
        
            <p>"Funding lisdexamfetamine would be a great addition to the ADHD treatment options already available and would help alleviate the supply shortages that are causing stress and frustration for a number of people."</p>
        
            <p>The medicines looking to have their renewal criterias axed include methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and modafinil, which were all also used for narcolepsy.</p>
        
            <p>Patients needed a specialist doctor's input every two years so they could continue having these medicines funded for them.</p>
        
            <p>For children, they needed to visit their doctor once a year to continue their access.</p>
        
            <p>For patients, the scrapping of the renewal would mean on 1 December, those already on a stimulant treatment would be given an approval that did not require a special doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Hughes said the current process had caused a lot of obstacles for patients.</p>
        
            <p>"People have told us about the difficulty of waiting for specialist appointments, dealing with the costs of appointments, and then having to wait for reassessments to come through before their current approval expires.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this is stressful for many people, and we are keen to make the process easier."</p>
        
            <p>The proposed changes were something ADHD NZ spokesperson Darrin Bull saw as a huge win.</p>
        
            <p>"For some time access to diagnosis and medication has been difficult for many people with ADHD. This proposal is a significant step forward that will enable the ADHD community to thrive. It's great that Pharmac continues to be responsive to the needs of those with ADHD."</p>
        
            <p>Co-convener of ADHD policy group Aroreretini Aotearoa Kent Duston also shared that excitement, saying it was a huge deal for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Not having to renew access to stimulant medications every two years will make a huge difference to the quality of life for many people with ADHD and will lift some of the burden on frontline medical teams across the country," Duston said.</p>
        
            <p>The consolation period started Thursday for both lisdexamfetamine and the renewal changes.</p>
        
            <p>The period for the public to have their say on lisdexamfetamine closed on 26 September while feedback for the renewal proposal ended on 3 October.</p>
