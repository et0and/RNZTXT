            <p>A horse owner - whose mare had to be put down due to catastrophic injuries caused by fireworks - says the private sale of fireworks must be banned.</p>
        
            <p>Remi, a 14-year-old retired race horse, became entangled in a fence after being spooked by fireworks near her Tauranga paddock.</p>
        
            <p>The mare's injuries were so severe, she had to be euthanised.</p>
        
            <p>Owner Donna Matherson told Checkpoint people had driven up her rural road and started to party at about 10.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>"I went out to my horses to check and they had started running because I don't know if there's something different this year but the fireworks were so loud and the ones that exploded in the sky, it was like sheet lightning."</p>

            <p>Matherson thought she had calmed the horses and went back to bed after midnight thinking things were over but got a phone call on Thursday morning from a neighbour.</p>
        
            <p>"She (Remi) had gone through a fence, pretty much ripped her foot off and there was no saving her...she lost pretty much all of her blood," Matherson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been one of the most probably horrendous 24 hours I've ever had to deal with - that bad."</p>
        
            <p>Matherson said Remi went through a big transition from being a racehorse to becoming a horse her kids could ride.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of love and time goes into that relationship and to see such a brutal end is, I'll never unsee it, I'll never unfeel it, it just rips your soul to pieces really."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was not against public displays of fireworks but wanted a ban on black sales.</p>
        
            <p>"I get that we all love different things and I'm not asking for a ban on anything, I'm just asking for a black sales ban."</p>
        
            <p>People don't see the consequences of their actions when using fireworks, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They don't get to see my horse ripped to pieces, tangled in a fence and gate and knee deep and blood, they just had a few sparkles in the sky and thought life's good."</p>
        
            <p>Another of her horses will never be ridden again because of fireworks.</p>
        
            <p>"He didn't lose his life but he lost his chance of a good life."</p>
