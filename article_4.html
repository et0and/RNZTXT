            <p>A large vegetation fire in the South Island's Waitaki District has been contained after spreading rapidly earlier today.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand Incident Commander Bobby Lamont said that earlier Saturday, the fire flared up with flames reaching six to eight metres.</p>
        
            <p>"Then around 1pm, rain forced our three ground crews working with hand tools to stop work," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Air operations were also stood down due to weather.</p>
        
            <p>"Rain and cooler weather has helped to suppress the fire and a late afternoon flyover found no evidence of smoke or hotspots."</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said all firefighting operations have ended for the day.</p>
        
            <p>"The land owner will monitor the fire ground overnight and crews will be back at 6.30am tomorrow morning to continue operations."</p>
        
            <p>The vegetation fire started yesterday around midday and burned through 806 hectares of farmland, tussock and scrub.</p>
        
            <p>Strong winds had been forecast for the region by MetService.</p>
