            <p>A former Auckland council building inspector and a company director are facing charges for bribery and corruption.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has filed 21 charges of corruption and bribery against Nicholas Bright, claiming he received cash bribes and other benefits as a building inspector between 2018 and 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland building company director - who has interim name suppression - faces 23 charges of corruption and bribery of an official.</p>
        
            <p>The defendants appeared at Manukau District Court today, where the company director pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Bright did not enter a plea and will reappear in court next month.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council referred the case to the SFO after carrying out its own investigations.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigating potential corruption of public officials, particularly where health and safety may be compromised, is one of the SFO's current strategic areas of focus," said SFO director Karen Chang.</p>
