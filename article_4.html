            <p>Firefighters from seven brigades have been working to extinguish a house fire in Oakleigh, south of Whangārei, on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency's Northland manager, Wipari Henwood, said all the occupants of the home had been accounted for, but the house was a total loss.</p>
        
            <p>The fire had been challenging because the house was up a steep driveway and there was a stand of bush at the rear of the property, close to a petrol station on State Highway 1, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency advised drivers just south of Oakleigh to expect delays, and take extra care.</p>
        
            <p>It was likely to take several hours before the fire was extinguished, Henwood said.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation into the cause had begun.</p>
