            <p>Surf Lifesaving New Zealand is urging beachgoers to take extra care as the summer's beach surf lifeguard patrols wind down across the country.</p>

            <p>Volunteer surf lifeguards will continue patrolling beaches during weekends and on public holidays until Easter.</p>
        
            <p>National coastal safety manager Tom Kearny said it was more critical than ever that swimmers carefully assess the conditions before entering the water.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of people who get into trouble, in the water, at the beach, they tend to overestimate their ability and underestimate the conditions. They also tend to not have a very good understanding or concept of the risks that are involved and the hazards that are present, on the beach and in the water," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Between July 2023 and June 2024, 42 people lost their lives on our coastline - each one is a tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"As surf lifesaving wraps up for the summer, we urge everyone who's going to the beach just to check the conditions - when they get there, take a couple of minutes make sure they understand what the water's doing. If they're in any doubt at all, just don't get in - stay out."</p>
