            <p>LandSAR and Police SAR were searching the area today, detective inspector Graham Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland woman was with a group setting bait lines in the Pureroa Forest before she went missing Saturday, 23 March.</p>
        
            <p>The woman is described as of medium height, slim build and has grey hair.</p>
        
            <p>She was last seen wearing trail-type shoes, black pants, and possibly a silver jacket.</p>
        
            <p>Hunters and trampers who were in the area on 23 and 24 March are asked to call police.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to remind any hunters or trampers who are planning to be around this area, during the start of the deer hunting roar session, to be extra vigilant due to the increase of people searching in the area," Pitkethley said.</p>
