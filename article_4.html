            <p>Prayers were led in several different faiths before reflections and the the dropping of pōhutukawa flowers into the ocean.</p>
        
            <p>At noon, the families, along with dignitaries including Mitchell, Chambers and Whakatāne mayor Victor Luca, will meet at Te Mānuka Tūtahi Marae for a pōwhiri.</p>

            <p>At 2.11pm - the time Whakaari began to erupt five years ago - there will be a minute's silence followed by speeches, after which the families will be given an opportunity to speak.</p>
        
            <p>At 4pm, a design for a new memorial at the heads will be unveiled by Harawira's brother, sculptor Peter Harawira.</p>
