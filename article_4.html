            <p>An Auckland school wrestling team is "devastated" after their brand new uniforms were stolen earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>To add insult to injury, the team from MƒÅngere's De La Salle College is competing in the national championships on Friday and it was to be the first time they wore the uniforms they had raised $5000 to get.</p>
        
            <p>The gear was in a box inside one of the coach's cars which was stolen from New Lynn on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police found the car abandoned afternoon in Clendon Park that afternoon, but the uniforms were gone.</p>
        
            <p>Wrestling coach Natahlya Va'ai told Checkpoint the team were disappointed and upset when they found out about the missing uniforms.</p>
        
            <p>The team had only been formed four months ago. In that time, they had won 21 medals at competitions, making their way to the national championships.</p>
        
            <p>Va'ai said they had tried to get sponsorships, fundraised, and used money from their own pockets to fund the uniforms, costing about $5000.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't easy and now it's all gone. We've got nothing left."</p>
        
            <p>The team had used borrowed gear for the first two competitions and were looking forward to wearing their own uniforms on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Va'ai said they had not even had the chance to print the school crest on the blue and red uniforms before they were taken.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just really hoping someone with a good conscience comes to realise the impact of their actions and that they return these uniforms for the boys."</p>
        
            <p>Va'ai asked that whoever had the uniforms - and accompanying shoes - return them to make the team feel more empowered in representing their school.</p>
        
            <p>But gear or no gear, she said the boys would still go out there on Friday and represent their school well.</p>
        
            <p>Va'ai said they were determined to win, feeling confident and "very resilient".</p>
        
            <p>"They're confident, I'm confident that they will come away with some medals tomorrow."</p>
