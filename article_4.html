            <p>A man has died after getting into trouble in the water, in the eastern Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Police said people noticed a man struggling in the water at Omaio, brought him to shore, and started CPR about 12.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police, fire and ambulance were called to the settlement on State Highway 35 about 50km northeast of Ōpōtiki, and continued CPR but efforts to resuscitate the man were unsuccessful and he died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>St John said a rescue helicopter, rapid response vehicle and two ambulances had been sent to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The man's death will be referred to the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third suspected beach drowning in the current holiday period.</p>
        
            <p>A woman died on 31 December while snorkelling at Bland Bay, on Northland's Whangaruru Peninsula; and on Christmas Eve, a 37-year-old woman died at remote Waimamaku Beach, southwest of Kaitāia, reportedly while saving her daughter and a nephew from a rip.</p>
