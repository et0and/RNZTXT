            <p>Outdoor fires will no longer be allowed in the Wellington district from tomorrow morning.</p>
        
            <p>The Hutt Valley, Wellington, Porirua and Kapiti Coast zones will all be placed into a prohibited fire season from 8am.</p>
        
            <p>A prohibited fire season means no open-air fires are allowed and all fire permits are suspended.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand said that the recent dry, hot and windy weather has caused grass, gorse, scrub and pine to dry out across the region.</p>
        
            <p>Community risk manager Phil Soal said this meant wildfires will be more difficult to control and extinguish.</p>
        
            <p>"While there has been rain in the region over the past few days, it hasn't been enough to alleviate the fire danger," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important people remain vigilant and understand the fire danger risks. I encourage people to go to checkitsalright.nz for fire safety advice."</p>
