            <p>A person is dead after a crash in Balclutha late on Friday night, the seventh fatality on our roads since Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Several other people have also been injured in crashes on both main islands, which has led to the closure or partial closure of more than one state highway.</p>
        
            <p>Police were also responding to a workplace incident south of Christchurch about 11.30am. Further details aren't immediately available but it's understood the incident in Glasseys Rd, Southbridge, may be transport-related.</p>
        
            <p>One person was critically injured in a Marlborough crash just after midnight, and two others seriously injured in crashes on Saturday morning, one in the Far North and the other in South Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Eight bobby calves were also killed when they were struck on a Coromandel Peninsula highway just before 6am.</p>
        
            <p>The Far North crash occurred near Rangiahua Rd, Hōreke, about 9.20am and had closed a section of SH1, with diversions in place, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial indications suggest there are serious injuries. The Serious Crash Unit has been advised... motorists are advised to avoid the area and expect delays."</p>
        
            <p>Three ambulances and a rescue helicopter were sent to help, with one person taken to Whangārei Base Hospital with serious injuries, a Hato Hone St John Ambulance spokesman said.</p>
        
            <p>The section of SH1 closed is in the Mangamuka Gorge area and had reopened on Thursday after being closed for more than two years for major repairs, a reader told the Herald.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-five minutes after the Far North crash, emergency services were called to rural South Canterbury where three people had been injured in a three-vehicle crash at the intersection of SH1 and SH79 in Rangitata.</p>
        
            <p>Three ambulances were sent, with a seriously injured person taken to Christchurch Hospital and two others - one with moderate injuries and the other with minor injuries - taken to Timaru Hospital, the Hato Hone St John Ambulance spokesman said.</p>
        
            <p>SH79 was partially blocked and traffic management is in place, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are advised to take care around the area and expect delays."</p>
        
            <p>Saturday morning's fatal South Island crash involved one vehicle and took place just after 10.30am on Balclutha's Gormack St, between Moir St and Barnego Rd, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"The sole occupant died at the scene. The Serious Crash Unit responded, and Gormack St will remain closed until mid-to-late afternoon while the scene is investigated.</p>
        
            <p>"Inquiries into the cause of the crash are ongoing."</p>
        
            <p>In Marlborough, police were called to the intersection of Chaytors and Neal roads at Spring Creek, 6km north of Blenheim, about 12.15am. They were told a vehicle had rolled.</p>
        
            <p>"The sole occupant of the car received critical injuries and was transported to hospital. The Serious Crash Unit has carried out a scene examination and inquiries into the crash are ongoing."</p>
        
            <p>And just before 6am, police were told a vehicle had struck a herd of bobby calves on State Highway 25, near the intersection of Kapowai Rd, just outside Coromandel Peninsula settlement of Coroglen, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Bobby calves are calves younger than 30 days old, and not with their mothers.</p>
        
            <p>"Eight calves were killed and one was injured. The highway was shut while the scene was cleared, however, it reopened by 8am."</p>
