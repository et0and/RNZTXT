            <p>A shopper has described the terrifying moment a knife was pulled out during an altercation at Auckland's Westfield Newmarket this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they attended a disorder incident involving a group of youths on Broadway, Newmarket about 2.25pm.</p>
        
            <p>A knife was presented during the incident, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police spoke with the youths and seized the knife."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they are continuing to make inquiries into the matter.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald has approached Westfield for comment.</p>
        
            <p>One shopper, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Herald they entered the mall with their partner before seeing about eight teenage boys fighting outside of Woolworths.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw one kid who was barefoot and he was holding a knife. He was walking towards that group fighting.</p>
        
            <p>"It was really scary," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the boy was wearing a hoodie but he was visibly holding a knife at his side.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously nobody attempted to stop them because it was really rowdy at there was a knife involved... We left to avoid the situation."</p>
        
            <p>They said three security personnel attempted to de-escalate the situation.</p>
        
            <p>"They were outnumbered, there was too many youths.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw three security people and one of them were trying to stop the fight and two others were calling for help," they said.</p>
