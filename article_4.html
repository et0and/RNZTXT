            <p>Ponsonby Road businesses are looking to fund their own extra security guards after a fatal shooting on the street.</p>
        
            <p>Police are searching for Hone Kay-Selwyn, 31, who they believe shot one person dead on Ponsonby Road on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>He has been on the run since and police say he is extremely dangerous and should not be approached.</p>

            <p>Detective Inspector Barry said it was believed the alleged gunman had been denied access to a bar on Ponsonby Road as staff were preparing to close for the night.</p>
        
            <p>Ponsonby Social Club owner Bobby Mukai said some venue owners on the street have started a conversation to see what could be done.</p>
        
            <p>He said police presence was needed on the street.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe New Zealand police is very good, does an amazing job but I think that maybe a few people just kind of patrolling perhaps.</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe a bit more security cameras, more lighting [on the] streets, things that can keep it safe."</p>

            <p>Mukai said he did not want people going out for dinner or a drink to feel unsafe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so sad but I think that all we can do is work around it and to keep everybody safe."</p>
