            <p>The war for supremacy over our cousins from across the ditch has a new battleground - tap water.</p>
        
            <p>Four New Zealand district council's are vying for the title of New Zealand's Best Tasting Tap Water and the honour of taking on their Australian counterpart for the first-ever Trans-Tasman title.</p>
        
            <p>Matamata-Piako (Tills Road), Rotorua Lakes (Karamu Springs), Central Hawke's Bay (Tikokino Road), and Kāpiti Coast (Rangiuru, Ōtaki) are in the New Zealand grand final which is being judged on Thursday at the Water Industry Operations Group (WIOG) conference in New Plymouth.</p>
        
            <p>The winner will go head to head with TasWater's Fern Tree plant of Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>WIOG chairperson Joshua McIndoe said the IXOM National Water Taste Test was a fun way to raise awareness about the quality of New Zealand's drinking water, and recognise the efforts of water operators and their teams to deliver water services to their communities.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty prestigious. You get the bragging rights for the following year as the best tasting water in the country and it's built up in popularity and is beginning to get a lot of attention, so it's definitely a title everyone wants to get."</p>

            <p>McIndoe said 18 water supplies - both bore and surface collected from the north and south islands - competed and were blind tested and rated according to the "Water Tasting Wheel".</p>
        
            <p>"The wheel outlines some of the attributes water professionals use when assessing water. Think 'wine tasting' without needing to spit and you won't be far wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"It's judged on clarity, colour, smell and odour, but the main one is taste. So, you want a good pleasant taste. It can be subjective, but every year there is always a clear winner."</p>
        
            <p>He thought the Trans-Tasman title would be a close call.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got all confidence that New Zealand's going to take it out, but it could go to either. The judges aren't going to know which is which and they're going to be sampling it exactly the same way, so fingers crossed."</p>
        
            <p>Matamata-Piako District Council operations manager Chris Gledhill was one of those hoping to be the New Zealand representative in the Trans-Tasman contest.</p>
        
            <p>"For us being in the New Zealand grand final is quite a big thing being quite a small town. So, the sample we entered has actually come from one of our supplies on the Kaimais, but yeah I think it's quite a big deal for our council to be recognised for all their hard efforts."</p>
        
            <p>Gledhill was humble when asked about the qualities of Matamata-Piako tap water.</p>

            <p>"Water source definitely does make a difference and coming off the Kaimais it is quite a clean supply unless it's raining, of course, then it turns to dirt.</p>
        
            <p>"Look we are providing a safe product for our customers, but when it comes to being something special, it's probably no more special than anybody else's. You know, it's a good product and we're 100 percent compliant with the new regulations."</p>
        
            <p>Water Industry Operations Australia representative Glenn Alford was a guest judge at the National Water Taste Test.</p>
        
            <p>He said the two nations were fortunate to enjoy great, safe water.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very similar I would say. Australian water is obviously much nicer and much cleaner but I have to say that. But no, it's very similar. Australia's the same as here different areas you go to, different regions, and the water will taste a little different."</p>
        
            <p>Alford would not be involved in picking the Trans-Tasman winner, but rated the Kiwi finalists highly.</p>
        
            <p>"The four finalists were very, very good, but I know the TasWater sample from the Fern Tree plant was amazing. It won our national competition and we actually sent it over to American for an international competition, so we're quietly confident."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Best Tasting Tap Water will be announced at 7.30pm and the Trans-Tasman title will be decided immediately afterwards.</p>
