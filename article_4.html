            <p>MetService says heavy rain and thunderstorms hit eastern Bay of Plenty on Tuesday morning, with 12mm falling in Whakatane inside of an hour.</p>
        
            <p>The forecaster said storms are moving fairly quickly, with the heaviest remaining offshore for now, and should ease by 9am.</p>
        
            <p>The rain was expected to continue in lower North Island and upper South Island, as unsettled weather lingered.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said it would be a soggy afternoon in the eastern parts of Wellington, more fine in the west.</p>
        
            <p>There was a snowfall warning in the Lewis Pass until late Tuesday afternoon, and there was expected to be light rains in Marlborough and Canterbury that night.</p>
        
            <p>Fog in Northland, Auckland and Waikato will clear and be followed by showers.</p>
        
            <p>The western areas of the country should get some sunshine until Friday, but with strong winds in the West Coast, Tasman, Nelson and the Manawatū.</p>
        
            <p>The weekend is looking on the wet side, especially for the North Island and upper South Island, with the potential for heavy rain for some of those areas.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said the southeasterly wind should be responsible for the rain and low temperature during the day.</p>
