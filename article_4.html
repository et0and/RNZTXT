            <p>Look, up in the sky - it's a bird, and if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it might just be coming for you.</p>
        
            <p>It is the time of year where rampaging raptors are causing havoc along some popular walkways.</p>
        
            <p>There have been several falcon or Karearea attacks, the most recent on a track at Pareora Gorge near Timaru where a man was left with a bloodied after being clawed by a swooping bird.</p>
        
            <p>There have also been incidents in Rotorua and Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>Ron Lindsay is from the New Zealand Raptor Trust, which looks after sick and injured hawks, falcons and owls.</p>
        
            <p>These imposing birds could pack quite a punch when they were angry or scared, though, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are dinosaurs. They're basically still dinosaurs."</p>
        
            <p>He told Checkpoint that in the end, the raptors were just following their instincts during nesting season.</p>
        
            <p>"They're just doing what they've always done, protecting the youngsters.</p>
        
            <p>"And when you look at it in perspective, we've moved into their territory, they haven't moved into ours. They were here before we were."</p>
        
            <p>Most animals were pretty territorial about their children, he noted.</p>
        
            <p>"You wouldn't go and pat a lioness's cubs when she was sitting there, would you?"</p>
        
            <p>A full-grown falcon or hawk can cause a lot of damage to the unwary.</p>
        
            <p>"These birds, if they're diving at full speed, they can move at about 200km/h.</p>
        
            <p>"So if you walk into their territory they're gonna come at you pretty fast and it is very daunting."</p>
        
            <p>Lindsay has had birds swoop at him, and said with their sharp talons, it was best to avoid conflict.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're upsetting them, they mean business, so try not to brass them off."</p>
        
            <p>The Raptor Trust helps rehabilitate wounded hawks, falcons and other birds and is just about to release their one hundredth harrier hawk, Lindsay said.</p>
        
            <p>There are also several other groups around the country also helping endangered birds and raptors.</p>
        
            <p>More and more birds are moving into urban areas, raising the chances of incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"They adapt really quickly."</p>
        
            <p>When he worked in Wānaka, "they were attacking everything that moved - dogs, cats, people."</p>
        
            <p>Locals there cleared a big area and left it just to the birds to nest during the season, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, if you are a tramper in raptor territory, there is not always a lot of warning.</p>
        
            <p>"Unless there are signs up you probably won't know until you find this bullet coming toward you.</p>
        
            <p>"It's time to pack up and run. Just get out of the way. Don't try to go through the area.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't take a stick and try to hit them off or anything like that.</p>
        
            <p>"These birds are actually endangered, so if you injure one of the parents it means the chances of the chicks actually being raised become a lot less."</p>
        
            <p>'Run away' may not seem like the best advice, but it is key to allow humans and birds to live together.</p>
        
            <p>"Let them do their things, they're going to be there a couple of months and then move on," Lindsay said. </p>
        
            <p>The nesting season starts around now, typically, and will last through the summer.</p>
