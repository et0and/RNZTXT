            <p>A man who allegedly stole a week's worth of dinners from the front door step of a home in Auckland has been arrested by police.</p>
        
            <p>The victim made a 105 report on Sunday after realising their food shopping had been taken from their home on Lisle Farm Drive in Pukekohe, said Counties Manukau area commander Inspector Joe Hunter.</p>
        
            <p>"The offending was recorded by home security cameras and the investigation team quickly identified the man.</p>
        
            <p>"The team then executed a search warrant at his home address and arrested him, charging him with burglary.</p>
        
            <p>"During the search warrant, the male in fact was allegedly in the process of eating the evidential material."</p>
        
            <p>The 40-year-old man will appear in Pukekohe District Court on Tuesday charged with burglary.</p>
        
            <p>The Pukekohe Tactical Crime Unit had been investigating a number of parcel thefts in the area and the report, along with CCTV, helped identify the alleged offender, said Hunter.</p>
        
            <p>He said people could protect themselves from mail theft by sending parcels to a work address or ensuring they were home when parcels arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Other tips included, clearing out letterboxes in a timely manner, putting a hold on mail delivery if away, providing clear delivery instructions for couriers to leave a package safely hidden or secured within the property, installing security cameras, and where practical considering click and collect over delivery.</p>
