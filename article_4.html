            <p>An Auckland liquor importer and a distributor have been fined $244,000 for trying to sell alcohol without legitimate bottle labels.</p>
        
            <p>Importer Golden Grand Trading Limited and distributor Mayajaal Holdings Limited supplied more than 5000 bottles of illegal liquor to retailers between 2016 and 2019, the Ministry for Primary Industries said.</p>
        
            <p>The liquor, which had a retail value of $292,526, was seized by New Zealand Food Safety investigators from their distribution warehouse.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 30 bottles sold by retailers were recalled and seven were seized from stores and another two from an online purchase.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director Vincent Arbuckle said the importers bought non-compliant bottles to cut costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigators found the importers bought thousands of bottles of liquor with lot codes removed and that it was cheaper - by nearly 7.5 percent."</p>
        
            <p>Arbuckle said lot codes, which are laser-etched into glass bottles or printed on a label, ensure traceability in case of a product recall and assure consumers the product is genuine.</p>

            <p>"In this case, a sample of the liquor was tested and showed that the product was genuine, but that does not excuse the offending.</p>
        
            <p>"When we find evidence of non-compliance, such as lot codes being tampered with, we will take action, including removing products from shelves, and in serious cases, placing the offending before the courts."</p>
        
            <p>The companies were sentenced in the Auckland District Court in April following prosecution by New Zealand Food Safety.</p>
        
            <p>Golden Grand Trading Limited was fined $142,000 and Mayajaal Holdings Limited was fined $102,000.</p>
        
            <p>Both companies were ordered to share costs of $36,000 for disposal of the alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>The sentencing is part of a wider Ministry for Primary Industries compliance investigation called "Operation Spirit".</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, another Auckland liquor importing company was fined more than $150,000 for a similar offence.</p>
