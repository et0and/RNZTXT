            <p>State Highway 3 - Ōhaupō Road just north of Te Awamutu in Waikato was closed due to a crash involving a car and a tractor near Te Rahu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Just three weeks ago five people died in what police called a horrendous two-vehicle crash on Ōhaupō Road.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the crash on Friday about 4.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said one person was trapped in the car when they arrived, but they managed to get them out.</p>
        
            <p>It's not yet clear whether anyone is injured.</p>
        
            <p>St John has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said the road was blocked, and diversions were in place.</p>
        
            <p>In an update around 6.30pm NZ TRansport Agency said the road was open again, however, motorists should expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>FINAL UPDATE - 6:25PMAll lanes are now OPEN on #SH3 between Ngaroto Rd and Racecourse Rd north of Te Awamutu. Allow extra time for delays to ease. ^JF https://t.co/g80E99VX7N</p>
