        <h2>Manawatū and Tararua highway: numbers don't add up, mayor says</h2>
        <p>
"The vehicle numbers do not stack up from previous use and do not reflect real data," Tararua District mayor Tracey Collis says.

            <p>Highway numbers used for tolls don't add up, mayor says</p>

            <p>A key number in determining if a lower North Island highway is suitable for tolls is under question.</p>
        
            <p>Public consultation is open on plans to impose a charge on motorists using the new highway between Manawatū and Tararua, expected to open mid next year.</p>
        
            <p>The plan to charge motorists $4.30 and trucks $8.60 a trip has come under heavy criticism from people in surrounding areas, who have waited years for the new highway to open.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Transport Agency has released its tolling assessment for the new road under the Official Information Act. It includes a section on compliance under "legislative requirements and  practicality test".</p>
        
            <p>One of these requires that, for a road under consideration for tolling, "not less than 10,000 vehicles are likely to travel the road per day".</p>
        
            <p>Transport agency modelling forecasts 10,902 vehicles a day using the road in 2025, rising to 14,250 a day in in 2048.</p>
        
            <p>But the figure of 10,902 requires a huge increase from the traffic counts available and Tararua District mayor Tracey Collis says the transport agency's number don't add up.</p>
        
            <p>When the old State Highway 3 through the Manawatū Gorge closed in 2017 due to rockfall, it carried 7600 vehicles, including 1100 trucks a day.</p>
        
            <p>A traffic count provided to RNZ from 2019 showed 5565 vehicles used the alternative Saddle Road on a particular day, and 1944 used fellow alternative the Pahīatua Track. Of those 7509 vehicles, about 11 to 12 percent were trucks.</p>
        
            <p>And 2023 figures showed 6000 vehicles a day on the Saddle Road, which included many construction vehicles for the new road.</p>

            <p>The 10,902 figure is a 43 percent increase on 2017 traffic volumes and Collis has cast doubt on it.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle numbers do not stack up from previous use and do not reflect real data. They have been made up to match a tolling policy so they could get it over the line with a minimum of 10,000 vehicles needed," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"To imagine 11,000 vehicles would equate to 458 vehicles per hour or 7.6 per minute. Anyone who has travelled our roads will have an image of how unrealistic those numbers are."</p>
        
            <p>Labour transport spokesman and Palmerston North MP Tangi Utikere also said the 10,902 estimate was questionable.</p>
        
            <p>"Where's the data they've used to base these figures on?"</p>
        
            <p>"One of the concerns is it's certainly not fair to be releasing this information midway through a process," he said of the public consultation on the proposed toll, which closes on 7 October.</p>
        
            <p>"People could have already made a submission and not been aware of potential issues with the figures."</p>
        
            <p>The other three criteria the road satisfied, according to the assessment, were that it's a new route or a significant upgrade, that there's a "feasible free alternative", and that tolling infrastructure can be installed in a cost-effective way.</p>
        
            <p>Under the requirement that at least 10,000 vehicles a day use the road, the assessment said: "This is a test that may be indicative of the likely viability of the toll road, but may be taken into consideration with other criteria."</p>
        
            <p>Collis said the road wasn't new. It was a replacement for the old state highway, which shut. She also called into question that the alternative routes were feasible, saying they weren't safe or built for high traffic volumes.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked the transport agency about its modelling to produce the 10,902 figure and when it last took a traffic count on the alternative routes.</p>
