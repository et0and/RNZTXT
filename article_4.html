            <p>More train services are expected to be cancelled in Wellington this evening and Wednesday due to industrial action by rail staff.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday union staff began instigating work-to-rule industrial action ahead of contract talks, which are expected to take place on 26 September.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of industrial action, eight Metlink train services were cancelled today between 12am and 12pm, seven of which were replaced by buses," Metlink spokesperson Samantha Gain said.</p>
        
            <p>"During that time, two services were part bus replaced between Trentham and Upper Hutt."</p>
        
            <p>Gain said with more cancellations expected this evening a limited number of buses were on standby at Wellington Station to replace the cancelled services.</p>
        
            <p>"Tomorrow, we expect the 6.20am and the 6.47am Wairarapa Line services from Masterton to be bus replaced because of the industrial action," Gain said.</p>
        
            <p>More cancellations are expected to be announced tomorrow.</p>
