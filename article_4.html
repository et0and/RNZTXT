            <p>A toroa chick has died after eating plastic at the Royal Albatross Centre at Taiaroa Head, near Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-day old northern royal albatross swallowed soft plastic that had been regurgitated by its parent.</p>
        
            <p>The plastic was found blocking its intestinal tract after it died at the Dunedin Wildlife Hospital last month.</p>

            <p>Department of Conservation biodiversity ranger Sharyn Broni said it was the first death of its kind at the Taiaroa Head colony, but rangers had feared something like this could happen after other close calls in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>"The parent will have picked up the plastic while foraging at sea and then regurgitated it for the chick, which unfortunately has blocked the digestive system," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This heartbreaking incident is a reminder it's vital to dispose of plastic rubbish carefully. People can also help by picking up litter they see on beaches, near waterways, or out on the ocean. Every piece you pick up could save a seabird's life."</p>
        
            <p>In May 2021, a 9cm-long plastic pony toy, which had been regurgitated by a parent, was found in a chick's nest. Fortunately in that case the chick did not swallow it, Broni said.</p>
        
            <p>"DOC staff found plastic in almost all the toroa chick regurgitations checked last season. The most common plastics seen were bottlecaps, however items like a plastic syringe were also found.</p>
        
            <p>"Plastic pollution is a significant threat facing our seabirds like toroa, because they can mistake floating plastic for food and eat it. Algae can grow on the plastic, making it smell like food and can encourage the birds to eat it.</p>
        
            <p>"As well as being a risk for chicks, it can also kill adult birds because it sits in the stomach and they can't digest it, causing dehydration or starvation."</p>
        
            <p>Te P≈çari a Pukekura chairperson Nadia Wesley-Smith said every piece of plastic discarded had an impact on the delicate balance of our environment.</p>
        
            <p>"The devastating death of this albatross chick serves as a poignant reminder our actions, no matter how small, can have profound consequences not only on the mauri of Pukekura and the toroa that live there, but also on the world around us."</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Wildlife Hospital director Lisa Argilla said vets were distressed that plastic was the cause of death of this toroa chick.</p>
        
            <p>"The soft but very tough plastic was discovered at necropsy and had caused an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract, which ultimately led to starvation and organ failure.</p>
        
            <p>"We echo the call from DOC to please dispose of plastic carefully. Even better would be to try to limit how much plastic you use and therefore reduce waste."</p>
        
            <p>Toroa, one of the largest seabirds in the world, had a conservation status of "nationally vulnerable".</p>
