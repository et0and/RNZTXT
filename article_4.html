            <p>Immigration New Zealand granted study visas to a record 19,860 children of foreign workers in the past financial year.</p>
        
            <p>About 13,000 were for children studying at primary or intermediate schools.</p>
        
            <p>The number of study visas granted to the dependents of work visa-holders has jumped sharply, from fewer than 10,000-a-year prior to the start of the pandemic in 2020 to nearly 17,000 in 2022-23 and almost 20,000 in 2023-34.</p>
        
            <p>Schools have told RNZ the sudden growth has put pressure on classroom space and their ability to support English-language learners.</p>
        
            <p>Immigration figures showed 4247 of last year's visas were for secondary school students, and about 2600 did not specify a level of schooling.</p>
        
            <p>It said dependents' study visas were usually valid for the same period as their caregiver's work visa. Work visas were valid for 12 months for lower-skilled workers, up to three years for mid-skilled workers, and five years for higher-skilled workers.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Immigration NZ approved study visas for 22,652 fee-paying foreign students and 4874 English-language students in 2023-24.</p>
        
            <p>The figures showed 5784 of the fee-paying student visas were for school students and 9305 for university students.</p>
        
            <p>A further 2920 visas were for students enrolled with polytechnics and 4176 for students at private training providers.</p>
