        <p>

            <p>
Hastings District Council said the Level 2 water restrictions applied to all homes that source water from public supplies in Napier City and Hastings.

            <p>Water restrictions are now in place in Hawke's Bay, meaning residents are limited on how and when they can water their grass.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council said the Level 2 water restrictions - which limit hose and sprinkler use - applied to all homes that source water from public supplies in Napier City and Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>Monday's move meant sprinkler and hose usage would be limited to every second day and between certain hours - permitted between 6am and 8am and 7pm and 9pm, with odd-numbered homes restricted to odd dates and even-numbered homes on even dates.</p>
        
            <p>The council said water reserves would be monitored, and it was likely Waimārama would follow suit before Christmas. It hoped introducing water restrictions now would prevent the need for greater limits over summer.</p>
