            <p>Hamilton Logan is well on his way to walking 100 kilometres in his 100th year for charity - inspired by the feat of UK centenarian Captain Tom Moore during the 2020 Covid lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Logan is raising money for the Hawke's Bay Rescue Helicopter, St John and the Rural Support Trust. You can donate via the Hawke's Bay Foundation website. Starting on 1 January, so far he has walked 62km - well ahead of schedule for his birthday on 21 November.</p>

            <p>Clinical psychologist Meg Jay has worked with 20-somethings for 25 years. The years between 20 and 30 are when people are most likely to feel anxious, depressed and struggle with substances, she says, and this is largely because it's a time of great uncertainty.</p>
        
            <p>In her new book, The Twentysomething Treatment, Jay is delivering a message of good news, that life - according to all the data - tends to get better in our 30s, 40s and 50s. "Life should get better as you go along."</p>

            <p>Waituna Lagoon - a wetland of international significance southeast of Invercargill - had to be opened to the ocean in January due to the threat of cyanobacterial bloom. But Environment Southland chief scientist Karen Wilson said recent quality tests in the lagoon showed water had "returned to normal levels".</p>
        
            <p>A major issue affecting the area was nutrient runoff from surrounding farms, but people were working hard individually to tackle the problem.</p>

            <p>After Caitlin Nugent saw a friend's Instagram post highlighting SPCA's need for foster animal carers, she and her partner Robbie looked through the mugshots on the SPCA website and saw a bright-eyed brindle puppy wearing a blue bow tie.</p>
        
            <p>Caitlin and Robbie cared for Rolly initially, before Caitlin's parents took over, fell in love with him and chose to adopt him. They were grieving the loss of their own long-time dog before Rolly bounced along into their hearts and became a new best furry friend.</p>

            <p>Children in nine Pacific Island countries will now be better protected from life-threatening diseases because their governments are adopting a new immunisation program.</p>
        
            <p>Implemented by UNICEF, in collaboration with the islands' ministries of health and funding from Rotary since 2020, the program will see vaccines for pneumococcal disease, rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV) added to the national essential immunisation programs.</p>

            <p>Leonardo DiCaprio praised The Capital Kiwi Project, which traps predators and releases kiwi in the Wellington region, to his 62.1 million Instagram followers. Since then, Capital Kiwi - which has released 110 kiwi into the region so far - has gained thousands of new Instagram followers and seen a spike in donations running to the hundreds of dollars.</p>
        
            <p>The Kiwi Project plans to release 16 more kiwi into the Karori bush next week.</p>
