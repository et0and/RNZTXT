            <p>A man has been injured after being shot in the leg in Kowhai Park in Feilding on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said in a statement they were called to the park about 5pm, after a report of a firearm being discharged.</p>
        
            <p>One person was found with an injury to their leg and was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Police inquiries are ongoing to identify those involved.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands it was the result of an online marketplace sale gone wrong.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald is reporting the sale involved a $2000 pair of shoes, and according to a friend of the victim, two men travelled to the park to meet a seller they had connected with online.</p>
        
            <p>When they arrived, three people in masks confronted the pair, demanded money, and shot the victim when they refused, fleeing with mobile phones and other belongings.</p>
