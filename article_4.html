            <p>Police have admitted breaching security protocols after a copy of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's itinerary was left on the dashboard of a police vehicle in Queenstown on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Otago Lakes Central Area Commander Inspector Paula Enoka said the vehicle was locked but one page of the itinerary was visible through the window.</p>
        
            <p>"While we are confident the risk created by this error was minimal, the practice is not acceptable and should not have happened," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Enoka said police had clear protocols around information security and, in this case, they had not been followed.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge our people are human and this was an unintended error, but we will be having a thorough debrief and use the lessons learned to prevent this happening in future."</p>
