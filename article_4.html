            <p>Police have cornered off a road in the Masterton area, a day after several churches and a funeral home there were reportedly targeted in arson attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they sighted a vehicle of interest about 9.15am this morning, and the vehicle was located abandoned a short distance away at about 11am.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons are in place while police work to locate the occupant.</p>
        
            <p>No further information was available.</p>
        
            <p>Four churches across the Wairarapa town were set alight between 4am and 5am on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said Saturday they were following up CCTV as well as a Facebook post in which a local man claimed he carried out those attacks.</p>
        
            <p>There is no information as to whether today's police cordons are related to that investigation.</p>
        
            <p>More to come. </p>
