            <p>Three people have been charged after painting over a rainbow pedestrian crossing in Gisborne, and police say they are pursuing it as a hate crime.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday night protesters coated a layer of white paint over a rainbow-coloured crossing on Gisborne's main street. This was followed on Tuesday by a heated demonstration involving Destiny Church members and counter-protesters, outside a children's storytelling event read by a drag queen at the city's public library, which was de-escalated by police.</p>
        
            <p>Then on Thursday, a rainbow crossing on Auckland's Karangahape Road was covered over with white paint overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The trio accused of the Gisborne crossing damage are two men, aged 46 and 36, and a 45-year-old woman, who now face graffiti vandalism charges, Police Area Commander for TairƒÅwhiti Danny Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>They are scheduled to appear in the Gisborne District Court on Wednesday, and Kirk said police would be seeking reparation of costs.</p>
        
            <p>A fourth suspect had also been identified, and police are working to locate them.</p>
        
            <p>Kirk said the incident was disturbing and sad for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We consider that, on the face of it, the alleged offending is consistent with a hate crime, and we will seek to establish that as fact during the ongoing investigations and court proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>"This incident has caused concern for many people in our diverse community and acts like this have no place here."</p>
        
            <p>Erasing the Gisborne rainbow crossing was not an appropriate way to protest, Kirk said.</p>
        
            <p>"Freedom of speech and the right to protest are fundamental principles of a free and democratic society under the rule of law," he said. "Sadly, a line has been crossed on this occasion."</p>
        
            <p>The Gisborne rainbow crossing had since been repainted.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland police have also earlier said they are treating the Karangahape Road vandalism as a hate crime.</p>
