            <p>There are calls to fix a ''broken'' funding model, as Kaikōura ratepayers face an average 14.5 percent rates hike.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaikōura District Council adopted its draft 2024/34 Long Term Plan on Wednesday proposing a 14.5 percent rates rise this year, as it faces rising compliance costs.</p>
        
            <p>The Future for Local Government report released last year found central Government collected 93 percent of tax in New Zealand, leaving councils with just 7 percent between them.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at Wednesday's council meeting, Kaikōura District Council corporate services senior manager Peter Kearney said the funding model available to councils ''is broken and fundamentally unsustainable''.</p>
        
            <p>''We need to advocate with Government for change, but it is not going to be quick fix, so we are stuck with what we have.''</p>
        
            <p>Other Canterbury councils are proposing high average rate rises, including Hurunui with 12.37 percent, Waimakariri 8.9 percent, Christchurch 13.24 percent and Environment Canterbury 24.2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Kaikōura's Long Term Plan is now out for consultation until April 30, with hearings scheduled in May.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed 14.5 percent rates rise is a big jump on last years 4.9 percent rise, which was the lowest in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Kearney said the council was still facing uncertainty with Government legislation and the ongoing impacts of high inflation and interest rates as it prepared the Long Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>''The costs of compliance have been substantial, and then you huge increases in auditing costs and insurance costs.</p>
        
            <p>''Everyone has been feeling the strain of keeping rates affordable, while still maintaining services. We are not alone.</p>
        
            <p>''Some of the councils without such high rate rises have had to sell assets or cut services.''</p>
        
            <p>Kearney said the council is consulting on footpath maintenance, funding for the Picton to Kaikōura Whale Trail, rural rating and rural recycling.</p>
        
            <p>The council wants to accelerate its footpaths renewal programme by boosting funding from $100,000 to $250,000 a year over the next six years.</p>
        
            <p>The Whale Trail cycle and walking trail, which runs from Picton to Kaikōura, is expected to bring significant economic benefits to the Marlborough and Kaikōura districts.</p>
        
            <p>The council is proposing to contribute $200,000 over the next four years towards the $32 million project.</p>
        
            <p>Feedback is also sought on how rural and semi rural rates are set, and how to fund the district's rural recycling programme.</p>
