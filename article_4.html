        <h2>Redwoods to get the chop at Wellington Botanic Garden ki Paekākā</h2>
        <p>
The trees are decaying due to damage from kākā, which have returned to the capital in high numbers.

            <p>Part of the Wellington Botanic Garden ki Paekākā will be closed to the public on Wednesday as two large redwood trees are removed by helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>The trees are decaying due to damage from kākā, as well as pests and diseases that have entered the trees through the damaged bark.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council arborists and external consultants made the decision to remove them on health and safety grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Gardens manager David Sole said some people might be disappointed by the removal of the trees.</p>
        
            <p>However, it was great to see kākā - a "taonga species" - return to Wellington in such high numbers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working towards a solution to the problem by diversifying our species being planted, especially as we continue to identify species that are less vulnerable."</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter would be used to remove the trees, which are near the Treehouse Visitor Centre, in sections.</p>
        
            <p>Weather permitting, the work would be carried out between 9am-4pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The visitor centre, display garden toilets, play area, duck pond and discovery garden would all be closed for the duration.</p>
        
            <p>The downhill walk would be open with two slight detours.</p>
        
            <p>Many attractions - including the Lady Norwood rose garden, the begonia house, the herb garden, Australian garden, peace garden, display garden, sculpture trail, and succulent and cacti gardens - would still be open.</p>
        
            <p>The Cable Car and Krupp Gun lookouts would be open, as would businesses around the Botanic Garden, such as the Cable Car Museum, Space Place and Picnic Cafe.</p>
        
            <p>Sole said locals had been notified of the work through a letter drop and there would be signage to show people alternate routes through the gardens.</p>
