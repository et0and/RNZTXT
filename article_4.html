            <p>Onewhero Area School board of trustees is to be replaced by a commissioner after four parent members resigned in the wake of their decision to fire a teacher for serious misconduct.</p>
        
            <p>The four elected parents resigned on Friday amid a furore into the board's decision to dismiss the teacher in mid-October following an out of school rugby trip in August.</p>
        
            <p>The Education Outside The Classroom excursion involved an under-15s' match between Onewhero Area School and Tuakau College in North Waikato, which RNZ understands Onewhero won by one point.</p>
        
            <p>When concerns were raised about the alleged serious misconduct, the then-acting principal conducted an initial investigation and determined the concerns were of a "sufficiently serious nature" and the matter was referred to the board.</p>
        
            <p>The board said it sought advice from the New Zealand School Boards' Association before engaging an independent employment lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>Based on that investigation report the board said it "had no option but to terminate the staff member's employment for serious misconduct".</p>
        
            <p>It said it was fully supported by the Ministry of Education when it "made this incredibly difficult decision".</p>
        
            <p>At a board meeting two weeks later on 30 October, the board said it was confronted by a large group of community members, including senior leadership and other school staff, who demanded the resignation of the board and full reinstatement of the dismissed staff member.</p>
        
            <p>New acting principal James Thomas, who has been at the school since the end of last term, said more than 100 people turned up to the meeting which took him by surprise.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas, who is a member of the board in his role, said he had not yet read the investigation report and was not involved in any of the discussions that led to the teacher's dismissal.</p>
        
            <p>The principal, Rebecca Bills, has been absent during term three and resigned in mid-October.</p>
        
            <p>The board said it stood by its decision to dismiss the teacher and that the reasons why he was fired remained confidential for legal reasons.</p>
        
            <p>They said he was a highly regarded community member but reiterated that serious misconduct by its very nature was serious.</p>
        
            <p>"...and based on the information we are privy to - despite intense pressure and very personal attacks - we cannot in good conscience reinstate this staff member as a teacher in our school".</p>
        
            <p>The board said it was accused of racism, members were threatened and they endured months of scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>Despite their resignations they said they stood by their decision and took their governance responsibilities extremely seriously.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas posted on the school's website on Sunday that it was business as usual this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just touching base to let you know that it will be school as usual for staff and students tomorrow right through 'til the end of term."</p>
        
            <p>He said senior students would begin their study leave on Monday for NCEA exams.</p>
        
            <p>Thomas said the school was working with the Ministry of Education to ensure school governance was covered and as soon as more was known parents would be informed.</p>
        
            <p>He told RNZ he hoped to know who the new commissioner was within the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>His plan was for a calm school environment for the remaining six weeks of school, and he said any students or staff would be supported through this situation if they needed it.</p>
        
            <p>Ministry of Education north leader Isabel Evans said the resignations triggered the need to dissolve the board and a commissioner would be appointed soon.</p>
        
            <p>Evans said the ministry's role was to make sure there was continued strong governance, including the delivery of teaching and learning.</p>
        
            <p>A Teaching Council spokesperson said it did not comment on complaints or mandatory reports made to the council about any specific teacher, early childhood education centre, school or kura for privacy reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"We take serious care with these matters as at the end of the day our priority is keeping Aotearoa's learners safe in the classroom. We encourage anyone who has any concerns about a teacher to reach out to us."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said police were not immediately aware of any reports relating to the situation.</p>
