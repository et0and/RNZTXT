            <p>Five people have been injured and State Highway 1 was closed for several hours in South Waikato after a serious crash this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said two vehicles were involved in the crash at Piarere at about 5.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Five people were seriously injured but the three trapped in the wreckage had since been freed.</p>
        
            <p>St John said five ambulances and two rapid response units attended the scene.</p>
        
            <p>SH1 was closed between Horahora Road and Paparamu Road and police warned of delays.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second serious crash on that stretch of the highway in months.</p>
        
            <p>In November one person died and 14 others were injured after a small bus loaded with international tourists collided with two vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>That crash happened at the northern end of the highway, near Horahora Road.</p>
        
            <p>A resident who lives on the highway, Sheryn Dean, said she has seen the aftermath of multiple crashes including one that was fatal.</p>
        
            <p>She owns Hobbit Hole accommodation just past the scene of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>"I've helped people who have had a number of accidents, most of them have been driver error. Drivers falling asleep, veering off through our fences."</p>
        
            <p>Dean said her property overlooked a 200 kilometre stretch of the highway that was straight and wide but some cars still ended up in paddocks.</p>
