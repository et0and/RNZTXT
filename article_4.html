            <p>A man was left with large burns across his body after a dermatology clinic gave him a treatment for a different patient, the health watchdog has found.</p>
        
            <p>He had been undergoing a regular course of phototherapy at the clinic to treat his eczema, said the Health and Disability Commissioner's report.</p>
        
            <p>An hour after he left the clinic, the man received a call from the dermatologist advising that he had received the wrong treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The dermatologist told the man an employee, "had opened a folder for a different patient and loaded their treatment", which was much stronger than the man's usual treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The dermatologist apologised for the mistake and told the man that he would develop bad burns, for which he prescribed aspirin and a topical steroid cream.</p>
        
            <p>By the next morning the man had developed several blisters on the front of his body.</p>
        
            <p>Over the next few days, the blistering worsened, covering most of the front of the man's body, from his chin to his waist.</p>
        
            <p>The pain rendered him bed-bound and unable to carry out daily tasks, and he had to take two days off work.</p>
        
            <p>The clinic in their investigation of the mistake found two errors were made.</p>
        
            <p>The first was that the employee who opened the man's profile in the phototherapy system, accidentally clicked on a different patient with the same first name after they had confirmed the profile for the correct patient.</p>
        
            <p>The second error was that the employee did not enter the patient's phototherapy dose into the clinic's practice management software until after the man had completed his treatment.</p>
        
            <p>If it had been entered prior, the system would have generated an alert if the dose is more than 20 percent higher than the previous dose.</p>
        
            <p>The health and disability commissioner found the clinic breached the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy health and disability commissioner Dr Vanessa Caldwell commended the clinic on its prompt and transparent investigation into the mistake.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes to the clinic's processes were specific and appropriate to reduce the risk of the same error happening again."</p>
        
            <p>However, Caldwell found the clinic breached Right 4 of the Code, for failing to provide services to the man with reasonable care and skill.</p>
        
            <p>She said the injury was avoidable and should not have occurred.</p>
