            <p>On Thursday evening Mustafa's mother, Tauvalea Law, took to Facebook to thank all of her family and friends and everyone who came to her son's funeral.</p>
        
            <p>She said the birth of Mustafa was the "happy day of my life, it's change my world and my life [sic]".</p>
        
            <p>She said her son was moved to her parents in October last year because of "situation," but she would often visit him and look after him.</p>
        
            <p>"On February of this year he move back to us [sic]. I was happy so that I continue to be a mother again.</p>
        
            <p>"Let me tell everyone about him, Mustafa Mahir Faaivivi was a happy and adorable boy.</p>
        
            <p>"I never seen kind of boy like this. He's a strong and naughty boy, his favourite cartoon movie is Cocomelon.</p>
        
            <p>"Once when the TV was on and I turn on the Cocomelon, and then he scream first, after that when the song come he started to sing, clap, smile and dance."</p>
        
            <p>She had hoped he would one day play rugby like his mother.</p>
        
            <p>"I was so excited he's my right strong arm for the future, but now he's gone never come back."</p>
        
            <p>She finished her post saying "we can't do anything, only God know, he's the one who gave and he's the one who can take away."</p>
        
            <p>"I know U gone but we never forget U in our heart. I love and miss u so much my boy [sic]."</p>
        
            <p>It was quiet and calm at the rural cemetery, with a crisp and chilly wind, for the around 30-minute service.</p>
        
            <p>A song briefly rang out, with a small boy loudly saying "bye Mustafa".</p>
        
            <p>Amongst the crowd, people were wearing T-shirts with Mustafa's photo and angel wings on the front, with the words 'in loving memory'.</p>
        
            <p>Before the burial, loved ones gathered in a church in the King Country town.</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted to social media, Mustafa was laid in a small, open basket. He was wrapped in a white, lace blanket and was wearing a white suit and hat.</p>
        
            <p>A compilation of videos was played on a big screen, highlighting clips of the smiley boy.</p>
        
            <p>Framed photographs were laid around him.</p>
        
            <p>
Around 100 attended the service at the cemetery.

            <p>The funeral comes a day after the baby's father, Mukzameel Ali, admitted to Stuff he was responsible for some of the injuries that his son suffered on the day of his death.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, he said his son was "choking, he couldn't breathe", when he started giving him CPR.</p>
        
            <p>"So when I was giving him the CPR so that would've caused that injury to become more big, and cause his death.</p>
        
            <p>"The only thing I was doing like I was trying my best to save my son. That's all I can say. If that could've happened from me, from doing it but that wasn't on purpose. Like I was trying to save his life."</p>
        
            <p>Ali said what happened was "not intentional," and he was "worried" about what might happen.</p>
        
            <p>Police have not made an arrest.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Detective Inspector Graham Pitkethley said both of Mustafa's parents were talking to police.</p>
        
            <p>"But I will outline that we have some inconsistencies with some of the statements that we are getting with what appears to be the injuries of Mustafa."</p>
