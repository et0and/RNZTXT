            <p>A teenager has been referred to Youth Aid after allegedly impersonated a police officer by attaching red and blue flashing lights to his vehicle in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Mid North response manager Senior Sergeant Mark Barratt said the 17-year-old allegedly signalled for other drivers to stop.</p>
        
            <p>Two recent incidents where solo female drivers were allegedly stopped by someone with fake police vehicle lights concerned officers, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"On both occasions, the female drivers have stopped, and the alleged offender has exited his vehicle, and engaged them in conversation.</p>
        
            <p>"The female drivers have then driven away from the man unharmed but were left distressed by his actions.</p>
        
            <p>"The incidents could have also led to a crash and put the lives of other road users at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Police were able to identify a suspect from images of the vehicle taken from CCTV footage.</p>
        
            <p>"Yesterday, we executed a search warrant at an address in Kerikeri and located a vehicle which had red and blue lights fitted to it," Barratt said.</p>
        
            <p>"A 17-year-old man was referred to Youth Aid as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"We are greatly concerned by this man's actions and believe he may have approached and signalled other drivers in the region to stop with the activated red and blue lights."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking the public for more information on these incidents or of other similar incidents.</p>
        
            <p>They can be contacted on 105, quoting file number 240625/9125 or online, clicking on update report and using the file number.</p>
