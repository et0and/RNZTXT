            <p>A Christchurch man will be sentenced today for the 2017 murder of his childhood friend Michael McGrath.</p>
        
            <p>McGrath was last seen at his Halswell home in May 2017, and he was due to visit David Benbow the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Benbow claimed his friend never turned up, but in October he was found guilty of murdering McGrath with a firearm.</p>

            <p>It was the second trial for Benbow on the charges.</p>
        
            <p>In February 2023 a jury heard seven weeks of evidence, but after three days of deliberation they could not reach a verdict.</p>
        
            <p>A second trial started in August, six years after McGrath went missing, and four years after Benbow's arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution said that Benbow - a former prison guard - killed McGrath after learning that he was in a relationship with Benbow's ex-partner of 17-years.</p>
        
            <p>Crown prosecutor Claire Boshier told the Christchurch High Court during the trial that Benbow spoke of "wanting to annihilate" McGrath after discovering the relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Boshier told the jury that after McGrath's disappearance Benbow had said - 'I don't give a f*** what happened to him, it just teaches you not to introduce your partner to another man'."</p>
        
            <p>The Crown said Benbow disposed of McGrath's body in a way that meant it had never been found.</p>
        
            <p>Following the guilty verdict, McGrath's brother Simon said he felt like a cloud had been lifted, and that he been nervous going into the second trial.</p>
        
            <p>He also had a plea for Benbow, saying they still wanted to know where his brother's body was.</p>
