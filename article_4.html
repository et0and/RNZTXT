            <p>It was the mid-1800s, and New Zealand mothers faced a dilemma.</p>
        
            <p>Photography was sweeping the nation, and they wanted a likeness of their babies - but could not leave them sitting alone while the image was captured, which could take up to 45 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>Enter a phenomenon that book editor Shaun Higgins calls the 'hidden mother': women preserved in early photos crouching behind chairs, or hidden under a shroud of fabric, propping up their young children.</p>
        
            <p>In some photos, their disembodied hands could be seen emerging from a cloth, holding their babies tight "lest they topple over".</p>
        
            <p>An example of the 'hidden mother' is displayed on the front cover of Higgins' latest book, A Different Light: First Photographs of Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Along with fellow editor Catherine Hammond, he pulled from the extensive photo collections of three major research libraries: Auckland Museum, Hocken Collections, and the Alexander Turnbull Library.</p>
        
            <p>The resulting tome includes an array of portraits and landscapes, providing an insight to New Zealand's colonial era.</p>
        
            <p>Higgins told Saturday Morning that photography was introduced in Aotearoa in 1848, about a century after its invention in France.</p>

            <p>The earliest surviving photo taken in Aotearoa was a portrait of a "rather bewildered man" named Edward Catchpool, who sat for a portrait in Wellington in April 1852.</p>
        
            <p>"He actually looks like a confused first-time Tinder user. It's quite a funny portrait, but you have to put yourself in his shoes and remember that he's never seen a camera before," Higgins said.</p>
        
            <p>Many people looked at early photographs and thought "gosh, it must have been pretty miserable back then", he said - but their serious expressions were usually because they had to sit still for a long time.</p>
        
            <p>"Dentistry was [also] not very good back then, so they don't tend to want to do a big grin and show their mouth."</p>

            <p>Early photographers had to cart a cumbersome kit around New Zealand, Higgins said.</p>
        
            <p>As well as their cameras and tripods, they had portable darkrooms - usually a small tent or a covered cart - because negatives had to be processed straight away.</p>
        
            <p>One image included in the book, of the Pink and White Terraces, had been captured on a 50cm plate, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You think about a piece of glass that size being taken to the Pink and White Terraces, that's when your imagination starts to go wild."</p>

            <p>The camera's body would have been at least as big as the plate, then there were the bellows and lens on top.</p>
        
            <p>Higgins referred to it as the "giant megapixel camera of the time".</p>
        
            <p>The image would have been processed in a small tent nearby, "then they would have washed the plates in the waters of the terraces".</p>
        
            <p>Portraits of Māori were popular in those days, but many photographers exploited them for profit, Higgins said.</p>

Kīngi Tāwhiao used photography to "spread his image around Aotearoa and the world".

</p>
        
            <p>The idea was that "Māori were a collectible", and photographs the size of business cards, called carte de visite, were taken of anonymous sitters and mass produced.</p>
        
            <p>Higgins said the sitters did not receive any payment for posing for the images, which became sought-after and frequently swapped, like trading cards.</p>
        
            <p>Their portrayal could be contrasted with that of Kīngi Tāwhiao, who sought out portrait photographers and "embraced this technology as a way to spread his image around Aotearoa and the world", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Instead of being for the benefit of Māori, this is actually the complete opposite - this is predominantly for a Pākehā collector audience."</p>
