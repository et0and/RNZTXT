        <h2>The parents refusing to give children smartphones</h2>
        <p>
"The evidence is very clear that it's not great for children, and we need to do something about it," says a parent who has created a support group attempting to keep cellphones away from kids. Audio

            <p>Despite the known harm smartphones can cause children, New Zealand has a culture of giving them access to these devices at a young age, Samantha Marsh, from the University of Auckland's Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences says.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwi kids are among the heaviest users of screens in the world. MƒÅori and those with lower socio-economic backgrounds are overrepresented. But there's a global push of parents refusing to give children smartphones.</p>
        
            <p>It's driven by research showing the link between mental and physical health problems in children with smartphone and social media use.</p>
        
            <p>Daisy Greenwell formed a group called Smartphone Free Childhood in the UK, and it has taken off, she told RNZ's Saturday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>"Within a week, there was one in every county in Britain, and 1000s of school groups within those and there are now 150,000 parents in our community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The idea that it's too late to do anything is exactly what big tech would want, she explained.</p>
        
            <p>"They've gone unregulated since they started, but we didn't know when they first came out what effect they would have on children and childhood.</p>
        
            <p>"And now we do, and the evidence is very clear that it's not great for children, and we need to do something about it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we've done a very poor job in New Zealand, there's not been a lot of research in this area, of letting parents know that there is an alternative," Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>There are similar groups to Greenwell's in New Zealand pushing the same message.</p>
        
            <p>"Unplugged Rebels, who are the grassroots parents' group, who are pushing for change in this area.</p>
        
            <p>"And we've created a group recently, Before 16, a collective of individuals with expertise ranging from wellbeing academia all the way to tech, and we're really wanting a social media free childhood to be the norm in New Zealand rather than the exception."</p>
        
            <p>The aim is not to leave children isolated, Greenwell said.</p>
        
            <p>"People really are starting to do something about it, and it's entirely possible, just to wait a few more years, you can get your child a simple phone, a brick phone, just calls and texts, and then when they're older, you could get them a smartphone."</p>
        
            <p>Research has shown a range of smartphone-associated health problems, Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that not meeting screen-use recommendations is associated with things like being obese, having more illnesses, more visits to the doctor, lower physical motor skills and issues with hyperactivity."</p>
        
            <p>A review of the data led by paediatric physiotherapist Julie Cullen identified a range of impacts from vision, hearing, neck pain and headaches to attention, language and cognitive function, Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then, of course, what everybody's talking about now is the mental health and mental wellbeing outcomes.</p>
        
            <p>"So, depression, anxiety, eating disorders or low self-esteem."</p>
