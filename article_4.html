        <h2>Wairoa locals can't afford $40m flood clean-up - mayor</h2>
        <p>
The town needs extra help to deal with the mountains of destroyed belongings left behind, Craig Little says.

            <p>The damage to Wairoa from last week's devastating flooding could top $40 million, which the town cannot afford, the mayor says.</p>
        
            <p>Some 500 properties in the town were flooded when heavy rain hit parts of the East Coast last week.</p>
        
            <p>A state of emergency remains in place.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Craig Little said a mountain of sodden carpet and destroyed belongings was now lining the streets.</p>
        
            <p>"Oh, people's possessions, now just wet sodden heaps out in front of their homes - all their furniture and everything, beds, carpets, linos, underfloor insulation, the gib inside, it's just relentless really."</p>
        
            <p>The town's landfill was already at capacity after Cyclone Gabrielle and it faced a huge cost to take the rubbish to other tips, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Ratepayers were already facing a 20 percent rate increase.</p>
        
            <p>Little said there was no way the community could fit the bill for the clean-up and he would be asking the government for help.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell has already announced the government would contribute $300,000 to the Mayoral Relief Funds to help communities in Hastings, Wairoa and Tai RƒÅwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>He would be going to appeal to Cabinet this week for extra funding to support the town's clean-up and recovery.</p>
        
            <p>Napier MP Katie Nimon earlier said the government was working with insurers and the local council to understand the best way to assist people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important for us to see what's going to be covered by insurance, what's not.</p>
        
            <p>"Ministers are working really hard to take a paper to Cabinet to get what we can to get the clean-up started, so council knows what can be done without having to worry about where it falls," she said.</p>
