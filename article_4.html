            <p>MetService is forecasting a wet farewell to 2023 but a settled start to 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The forecaster said a warm northwesterly flow would bring probable showers to all reaches of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings are in place for Mount Taranaki, Nelson and the Westland ranges.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said mountainous areas would bear the brunt of the rain.</p>
        
            <p>But there was a risk of thunderstorms for the northern and western parts of the country as well as the deep south.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly along the eastern part of the country, we see a northwesterly flow coming through so we may even see Canterbury cracking the 30 degrees (Celsius) as the day goes on," Makgabutlane said.</p>
        
            <p>"However for the rest of the country, and eventually in that Canterbury region, as well it's going to be quite a wet day."</p>
        
            <p>The weather was expected to improve by mid-Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said a ridge of high pressure would then bring a settled start to the new year.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is also warning the next few days could bring uncomfortable nights for sleeping, with high temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>In some places the overnight temperatures would be 20C or more.</p>
        
            <p>Warm moist air continues to cover much of the country with daytime temperatures set to reach 30C on the East Coast.</p>
