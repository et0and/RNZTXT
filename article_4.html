            <p>A charity says families displaced after a fire destroyed temporary homes behind a South Auckland Church will need lots of support this holiday season.</p>
        
            <p>Two weeks ago, a fire ripped through the Akoteu Faka Kalisitiane Ko Namoa church complex at Māngere Bridge.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze destroyed four cabins on the complex, where families in need of housing have been living in temporary accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Dave Letele from the charity Buttabean Motivation has been supporting the ten affected families, who are still living temporarily in the main church hall.</p>
        
            <p>"We got reached out to right after it happened, for support with food and more, and we always think if you can help, you should."</p>
        
            <p>He said the community has been rallying around the affected families who had lost everything in the fire, and were doing it tough, especially in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"We are just one out of a number of groups that are supporting and doing the best we can. It's tough times for a lot of people and for this to happen just leading up to Christmas, it's heartbreaking really.</p>
        
            <p>It was earlier reported by FENZ that there were no sprinklers and no evidence of smoke alarms in the church buildings housing the families.</p>
        
            <p>The Tongan church said the revelation was concerning.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured in the fire but FENZ said the families are lucky to be alive.</p>
