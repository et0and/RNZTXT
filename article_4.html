        <h2>Ministry told school to 'evacuate immediately', five months after toxic mould found</h2>
        <p>
The Ministry of Education knew an Auckland school's disability unit had toxic mould, but didn't tell them to evacuate until five months later.

            <p>Staff and students at an Auckland school's disability unit were told to "evacuate immediately", five months after the Ministry of Education learnt the building contained toxic mould.</p>
        
            <p>Papatoetoe South School's Le Va Inclusive Centre caters for students with disabilities and higher needs, such as those who use wheelchairs, are non-verbal or who require help with eating and toileting.</p>
        
            <p>But in August 2022, the centre had to move into another building after the discovery of toxic mould.</p>
        
            <p>The instruction to "evacuate immediately" came five months after the ministry learnt of the mould in March 2022.</p>
        
            <p>To learn that the ministry sat on this information and that staff and vulnerable students had been exposed to toxic mould for five months "rocked us to our core", tumuaki tuarua (deputy principal) Paul Andrews said, especially when workers in protective hazmat gear arrived to inspect the building prior to its demolition.</p>
        
            <p>Tumuaki (principal) Caroline Chawke said two existing classrooms were renovated to temporarily accommodate for the tamariki while a replacement facility was built.</p>
        
            <p>However almost two years on, construction is yet to begin, and the tamariki remain "crammed" in a space that does not meet their needs, with a "cupboard" like space for showering and changing.</p>
        
            <p>The accessible bathroom, in a separate building altogether, requires two staff members to leave the classroom when a student needs the toilet, putting a strain on the school's teaching resources.</p>
        
            <p>"It shouldn't be a mission to go to the toilet," Chawke said.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary centre is on the opposite side of the school from the pick-up/drop-off area, meaning staff are needed to walk with students to class.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, the walkways to the bathroom and drop off areas are not undercover like the previous building, meaning students who are vulnerable to respiratory illnesses could end up cold and wet during bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>This had seen attendance drop at the centre, especially during the colder months, and a regression in the children's independence, Chawke said.</p>
        
            <p>The higher-needs students' families shouldn't have to worry about school, as they already have to fight for their children in all other aspects of life, she said, adding that the current set up was not mana-enhancing for the tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>Andrews compared the situation to doctors having to perform surgery in a waiting room.</p>
        
            <p>"Our tamariki with needs, they've already got a tough start at life. They should be able to come to school and just learn," Chawke said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want barrier free access to quality education."</p>
        
            <p>Three sets of plans for a new facility have been drafted, but none of have progressed. Chawke said it appeared those with the power to approve the plans are never present at their meetings with the ministry.</p>
        
            <p>"We need shovels in the ground yesterday," Chawke said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Ministry of Education head of property Sam Fowler said it should have acted quicker to move the centre out of the building with the toxic mould.</p>
        
            <p>"It is unacceptable for any student to be learning in an unhealthy environment.</p>
        
            <p>"We apologised to the school and have also changed our internal processes to make sure school receive their air testing results at the same time as we do."</p>
        
            <p>A new, fit for purpose building is expected to be complete in 2025, the cost of which is yet to be determined. The ministry would work with the school to identify what further support is needed until then.</p>
        
            <p>"Papatoetoe South is experiencing significant growth and is forecast to grow further," Fowler said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been working with the school to plan for this growth and make sure that the new Le Va facilities are sited appropriately as part of this plan."</p>
