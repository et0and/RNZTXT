        <h2>Waitematā Harbour rahui lifted, seven weeks after sewage spill</h2>

Watercare says it is hoping to make amends because the harbour has "suffered a lot in the past 100 years".

            <p>Watercare says it is hoping to make amends to improve the health of Auckland's Waitematā Harbour because it has "suffered a lot in the past 100 years".</p>
        
            <p>After seven weeks, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei on Thursday morning lifted the rāhui over the harbour at Ōkahu Bay, meaning swimmers can get back in the water.</p>
        
            <p>Raw sewage spilled into it at the end of September when a storm and wastewater pipe burst, creating a sinkhole in a Parnell carpark and blocking the Ōrākei main sewer.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, Watercare met with Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei to discuss the next steps in the harbour's restoration. The two groups were joined by environment regeneration experts to find a way to get the water back to health.</p>
        
            <p>Following the meeting, environmental care manager Nathaniel Wilson said the water quality was back to normal, but there were "subtle changes" that could take months or years to resolve.</p>
        
            <p>"You just get a slight change in what makes up the ecosystem, so different things move in, other things move out. Just getting that equilibrium back will take some time."</p>
        
            <p>While results showed it had affected the water quality of the harbour, he said, "there's not a lot to directly clean up".</p>
        
            <p>"Natural processes will resolve that better than we can intervene."</p>

            <p>In the meantime, Wilson said action was being taken to restore the Waitemata Harbour from the poor treatment it had experienced in recent history.</p>
        
            <p>"Through unfortunate circumstances we are in a position to do some good. It is very much acknowledging that the harbour has suffered a lot over the last 100 years, and this is an opportunity to start making things right."</p>
        
            <p>He said Watercare was working alongside Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and Revive Our Gulf to replenish "ancestral mussel - or kūtai - beds'.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson hoped there would be opportunities with other habitat restoration projects around the harbour.</p>
        
            <p>"That's artificial reef building, and planting habitat like seagrasses and seaweed."</p>
