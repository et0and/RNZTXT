            <p>Public transport signs in the capital are set for a major upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council has announced it will replace signs at bus stops and train stations, the new ones offering real-time information (RTI) for services and display available onboard capacity.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of setting up the new RTI system is estimated to be $8m, with about $11m more available to maintain the system over the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-one percent of this cost is being funded by Waka Kotahi / NZ Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>The overhaul has been made available through a deal between Metlink and global technology firm NEC.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink group manager Samantha Gain said rolling out the project could take up to two years.</p>
        
            <p>"About 250 digital signs around the region need to be replaced and new hardware installed on approximately 450 buses.</p>
        
            <p>"By June 2024 we hope to have the new RTI software up and running in the background, and the whole project completed by December 2025."</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Transport Committee chairperson Thomas Nash said it would greatly improve the passenger experience.</p>
        
            <p>"The current system is close to its use-by date and its inaccuracy is a significant pain point for our passengers.</p>
        
            <p>"The new system will greatly enhance passenger confidence in our network."</p>
        
            <p>Information on NEC's new signs will be generated by Metlink and displayed using software developed by Wellington's Somar Digital.</p>
        
            <p>Along with the new signs, text to speech units will be installed at some bus stops for blind and visually impaired passengers.</p>
        
            <p>The project will also make life easier for bus drivers. New tablets will be fitted onboard buses that display route diversions within seconds of being transmitted by operators.</p>
