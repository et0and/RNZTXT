            <p>The rising cost of living has hit the Salvation Army hard, with the charity's resources stretched to levels never seen before.</p>
        
            <p>This week is the 60th anniversary of the Red Shield Appeal, which will see thousands of volunteers fundraising at 450 sites around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Money raised will go toward services for those doing it tough, such as food support, addiction services, supported accommodation, counselling and youth development.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland area officer David Daly said the rising cost of living was leading to greater demand for the charity's services.</p>
        
            <p>It also meant that any money raised did not go as far as it used to.</p>
        
            <p>"It's sort of a cycle that we're getting more people seeking support and yet our costs are also getting blown out a bit, trying to have enough food and making sure we have people available to give support to those that are coming in."</p>
        
            <p>He was worried that fewer people would be able to donate to the appeal this year due to rising living costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We realise with the amount of extra people that we're seeing coming in for help and support from us, we realise that for others to be able to give and donate and to help other people, is also a cost to them and for many that may not be something they can do."</p>
        
            <p>Daly said the Salvation Army helped more than 150,000 New Zealanders and their whƒÅnau last year.</p>
        
            <p>Donations of any amount could be made at their website, or by phone at 0800 53 00 00.</p>
