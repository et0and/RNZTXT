            <p>Gisborne residents remain fearful for their safety after a double homicide in the suburb of Elgin, while neighbours say the wh훮nau who hosted the birthday party where a mass brawl happened are good people.</p>
        
            <p>The fight on Saturday night involving 100 people ended with two dead and three injured.</p>
        
            <p>Police forensic teams are at the property, examining cars on the street and have been and coming and going from a number of homes inside the cordon on Lytton Road.</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old charged with wounding with intent in relation to one of the wounded men has been remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>His court appearance on Monday has been postponed.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Construction worker Daniel Walters, who lives on Lytton Road, said a friend whose house is on a different street, but near where the party happened, decided to stay elsewhere out of fear for her safety.</p>
        
            <p>"She's been staying at her mother's for two days just cause they feel like it's unsafe and they haven't come back to the house yet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour of the wh훮nau who did not want her name used described the family as "lovely people" who sometimes take kina over to her grandmother.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were still awake on Saturday night when they heard the commotion outside.</p>
        
            <p>"It was just a whole lot of people in the middle of the road, pretty much. Couldn't see much, it was pretty dark, no lights, just a whole bunch of people screaming, yelling."</p>
        
            <p>She said emergency services arrived within minutes.</p>
        
            <p>She had never experienced anything like this in the neighbourhood before.</p>

            <p>Supermarket worker Tione Williams Tamatea said the double homicide had been the talk of the town.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a lot of chitter chatter in the supermarket about what happened - everybody's got their own little scenario about how it happened.</p>
        
            <p>She agreed the wh훮anau who held the 21st birthday party were good people.</p>
        
            <p>"They're a pretty good family. We've had no issues with them whatsoever," Williams Tamatea said.</p>
        
            <p>Extra police officers are patrolling the area, and armed police remain at Gisborne Hospital where three people are being treated for stab wounds, one in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Although the party involved Black Power gang members, police said the brawl was not sparked by conflict between rival gangs.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in or near the Elgin suburb where the party was held say they're concerned about the growing violence in the area.</p>
