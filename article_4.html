            <p>Detectives are continuing "painstaking work" ahead of the second Christmas Ariki Rigby's whānau will spend without her.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old's body was found in a burnt-out car near Havelock North in September 2022, three days after her family reported her missing.</p>
        
            <p>Her death was initially treated as unexplained but later became the subject of a police homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Dave de Lange said police remain committed to solving her murder and bringing justice to her.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the second Christmas Ariki's whānau have been without her, without knowing who carried out this senseless and cruel act, and why.</p>
        
            <p>"A team of experienced detectives in Hawke's Bay continue the painstaking work to find those answers and bring closure for Ariki's whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"Individuals within the Hawke's Bay community know what happened, or could help our investigation, but they are refusing to interact with police."</p>
        
            <p>De Lange said police were making "slow but steady" progress to break the silence by reinterviewing witnesses, studying evidence and following new leads.</p>
        
            <p>"This is meticulous work and remains incredibly sensitive because of the secrecy from those who refuse to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge them to think of Ariki's grieving whānau this Christmas and do the right thing and talk to police."</p>
        
            <p>On the one-year anniversary on Rigby's death, her whānau said they still mourned her but wanted to move forward by finding those responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Information relating to the investigation can be given to police by contacting police via 105 or online, quoting file number 220905/1265.</p>
        
            <p>Information can be also provided anonymously by calling Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
