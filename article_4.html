            <p>TVNZ says it must press ahead with big spending on new technology, while also cutting news jobs and programmes</p>
        
            <p>It has signed Irish company Accenture to help build a new digital platform over five years, for the likes of its streaming service.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown entity says its strategy was to triple digital advertising revenue by 2028.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the next few years, we will significantly increase digital advertising opportunities for New Zealand businesses, create new revenue streams outside of advertising, and give our advertisers more data-led options on our platforms."</p>
        
            <p>But other advertising revenue keeps shrinking.</p>
        
            <p>"With the significant declines we're seeing in the TV advertising market, we must reduce our operating costs to match our revenue," a spokesperson told RNZ in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Interim chief executive Brent McAnulty said in October that "developing a world-class digital offering is one of the most important investments we can make to safeguard quality local content in Aotearoa for years to come".</p>
        
            <p>But that digital upgrade has come too late to safeguard current affairs show Sunday, most news bulletins and dozens of jobs that the broadcaster confirmed last week would be cut.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the company must invest in new IT to keep up to date.</p>
        
            <p>"The IP [internet protocol] programme is fundamental to TVNZ's transformation and will safeguard the future sustainability of our organisation."</p>
        
            <p>According to government briefings, TVNZ has announced a $100m investment in its online platform TVNZ+, "while continuing to maintain legacy networks and infrastructure".</p>
        
            <p>TVNZ has refused to reveal the overall costs, on the grounds of commercial sensitivities.</p>
        
            <p>"But we have been clear that it will require significant investment from our cash reserves and earnings to create a sustainable future business," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Accenture began work on the project to set up a Master Systems Integrator last week.</p>
        
            <p>A TVNZ executive told Businessdesk: "At the moment, the technology holds us back from everything we'd like to do" and the new platform would "enable us to do a whole lot more".</p>
        
            <p>The IT spend did not reduce its resources available to spend on news production: "We continue to invest $40m annually into news and current affairs."</p>
        
            <p>Investigative journalism took many shapes and forms and would continue, possibly added to by an investigative consumer and current affairs team on the digital side, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a five-year plan to fund this investment through a combination of cash reserves and operating profit.</p>
        
            <p>"That plan is only achievable if we're able to ensure the business remains operationally solvent while we make the changes."</p>
        
            <p>Online streaming helped TVNZ increase digital revenue by 16 percent in the half-year to December, but free-to-air TV ad revenue continues to drop.</p>
        
            <p>The company set up a transformation team last year to push through the IT changes.</p>
        
            <p>It would not say if this team had undergone any cost cutting, saying it was a "confidential employment process".</p>
