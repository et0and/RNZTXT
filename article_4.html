            <p>Data obtained from Facebook and Google were collected as evidence by police investigating the death of Rau Tongia.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Carolyn Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume, and Pania Ella Waaka have all pleaded not guilty to the murder of Tongia, who the Crown alleged was shot in the back while he slept at a house in Wellington's Karori in December 2020.</p>
        
            <p>In the hours before Tongia's death, the Crown alleged he assaulted Weston and his death was a revenge killing.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt-Weston has pleaded not guilty to additional charges of an accessory after the fact to murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth person was due to go on trial but has not appeared due to health issues.</p>
        
            <p>This week, police have given evidence on data they received from Facebook and Google.</p>
        
            <p>Police sergeant Scott McKendry told the court that data points from Google Maps placed Pania Waaka's phone outside the address on Percy Dyett Drive where Tongia was killed around 4.30am that morning.</p>
        
            <p>McKendry said data points further tracked the phone travelling to Halswell Lodge and out to Waiwhetu in Lower Hutt after 5am.</p>
        
            <p>CCTV footage shown to the court last week identified Breeze Hunt-Weston and Pania Waaka getting out of the car at the Waiwhetu BP after 5am that day.</p>
        
            <p>On cross examination, lawyer for Waaka, Letizea Ord questioned how far the radius for those data points expanded.</p>
        
            <p>The sergeant said the question would be better asked to another officer.</p>
