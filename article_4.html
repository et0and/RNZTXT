            <p>Auckland Transport is delaying charging people to park overnight in the central city by a year.</p>
        
            <p>It is the latest in a series of delays for the 24 hour fees after they were first announced in May last year.</p>
        
            <p>The paid parking will now come into force in March 2026 at a price of $1 - $2 per hour.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said it had listened to feedback from the community and stakeholders that requested the changes be made closer to the City Rail Link opening date.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency's parking services group manager John Strawbridge said managing parking through time restrictions and pricing values their limited space.</p>
        
            <p>"In the city centre, managing parking enables people to be able to easily access businesses and apartments at any time of day or night.</p>
        
            <p>"The city does not go to sleep at 6pm. Part of this is ensuring that there is at least one parking space available on every street in our city centre."</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck said AT was to be commended for the move.</p>
        
            <p>"It was far from ideal when plans to charge for overnight parking were thrust on the community last year. After everything the city centre has dealt with in recent years, this is not the time to be introducing charges of this nature."</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality NZ chief executive Steve Armitage also backed the delay.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Transport's delay to overnight parking charges, and confirmation of parking rates when charging is introduced next year, provides these workers with crucial breathing room and some certainty, as it does for patrons.</p>
        
            <p>"This is important as businesses work hard to rebuild and ensure staff and customers alike have easy access to the city centre."</p>
