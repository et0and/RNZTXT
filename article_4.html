            <p>The Public Service Association (PSA) says a proposal to halve the Department of Conservation's Chatham Islands staff risks impacting front-line conservation efforts.</p>
        
            <p>DOC has proposed to cut year-round staff on the islands from 11 to five, and merge the office with the Wairarapa district.</p>
        
            <p>A boosted summer staff was also included in the proposal, which would see the on island team swell from five to 20 from October to April.</p>
        
            <p>"Our members are feeling shocked and completely undervalued by this proposal," said Duane Leo, PSA national secretary.</p>
        
            <p>"The staff are a passionate group of workers, who work all year round to support and protect more than 40 species that are on the endangered list Chatham Islands animals," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Some of those species included the black robin, the Chatham Islands tūī, tomtit and warbler, and the Forbes' parakeet.</p>
        
            <p>Protecting endangered species was not just a summer job, Leo said.</p>
        
            <p>"Workers are concerned that this proposal puts vital work at risk. DOC staff also undertake much work co-ordinating volunteers, and others who are working to save endangered species and now that won't happen year round."</p>
        
            <p>The proposal as it stood would undermine conservation efforts on the island, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While changes may be needed, these are wholesale changes, without consultation with interest groups who understand the challenges on the island."</p>
        
            <p>Budget savings were not a factor in the change, DOC said.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, it was in response to feedback from staff on the Chathams who had indicated their well-being was being negatively impacted under the current operational model, said Henry Weston, DOC's deputy director-general of regional operations.</p>
        
            <p>Staff and the PSA now had until 22 May to explore alternative proposals with DOC during a consultation period.</p>
        
            <p>A final decision would be made by the end of the month.</p>
