            <p>A 37-year-old man has been charged with murder after a fatal crash in the west Auckland suburb of Massey.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a vehicle struck the victim on a driveway at Lanham Lane on Tuesday evening and left the scene immediately after.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, despite the best efforts of ambulance staff at the scene, the victim succumbed to his injuries at the scene," Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Williams of Waitematā CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found and seized the vehicle at an Avondale address late on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>The alleged offender was known to the victim and was arrested in the Thames area and brought back to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in Waitākere District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with the man's death," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we can't comment on the specifics of what has taken place, I can advise that both men are known to each other."</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was continuing at the address and police enquiries were underway overnight to established what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>Neighour Nelu Lotonu told RNZ in the 20 years he has lived in the area he has never seen anything like it, and is it usually quiet.</p>
        
            <p>"This is my first time to see that happening," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Very shocking, because it's a quiet area."</p>
        
            <p>Another resident told the New Zealand Herald they heard a car roar up a hill before it struck something and returned to hit it again.</p>
        
            <p>The driver was "driving like something else. Eventually he took off," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She told the Herald the victim "kept to himself" and "sometimes he'd wave".</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking anybody with information to contact them. Tips can be offered anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
