        <h2>'Please give us a police station' - Central Aucklanders still feel unsafe</h2>
        <p>
A building manager in downtown Auckland says safety measures put in place in the central city are not working, and that a brick and mortar police station is the key to making a difference.

            <p>A building manager in downtown Auckland says safety measures put in place in the central city are not working, and that a brick and mortar police station is the key to making a difference.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one more police have been patrolling the city centre since the start of July.</p>
        
            <p>Robert Macfarlane is the building manager of 105 Queen Street, a grand, historic apartment building situated at the bottom of the main drag.</p>
        
            <p>He had seen the extra patrols, but said something was still not right - with crime and disorder continuing in his neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a heavily dense residential area, and the vibe on the street is - it's really quite unpleasant sometimes," Macfarlane said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of low level agro."</p>
        
            <p>Macfarlane said he had seen incidents including retail theft and a neighbour being robbed, and that he sometimes felt unsafe in his own neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>"Having a neighbour attacked recently, that's made me wearier than I was before, you know, looking over my shoulder as I come and go, particularly after dark," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Macfarlane believed backing up the on-street police presence with a downtown police station, and increasing patrols at night, would make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've been asking for, over and over again, is the re-establishment of a police station in this neighbourhood," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great that we've got more police, but I don't think that's sufficient to address the actual real crime and the perception of what's going on."</p>
        
            <p>The downtown station on Fort Street closed in 2013, with police headquarters in central Auckland moving to Freeman's Bay in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council compliance manager Adrian Wilson said he was surprised to hear claims measures were not working.</p>
        
            <p>"The reports that we're getting back from our team is that: yes, we'd get the odd bit of nuisance that's being caused but, in terms of levels of crime, we're not seeing it on a daily basis," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said the council was keen to take a deeper look at peoples' perceptions of city safety by surveying those living, working and visiting town.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to look at areas across the board," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things we're conscious of is that a lot of it comes down to perceptions of safety, which is really difficult to measure if you're talking about crime stats, that doesn't measure what people are feeling."</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said a downtown police station was already being considered, but that that was a matter for the police.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been lots of talk about a downtown police station, and the need for one, and I think that's even shared by police and government," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's not as simple as it's going to open up tomorrow, but I know that it's being looked at."</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck backed a downtown police station, but said she wanted to see even more officers out on patrol.</p>
        
            <p>"We've always wanted to see more police on the street," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have got more, there is more needed, we firmly believe that, and we do want to see a downtown station, but we are seeing the benefit of additional police on the beat.</p>
        
            <p>Beck said central government, local government, and social and business sectors were working together to make Auckland central safer.</p>
        
            <p>But for Macfarlane, that did not go far enough.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not working, the current policies are insufficient and are not working, the current approach," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Please do more, please give us a police station."</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell had said he would be open to exploring a public-private partnership for a station in central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been approached for comment.</p>
