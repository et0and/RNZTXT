            <p>MetService said it was a frosty morning in many places and most places were forecast to get a fine Mother's Day earlier on with a chance of showers developing in many places later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said this week's temperatures should be more typical for this time of year - cold but not extreme.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecaster Claire O'Connor said the week ahead would be warmer.</p>
        
            <p>"And that does mean that we're returning to more ... average temperatures for this time of year whereas these ones we've been seeing have definitely been below average."</p>
