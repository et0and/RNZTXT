            <p>One of 11 schools found in breach of government requirements to teach reading, writing and maths for an hour a day has yet to prove it complies with the rule.</p>
        
            <p>The schools were among 685 primary schools the Education Review Office visited between January 2024 and January 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The review office told RNZ it notified the Education Ministry of the non-compliant schools.</p>
        
            <p>Education Ministry Curriculum Centre acting deputy secretary Pauline Cleaver said it offered support to each of the 11 schools to understand the shortfalls and help rectify them.</p>
        
            <p>"When issues are identified, the ministry works alongside schools to resolve challenges such as these. In all but one case, schools were able to promptly satisfy ERO that they had rectified shortfalls," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the remaining case, the school is near compliance. We will continue to monitor their progress."</p>
        
            <p>The hour-a-day rule was introduced for schools with pupils in Years 0-8 at the start of last year as part of government efforts to improve children's literacy and numeracy.</p>
        
            <p>The Education Review Office said school boards were expected to attest that they complied with the rule as part of their board assurance statement.</p>
        
            <p>It said it also checked each school's plans, programmes and their assessment of student progress and achievement in reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
