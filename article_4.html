            <p>Crowds of mainly students, parents and supporters from across the country are expected to protest as part of School Strike 4 Climate on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>They have multiple demands including around climate justice, abolishing the Fast -Track Bill, honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi and for the government to stand in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Other demands included:</p>
        
            <p>On Friday strikes were being held in Auckland, Dunedin, Whanganui and Christchurch. Wellington's was cancelled on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>In New Plymouth, protesters gathered at Puke Ariki Landing, but RNZ's reporter at the scene said few school-aged people were present.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers of the strike said Friday's protest represented the collective voices of rangatahi demanding government took its responsibilities seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"We refuse to stand by while decisions are made that destroy our future, our environment, and the lives of indigenous and marginalised communities," one protester, Kereama said.</p>
        
            <p>"Together, we will fight for climate justice and a future where people and the planet come before profit and destruction," PerƒÅ said.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Education Minister David Seymour wants schools to mark students who bunk off to go to climate protests today as unjustifiably absent.</p>
        
            <p>Young people, parents and supporters are expected to turn out at a number of events across the motu afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Seymour said while he admired children caring about major issues the best place to get the tools they needed to tackle climate change was in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>"I do not think that you can argue it is a valuable contribution to a child's education. If we're worried about maintaining human welfare with lower climate emissions... what we need is a generation well versed in maths and science."</p>
        
            <p>The protest would have more impact if was held on the weekend or during the holidays when they would not miss school, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Read more about the crackdown on truancy:</p>
        
            <p>Seymour announced a crackdown on truancy on Thursday, including prosecuting parents after 15 days of absences.</p>
        
            <p>"If students feel strongly about sending a message they could have waited until Monday, when the end of term holidays begin and there is no school for two weeks. It has become far too common to sacrifice valuable learning time for other causes.</p>
        
            <p>"The previous government said that protesting instead of attending school could be justified. This, in my view, is unacceptable. My expectation is that schools will treat students protesting today as explained but unjustified absences."</p>
        
            <p>Seymour has also announced schools would no longer be allowed to hold teacher-only days during the school term.</p>
