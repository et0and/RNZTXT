            <p>An 18-year old Christchurch man is facing dangerous driving charges following a "crazy, idiotic display of speed" south of the city earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Highway Patrol constable Scott Agnew was issuing a ticket on the Southern Motorway when a Holden Commodore "screamed past" at about 1pm on Tuesday, driving at more than 200 km/h.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an absolutely crazy, idiotic speed," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of people on that motorway at 1pm on a weekday; a crash at that speed would have been catastrophic."</p>
        
            <p>Police later found two witnesses yelling at the driver as he checked a damaged wheel in a Rolleston car park.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a horrendous speed, putting other road users at extreme risk," Agnew said.</p>
        
            <p>"He's very lucky, as are all the other people who were on that road with him.</p>
        
            <p>"As a driver, the decisions you make impact not only you and those in your vehicle, but everyone else on the road around you."</p>
        
            <p>The man has been summonsed to appear in court on a charge of dangerous driving, with his car impounded for 28 days and his licence set to be suspended.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson would not say what speed he was travelling at out of fear of copycat behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"People will try and beat it, believe it or not."</p>
