            <p>A 110kmh speed limit has been proposed for State Highway 1, from Orewa to Warkworth.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on raising the speed limits from 100kph for the Northern Gateway Toll Road and Pūhoi to Warkworth Road of National Significance will last four weeks, beginning on 3 September and closing on 1 October.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency will then consider all feedback received during the consultation process and review it alongside technical and safety assessments.</p>
        
            <p>The government is currently finalising a new Speed Limit Rule that will enable 110kmh speed limits on Roads of National Significance that are built to a high safety standard.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said the two sections of State Highway 1 were both built to a high safety standard and have delivered strong safety benefits for those travelling between Auckland and Northland.</p>

            <p>"Since the Northern Gateway Toll Road opened in 2009, and the Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway opened in 2023 under National's Roads of National Significance programme, no one has died in a crash on these roads," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"These roads provide a faster, safer and more resilient connection between Auckland and Northland, helping to unlock economic growth and productivity by moving people and freight quickly and safely between regions.</p>
        
            <p>"Delivering 110kmh speed limits on Roads of National Significance where it's safe to do so is another part of our government's Accelerate NZ plan to grow the economy, reduce travel times and increase productivity on our transport network."</p>
