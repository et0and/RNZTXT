            <p>Police investigating a fatal hit-and-run accident in Wellington are appealing for the driver of a white Toyota Aqua to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>One person died on 17 June after the collision on Ghuznee Street in the central city.</p>

            <p>He was appealing for anyone who saw the crash to come forward, or if they saw a similar make or model car in the area or heading north about 10.50pm on the night.</p>
