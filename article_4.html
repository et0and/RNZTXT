            <p>Human remains have been found at a rural location close to Waikato's Tokoroa, leading to a police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The scene had been secured and an examination of the area was underway, detective senior sergeant Ryan Yardley said.</p>
        
            <p>"Specialist resources, including search teams, are assisting to ensure a thorough search.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this news may be concerning to the community, and we want to reassure residents that our team is working diligently."</p>
        
            <p>Identification would take some time, he said, and no further comment on the possible identity of the remains could be given until it was completed.</p>
