            <p>Destiny Church's leader says he strategically planned the protests carried out at Pride Festival events by his Man Up followers.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday night, around 30 members of the group blocked a parade in Wellington by performing a haka.</p>
        
            <p>The parade was about five minutes in when the Man Up members appeared.</p>
        
            <p>The crowd yelled "you are not welcome" and police formed a line, trying to move them away on Taranaki Street.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki said they were making a stand to "protect children".</p>
        
            <p>Wellington mayor Tory Whanau was at the start of the parade, joined by Wellington Paranormal actor Karen O'Leary.</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said the protesters were there to spread hatred and bigotry and were not welcome in the city.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the Man Up group also disrupted a Drag King's children's event at a West Auckland library a few weeks ago.</p>
