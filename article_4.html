            <p>Former justice minister Kiri Allan says she has pleaded not guilty to a charge of failing to accompany a police officer on the basis that she did not have access to a lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>Allan is facing charges of refusing to accompany a police officer and careless driving after crashing her car in Wellington earlier this year.</p>
        
            <p>A statement posted on Allan's Instagram account said she requested to speak to a lawyer both immediately before and after her arrest.</p>
        
            <p>Police did not allow her to and the charge resulted from her unwillingness to accompany the police without the ability to speak to a lawyer, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"The issue here is that such a fundamental legal right sits in a grey area which several senior lawyers in NZ from both a defence and prosecution perspective have not been able to provide a unified view on," it said.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said all agreed that the law was currently uncertain.</p>
        
            <p>Allan said laws should be clear and accessible to all New Zealanders, not just legal professionals.</p>
        
            <p>A guilty plea would likely result in a minor fine, there would not be the need to turn up in court and it would cost very little, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The route of taking the matter through the courts will be incredibly exposing, it will be costly, and it will require a personal attendance in the court."</p>
        
            <p>Allan said it was a significant decision and its sole purpose was to ensure that the police and New Zealanders "have certainty about when the right to legal counsel is available".</p>
        
            <p>The hearing is set down for next year.</p>
