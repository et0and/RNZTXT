        <h2>'Way too many cones': Roadworks create confusion at licence testing</h2>
        <p>
People taking driving tests in Wellington say long-running roadworks outside the main testing centre are creating "confusing" test conditions, putting them at an unfair disadvantage.

            <p>People taking driving tests in Wellington say long-running roadworks outside the main testing centre are creating "confusing" test conditions, putting them at an unfair disadvantage.</p>
        
            <p>The roadworks outside VTNZ Wellington have been ongoing along Thorndon Quay for more than a year.</p>
        
            <p>One man who did not wish to be named said they had taken the test twice during the road works and both times had failed in the first couple of minutes.</p>
        
            <p>On his first test attempt, he was told to go left at a time when roadworks did not allow this.</p>
        
            <p>"He [the examiner] pointed to the right, but then I was told I had to go left."</p>
        
            <p>The road works caused confusion for both parties, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's way too many road blocks and way too many cones.</p>
        
            <p>"The roadworks not only confuse the people driving - but the person who's trying to instruct you."</p>
        
            <p>Resitting the driving test had cost him $300 so far on lessons and fees.</p>
        
            <p>The fee for restricted license costs $167.50, including the application fee and two practical test attempts, with an additional $102.80 for every attempt after that.</p>
        
            <p>A full licence costs $98.90 for the application fee and two tests, and $71.90 for every additional attempt.</p>
        
            <p>Data provided to RNZ by Waha Kotahi showed that the fail rate at VTNZ Thorndon Quay for a Full licence is at 57 percent, compared to a national average of 52 percent.</p>
        
            <p>VTNZ declined to comment on if roadworks contributed to these statistics.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said the roadworks on Thorndon Quay are due to finish by the end April.</p>
