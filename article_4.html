            <p>More than 100 students have gathered on Auckland University's city campus to protest the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The rally was originally planned as an encampment, but the university said any overnight stand would not be allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Tents had been set up within the crowd, but protest organisers said the event would be a rally.</p>

            <p>Protesters have been waving the Palestinian flag and banners saying 'Free Palestine'.</p>
        
            <p>The demonstration has been organised by Students for Justice in Palestine, taking after the protest camps sweeping universities in the US.</p>
        
            <p>Students for Justice in Palestine co-president Layah Khalil said the group also had demands for Auckland Univeristy.</p>
        
            <p>"We're wanting the university to put out a formal statement saying they're against what's going on in Palestine, [that] they don't support the genocide. We really want the university to join the movement."</p>
        
            <p>Khalil said the protest also showed solidarity with students in the US who had been arrested for disruptive protests.</p>
        
            <p>In an email to all students on Tuesday night, Auckland University Vice Chancellor Dawn Freshwater said the university supported the right to peaceful protest, but would not authorise an overnight encampment.</p>

            <p>In March, the World Court unanimously ordered Israel, accused by South Africa of genocide in Gaza, to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave's Palestinian population and halt spreading famine.</p>
        
            <p>But Gaza's Hamas rulers said a ceasefire was needed to halt the humanitarian crisis.</p>
