        <h2>Could the building consent overhaul endanger lives?</h2>
        <p>
There are concerns potential shortcuts could lead to "another disaster like the CTV building collapse".

            <p>Christchurch city councillors have heard misgivings from community advocates about whether an overhaul of building consenting requirements could "endanger lives".</p>
        
            <p>Concerns around building standards and the effects roading upgrades had on the city's emergency services were put to the city's community leaders, imploring the council to reflect on whether the lessons of the devastating Canterbury earthquakes had been fully realised.</p>
        
            <p>The presentation at Wednesday's council meeting comes off the back of an announcement at the weekend by Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk.</p>
        
            <p>The government is investigating three options to "streamline" the building consents process and replace the current system where 66 councils across the country act as Building Consent Authorities.</p>
        
            <p>Momentus PR and CTV Families Group advocate David Lynch said there was genuine fear that an overhaul of the consenting system exposed the community to risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Potential shortcuts could increase the risk of another disaster like the CTV building collapse," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While these reforms are intended to streamline the process, there is genuine fear that they might lead to building failures and endanger lives."</p>
        
            <p>The situation facing an eight-storey central city building was referenced during the talk, with questions raised around whether some buildings were subject to structural defects.</p>

            <p>The office block at 230 High Street has stood empty since it was consented by the council and built in 2018.</p>
        
            <p>The eight-storey block has never been opened because it has several earthquake design flaws.</p>
        
            <p>"What is even more alarming is that when I sought clarification from council staff three years ago on whether this was an isolated case, they were unable to provide a definitive answer," Lynch said.</p>
        
            <p>"This uncertainty raises the troubling possibility that other buildings with similar faults may be fully occupied, putting lives at risk in the event of another major earthquake."</p>
        
            <p>Lynch proposed the council investigate supposed substandard building materials after reports surfaced about non-compliant steel that had been imported into the New Zealand market.</p>
        
            <p>"This steel could contain hidden defects that might only become apparent during the next major seismic event, posing a catastrophic risk," he said.</p>

            <p>Councillors also heard concerns about the effects roading upgrades were having on the city's emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>CTV Families Group spokesperson Professor Maan Alkaisi said on 22 September he observed two Fire and Emergency (FENZ) trucks come to a standstill among central city traffic due to narrow roading.</p>
        
            <p>"The firemen started to sound their horn out of desperation with little outcome," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The situation immediately reminded me of what happened on the 22nd of February, 2011, where we experienced total chaos.</p>
        
            <p>"My question to the council is do we have an effective emergency plan that can be activated fast enough when needed?"</p>
        
            <p>Cashmere ward councillor Tim Scandrett defended local emergency response strategies, describing them as the best in the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We have an outstanding emergency service plan, we have an emergency service precinct next to the court building where they work closely together and it's country-leading.</p>
        
            <p>"But an emergency is an emergency, and a crisis is a crisis, and we do the best we can."</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch mayor Phil Mauger admitted some raised pedestrian platforms and zebra crossings were unnecessary.</p>
        
            <p>Scandrett proposed the council meet with emergency service representatives to discuss the concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The deputation began with Lynch presenting a sign stating "185 - Have Lessons Been Learned?" for Mauger.</p>
        
            <p>The 185 refers to the number of lives lost during the 2011 earthquakes.</p>
        
            <p>"This is for your lounge sir," Lynch said.</p>
        
            <p>The presentation also featured a tribute video made by late Christchurch resident Gerardo Torres for his sister Elsa, one of the 115 people killed in the CTV building collapse on 22 February 2011.</p>
        
            <p>Lynch said the video was produced before Torres' sudden passing in October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Court records showed the company that owns 230 High Street began legal action against the city council and its engineers in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The council's head of building consenting Steffan Thomas told RNZ developers had paid about $120,000 in consent fees.</p>
        
            <p>As the matter remained before the court, the council refused to comment on whether any further costs had been incurred on the building.</p>
        
            <p>"The owners have not told the council what their plans are for the building at 230 High Street.</p>
        
            <p>"Their proceedings claim the building must be demolished, but the council, and other defendants, disagree and say the building can be repaired.</p>
        
            <p>"None of the expert engineers involved in the MBIE determination say the building is dangerous."</p>
