            <p>Residents in parts of Motueka are being advised to boil their water after a sewage overflow.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman District Council said the leak was discovered in Grey Street near Motueka High School and may have been happening for two days or more.</p>
        
            <p>There were concerns the shallow groundwater aquifer in the area may have been contaminated and investigations were underway to determine the scale of the overflow.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution, residents and businesses southeast of Grey Street who took water from private bores were advised to boil all water until further notice.</p>

            <p>Properties that took water solely from the council reticulated supply were not affected.</p>
        
            <p>The overflow had also entered the stormwater network, which feeds into Woodlands Drain and runs to the Motueka Estuary at Old Wharf Road.</p>
        
            <p>People should avoid contact with water in the drain and the estuary, and not take shellfish from the tidal area until further notice, the council said.</p>
