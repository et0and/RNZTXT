            <p>A search is under way for a man who went overboard from a vessel between Whakatāne and Whakaari/White Island.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre was notified about 3am Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Two Coastguard boats and two rescue helicopters were searching, and more helicopters were being brought in.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime New Zealand has taken over coordinating the search.</p>
        
            <p>Drift modelling has led to a search area of approximately 300 square nautical miles, but Maritime New Zealand said they are working to refine that area.</p>
        
            <p>The missing person was last seen at around midnight.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the man was one of four people onboard.</p>
