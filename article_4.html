        <h2>Hunting for New Zealand's 10th meteorite</h2>
        <p>
It's been 20 years since the last meteorite was found in NZ. But the next could be sitting on Grandpa's back step. Audio

            <p>The hunt is on for New Zealand's 10th meteorite - and it could be sitting on your back doorstep.</p>
        
            <p>A group of enthusiasts known as Fireballs Aotearoa is asking Kiwis to take photos of any rocks they think could have fallen from space and send them in for analysis.</p>
        
            <p>It has been 20 years since a meteorite was last found in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>That rock fell through a roof in Auckland's Ellerslie in 2004, Fireballs Aotearoa publicist Steve Wyn-Harris told Afternoons.</p>
        
            <p>"It bounced off the couch, hit the ceiling and ended up rolling onto the carpet," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The space rock was now in Auckland War Memorial Museum.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorites were fascinating because of the information they held about the history of the universe, Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>There was "quite a good scattering of stones out there that have come from the outside of the solar system", he said.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the Great NZ Meteorite Hunt, people were asked to keep an eye out for any "really interesting rocks".</p>

            <p>New Zealand's 10th meteorite could be "the stone that Grandpa always claimed was a meteorite that's sitting on the back step holding the door open", Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of them won't be meteorites - they'll just be earth rocks, [but] interesting rocks all the same - but you never know."</p>
        
            <p>Freshly fallen meteorites would have "black fusion" crusts because they had vaporised coming through the atmosphere, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Iron meteorites could be identified because they were "much heavier than you'd expect a rock to be".</p>
        
            <p>They were also magnetic, Wyn-Harris said.</p>
        
            <p>"[But] if you ever come across a freshly fallen one, don't put your magnet next to it because you'll destroy a lot of the information it holds about the solar system's formation four-and-a-half billion years ago."</p>
        
            <p>Wyn-Harris said farmers had found most of New Zealand's meteorites to date.</p>
        
            <p>One farmer had found a space rock while harrowing a paddock, while another had picked one up after noticing his sheep kept hitting their hooves on it.</p>
        
            <p>There was likely a "good scattering" of meteorites across Aotearoa, with no one place likely to have more than another, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with a rock they think could be a meteorite was asked to send photos to the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand at meteorites@rasnz.org.nz.</p>
        
            <p>Scientists would examine the photos and any space rocks that warranted further investigation would be sent to Otago University, where they would go under an electron microscope.</p>
