"I live in Cornwall Rd but in the post it said 'Pornwall Rd'. I just thought it was a joke," one local said.

            <p>Mystery surrounds the identity of a sign bandit in Napier who has been changing dozens of street names into crude words for months without being nabbed.</p>
        
            <p>So far the handiwork has cost ratepayers more than $5000 for repairs.</p>
        
            <p>Residents say the culprit might feel like a practical joker, but their tampering isn't funny.</p>
        
            <p>Taradale resident Jo Coffin thought someone was having a laugh when she saw a post about her street name on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"I live in Cornwall Rd but in the post it said 'Pornwall Rd'. I just thought it was a joke," Coffin said. "But no, it's real."</p>
        
            <p>Other changes to street sign names seen by Local Democracy Reporting, including one on Kent Tce, were deemed unfit for publication.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Napier City Council said the vandalism was happening right across the network, but Taradale appeared to be the latest target.</p>
        
            <p>So far the vandalism has cost ratepayers about $5700 to fix.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the spate of tampering started in August 2024 and since then they had replaced 30 street signs.</p>
        
            <p>The rate of vandalism was climbing, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"An average double-sided street name blade costs around $190 plus GST, depending on size and length of the street name."</p>
        
            <p>Coffin said she was expecting visitors from overseas when the sign was changed to Pornwall Rd.</p>
        
            <p>"It's kind of embarrassing telling them to look for a street name like that," she said. "Replacing signs because of behaviour like this is not a good use of taxpayers' money."</p>
        
            <p>Sharon McNiece, who owns EIMI, a preloved clothing shop in Taradale, said it's just not funny.</p>
        
            <p>"It's blatant unnecessary exposure to crude words. Street signs don't go unnoticed."</p>
        
            <p>ArtyAz shop owner Terri Dangen said most people will automatically think it's teenagers.</p>
        
            <p>"But I don't think you would get a group of teenagers standing around scoping out suitable signs and traffic flow. I'm leaning towards males 30 years and upwards.</p>
        
            <p>"Whoever was responsible might think it's a practical joke but it's at the expense of the community."</p>
        
            <p>Napier City Council said the matter had been raised with police.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they hadn't been able to locate any reports in relation to the matter but it "would likely have been noted for intel purposes".</p>
