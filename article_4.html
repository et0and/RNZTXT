            <p>A friend and colleague of a Christchurch lawyer who died when rock climbing in Australia has remembered her as a revered figure among the legal community.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes have been paid for barrister Lee Lee Heah, who died after a fall at Mount Arapiles in western Victoria on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 69-year-old fell as she scaled the final section of a climb called Eskimo Nell.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Christchurch barrister Liz Bulger told RNZ the legal fraternity had been rocked by the tragedy.</p>

            <p>"We're all feeling it today," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a big Lee Lee-sized gap in our profession and will continue to be felt for some time to come."</p>
        
            <p>As a lawyer, Heah had been described by colleagues in the wake of her death as "unflappable", and Bulger echoed those sentiments.</p>
        
            <p>"Even in the face of challenging clients, and being challenged by judges and challenging circumstances, she never lost her cool," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"She was well known for fighting hard, often for people who'd had a number of lawyers before and fallen out with them, or disengaged with them.</p>
        
            <p>"Lee Lee would often take on those kind of assignments and make something out of a matter that others had been unable to."</p>
        
            <p>Despite her seniority, Heah still worked on a range of cases and work of varying levels of significance.</p>
        
            <p>"Lee Lee still worked in the trenches," Bulger said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that's something that we should all do."</p>
        
            <p>She was also known for mentoring young lawyers who had just entered the profession.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of the courtroom, Heah - who believed in maintaining a good work-life balance - was an avid traveller.</p>
        
            <p>She and Bulger often conversed on their respective travels.</p>
        
            <p>"It always seemed to me, that she had just been on an amazing trip, or was about to go on one, and it usually involved mountain climbing or surfing.</p>
        
            <p>"And going to places I'd never heard of and doing amazing things.</p>
        
            <p>"Although she probably did half-a-dozen trips to my one."</p>
        
            <p>The site where she died was a renowned rock-climbing destination, attracting outdoor climbers from all over the world.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, the New Zealand Alpine Club's Canterbury Westland Section said it was saddened by the tragedy.</p>
        
            <p>"Lee Lee had climbed with our mid-week rock climbing group over a number of years as well as attending climbing meets."</p>
        
            <p>Other friends and family had posted heartfelt tributes on social media.</p>
