            <p>Kaikōura business owners are worried about safety at a busy intersection where trucks "thunder" through town, but there are no plans for safety improvements or a bypass.</p>
        
            <p>Destination Kaikōura deputy chairperson Lynette Buurman said she is concerned for the safety of cyclists negotiating the high volume of traffic on Beach Road, which is also State Highway 1.</p>
        
            <p>With the town expected to grow over the next few decades, Buurman said it is time a traffic safety plan was developed.</p>
        
            <p>"We are meant to be encouraging cycling, but we need to make sure it is safe.</p>
        
            <p>"As we grow as a community we want our visitors to be safe and our elderly to be safe, and our children coming home from school.</p>
        
            <p>"Unless we keep talking about it, nothing will happen."</p>
        
            <p>Buurman said she is also concerned at the safety at the intersection linking West End with Churchill Street, Beach Road and Ludstone Road.</p>
        
            <p>"Trucks roar through the town, thundering past that intersection.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a wonder we don't see more accidents."</p>

            <p>Council chief executive Will Doughty said a diversion for Beach Road was looked at as part of the North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery alliance's work after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in November 2016, but there was no funding available at present.</p>
        
            <p>He was also unaware of any planned improvements by Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) at the West End intersection.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't had too many issues in terms of crashes.</p>
        
            <p>"NZTA did some minor improvements after the earthquakes, but I'm not aware of anything planned."</p>
        
            <p>Doughty said funding for roading infrastructure was a nationwide issue.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a feeling it would be good to see a greater investment in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"The roading programmes for every council is balance between what needs to be done and what is affordable."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA has been contacted for comment.</p>
