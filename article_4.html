            <p>The man accused of murdering five people in the Loafers Lodge fire in Wellington has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>The man, who has interim name suppression until the beginning of the trial, appeared via audiovisual link at Wellington High Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer Louise Sziranyi told the court the defence of insanity would be relied upon during the trial.</p>
        
            <p>The man had also denied two charges of arson.</p>
        
            <p>Five people died at the multi-storey budget accommodation on Adelaide Road in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>More than 50 people were rescued, and many lost precious belongings, although some were able to be recovered.</p>
        
            <p>The man was charged with murder and arson a few weeks after the blaze, but until now had not formally entered a plea.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was set down to begin in August.</p>
