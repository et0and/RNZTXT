            <p>An Otago principal says it "doesn't feel like common sense prevails" when it comes to cuts to rural school bus services.</p>
        
            <p>So far this year 176 routes have been or are being reviewed by the Ministry of Education.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one routes have been cut and 11 have been replaced with different routes or combined with others.</p>
        
            <p>And Otago schools have been hit hard by the charges that for some came in at the start of Term 3.</p>
        
            <p>To get ministry-funded school transport assistance there must be eight or more students using the bus and they have to go to a state or state integrated school within a certain distance.</p>
        
            <p>Colin McHutchon, principal of Heriot School in west Otago, told Checkpoint he was disappointed about some of the decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't feel like common sense prevails when they make the decisions, especially about routes and route design."</p>
        
            <p>McHutchon said "there's a lot of variables as far as designing the routes go".</p>
        
            <p>"Often in remote places such as ours, in one space it might be empty for a month or so and then there might be a number of families."</p>
        
            <p>One of his school's routes was cancelled, he said, which puts much more burdens on parents or caregivers to get their children at least some of the way to school.</p>
        
            <p>"So basically parents pretty much need to bundle kids into the car in the morning and then they would travel quite a distance in order to meet up with another bus route and hopefully they can get that timing right and hopefully the bus is on time.</p>
        
            <p>"The responsibility is with mum or dad or whoever's looking after them to make sure, especially in the case of 5-year-olds that are waiting with them, as the 5-year-old can't wait on the side of the road for the bus obviously."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Education has said the primary responsibility for transporting children to school rests with caregivers.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that to a point, but as far as having the right to a bus, I think if things are resourced in a different way it might be able to suit schools and communities more specifically."</p>
        
            <p>McHutchon was asked if he thought parents at his school might pay to ensure bus service.</p>
        
            <p>"One hundred percent, if that's what it took."</p>
