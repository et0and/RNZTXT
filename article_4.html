            <p>A secret $32 million deal between Wellington City Council and Reading Cinema owners is set to finally be discussed in public.</p>
        
            <p>The cinema building was closed in early 2019 after an earthquake risk was discovered and has since become a symbol of the tired state of Courtenay Pl - a street that has traditionally been a key part of the city's nightlife and entertainment offering.</p>
        
            <p>The deal has always been discussed behind closed doors to protect commercial sensitivity but some details have been leaked and widely circulated in the public domain.</p>
        
            <p>The council plans to buy the land underneath for $32m which the cinema chain would use to strengthen and reopen the building and later have the option of buying the land back at the sale price, the Herald understands.</p>
        
            <p>A $43,000 independent code of conduct investigation launched by Mayor Tory Whanau into five councillors found there was insufficient evidence to identify who leaked the confidential information.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors and the Mayor, whether they support the actual deal or not, were becoming increasingly aware of the public suspicion and aggravation that the secrecy around it has caused.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Iona Pannett filed a notice of motion to revoke decisions the council has made on the cinema which is being discussed at a full council meeting on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>No information about the motion has been provided in the agenda and council officials have recommended it be considered in a public-excluded part of the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>But not a single councillor the Herald spoke to today completely agreed it should be discussed in secret, easily giving Pannett the majority she needs for a vote to have it play out in public.</p>
        
            <p>Even Whanau said she was supportive because of ongoing misinformation.</p>
        
            <p>"It is entirely appropriate that commercially confidential information is debated in private. It has been really frustrating to see details leaked - leading to misinformation - on a decision that was democratically agreed in council for the good of the city.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers advice continues to be that this remains private, but a lot of what has been said about this proposal with Reading is inaccurate and misleading."</p>

            <p>Councillors John Apanowicz and Tim Brown agreed.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said the confidentiality of the deal has materially increased public suspicion and aggravation about the council.</p>
        
            <p>He said it might have been viable to hold information about the deal in confidence for a few weeks but not several months.</p>
        
            <p>"Council should seek to ensure everything about all its activities is public with any exceptions having to be justified by really strong reasons, which is not the case with Reading."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Sarah Free said most of the relevant details were now in the public domain anyway.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors Nicola Young, Diane Calvert, Ray Chung and Tony Randle were also on board citing the "huge public interest" and concern.</p>
        
            <p>Labour councillors Nureddin Abdurahman, Rebecca Matthews, Teri O'Neill and Ben McNulty all agreed.</p>
        
            <p>The deal would have been far less controversial had it been public from the start, McNulty said.</p>
        
            <p>Abdurahman said the public needed to have confidence in the council's decision-making processes.</p>
        
            <p>"At a time when community facilities are under threat from the council, the public are rightly sceptical of closed-door discussions on major items of expenditure like the Reading deal.</p>
        
            <p>"Too often council excludes the public from decision making and this is bad for democracy."</p>
        
            <p>Green Deputy Mayor Laurie Foon said she would prefer for it to be discussed in public noting an "uninformed conversation" had emerged from the public not having the full details.</p>
        
            <p>"But if it will jeopardise the commercial sensitivity at this stage, then I do not think we should discuss it in public."</p>
        
            <p>Green councillor Nīkau Wi Neera acknowledged parts of the deal were commercially sensitive and kept private to secure the best deal for the public.</p>
        
            <p>"That said, I think the best way to take Wellingtonians with us on this and show the positives of the deal would be to release as much detail as we can - without compromising our negotiating position."</p>
        
            <p>Geordie Rogers, who was confirmed the winner of the Pukehīnau Lambton Ward by-election this week and will be sworn in as a councillor at the upcoming council meeting, also said he would like the discussion to be held in public.</p>
