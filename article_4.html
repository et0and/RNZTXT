            <p>Young Māori have taken to social media to welcome their new queen with open arms.</p>
        
            <p>Kuini Nga Wai Hono i Te Po was anointed as the new monarch during her father's funeral on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Focus was now turning to how she would continue her father's call for Māori to unite.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ host Mihingarangi Forbes told Morning Report there was immediate acceptance from those gathered at Tuurangawaewae on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>And the support on social media was effusive, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a quick look on the socials because Nga Wai Hono i Te Po is 27-years-old and the average Māori is also 27-years-old so this is the way this generation communicates.</p>
        
            <p>"The feeds are overwhelmingly Māori women reaffirming here as their new queen. The posts, the tweets, the reels of support, honestly my feeds were just full of it."</p>
        
            <p>There were claims her appointment was a rebirthing for Māori, Forbes said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is just so much support for her over the last 24 hours."</p>
        
            <p>Nga Wai Hono i Te Po was an academic and loved kapa haka and was well known and loved in those circles, Forbes said.</p>
        
            <p>"She was mentored by some of Māoridom's most esteemed rangatira at Waikato University... she will grow into this role with a deep understanding of tikanga and mātauranga," she said.</p>
