            <p>A school principal has shared the Warriors' impressive weekend victory as a parable of resilience to his students.</p>
        
            <p>The Warriors ended a four-game losing streak on Sunday, scoring a huge 22-20 NRL win over the three-time defending champion Penrith Panthers.</p>
        
            <p>This was despite 10 Warriors players including Captain Tohu Harris and big-name Shaun Johnson being sidelined from the clash due to injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāhinapōuri School principal Mark Harrop saw the heartening victory as the perfect opportunity to share a message of resilience with his students.</p>
        
            <p>A clip of his booming speech is doing the rounds on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"It was looking grim," Harrop begins.</p>
        
            <p>"Ten key players out with injury... Five minutes into the game, they lose their hooker... Things were looking bad.</p>
        
            <p>"But the Warriors, with a whole bunch of inexperienced young players, stepped up," he continued.</p>
        
            <p>"They never gave up. They played with heart and won the game."</p>
        
            <p>Harrop ends with a resounding: "Isn't that amazing!!! Resilience! That's what it looks like."</p>
        
            <p>As the video has gone viral across the Tasman, the comments are heart-warming.</p>
        
            <p>One person said: "I could have been something if he was my teacher."</p>
        
            <p>Another said: "Awesome that the principal knows how to talk to his students about what really matters. Up the WAHS baby."</p>
