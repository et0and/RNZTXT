            <p>A large industrial building has gone up in flames in Kumeū, north of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The fire broke out around 10pm on Wednesday in what Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said was a 50m x 10m commercial building in an industrial area.</p>
        
            <p>At the height of the blaze, 11 fire engines were at the site, and FENZ said four crews remained, dampening down hot spots and turning over debris.</p>
        
            <p>Nobody was in the building, and no neighbouring properties were threatened, a FENZ spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ could not confirm a local resident's report online that an explosion was heard before the blaze broke out.</p>
