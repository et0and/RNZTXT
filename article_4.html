            <p>A restricted fire season has been declared for Dunedin and Clutha from tomorrow morning until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who wants to light an outdoor fire will need a fire permit authorised by Fire and Emergency NZ.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Otago district manager Phil Marsh said an uncharacteristically damp and cool start to summer had resulted in a lot of grass growth which is now rapidly drying off.</p>
        
            <p>"Our summer has been a mixed bag so far, with very wet days interspersed with strong winds and calm, warm days.</p>
        
            <p>"This means there is an abundance of flammable vegetation in the Dunedin and Clutha areas, which is ready to ignite again only a few hours after being wet."</p>
        
            <p>With less rain forecast over the next few weeks, vegetation will continue to dry out and the fire danger will continue to increase.</p>
        
            <p>"The areas we're imposing restrictions on have a history of significant vegetation fires even in the milder conditions we're experiencing this season.</p>
        
            <p>"We're asking everyone to go to checkitsalright.nz before lighting any outdoor fires or engaging in heat or spark generating activities, such as using power tools and mowing long grass.</p>
        
            <p>"The website advises on the risk for different types of fire activity, provides fire safety advice, and tells you what fire restrictions your location is under if you aren't sure."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone wanting to apply for a permit for an outdoor fire can also do so at checkitsalright.nz.</p>
