            <p>A Gisborne man has been sentenced to two months in jail for repeatedly poaching crayfish from a marine reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Duke Matahiki was first apprehended by police at Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve on 8 November last year, when a police dog located a hidden sack of crayfish.</p>
        
            <p>Under the Marine Reserves Act 1971, it is illegal to take any marine life from a reserve, punishable by up to three months imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>The following day, CCTV recorded Matahiki attempting to recover the crayfish catch, which police had released back into the reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Less than a month later, on 6 December at about 11.30pm, Matahiki was apprehended once again by a joint operation involving the Department of Conservation, Fisheries New Zealand and the police, this time with 12 kina and five crayfish, all of which were released back into the water.</p>
        
            <p>At the Rotorua District Court this month, Judge David Cameron sentenced Matahiki to two months in prison.</p>
        
            <p>DoC's Gisborne operations manager Matt Tong said this was one of the strongest sentences he'd seen - "and it sends a clear message; don't poach from a marine reserve".</p>
