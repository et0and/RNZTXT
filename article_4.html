        <h2>'Maths doesn't add up': Number of surgeons being trained falls well short</h2>
        <p>
The situation is made worse by the number who are either retiring or taking jobs overseas, an expert says. Audio

            <p>New Zealand is not training enough surgeons, while also facing significant attrition of the workforce, according to the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.</p>
        
            <p>Workforce shortages are one of the key issues at the beleaguered Tōtara Haumaru building at North Shore Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The new 150-bed building has been sitting empty for months, and is now set to partially open in July, however, no additional surgeries will be carried out at the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>That's because in order to staff the new building, other operating theatres will have to close; a "lift and shift" of resources from one building to the other.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons said while it applauded more physical infrastructure for surgery, these theatres needed to be staffed.</p>
        
            <p>Its chairperson of the Aotearoa New Zealand National Committee Dr Ros Pochin told Midday Report there were significant shortages of senior medical officers (SMOs) and registrars.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things we know is that we have significant attrition of surgeons overseas and that's partly because of conditions of working.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's also because we train very good quality surgeons in New Zealand, but then we encourage them to go do an overseas fellowship. We currently don't have a system whereby we're giving them the promise of a job to come back to, so we're losing people overseas."</p>
        
            <p>Pochin said that loss was compounded by retirement and not training enough new surgeons.</p>
        
            <p>"Plastics is a perfect example of training; they're getting one or two new surgeons out a year that are staying in the country, but they're actually down 12 SMOs throughout the country, so the maths doesn't add up."</p>
        
            <p>The new Tōtara Haumaru building was anticipated to have capacity for 15,000 procedures a year, and was supposed to help slash waiting lists in the Auckland region.</p>
        
            <p>Pochin said that extra capacity would have provided the opportunity for more operations that go beyond just the most urgent and life-threatening, to those that improve a patient's quality of life.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to provide a service where we cannot just treat cancer, but we can actually treat people who have gallstones, or varicose veins, and who are therefore finding they can't can't live their life."</p>
        
            <p>Pochin said the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons was working with Health Minister Dr Shane Reti to address workforce and pipeline issues.</p>
        
            <p>"But it is very frustrating... it feels a little bit like one step forward, two steps back."</p>
