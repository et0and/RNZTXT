            <p>Two people injured when a vehicle in a Christmas parade experienced a "mechanical malfunction" have been released from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>They were hit by a slow-moving Burger Fuel-branded car on Saturday morning at the Avondale Christmas Parade.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Jacqui Whittaker said it was fortunate neither were seriously hurt.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation into what exactly occurred is continuing."</p>
        
            <p>The accident sparked a "general melee", in the words of local board member Catherine Farmer, which saw the three occupants of the vehicle - two of them children - attacked by members of the public.</p>
        
            <p>Contrary to initial reports, they were not dragged from the vehicle - assaulted whilst still seated, police said on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A NZME reporter at the scene said the crowd were jumping on the bonnet and smashing their fists on it, MƒÅori wardens holding them back.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle occupants were treated at the scene for minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker said the vehicle was being examined to determine what caused the malfunction.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to ask anyone who witnessed these events, or captured footage of it occurred, and have yet to speak with us to get in touch."</p>
        
            <p>Witnesses can call 105 or file a report online, referencing file number 231126/1537.</p>
