            <p>Neil Finn's voice has changed a lot since his original Crowded House days.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I've got more control over my voice which is lovely and I've got more range - I can sing higher and go lower ... I hope that lasts," he tells Music 101 host Charlotte Ryan.</p>

            <p>The new Crowded House line-up is starting to delve into the "wealth and riches" of what they can offer. They're preparing to go on tour later this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We're beginning to jam on stage and the more we play live the better it feels. I think we are developing ... I think this record, Gravity Stairs, has some new angles and shades and echoes."</p>
        
            <p>Watch Neil Finn play classics along with some new tracks in the RNZ studio:</p>
