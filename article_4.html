            <p>A magnitude 4.1 earthquake has struck within 5km of Pōrangahau in southern Hawke's Bay this morning.</p>
        
            <p>It occurred at 6.59am, 18km deep, and caused "moderate" shaking, according to GeoNet.</p>
        
            <p>The quake may have been felt in central North Island towns such as Castlepoint, Dannevirke, Eketahuna, Feilding and Hastings, it said.</p>
        
            <p>So far, 69 people have reported feeling the shake through the government's GeoNet website.</p>
        
            <p>In June, a swarm of more than 80 earthquakes were recorded in Hawke's Bay and Te Tairāwhiti.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, GNS Science said such swarms were "not uncommon" in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite common to have this cluster of increased seismicity in Wairoa and also the whole east coast," GNS seismic duty officer Elisabetta D'Anastasio said.</p>
