            <p>There were 8040 new cases of Covid-19 reported last week with almost 5000 being reinfections, Te Whatu Ora says.</p>
        
            <p>As of midnight on Sunday, 324 people were in hospital with the virus, six of them in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>The number of people who had already had Covid-19 before getting it again was 4992.</p>
        
            <p>There were 77 new deaths attributable to Covid-19 reported this week.</p>
        
            <p>The number included deaths that occurred between 23 December and 11 January.</p>
        
            <p>These were unable to be attributed due to a break in cause of death coding over the holiday period, the ministry said in its weekly statement.</p>
        
            <p>There were 6558 new cases reported in the week leading up to 8 January and of them, 3999 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 355 people in hospital and six were in intensive care at midnight on 7 January.</p>
