            <p>The number of reported new cases of Covid-19 fell slightly in the week to Sunday, as free access to rapid antigen tests (RATs) was ended.</p>
        
            <p>There were 1174 new cases of Covid-19 reported for the week to 6 October, and five further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>The previous week there were 1339 reported new cases and four deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Since 1 October, RATs to detect the disease have not been given out for free, but were still available to buy.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, the government was going to stop providing free tests from 30 June but extended this for three months.</p>
        
            <p>College of General Practitioners medical director Dr Luke Bradford told Morning Report last week not providing free RAT tests could lead to more hospitalisations and deaths.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing that triggers us a little bit is that there is a treatment for Covid for those that need it, for the immune-compromised, the elderly and the co-morbid. And now in order to decide if you need that treatment, you need to pay for a test - and we don't do that with other conditions."</p>
