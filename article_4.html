        <h2>Police not prepared, quickly overwhelmed during cyclone</h2>
        <p>

            <p>Cyclone Gabrielle quickly overwhelmed police and they are not properly prepared for the next such disaster, a newly released report shows.</p>
        
            <p>The report shows Gabrielle cost police about $60 million, and while it warns that getting beyond a "just in time" response will create more costs, it still recommends doing it.</p>
        
            <p>Unlike the other scathing storm reviews by other agencies that have been publicly released so far this year, the police one was written more than a year ago but has only just been released under the Official Information Act.</p>
        
            <p>The eight-page debrief used the word "overwhelmed" five times, including of the police's emergency co-ordination centre and emergency call system.</p>
        
            <p>It praised officers for "doing heroic things" and showing community leadership, and said they quickly managed to track down a substantial number of people who had been reported missing.</p>
        
            <p>It found some systems worked well, but identified many gaps.</p>
        
            <p>This included basics like too few four-wheeled drives, confusion over who was in charge, and the 111 and 105 systems unable to easily prioritise or share calls.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite early planning and preparation, our ECC [emergency co-ordination centre] was not prepared for the scale of impacts and was quickly overwhelmed by sheer volume.</p>
        
            <p>"There was little surge capacity available."</p>
        
            <p>It said there was confusion between police passing jobs from the centre to the districts - with some jobs falling through the cracks.</p>
        
            <p>"Some events were cancelled without explanation or resolution ,creating confusion and risk."</p>
        
            <p>The report contained a host of recommendations - the number one was to make disaster response a core function for the first time - but warned that time was tight and funds were short.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not geared toward response... as core business," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Severe weather events have already become so frequent that police should consider including specific planning, adaptation, and disaster response to flooding, coastal storm surge, other severe weather events."</p>
        
            <p>This had "significant fiscal implications".</p>
        
            <p>Most of the almost $60m cost came from writing off gear worth $10m and replacing it for $45m.</p>
        
            <p>The findings echoed those of the other storm response reviews released earlier this year, such as Fire and Emergency and NEMA's reports that detailed a litany of failures, some successes and with the scale of the storm repeatedly offered in mitigation for not being ready.</p>
        
            <p>But the police debrief could join the country's long list of reviews that find gaps, make recommendations and are then forgotten until the next disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"Police currently respond on an 'just in time' basis," the June 2023 debrief said.</p>
        
            <p>"This approach is likely to be inadequate as the frequency and severity of weather events increases in coming years."</p>
        
            <p>The police's major operations centre - which backed up their frontline staff in the Hawke's Bay and other districts - did a lot of work, but with too few people.</p>
        
            <p>The centre's staffing was "ad hoc" and there was no register of who was trained and available.</p>
        
            <p>Districts also lacked people, staff welfare suffered and "near misses" went unreported. Officers leapt in without properly assessing the threat.</p>
        
            <p>"We do not believe that the reports made during this operation are actually reflective of the incidents/near misses experienced" and this should be fixed, it said.</p>
        
            <p>A bright spot was that as people's panicked calls flooded in, a new national operating model for the 105 line kicked in, with "pre-recorded messages ready to go when... overwhelmed".</p>
        
            <p>But staff handling the calls from there confronted a "huge spike [and] manual processes", and 105 "cannot surge easily to support 111 anymore". RNZ is asking for more information about this issue.</p>
        
            <p>Many officers' close relationships with marae and others in the community was also highlighted as a bright spot.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial days there were reports of RSE [regional seasonal] workers being washed away. By week 2 all were accounted for due to relationships already in place."</p>
        
            <p>In the field, officers struggled to talk to each other as "radio/cell phone capability was significantly restricted".</p>
        
            <p>Out of the field, they also struggled to get things done. "It was difficult to transfer events out of the ECC and into the emergency response on the ground."</p>
        
            <p>This caused "confusion... distress and delays". There were "inefficiencies, additional uncertainty, and frustration" amid the storm, even though in the build-up communications were "on the whole well-coordinated".</p>
        
            <p>Police also struggled to talk to other agencies, such as local civil defence groups so "overwhelmed" that their jobs often fell to police to do.</p>
        
            <p>While it is a space age for communication technology, the disaster response struggled with comms systems.</p>
        
            <p>"Different communications platforms remain a barrier - currently rely largely on phone and email. Not efficient," the debrief said.</p>
        
            <p>"AoG [all-of-government] remained siloed and this had an impact."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has reported extensively on agencies lacking a common operating platform or picture (a COP) to allow hundreds or thousands of users to collaborate online, almost in real time, as other countries do.</p>
        
            <p>The debrief also goes there, recommending that police "continue to raise lack of common operating and communications platform with NEMA and DPMC [Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet] as part of Catastrophic Readiness Planning work programme".</p>
        
            <p>Various police technology upgrades have been paused, reduced or dumped due to budget constraints, including upgrade of the technology behind the 111 system.</p>
        
            <p>The government said in April it would consider all the various reviews over coming months as it also worked on new emergency management legislation, and also pointed to more co-ordinated responses to more recent emergencies - although these were much smaller ones, such as the Christchurch Port Hills fire.</p>
