            <p>A leading oceanographer says ships and boats may be behind an increase in whale and dolphin strandings.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has the highest rate of beached mammals in the world.</p>
        
            <p>The founder of Mission Blue, Sylvia Earle, said there were documented cases of the effects of high sound volumes.</p>
        
            <p>She told The Future of Facts conference in Manila that motorised vessels were causing a cacophony of noise which might be damaging communication channels that whales used.</p>
        
            <p>She also called for a ban on deep sea mining, saying we were "squandering the chance" to protect one of the last bastions of diversity.</p>
        
            <p>The government has rejected calls for a ban, and critics have called its strategy a love letter to offshore mining companies.</p>
        
            <p>Resource Minister Shane Jones described the opposition as a "tiny group of green cultists" and argued deep sea mining would create regional jobs and move the country away from relying on minerals extracted overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Earle said it was a crucial time for recognising safe operating boundaries in the marine environment.</p>
        
            <p>Gill Bonnett travelled to the Philippines with the assistance of the Asia New Zealand Foundation.</p>
