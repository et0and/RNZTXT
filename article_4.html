            <p>The husband of an Invercargill woman found dead at Lake Hāwea last year has formally pleaded not guilty to her murder.</p>
        
            <p>Karen Gaylene White, 60, died at her Lake Hāwea property on 8 March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>In November, eight months after her death, police launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, police charged Robert Joseph White with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>The 61-year-old appeared in the High Court at Christchurch via audio-visual link this morning.</p>
        
            <p>White entered a not guilty plea to the murder charge through his lawyer Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Dunningham remanded him on bail.</p>
        
            <p>White's death was initially treated as unexplained while officers worked to establish what had happened before her death.</p>
        
            <p>In December, police said White was the victim of a significant assault and they believed people in the Lake Hāwea area had important information.</p>
        
            <p>Robert White's trial is set down for six weeks and will start in April 2027.</p>
