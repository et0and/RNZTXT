            <p>A major clean-up is underway at Northland's Waipoua Settlement as residents return after last week's ferocious forest fire.</p>
        
            <p>Iwi leader Snow Tane said about a third of the evacuees returned on Sunday night and by Tuesday about two-thirds were back in their homes.</p>
        
            <p>Those who had yet to return were worried about the possibility of another flare-up and particularly about the health effects of lingering smoke.</p>

            <p>"There are still some concerns around the potential for the fire to spark back up again, and in particular about smoke inhalation. That's a very real risk with some of the whānau there having respiratory issues."</p>
        
            <p>Tane, who manages Te Roroa Development Group and owns a house in the settlement, said a major clean-up was now underway.</p>
        
            <p>No homes were damaged by fire but the settlement's water supply had been destroyed and roofs were blanketed in ash.</p>
        
            <p>Some homes had sustained smoke damage indoors because the occupants had no time to close windows as they fled the rapidly advancing flames.</p>

            <p>Rather than using individual rainwater tanks, homes in the settlement were connected to a single water system that supplied the entire valley.</p>
        
            <p>"That was right in the middle of where the fire ripped through, so that's been destroyed."</p>
        
            <p>Tane said water was drawn from a freshwater source, filtered and pumped into three holding tanks, and then reticulated through the settlement.</p>
        
            <p>"The tanks are still there, but the infrastructure around them's gone and the pump shed that had that had our filtering system, that's gone. So there's no drinking water now."</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, until the system could be rebuilt, Te Roroa was providing residents with safe drinking water.</p>
        
            <p>Tane said the firefighting effort was "looking really good" with firefighter numbers further reduced today, and the only concern was possible high winds on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency's focus continued to be on dampening down hot spots across the 91-hectare fire ground.</p>
        
            <p>Incident controller Phil Larcombe said 56 firefighters, four tankers and two diggers were on the ground Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Contract and Department of Conservation crews will keep mopping up the blaze for the rest of this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to thank the local community and Te Roroa for their manaakitanga while we've been here. Thanks too for all the messages of support for our crews, they're greatly appreciated."</p>
        
            <p>A total fire ban was now in force across the west and north of Northland.</p>

            <p>Larcombe said that meant no outdoor fires were allowed and all existing fire permits had been revoked.</p>
