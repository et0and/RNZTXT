            <p>Some New Zealand companies have started offering jobs to migrants who've been laid off after the closure of labour hire company the ELE Group.</p>
        
            <p>More than 1000 permanent staff, casual workers and contractors have been hit after five companies in the group went into receivership last week.</p>
        
            <p>Dennis Maga from First Union said at least 250 staff members are migrants on work visas.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 of those workers had been offered new jobs and were waiting to apply for new visas after the Christmas break, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Maga said groceries and vouchers were also being delivered to the workers across Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>He said he'd been told Immigration New Zealand had set up a special team to assist these workers with the visas.</p>
