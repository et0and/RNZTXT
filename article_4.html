            <p>Cases of Covid-19 are down on last week, as experts warn of a summer wave approaching.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 889 new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand over the week to Monday, and seven further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>There were 106 cases in hospital, with the number in intensive care unavailable.</p>
        
            <p>The highest number of cases was in Canterbury, followed by Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago professor Michael Baker told Sunday Morning it was easier to reduce transmission in summer, but summer waves could still be very harmful.</p>
        
            <p>"The trouble with these waves isn't so much that the new subvariants that are causing them are more harmful, it's mainly that they just infect a whole lot more people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of deaths might increase from, say, five a week up to maybe 30 or 35 per week. And we're going to get more cases of long Covid."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said people had become "very complacent", and while the Covid-19 pandemic had officially ended in May 2023, there are still two waves - a winter and a summer one - that can cause a lot of harm.</p>
        
            <p>"We all want this to go away. I mean, it's been very disruptive and we can't wish it away," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Health NZ reported 917 new cases and five deaths.</p>
