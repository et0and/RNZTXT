            <p>An Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Wellington was diverted to Christchurch on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Flight-tracking website Flight Radar 24 showed flight NZ405 circled over the Cook Strait before heading south to Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ405 from Auckland to Wellington diverted to Christchurch this morning due to a hydraulic system issue," an airline spokesperson told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"This meant the aircraft required a longer runway for landing. The safety of our people and our customers is our number one priority. Impacted customers will be re-accommodated on the next available service."</p>
