        <h2>Te Whatu Ora hits milestone as 1 million self bowel testing kits processed</h2>
        <p>
The self-test helps detect bowel cancer early which makes the disease much easier to treat, Te Whatu Ora says.

            <p>One million bowel testing kits have been returned and processed as part of Te Whatu Ora's cancer screening programme.</p>
        
            <p>Eligible New Zealanders between the ages of 60 and 74 are sent self-test kits every two years.</p>
        
            <p>"The bowel screening test is easy to do and can be completed in the privacy of your own home," the programme's clinical lead Dr Susan Parry said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"The test can help detect bowel cancer early before you have any symptoms."</p>
        
            <p>Around 3300 New Zealanders are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and more than 1200 died from it.</p>
        
            <p>But Te Whatu Ora said it was much easier to treat if discovered early.</p>
        
            <p>"Reaching the milestone of 1 million returned bowel screening test kits is testament to our commitment to provide accessible, effective screening, but we aren't stopping there," Parry said.</p>
        
            <p>The agency aimed to make it easier for people to access the kits.</p>
        
            <p>"We know getting these kits in people's hands, along with the right information and support, is a crucial factor to increasing participation rates, particularly for Māori," Te Aka Whai Ora's deputy chief executive Selah Hart said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's encouraging to see over 70,000 eligible Māori have completed the test since the programme started."</p>
        
            <p>Hart said people could access information about bowel screening through the Ministry of Health's Time to Screen website.</p>
