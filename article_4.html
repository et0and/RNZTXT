            <p>A large fire at a car-scrapping yard in the Auckland suburb of Takanini has been contained and firefighters are working on extinguishing hot spots.</p>
        
            <p>Lala, who lives in nearby Parehurehure, said she could hear "very loud explosions" and see the flames getting larger and brighter on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>"Thick smoke filled the air very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"It took less than 15 minutes for the smoke to turn black and reach our area just above our roof.</p>
        
            <p>"We could hear endless sirens and helicopters making their way to the scene."</p>

            <p>The fire on Tironui Road was spotted about 11pm.</p>
        
            <p>Lala said the fire had "definitely" got smaller by midnight, and looked as if it had been contained.</p>
        
            <p>"There's currently lots of flashing red fire truck lights."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Fire and Emergency said crews were working to extinguish the blaze and there were 19 trucks in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a large Fire and Emergency presence on Tironui Road and on Walters Road. People are advised to avoid the area to allow Fire and Emergency crews to work.</p>
        
            <p>"There is smoke in the area. People are advised to stay inside, close all windows and doors and turn off air conditioning."</p>
        
            <p>By 6am on Monday, FENZ said the fire was contained and people could go return to their normal activities.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator would return to the site later on Monday morning.</p>
