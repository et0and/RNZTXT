            <p>Heavy rain watches have been issued for parts of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>They cover the Westland District ranges, the Buller district, Tasman north-west of Motueka, the Nelson Lakes, the Bryant Range and the Rai Valley, as well as the ranges of Marlborough north-west of the inland Kaikoura Range.</p>
        
            <p>The clockwise  flow around low pressure in the Tasman will tug moisture (and warmth) from the tropics.[Note the distinct connection the rain has to the tropics & sub-tropics].Heavy rain will impact the western South Island from late Wed & the North Island from late Thu. pic.twitter.com/8pOOzk60Mp</p>
        
            <p>MetService warns people in those areas to ensure their drains and gutters are clear to prepare for heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>People should avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously, it advises.</p>
        
            <p>MetService says the watches are likely to be upgraded to warnings on Wednesday morning, for everywhere except the Nelson Lakes.</p>
