            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) has announced the options it is exploring to reinstate walking access to Cathedral Cove in the Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>The track was closed in February 2023 after extreme weather events caused a myriad of slips.</p>
        
            <p>DOC Hauraki Waikato Taranaki regional director Tinaka Mearns said the land across the reserve had continued to move since the initial storms.</p>
        
            <p>"The continued land movement has made it challenging to identify a simple walking solution at a level of risk acceptable for the type of casual visitor who generally goes there."</p>
        
            <p>For walking access to the beach, three options were under consideration.</p>
        
            <p>One is a short-term fix, which would include construction of new steps and a boardwalk to reinstate a section of the existing track, while the two others would be long-term repairs involving installation of new infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Mearns said the two long-term options would also require significant investment and the possible installation of a cantilevered staircase and steps to the beach.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, those options would take longer to design, procure and complete, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Other options explored were reinstating the Hahei short walk, stabilisation of the current Grange Road entrance and looking at a short-term walk over private farmland.</p>
