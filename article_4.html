            <p>A small town school production is reaching for the stars with For Today, a musical featuring iconic Kiwi songs from a golden era in New Zealand music.</p>
        
            <p>Cambridge High School will be the latest of many to put on the show since it was first created by Hamish Arthur in 2006.</p>
        
            <p>The story revolves around David Miller, a once promising rugby player who went to Southland for a year to escape the aftermath of his friend's death.</p>
        
            <p>Now he's back and has joined the choir to get close to new girl and singer Sophie.</p>
        
            <p>The storyline has all the excitement of teenage romance, comedy and drama, as well as touching on tragic themes.</p>
        
            <p>But it's the all-Kiwi music that makes it unique with hits from Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga, Goodshirt, Goldenhorse and Split Enz that will have a generation of parents feeling nostalgic.</p>
        
            <p>There are 17 songs in the production and it features live music from the school's band with students singing solos, duets, alongside an ensemble.</p>
        
            <p>David is played by 16-year-old Liam Dobson who performed in the school's last show, The Addams Family, in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He has also acted outside school in productions at The Gaslight Theatre in Cambridge and Riverlea Theatre in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>But he's never sung before and says the singing and dancing attracted him to the production despite singing in front of an audience being "terrifying".</p>

            <p>Anna Crouchman, who plays David's younger sister Ronnie, is no stranger to singing, having just released her own song on Spotify, called 'Criminal'.</p>
        
            <p>The 16-year-old said while she still gets nervous, she loves music and was looking forward to opening night on Wednesday. (May 1)</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be cool to get all different aspects of the show together and get an audience which adds another layer of excitement and fun."</p>
        
            <p>Vinnie Proebstel plays antagonist Jordan Jones and said since being involved with the musical 'Verona 'by Elemeno P had become his new favourite song.</p>
        
            <p>The 14-year-old had learned to perfect a "stable body" before singing, thanks to voice coach Jayne Tankersley.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely nerve-wracking but I've got way better at it over practice," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Probably having a stable body while singing makes it way easier to sing loud. The way she taught us is to jump and when you land that's your stable position."</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen-year-old Erin Bouwer described her character Alex Edwards as being full of life and energy, and not caring about what others think.</p>
        
            <p>All four agreed Alex, one of two class clowns in the show, was their favourite character.</p>
        
            <p>Bouwer said the foursome all had a love of theatre and performing arts and for some of the 43 cast and band members, it was their first school production.</p>

            <p>Tankersley, a soprano, said the classic Kiwi pop songs made the show unique.</p>
        
            <p>"The songs don't necessarily come from a musical theatre sound so that's been quite interesting to work that in."</p>
        
            <p>She said while most of the students had never heard of the songs before, all released between 1981 and 2003, their parents would.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very cool to be able to do New Zealand music. I think the people that are going to enjoy it the most will probably be the kids' parents. Because they will know all of the songs."</p>

Show director Toni Garson says hundreds of hours of rehearsals have gone into the production.

            <p>Show director Toni Garson said For Today was chosen from five possible musicals and it had exposed the students to different music than what they might usually listen to.</p>
        
            <p>"They've definitely been loving it. They've been listening to it at home and listening to other songs by those Kiwi bands and it's opened them to a new generation of Kiwi music for them."</p>
        
            <p>Garson estimated there had been hundreds of hours of work gone into the show since auditions last year, with rehearsals beginning in February as well as band practices, choreography, voice coaching, and costume and set design.</p>
        
            <p>For Today will run from 1 to 4 May in the Cambridge High School hall with tickets available from iTicket.</p>
