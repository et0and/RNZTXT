            <p>Aotearoa's first-ever festival dedicated to celebrating te mana o te reo Māori in Heretaunga/Hastings has seen massive success, drawing over 7000 supporters.</p>
        
            <p>Led by Ngāti Kahungunu in partnership with Hastings District Council and Kauwaka, Toitū Te Reo was a two-day event created to foster and provide a safe space to karawhiua (give it a go).</p>
        
            <p>It took place at Toitoi Hawke's Bay Arts & Events Centre in Hastings CBD, from 8-9 August.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu iwi chairperson Bayden Barber said it was a "positive" two days that celebrated all things Māori.</p>
        
            <p>"It was an expression of strength, strength in our language, strength in our culture, and an opportunity to expose that to people that may not have been exposed to it in the past."</p>
        
            <p>Central to the festival is Te Reo ki Tua, a Māori language symposium which featured a variety of keynote speakers at different stages of their reo journeys.</p>

            <p>Toitū Te Reo also incorporated dedicated panels led by mātanga reo/reo experts.</p>
        
            <p>Barber said a special part of the kaupapa was sharing the greatness of te reo with all people.</p>
        
            <p>"People need to feel comfortable to come and partake. If they're not going to feel comfortable, they won't come.</p>
        
            <p>"From what I've seen, people have felt comfortable."</p>
        
            <p>In a video posted to social media by Māori broadcaster Matai Rangi Smith, a group of tangata tiriti could be seen singing a rendition of waiata Māori, 'Mauria mai te aroha.'</p>
        
            <p>The caption ended with, "Exemplars of how we can live together as one and embrace our reo in harmony (literally)".</p>
        
            <p>Barber said it was amazing to see crowds of Pākehā eager to hop on the reo Māori waka and said the event succeeded in allowing people from all te reo Māori levels to come together to celebrate te mana o te reo Māori.</p>

            <p>"Sometimes people can get a bit overwhelmed and the te reo space can be a little bit intimidating, but this is a very free and open space for all people of all levels to enjoy and to be exposed to te reo Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Barber said there is a lot of "heavy" kaupapa surrounding Aotearoa in relation to government policies around te ao Māori and while Toitū Te Reo is a "happy" kaupapa, it is still political.</p>
        
            <p>"Coming to one place to celebrate our language and culture is sending a statement, not just to the kawanatanga but the whole community of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not going anywhere; we've got a younger population coming through and they are learning and becoming fluent in their language and that's our tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, Barber said while discussions still need to take place, Ngāti Kahungunu plans to continue hosting Toitū Te Reo for the next couple of years to establish it firmly.</p>
        
            <p>He said other iwi had expressed interest in bringing a similar kaupapa to their rohe, and sharing this initiative with other parts of Aotearoa will "no doubt" be part of the long-term plan.</p>
