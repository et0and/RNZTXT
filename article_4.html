            <p>A fundraiser for the family of a New Zealander who drowned in Australia has raised more than $2500 in 15 hours.</p>
        
            <p>Seti Tuaopepe drowned at Penrith Beach in west Sydney on Tuesday afternoon while paddleboarding with his children.</p>
        
            <p>New South Wales Police said they received a report that Tuaopepe had disappeared underwater at 2.35pm and didn't resurface.</p>
        
            <p>His body was found later that evening, at 6.15pm, following a lengthy search involving divers and a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>A GoFundMe page set up by Taylah Lagaaia, a relative of Tuaopepe's wife, is asking for $10,000 to support the family, including five children.</p>
        
            <p>Lagaaia revealed Tuaopepe was trying to save his kids when he drowned.</p>
        
            <p>"Seti was a dedicated father and husband who would sacrifice all for his family," she wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"His kids meant the world to him, and he cherished the life they had together."</p>
