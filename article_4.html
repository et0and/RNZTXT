            <p>Police have arrested a man after a child was hit in the head with a shovel as he was leaving a protest in Auckland's Aotea Square Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Several thousand people gathered in Auckland's Aotea Square Sunday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza over the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>
        
            <p>The assault occurred behind the Auckland Town Hall as crowds dispersed.</p>
        
            <p>The victim is currently in a serious condition in Starship Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this incident has been incredibly distressing and are supporting the victim and their family," police Superintendent Sunny Patel said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Prior to this attack, the man arrested had been receiving support of the mental health services.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are still working to establish the events that occurred in the lead up to this incident and we are speaking with a number of witnesses."</p>
        
            <p>Several thousand people attended the protests at Aotea Square, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Although police made three arrests, the demonstrations were mainly peaceful."</p>
