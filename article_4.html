            <p>KiwiRail has confirmed warm weather caused the fault which shut down the Wellington region's trains and left some passengers stranded onboard.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday afternoon, all rail services in and out of the capital were replaced by buses due to an overhead powerline failure.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 140 passengers were stuck onboard three trains stopped between stations. For some, it took almost an hour to disembark.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail metros general manager Jon Knight said consecutive days of warm weather caused the overhead powerlines to expand.</p>
        
            <p>The faults were related to insulator and weight tension mechanisms, which had exceeded their operating limits and resulted in outages, Knight said.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail had rectified all faults, meaning there were no safety risks, but the operator was conducting a full investigation into Wednesday's shut down, he said.</p>
