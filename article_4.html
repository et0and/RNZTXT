            <p>Christchurch police have "serious concerns" for a missing Chinese visitor who has not been seen since the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Ping Lyu, a visitor to New Zealand from China, was last seen on Stewart Street in the Christchurch suburb of Addington on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the 41-year-old has no known relatives in the country and does not speak English.</p>
        
            <p>"Our main concern is that no one has seen or heard from her since Saturday afternoon, and she could be anywhere," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"She is a recent arrival from China and it's possible she is travelling independently around the country, but we want to establish that she's safe.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who has seen Ping, or who has information on her whereabouts, is asked to call police on 111 immediately and reference the file number 240525/9699."</p>
