        <h2>Area schools brace for busy year</h2>
        <p>
Some schools get few, if any, New Zealand-trained teacher applicants, with several employing LAT (limited authority to teach) teachers to fill staffing gaps.

            <p>Area schools are coming up with innovative ways to overcome the challenge of isolation and a wave of curriculum changes.</p>
        
            <p>Hurunui College board of trustees chairperson Robin McKinlay said area schools tended to be small and mostly in rural areas, making it difficult to attract staff.</p>
        
            <p>Being year 1-13 schools, area schools also tend to be hit by all government changes, including the curriculum changes across all year levels.</p>
        
            <p>While Hurunui College at Hawarden is not as isolated as some schools, McKinlay, a New Zealand Area Schools Association executive member, said he is aware of the difficulties in attracting staff.</p>
        
            <p>Some schools get few, if any, New Zealand-trained teacher applicants, with several employing LAT (limited authority to teach) teachers to fill staffing gaps.</p>
        
            <p>"A LAT teacher is someone who has a trade or a skill and is trained by the school to be a teacher over a number of years," McKinlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are not pushing through the numbers of teachers we need, so I think the LAT initiative is a great one. Some people are natural born teachers."</p>
        
            <p>Hurunui College will be without its principal again this year, with Stephen Beck completing a two-year secondment as the Ministry of Education's area schools leadership advisor.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a good opportunity for him and for our team," McKinlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff have all stepped up and had a lot of learnings and now we can put those learnings into place."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy principal Jane Marsh will continue as acting principal for another year.</p>
        
            <p>Beck is playing an important role in being a voice for area schools, McKinlay said</p>
        
            <p>"Stephen is still very much a part of our school and he is just a phone call away for Jane and I."</p>
        
            <p>While there are no major projects at Hurunui College this year, the board and staff will be busy navigating the curriculum changes, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Beck said he travelled around the South Island several times last year to meet with area school principals and boards, and connected with North Island schools online.</p>
        
            <p>He expects a busy year ahead supporting new principals and school boards at Lawrence, Karamea and Reefton, and acting principals at Cheviot and Collingwood.</p>
        
            <p>The turnover is mainly due to retirements, but principals are also under pressure with the changes.</p>
        
            <p>"My role is to support principals and boards through these changes. The business as usual stuff can demand a lot of your time and finding the time to do the change is difficult.</p>
        
            <p>"Clarity is what they're looking for, with the amount of information coming through - what needs to happen and when.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there is any principal who doesn't support the changes, but it is the speed of change."</p>
        
            <p>Beck said graduate teachers should consider working in an area school.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a lot of benefits to working in an area school, but you need to be flexible as you will be in a small department with a small number of teachers.</p>
        
            <p>"You can have a PE (physical education) teacher teaching students from years 4 to 13, so it can be a challenge, but it can also be enjoyable."</p>
