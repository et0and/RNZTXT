            <p>A fire crew remained overnight at a fire brought under control on Saturday on a steep hillside above Lake Dunstan in Central Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) incident controller Bobby Lamont said fire-fighters from local volunteer brigades and helicopter pilots did a tremendous job in what he called horrific winds to limit the fire to just three hectares.</p>
        
            <p>The pilots were armed with monsoon buckets.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, near the Clyde Dam, reignited late afternoon (4.20pm) from an earlier fire started by fireworks on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>Further fire crews will be back Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere in the South Island, fire-fighters were continuing to fight fires at Templeton in the Selwyn District and Glenham in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said anyone considering lighting a fire outdoors should check online to see if any restrictions were in place.</p>
