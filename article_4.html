            <p>For a bloke who turns 85 years old this year, Batman is holding up pretty well.</p>
        
            <p>The caped crusader has been reinvented countless times since his 1939 debut, and that's the secret of his longevity.</p>
        
            <p>You want a friendly Batman? Adam West's day-glo 1960s TV series fits the bill. Bold and epic? There's plenty of animated series to choose from. Dark and gritty? Pick up Frank Miller's classic Dark Knight Returns graphic novel. Somewhere in the middle, with lots of Gothic architecture? Tim Burton's unique 1989 Batman still holds up very well.</p>
        
            <p>Those Bat-villains just keep on going, too. Batman probably has the best rogues' gallery in comic books - a twisted collection of eccentric obsessives strongly defined enough to take the spotlight in many of their own solo comics and movies. Stars who have played the Joker have now won two Academy Awards for Best Actor. For many, battling the Bat as the Riddler, Catwoman or Clayface is still a feather in the cap.</p>

            <p>The world of Batman has proved itself ripe for interpretation, whether it's Robert Pattinson's brooding emo turn in 2022's The Batman or villainous Harley Quinn starring in her own filthily funny and irreverent animated series.</p>
        
            <p>But a new HBO spin-off of that 2022 Batman movie serves up one of the darkest takes yet on Batman's Gotham City, starring Colin Farrell reprising his role as the scheming gangster Penguin.</p>
        
            <p>The Penguin has always kind of been the also-ran of Bat-villains, despite hanging about for decades. A pudgy, monocle-wearing bird-obsessed weirdo with trick umbrellas, he was memorably brought to life by a cacklingly campy Burgess Meredith in the 1960s TV series, while Danny DeVito in Tim Burton's Batman Returns was a waterlogged, creepy outcast.</p>
        
            <p>Wipe all that out of the memory with Farrell's sinister "Oz" - who loathes the nickname Penguin - a scarred and crippled mobster who nearly stole the show in The Batman. There are no trick umbrellas here.</p>
        
            <p>An unrecognisable Farrell, looking like an overweight Robert DeNiro run through a smudgy photocopier, played Penguin in The Batman film, as a seedy Goodfellas-style criminal.</p>
        
            <p>It was a magnetic performance with its visceral sleaze, and over the new eight-part miniseries Farrell's snarling take on this most ridiculous of Bat-villains makes a good case for why you should never overlook a penguin.</p>
        
            <p>In The Penguin, which picks right up after the near-destruction of Gotham City in The Batman's climax, Farrell gets a showcase a world away from big budget MCU-style comic adventures.</p>
        
            <p>Farrell feels consistently underrated as an actor, despite some excellent performances in films like After Yang or In Bruges and an Oscar nomination for The Banshees of Inisherin. He gives the oily Penguin a sense of wounded soul despite working under piles of makeup and padding to create the character's waddling presence.</p>
        
            <p>This isn't your childhood Batman and definitely isn't for kids - while the Bat himself is only referred to in passing, The Penguin is a deliciously nasty slice of noir, filled with F-bombs and shockingly violent deaths, far more The Sopranos than Batman Forever.</p>

            <p>The Penguin is scrambling to take advantage of the chaos in Gotham's criminal underworld after the events of The Batman. He's nowhere near a "supervillain" yet, but he's got big dreams, and ropes into his labyrinthine plans a conflicted teenager (Rhenzy Feliz) and the disturbed daughter of deceased crimelord Carmine Falcone, Sofia (Cristin Milioti).</p>
        
            <p>The Penguin works best when it focuses on Farrell, but Milioti (Palm Springs, Black Mirror) is also striking channeling that good old Gotham City criminal intensity into an unpredictable performance. A rogue's gallery of prominent actors like Mark Strong, Shohreh Aghdashloo and House of Cards' Michael Kelly fill out the cast.</p>
        
            <p>Over The Penguin's eight episodes, a tangled web of double-crosses and violent heists unfolds, with Oz the Penguin scrambling over dead bodies as he hopes to make his mark on the world. While it may help set the stage for the 2026 sequel to The Batman, it also very much stands on its own even if you're not a Bat-fan.</p>
        
            <p>There's no Batman, no Robin in sight, but you honestly don't miss the Dark Knight too much with bad guys this watchable.</p>
        
            <p>* The Penguin is available starting at 4pm on 20 September on NEON, with weekly episodes from Mondays starting 30 September. It will also be on Sky's SoHo channel Mondays from 23 September at 8.30pm.</p>
