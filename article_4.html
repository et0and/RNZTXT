            <p>Motorists heading into Auckland city are advised to expect delays following a single vehicle crash on the Southern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>One person has been taken to hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi NZTA said all lanes were open at 2.25pm, but that motorists could continue to expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another crash on the southwestern motorway partially blocked the right southbound lane between Walmsley Rd off-ramp and Walmsley Rd on-ramp earlier this afternoon, but Waka Kotahi advised all lanes were now open.</p>
        
            <p>But motorists have been advised there could still be some delays.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, traffic is flowing well through Hamilton except for a slow patch around Taupiri.</p>
        
            <p>And there are pockets of slow traffic in central Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>The place to be on the roads this afternoon, is the South Island, where there are no major headaches for motorists.</p>
