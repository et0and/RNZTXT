            <p>The mother of two-year-old Arapera Fia, who was brutally murdered during Auckland's 2021 Covid lockdown, has been sentenced to home detention for her part in the little girl's death.</p>
        
            <p>Nikitalove Tekotia was sentenced on Tuesday at the High Court in Auckland to 12 months' home detention.</p>
        
            <p>She earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter by failing to protect her daughter from injury.</p>
        
            <p>Arapera was found badly injured at a property in Weymouth, south Auckland on the evening of 31 October 2021.</p>
        
            <p>She was rushed to Starship Children's Hospital but died hours later, just after midnight the next day.</p>
        
            <p>Tekotia's partner, Tyson Brown, was in 2023 jailed for life for her murder, with a minimum non-parole period of 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>During his trial, the jury heard he brutally beat the toddler, leaving her covered in bruises from head to toe.</p>
        
            <p>At his sentencing, the court heard from Arapera's father Malcolm Fia, who said Brown had taken his "legacy" away.</p>
        
            <p>"I will never get the chance to hold [Arapera] again or to take her to her first day of school, graduating from high school, her prom, her 21st, everything."</p>
        
            <p>He said he spent hours by her grave, sometimes sleeping there.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Warrick Adkin said in a statement on Tuesday that Tekotia's sentencing marked the end of a case that was often challenging for the officers involved.</p>
        
            <p>"Investigating a homicide is a responsibility not taken lightly, especially in cases when it involves the death of an innocent child in suspicious circumstances."</p>
        
            <p>Adkin acknowledged the investigation team, "many of whom have families of their own", for their diligence.</p>
        
            <p>He also acknowledged Arapera's whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"[They] cooperated and assisted police right from the outset, so that we could find justice for this innocent young girl," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today's sentencing brings what has been a challenging case to a close, and I wish Arapera's whānau well as they move forward with their lives."</p>
