            <p>Abdul Aziz Wahabzadah appeared at the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting with intent to injure, and opted for a judge-alone trial, which has been set for next March.</p>
        
            <p>He intends to represent himself.</p>
        
            <p>Aziz was awarded a New Zealand Cross for bravery in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>During the mosque attack in 2019 he picked up a discarded gun, chased the terrorist and threw it at his departing car, smashing the back window.</p>
