            <p>A young woman has made history after winning the tractor pull event at Northland Field Days in Dargaville over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The tractor pull event sees competitors drive a tractor over a 100 metre course pulling a weighted sledge.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers are tested on their skill in obtaining the best pulling speed and fastest time.</p>
        
            <p>Ella Martin is the first woman to win the competition in it's almost 40-year history.</p>
        
            <p>Coming from a family of contractor tractor and truck drivers, she learned to drive a tractor with her older brothers' help at age 12.</p>
        
            <p>The now 17-year-old first entered the competition last year after watching them compete.</p>
        
            <p>Martin said most of the young men she was competing against in this year's race were her friends.</p>
        
            <p>"Being the only girl was quite intimidating," she admitted.</p>
        
            <p>After winning her first race she started to feel better though and was "stoked" to be named a finalist.</p>

            <p>Taking out the top title left her "quite speechless" and with the "biggest smile on her face".</p>
        
            <p>Martin attributed her win to a solid start.</p>
        
            <p>"It all sort of depends on how you start. Because if you have a good start and make all the right gear changes up the track you can be pretty successful. The start is probably key to everything."</p>
        
            <p>She has been building her experience working part-time driving tractors for friends which is helping fund her midwifery studies at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sort of ready to get back into a tractor," she said. "It's pretty cool being able to drive a tractor and it's good to have it to fall back on when I go home for breaks and that."</p>
        
            <p>Martin encouraged other people, especially young women, to give it a go.</p>
