            <p>Two teenagers have been critically injured, and a third has also been hospitalised, after fleeing police in a stolen vehicle and crashing into a ditch in West Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was first spotted together with another stolen vehicle, near the Waterview tunnel, after midnight.</p>
        
            <p>The police eagle helicopter monitored both vehicles as they travelled towards Māngere.</p>
        
            <p>One came to a stop on Puketutu Island, and two people were arrested.</p>
        
            <p>The second travelled to Onehunga, and failed to stop when signalled on Galway Street.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they didn't pursue the vehicle, but kept it under observation via the camera network as it headed west on State Highway 16 towards Kumeū.</p>
        
            <p>"A Police unit was in the area as it entered the township and could see the vehicle still travelling at speed in the distance," acting superintendent Dave Glossop said.</p>
        
            <p>Glossop said the vehicle failed to follow diversions for roadworks and entered a closed part of a road near Huapai, before crashing into a ditch.</p>
        
            <p>Two teenagers in the front of the vehicle had critical injuries and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Their their injuries were not thought to be life-threatening, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A third teenager had moderate injuries and was also taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The incident has been reported to the Independent Police Conduct Authority, and police are also undertaking a wider investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed in a statement the vehicle was not pursued by police at any point, however due to the vehicle failing to stop for police near Onehunga, the IPCA had to be notified "as standard procedure".</p>
