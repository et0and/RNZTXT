            <p>Ten pilot whales have stranded at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Eight were still alive after becoming stranded on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation said it would aim to refloat the whales at high tide on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Golden Bay Operations Manager Ross Trotter says he's unsure if it's the same pod that beached at the spit a month ago, but says it's clear this is not the pod's first stranding.</p>
        
            <p>"They are showing signs of having been sunburnt and have healed over, so possibly in the last few weeks they have been beached somewhere else."</p>
        
            <p>Trotter said there were plenty of volunteers keeping the whales cool, with the aim to refloat the pod around high tide this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>A pod of pilot whales was refloated several times in December.</p>
        
            <p>Not all of them survived.</p>
        
            <p>Among those that did, some were seen in the area even after being refloated again.</p>
