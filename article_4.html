        <h2>Illegal high-powered e-scooters left unmonitored by authorities</h2>
        <p>
According to the Transport Agency Waka Kotahi, e-scooters cannot exceed 300 watts - that is less than a lawnmower - to qualify as "low-powered vehicles".

            <p>High-powered electric scooters are being driven illegally on roads and footpaths.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Transport Agency Waka Kotahi, e-scooters cannot exceed 300 watts - that is less than a lawnmower - to qualify as "low-powered vehicles", which don't have to be registered or licensed.</p>
        
            <p>At 300 watts, an e-scooter's top speed is about 35km/hr - but higher-wattage scooters, which can go nearly 100km/hr are in demand.</p>
        
            <p>It is not known how many overpowered e-scooters are on the roads because they don't have to be licensed or registered.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland e-scooter retailer Storm Rides managing director Andrew Altmann has ridden over-powered e-scooters to and from work for years.</p>
        
            <p>"I go up the road and get my lunch on it, I take my little dog on one, it's a little sit-down scooter.</p>
        
            <p>"But oooh it's over 300 watts! Illegal! Oh, I'm a criminal," Altmann laughed.</p>

            <p>Storm Rides stocks the Kaabo Wolf King GT Pro 72V, powered by two 2000-watt motors, which is 12 times more powerful than the "low-powered" class limitation and boasts a top speed of nearly 100km/hr.</p>
        
            <p>Altmann agreed powerful scooters belonged on the road, not the footpath.</p>
        
            <p>But in his view, the road rules should updated to make this legal, because there was currently no way to register the machines.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really silly that all of a sudden it turns from the slowest silliest thing that you are not going to be able to ride up the hill, into something that is a high-powered crazy machine that goes 100km/h and is going to kill you," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The authorities should be monitoring e-scooter speeds, just like cars, instead of restricting the power, which was hard to police, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I can probably think of at least half a dozen police officers who own these high-powered scooters. They ride them themselves, they love them."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not aware of off-duty officers using the illegal overpowered e-scooters in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said police did not routinely monitor vehicle wattage and were unable to say whether anyone had been ticketed for breaches.</p>
        
            <p>Petone resident Chris Totton commutes from the Hutt Valley into the capital on his high-powered 2400-watt e-scooter with a top speed of 65km/h.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cheaper, gets me around quite well. I can travel the same speed as vehicles on the road, so I am saving on petrol, saving pretty much on time," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, e-scooter rules were in a grey area, which created some safety risks, and the road code should be updated, Totton said.</p>
        
            <p>He recently had a close shave himself.</p>
        
            <p>"Came around the corner the car decided to move left into my lane and very much cut me off, to the point where I had to break hard enough that the back wheel came off the ground," he said.</p>

            <p>Living Streets Aotearoa pedestrian safety campaigner Chris Teo-Sherrell said high-powered e-scooters were a menace on roads and footpaths.</p>
        
            <p>He had seen one recently on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"I was going close to 50, it must have been doing 60-70. I have heard plenty of other stories like that too of people encountering that."</p>
        
            <p>The government and Transport Agency needed to take action, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have alerted NZTA and the government to this and nothing has been done about it, they have just basically ignored it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The problem was set to get worse, with more high-powered e-scooters being developed, he warned.</p>
        
            <p>In response to questions from RNZ, the Transport Agency said it was not illegal to import high-powered e-scooters into the country - but they could not be legally used on the road without registration or a driver's licence.</p>
        
            <p>Its website defines e-scooters above 300W as motor vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>However, they could not be operated on the road as they had "difficulty meeting the safety standards".</p>
        
            <p>The Waka Kotahi 2023 e-scooter safety review included the European Transport Council safety recommendations to "set a maximum 20km/h speed for private e-scooters at the factory."</p>
        
            <p>Since 2018, Waka Kotahi has twice-extended a five-year exemption for e-scooters to not be classed as motor vehicles, up for review in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>The low-powered classification excludes e-scooters from entry certification, registration, warrant of fitness, or driver licensing requirements.</p>
        
            <p>More than $30 million was claimed through ACC for e-scooter-related injuries from October 2018 to 2022.</p>
