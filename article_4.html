            <p>Police are investigating several incidents in Tasman where vehicles have had their petrol tanks drilled and drained while parked in Department of Conservation (DOC) carparks.</p>
        
            <p>In the last month there have been seven reports of petrol being drained from tanks in vehicles parked overnight in the Siberia Flat carpark near the Wanagapeka River (May 5-6), at the Flora Carpark in the Kahurangi National Park (5 May) and at the Hackett Hut carpark in the Aniseed Valley (27 April - 2 May).</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Bays area prevention manager Senior Sergeant Adam Ramsay said in most cases a hole had been drilled through the petrol tank and the fuel syphoned.</p>
        
            <p>"Most vehicle owners have only noticed the theft after leaving the carpark and realising their fuel tank is empty or significantly drained.</p>
        
            <p>"Inspection of the vehicles shows that in some cases the holes have been hurriedly patched with putty or chewing gum by the offender after draining the tank."</p>
        
            <p>Police are working with Department of Conservation and security contractors in an effort to identify the offender/s.</p>
        
            <p>Ramsay said there may be more incidents that have not been reported as they have gone unnoticed due to the efforts to patch the holes.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to hear from anyone who may have had their petrol stolen - or who had seen suspicious activity in those areas on the dates mentioned.</p>
