            <p>A man who killed a tourist who he mistakenly thought was trying to abduct his son near a Christchurch park has been jailed for two years.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty-year-old Mewa Singh, a visitor from India, died two days after he was attacked by a stranger outside Linwood Park in April 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Jayden Kahi pleaded guilty to Singh's manslaughter and was sentenced in front of a packed public gallery in the High Court at Christchurch this morning.</p>
        
            <p>In a victim impact statement read to the court, Singh's son said he was still struggling with the loss of his father.</p>
        
            <p>"The defendant has turned out lives upside down. Wherever we go and whatever we do, we will always miss our dad," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There were shouts of "love you" from the public gallery as Kahi was taken away after being sentenced.</p>
        
            <p>The summary of facts said Singh had been in New Zealand only four months before his death.</p>
        
            <p>It said in April 2023, Kahi left his seven-year-old son alone at Linwood park to teach him a lesson after he had refused to go home with him.</p>

            <p>When Kahi returned, he saw an unknown man, later identified as Singh, holding his son's hand near a bus stop and became "enraged".</p>
        
            <p>Kahi yelled out "that's my f***ing son", told the man to get his hands off his son and shoved the man, the summary said.</p>
        
            <p>The summary said Kahi then drove his son back to his ex-partner's house, where his son told him that the man was "trying to walk him to daddy's car".</p>
        
            <p>Kahi went back to Linwood Park and confronted Singh, accusing him of trying to abduct his son.</p>
        
            <p>He shoved Singh and delivered a "haymaker-style punch" to his jaw, and Singh fell and hit his head on the pavement.</p>
        
            <p>The summary said Singh suffered a skull fracture and internal bleeding and died at Christchurch Hospital two days later.</p>
        
            <p>At Kahi's sentencing, crown prosecutor Christina Hallaway said Kahi's offending had caused Singh's family "never-ending</p>
        
            <p>harm", and that they would continue to grieve for the rest of their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim had done nothing to provoke the confrontation. There is nothing to suggest the victim did anything but try to help the defendant's son," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Kahi's laywer, Anselm Williams, said his client had a great deal of remorse.</p>
        
            <p>"He's accepted his actions have caused the death of an individual," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said it was not a pre-meditated attack and Kahi acted impulsively.</p>
        
            <p>Kahi had been on electronic bail for about 16 months and during that time had engaged with his mental health treatment and a violence prevention programme, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Melanie Harland told Kahi there was no doubt that he was the aggressor in this situation.</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing at all to suggest he [Singh] did anything to his son apart from showing him kindness. The person was just trying to help a little boy, your son, who had been left at the park by you," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Your actions reveal a man who that day was quick to anger."</p>
        
            <p>However, she accepted that Kahi had been "upfront" with the police and others about what he had done.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Harland sentenced Kahi to two years imprisonment.</p>
