            <p>A Taylor Swift tour could have generated more than $70 million for New Zealand's economy, an expert says.</p>
        
            <p>Aotearoa was not included in Swift's Eras Tour lineup, with Kiwi fans instead flocking over the ditch to see the star at her Melbourne and Sydney shows.</p>
        
            <p>Most fans who spoke to Checkpoint before boarding a plane for Sydney spent between $1200 and $1500 all up on the trip, including tickets, flights, accommodation, dining and merchandise.</p>
        
            <p>One said he was "happy to spend as much as I'd spend on a car", while another said she spent more than $100 on bedazzling a bodysuit for the gig.</p>
        
            <p>"You'd be surprised at how expensive rhinestones can get," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Over $100 on rhinestones and sequins was not part of the plan, but no regrets."</p>
        
            <p>The fans surveyed said they each spent about $700 or $750 on return flights and between $200 and $400 on tickets, with the amount spent on accommodation varying based on how long they were staying in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>It was "a lot of money", one fan told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially as I only just started full-time work - as a student, it was pretty rough."</p>
        
            <p>Some estimates have put the financial gains from Swift's seven-night tour of Australia at nearly $1 billion.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Angel Zhong, a senior lecturer in finance at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, was more conservative, and said the Australian tour was expected to generate about $558 million.</p>
        
            <p>If she had played three nights in Auckland, that would have generated about $97.5 million, she told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>Swift could be expected to take home about $25 million of that, leaving the New Zealand economy with just over $70 million.</p>
        
            <p>Zhong said she had come to that conclusion by looking at the capacity of stadiums in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park - which last week claimed its resource consent had stopped it from hosting the Eras Tour - can host about 50,000 fans.</p>
        
            <p>"If she's holding a three-night concert during the tour, then we're talking about 150,000 participants," Zhong said.</p>
        
            <p>Then, Zhong looked at what concertgoers would likely spend on tickets, dining, travel, accommodation and merchandise, and came to an average of $650 per person.</p>
        
            <p>That might sound conservative, but many fans would be Auckland residents and would not need to pay for travel or accommodation, she said.</p>
        
            <p>After Australia, Swift will head to Singapore, where the country's Tourism Board reportedly paid about $4 million to the star to encourage her to play there.</p>
        
            <p>However, when questioned whether Aotearoa should have done the same, Zhong said it was not a simple case of $4 million in, $70 million out.</p>
        
            <p>To afford to see the Eras Tour amid a cost-of-living crisis, fans had to make "financial sacrifices", she told Checkpoint - cutting back elsewhere in order to spend on tickets, travel and merch.</p>
        
            <p>"So instead of buying good tomato sauce, you actually cut back on your spending by buying home brand tomato sauce to save money," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That means, maybe the direct impact or net impact on the economy will be less than the $70 million figure."</p>
        
            <p>Swift's final Sydney show is on Monday night.</p>
