            <p>Two men will appear in the Wellington District Court today charged with murder after a shooting in South Wairarapa over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>A man died on Saturday after he was found in a vehicle with a gunshot wound.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery came following a report of a shot or shots fired at a vehicle as it was driven out of a supermarket in the Wairarapa town of Featherston, sending emergency services rushing to the site, about 4pm that day.</p>
        
            <p>Police are not ruling out further charges against the pair, aged 23 and 25.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the people were known to each other, but police say they continue to investigate whether others may have been involved.</p>
        
            <p>They say there is no ongoing risk to the public, but there will be a continued police presence in South Wairapapa.</p>
        
            <p>Local MP for Wairapapa, National's Mike Butterick said the deadly shooting was "abhorrent", but the community will pull together.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was "appalled" by the "unacceptable" violence in a busy public place.</p>
        
            <p>Carterton Mayor Ron Mark also described the shooting as brazen.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report it happened near a busy supermarket in Featherston where families were shopping.</p>
        
            <p>"A busy place on a Saturday - with mums, and families, and kids all around the supermarket in that shopping area - cars and going in and out - there to be a couple of thugs and idiots firing off multiple rounds," Mark said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just unacceptable, totally unacceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Mark added there was "very little sympathy" for people who shoot each other.</p>
        
            <p>"People have had a guts full, they're over it.</p>
