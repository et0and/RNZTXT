            <p>Police are investigating reports that alcohol companies are giving away free drinks to university students in exchange for promotion on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, a Dunedin flat was reported to have received 280 1.2-litre bottles of alcoholic lemonade, and a Christchurch student was given six bottles for her 21st birthday party.</p>
        
            <p>The reports come as orientation weeks marking the start of the university year - more commonly known as Flo Week, followed by "O Week" - happen at universities around the motu.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they were continuing to investigate reports of alcohol giveaways.</p>
        
            <p>"However, we do not endorse this behaviour as there are strict regulations around the sale and supply of alcohol."</p>
        
            <p>Young people away from home for the first time and in large social gatherings were more vulnerable to alcohol harm, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Companies that did not comply with the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act may be prosecuted.</p>
        
            <p>But the police statement added that they aimed to strike a balance between enforcement and education with the public and liquor providers.</p>
        
            <p>"Police want everybody to have a good time while keeping themselves and others safe."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association said it was not aware of any problems with its students being targeted by alcohol advertising.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said liquor brands wanting to advertise with VUWSA were restricted, but gave no further details.</p>
        
            <p>"During O-Week, and at all times, we stress to our student body the importance of safe alcohol consumption," it said.</p>
