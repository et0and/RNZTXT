            <p>Wellington police will decide this morning if all officers should continue to carry guns following Tuesday's fatal gang shooting in Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>A temporary order for police to be armed - rather than just have weapons in their vehicles - has been in place since a 39-year-old man was shot dead in the suburb of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>The victim is believed to be Albert Enoka, who was reportedly a member of the Tribesmen gang and a former president of the Rebels Motorcyle Club's Christchurch chapter.</p>

            <p>Police are still hunting for the shooter, who they say also has gang affiliations.</p>
        
            <p>They say they are following good lines of inquiry but are asking for any witnesses to come forward and are appealing for sightings of a black 2008 Mercedes saloon, registration KRP453.</p>
