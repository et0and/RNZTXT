            <p>Dunedin City Council is making skips available to help with the clean-up from recent severe flooding.</p>
        
            <p>On 4 October, the city experienced its wettest day in more than a century, with residents describing the flooding and rain in and around the city as devastating and chaotic.</p>
        
            <p>Streets were swamped and a state of emergency was declared for Dunedin and the Clutha District.</p>
        
            <p>The council said eight skips had been provided in South Dunedin, Tomahawk and Waikouaiti, and would be cleared regularly and then removed on Friday.</p>

            <p>The skip locations included Nicholson Street, Bayview Road and Wesley Street in Dunedin, as well as Stewart Street in Waikouaiti.</p>
        
            <p>There was also one located at Ocean Grove Domain Hall carpark in Tomahawk.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence controller Rob West said the skips were for flood-contaminated waste only, such as soaked carpets or furniture.</p>
        
            <p>Building inspectors had completed rapid inspections at 60 properties, resulting in 11 red stickers, 31 yellow, 13 white and five with no action required.</p>
