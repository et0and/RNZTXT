            <p>Friends mourning the death of 16-year-old Elizabeth Marvin in a fire at a Burnham military camp housing block near Christchurch have shared online tributes and laid fresh flowers outside her home.</p>
        
            <p>Marvin, who was also known as Lizzy, died in Toanui Street early on Wednesday morning in the blaze that left three others injured.</p>
        
            <p>Bunches of flowers have been laid around the letterbox of the charred remains of the property, and by Friday afternoon almost $6,000 had been raised through a Givealittle page set up for her family.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not treating the fire as suspicious. One person remained in a moderate but stable condition in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, Rolleston Softball Club said Marvin played for many girls' teams and had returned to play last season in the Breakers' mixed grade with her brother.</p>
        
            <p>"It is with great sadness and heartache to inform you of the passing of one of our young and spirited players. Elizabeth "Lizzy" Marvin, 16, died after a fire ravaged the property on Toanui St, just outside the army barracks south of Christchurch, in the early hours of the morning earlier this week," the club said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts extend to the family during this time, and such a tragedy for all that knew her."</p>
        
            <p>Marvin's mother was in hospital with her son by her side, the club said.</p>
        
            <p>The Givealittle page creator said Marvin's mother was a big supporter of her community.</p>
        
            <p>"A special family has had a tragic loss and in the spirit of community we ask any one who can to donate to help them," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Mum has always supported her family in any way she could and has been involved in many sporting and schooling events. She can be counted on to fight for her community and now it's our turn to support her."</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force (NZDF) said welfare homes were opened for people from four affected houses and support was being provided by community facilitators and Burnham's padre.</p>
        
            <p>They were helping people find clothing, personal items and permanent accommodation, the NZDF said.</p>
        
            <p>The NDZF said the houses were fitted with domestic smoke detectors on each floor that complied with building code and Fire and Emergency NZ guidelines, but would not comment on the presence of sprinklers or fire escapes because they would be subject to the fire investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The Burnham military fire station was unstaffed at the time of the blaze because it had been operating within the hours of 8am-4.30pm, Monday to Friday, since January.</p>
        
            <p>The Rolleston brigade was first to arrive at the scene at 2.23am, 11 minutes after the first emergency call.</p>
        
            <p>The military camp fire master arrived in a command vehicle that did not have fire suppression capability at 2.40am.</p>
        
            <p>The NZDF said the Burnham fire station hours were well-known and supported by Fire and Emergency area commanders, with FENZ providing coverage outside those hours.</p>
