            <p>Waikato police are concerned by the number of parents who had no idea where their children were during last night's New Year's Eve festivities.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Mike Henwood, area commander for Waikato East, said behaviour was generally good at the Coromandel's holiday hotspots - but some parents and caregivers seemed to have a cavalier attitude about supplying their children with alcohol, just because it was New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not uncommon for police to arrest a youth, or locate a highly intoxicated teen, only to phone the parents and find out they were a couple of hours' drive away or did not know where their child was.</p>
        
            <p>Henwood said more than 2000 teenagers gathered at the traditional hotspot of Whangamata in the lead-up to midnight, but the crowd was generally well behaved.</p>
        
            <p>The number of arrests and fines for liquor ban breaches were both down slightly on previous years. Most of the arrests were for fighting and disorderly behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>A mostly positive New Year's Eve around the Coromandel was marred, however, by a large group of people fighting on Rolleston Street in Thames about 12.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Henwood said one person reportedly threatened to bring a firearm to the fight, so armed police responded swiftly as a precaution before that could happen.</p>
        
            <p>The man was taken into custody and the fight was dispersed. There were no serious injuries, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police in another summer holiday hotspot - Northland - said they dealt with only minor disorder and made few arrests.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Rhys Johnston said there was some trouble in Paihia caused by excess alcohol consumption, but it was well down on previous years.</p>
        
            <p>Most revellers were well behaved with just a few taken into custody "for cooling-off time".</p>
        
            <p>Johnston said there also appeared to be fewer spectators at the midnight fireworks display than last year.</p>
