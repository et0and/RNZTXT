            <p>Kaikōura's bid to become a dark sky sanctuary is a step closer.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaikōura Dark Sky Trust recently submitted its application to DarkSky International for most of the Kaikōura district to become an international dark sky sanctuary and hopes to get a response soon.</p>
        
            <p>Project co-ordinator Colette Doughty said the proposed sanctuary area covers around 2039 square kilometres with a low-density population, which includes Department of Conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>The prime motivation for the project was to protect the endangered Hutton's shearwater birds / tītī from the detrimental effects of artificial lighting, she said.</p>
        
            <p>''The preservation of our pristine night skies will be hugely beneficial in protecting our unique biodiversity.''</p>

            <p>To support application, the trust prepared a private plan change to the Kaikōura District Plan to alter the town's lighting rules.</p>
        
            <p>It was adopted by the Kaikōura District Council in January and subsequently notified for public submissions.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Will Doughty said 37 submissions were received and all were in support, meaning no hearing is required.</p>
        
            <p>A panel of commissioners has been appointed and is expected to consider the submissions next month, with a final decision expected to come back to the council in November.</p>

            <p>''It has been a long time coming and it has taken a lot of hard work, but it has had a lot of support from the community, which is great,'' Doughty said.</p>
        
            <p>The new rules apply to any new builds and when lighting needs to be replaced.</p>
        
            <p>But local residents will not have to change their light bulbs immediately.</p>
        
            <p>To reduce light pollution, lights should be turned downwards and turned off when not needed, while motion sensors, light shielding and timers can reduce the impact of bright lights.</p>
        
            <p>Outdoor light bulbs should be replaced by 3000 Kelvin or lower.</p>

            <p>The trust also plans to prepare a second application for the town and surrounding area to become an international dark sky community.</p>
        
            <p>If the applications are successful, Kaikōura will join dark sky sanctuaries at Aotea Great Barrier Island and Rakiura Stewart Island.</p>
        
            <p>There are four other dark sky sites in New Zealand, including the Oxford dark sky park, which was announced in January.</p>
