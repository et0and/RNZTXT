            <p>One person is in custody and imitation guns have been seized, after two schools in Hamilton were placed in lockdown while police responded to a reported firearm sighting.</p>
        
            <p>The firearm sighting was reported on Silverdale Road, just before 3pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said some staff are armed as a precaution and a cordon had been set up, with the schools in lockdown as a precaution. Members of the public had earlier been advised to avoid the area,</p>
        
            <p>By 5:30pm, police said two imitation firearms had been recovered from an address, and one person was in custody. The cordons had been removed.</p>
        
            <p>Hillcrest High School - close to Silverdale Road - went into Lockdown at 3:13pm Wednesday, just minutes before the end of the school day. But it was lifted just after 5pm, the school said.</p>
        
            <p>Parents and caregivers had been asked not go to the school.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands Silverdale Normal School was also affected.</p>

            <p>"We realise this has caused inconvenience and stress to our community but our first priority is the safety of our students and staff," Hillcrest High School said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>It had implemented emergency procedures and locked the school down as a result of Ministry of Education instructions.</p>
        
            <p>"The school is satisfied the emergency processes and procedures undertaken were appropriate and carried out in the best interests of students and staff of Hillcrest High School," they said.</p>
        
            <p>The school earlier said buses would return to the school when the lockdown ended.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday afternoon, people had reported that roads around both schools had been blocked by police.</p>
