            <p>A squabble over "who worked for the best boss" led to a vicious group attack outside an Invercargill pub, a court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>Ngawai Henry Gordon West, 29, Teony Pennicott, 20 and Terry Jack Taurima, 22, were sentenced to home detention when they appeared in the Invercargill District Court on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>On 28 June, about 10pm, the three defendants were drinking at the Southland Tavern.</p>
        
            <p>The two victims were outside the premises smoking. The defendants followed them out.</p>
        
            <p>West approached one man and punched him in the face causing him to lose consciousness and fall to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Pennicott beat up the second man, punching him to the ground.</p>
        
            <p>Taurima then punched him as he lay on the concrete.</p>
        
            <p>Pennicott continued attacking the victim as he tried to get up repeatedly but was hit back to the ground by the defendant, who then stomped on the man's head.</p>
        
            <p>Taurima then struck the head of a victim before kicking him and walking away.</p>
        
            <p>A third victim became aware of the fracas and came out of the tavern holding a pool cue in "a non-threatening manner", the police summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>He reached out to Pennicott for a handshake, but the man punched the victim in the jaw, knocking a tooth out.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the skirmish seemed to have broken out following "taunts about who worked for the best boss".</p>
        
            <p>"This has come out of nowhere, but it was a particularly nasty incident," Judge Duncan Harvey said.</p>
        
            <p>All three defendants had no criminal history.</p>
        
            <p>"It's puzzling also because none of you have been in trouble before," the judge said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was only by good luck that the injuries caused here were not either incredibly serious and of course did not result in death.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a disgraceful incident," Judge Harvey told them.</p>
        
            <p>Pennicott was sentenced to 11 months' home detention for injuring with intent to do grievous bodily harm and injuring with intent to injure.</p>
        
            <p>He was ordered to pay $1500 emotional harm reparation, to be split between his two victims.</p>
        
            <p>Taurima received a sentence of 10 months' home detention after pleading guilty to injuring with intent to do grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>After pleading guilty to injuring with intent to injure, West was sentenced to six months' home detention and ordered to pay $1000 reparation.</p>
