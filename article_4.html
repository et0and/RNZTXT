            <p>Northland horse riders are kicking up a stink over a proposed new rule that would mean they would have to pick up their horse's poo.</p>
        
            <p>The Far North District Council has proposed a new bylaw, ruling that any person riding a horse in a public area must be responsible for the removal of any manure or droppings.</p>
        
            <p>Hokianga horseman Robert Pink told Midday Report that was just not practical and that horse poo was not really a problem.</p>
        
            <p>"Here in Hokianga, it's like liquid gold. Horse has a poo outside your house, you run out there with a bucket and a spade and bring it straight into your garden. Next minute, your tomatoes are bigger than any tomatoes in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Pink said it could be dangerous for horse riders to get off beside fast-moving traffic to pick up poo.</p>
        
            <p>"Horses, unlike human beings, can poo while they're walking, and quite often, you don't even know the horse has had a poo.</p>
        
            <p>"What's the rider gonna do - take a spade and a brush with them everywhere they go? Tie it onto the tail?"</p>
        
            <p>He said the only way to stop horses leaving droppings on the roadside would be to ban them altogether.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a natural thing, when a horse goes somewhere, a different place to its normal area, or an area where it can be a bit nervous, it'll have a nervous poo."</p>
        
            <p>"I know that feeling," interjected Midday Report presenter Charlotte Cook.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just not practical for people to jump off their horse and pick it up," Pink said.</p>
        
            <p>The council was trying to fix a problem that did not exist, and a new rule would not change anything for horse riders, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Right through the middle of town it wouldn't be nice - but anywhere else, it's just grass and water."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Far North District Council said it encourages residents to have their say in all consultations, and all submissions will be considered.</p>
        
            <p>"The Keeping of Animals Bylaw aims to set clear rules to ensure animals are managed responsibly, without disrupting the well-being of residents.</p>
        
            <p>"This bylaw is in draft form, with a consultation process currently underway. Public input will be important in shaping the final bylaw, ensuring it reflects the needs and values of the Far North community."</p>
