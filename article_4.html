            <p>A 58-year-old man accused of setting fire to an empty Dunedin boarding house will remain in custody awaiting his next court appearance.</p>
        
            <p>Paul McCurdy, who court documents say has no fixed abode, pleaded not guilty to the arson charge and opted for trial by jury in December.</p>
        
            <p>The fire tore through the boarding house in the suburb of Kensington in late October.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities initially feared there may have been people inside.</p>
        
            <p>McCurdy appeared in the Dunedin District Court via audio visual link on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>His next appearance will be in May.</p>
        
            <p>The charge has a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.</p>
