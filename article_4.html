            <p>The Future Development Strategy suggests how and where Dunedin should grow and what is needed to make it happen over the next 30 years.</p>
        
            <p>It was developed by the Dunedin City Council and Otago Regional Council with other stakeholder support.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, a joint hearing panel recommended the councils adopt the strategy with changes following public submissions.</p>
        
            <p>They included:</p>
        
            <p>Otago Regional Council chair Gretchen Robertson welcomed the panel's decision.</p>
        
            <p>"The Dunedin Future Development Strategy underscores the importance of proactive, forward-thinking planning," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is not just about infrastructure beneath the ground; rather, it's a holistic approach to city-building to ensure a healthy, vibrant, and thriving Dunedin for generations to come."</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich said it would help to chart the course of the city into the future.</p>
        
            <p>"The completion of this strategy is a significant step for the future of our city. We all want to see Dunedin thrive and this strategy spells out how and where growth can occur and the infrastructure we need to support that growth," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The councils will now prepare a implementation plan.</p>
