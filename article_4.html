            <p>Hundreds of public homes, some dating back to the first wave of state housing, are being renovated at record numbers.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of Kāinga Ora's massive two year, half-a-billion dollar housing renewal programme, described as one of the biggest housing projects the country has seen.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 750 public homes have been overhauled since April, at a cost of $251 million, with a further 820 set to undergo renovations this year.</p>
        
            <p>The average cost of completed renovations per home is more than $336,000.</p>
        
            <p>The programme was first trialled in the Upper Hutt area back in 2019 when 69 homes were refurbished.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora general manager of construction and innovation Patrick Dougherty said the work had grown steadily since then.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of our homes date back to the early days of public housing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have been great homes, but they were designed for a different way of living and are starting to show their age.</p>
        
            <p>"We're breathing new life into those homes to make sure they're not only warm, dry and safe, but work for the way people live both today and well into the future."</p>
        
            <p>The upgrades include new kitchens, bathrooms, insulation and double glazing.</p>
        
            <p>"When the renovations are done, it's like stepping into a new build - the effects can be truly life-changing for the whānau who live in those homes."</p>
        
            <p>Dougherty said the renovation work that Kāinga Ora is doing is on top of the regular maintenance work it does on all its homes.</p>
