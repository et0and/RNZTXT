            <p>Auckland resident Iain Hudson drove past the fire a short time ago and said it is in a yard right next to the southern motorway.</p>
        
            <p>"We noticed quite large amounts of black smoke even heading through Manukau...really thick black smoke going across the motorway and quite a few people slowing down to have a look."</p>
        
            <p>He said it appeared a pile of metal rubbish was on fire.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come...</p>
