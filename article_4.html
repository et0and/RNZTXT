            <p>Auckland's mayor says rational thinking for the long term plan is on his Christmas list this year.</p>
        
            <p>The council approved the draft proposal for its long term budget to go out for public consultation earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Rates rises, overhauling public transport to make it faster and more reliable, and creating a multi-billion dollar investment fund for the city are all included in the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Wayne Brown said he is hoping councillors will think rationally when it comes to the long term plan next year.</p>
        
            <p>"Just everyone being rational," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's nothing in the Long Term Plan that doesn't make a lot of sense,"</p>
        
            <p>Brown said things couldn't be fixed by doing what council had done in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"Rational, open-minded councillors would be a good step forward, because the ideas are there."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said he wanted the public to show councillors through consultation what he proposed was needed.</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he was going into 2024 ready to work with the Government.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to meeting with the Prime Minister and senior ministers early in the year, and being treated like the regional government that Auckland is," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Brown wished "everybody out there" a Merry Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"They can look forward to Auckland being brighter and cheerful next year as we finish the projects in the city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Hopefully, everybody gets in and supports the Long Term Plan, because it is the only way to get a better Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the plan is expected go out to the public at the end of February.</p>
