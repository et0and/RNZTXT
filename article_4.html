            <p>A woman has been arrested after a a spree of rocks being thrown through windows left locals rattled in a leafy Auckland suburb.</p>
        
            <p>A number of houses on Sackville Street in Grey Lynn had their windows smashed in January, the latest in a series of attacks dating back to February last year.</p>
        
            <p>On one particularly bad day, six windows were smashed.</p>
        
            <p>"We just really want this to stop," one resident told RNZ at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a really nice street with mixed housing, so there's some rentals, and there's some owners, and there's the Kāinga Ora flats, which we all really like.</p>
        
            <p>"It's terrifying lying in bed, waking up for every sound, thinking that a rock's going to be thrown through your window."</p>
        
            <p>Police on Monday said they had arrested a 39-year-old woman in Kingsland.</p>
        
            <p>She will appear in Auckland District Court on Monday, charged with three counts of intentional damage.</p>
        
            <p>One local told RNZ at the time of the attacks in January the suspect was staying with someone in a Kāinga Ora property, but was not a tenant themselves.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora regional director for central and East Auckland John Tubberty told RNZ in January they were aware of the situation, and that the behaviour was clearly unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>"The allegations involve a person who has been visiting one of our properties - they are not a tenant," he said. "We are looking into whether we can take any action under the Residential Tenancies Act to address the situation."</p>
