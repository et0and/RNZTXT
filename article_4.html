            <p>Former justice minister Kiri Allan's court case over crashing her car in Wellington earlier this year has been delayed for the third time.</p>
        
            <p>It was due to be called in the Wellington District Court on Friday but a registrar has confirmed it has been adjourned until the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>Allan is pleading not guilty to a charge of refusing to accompany an enforcement officer after the crash in July.</p>
        
            <p>She was also charged with careless driving.</p>
        
            <p>Allan resigned from all her portfolios after the crash on Evans Bay Parade in Roseneath on 23 July.</p>
        
            <p>She later did not seek re-election for the East Coast electorate.</p>
