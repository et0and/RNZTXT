            <p>About a third of the $1.2 million spent on Auckland's downtown Christmas tree are costs associated with the installation of the tree for the first two years, new information from the Auckland Council has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>The newly-installed Te Manaaki tree is 18 metres tall, with more than 10,000 LED lights and 200 giant baubles, and is owned by Heart of the City and Precinct Properties.</p>

            <p>Auckland Council said its given $800,000 to support the project, using money from the city centre targeted rate - money that city centre residential and commercial property owners pay on top of their normal rates, for promoting the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson said half of the $800,000 went towards buying the tree, and the remaining $400,000 goes towards costs for putting up the display for this year and next year.</p>
        
            <p>Funding will need to be raised for the installation of the tree beyond the first two years.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect the co-owners will bring in private investment to continue displaying Te Manaaki over future festive seasons," the spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The statement said Heart of the City and Precinct Properties have also paid the balance of the capital cost, the pack-up and storage for the life-time of the tree, as well as a launch event.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck told RNZ that the tree was a long-term investment.</p>
        
            <p>"It's built of solid material that's very different from an inside mall tree, it has to endure the elements... It's stainless steel, it's outside, and if it last 10 years that's $124,000 a year split three ways, now we're hoping it lasts a lot longer than that."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Ratepayers' Alliance spokesperson Sam Warren said while the tree looked incredible, he wondered if it could have been achieved at a much more reasonable cost.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was uncertainty over whether ratepayers will need to fork out more money for its installation in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly a huge price tag for third parties to cover. Council has already committed $800,000 towards the tree through targeted rates.</p>
        
            <p>"If private funding is unsuccessful, are CBD ratepayers and businesses going to have to pay even more than they initially said?"</p>
        
            <p>Warren said he made a LGOIMA request for a cost breakdown for the tree in October, but was declined by council on the basis that they would soon release that information.</p>
        
            <p>In November, council released a broad breakdown of costs - saying that $400,000 went towards "operational funding".</p>
        
            <p>Warren said council needs to be more transparent and release more details about the budgetlines for the Christmas tree.</p>
