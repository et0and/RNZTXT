            <p>A major Wellington music venue has had its opening delayed just days before its first show.</p>
        
            <p>Meow Nui has involved converting the Salvation Army's 1990 Citadel church into a gig spot that could hold a capacity of 1000 people, a similar size to Auckland's Powerstation.</p>
        
            <p>Drax Project were set to be the first artists to take the stage at Meow Nui this Friday and Saturday, but those shows have been postponed.</p>
        
            <p>Meow Nui's part owner Damien Jones confirmed to RNZ that the opening of the venue had been delayed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked about the impact on other shows slated for Meow Nui, but Jones said he could not provide any other details due to commercial sensitivities.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Instagram Drax Project said they were gutted that due to circumstances completely outside of their or Meow Nui's control they'd have to postpone the shows.</p>
        
            <p>The band said tickets would be automatically transferred to a new date on the first weekend of November but noted that if fans could not make it, they could receive a full refund.</p>
        
            <p>"If you'd booked travel to Wellington for next weekend and can't change it, please let us know and we'll try and find a way to make it up to you," the band said.</p>
        
            <p>Other shows scheduled at Meow Nui next month include performances by New Zealand hip hop group Home Brew and indie pop group The Beths.</p>
