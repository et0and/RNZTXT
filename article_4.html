            <p>Drones are joining the search for three climbers who have been missing at Aoraki Mt Cook since Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Bad weather has prevented the search for most of the week, but it was able to resume on Friday morning during a limited clear weather window.</p>
        
            <p>Kurt Blair, 56, and Carlos Romero, 50, from the United States, and a Canadian national were intending to summit Aoraki but failed to meet their flight out.</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said a helicopter was sent at first light during a break from the harsh weather but was unable to spot the climbers.</p>
        
            <p>"The purpose [for the helicopter flight] was to conduct an initial search and also to bring up two drone pilots to create a staging area for them to operate a drone as part of the search.</p>
        
            <p>"We have completed that initial helicopter search and we are now looking to place the drone operators into the alpine environment.</p>
        
            <p>"Our search teams have been hampered by ongoing treacherous alpine conditions. It has been too windy for helicopters and simply too dangerous to put teams in the environment.</p>
        
            <p>"As our highest peak Aoraki Mount Cook, it is challenging. It's a technical climb and with countless crevasses and hazards."</p>
        
            <p>Even if was safe to put searchers on the ground, she said it would take them about a day to reach the area of interest.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said scattered showers were expected to develop on Friday with some heavy and possible thundery before clearing in the evening.</p>
        
            <p>Alerts were in place for thunderstorms, wind and wind chill as mountain weather hazards for the national park.</p>
        
            <p>"The window of opportunity to survey this area is small and we'll continue to assess any new information that we've gathered from the mountain," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were thinking of the men's families.</p>
        
            <p>"The families of the men are desperate to understand and understandably distraught and desperate for answers," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a deeply distressing time for the relatives and my heart and my team's heart goes out to them."</p>
        
            <p>This type of work could also take a personal toll on staff especially if they weren't getting the outcome they hoped for, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Gear believed to belong to the men was found during the initial search.</p>
