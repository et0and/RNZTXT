            <p>Police are still working to recover 24 methamphetamine lollies unknowingly handed out to families in Auckland City Mission food bags.</p>
        
            <p>The mission and police have been scrambling to contact families who were given lollies after they were found to contain lethal levels of methamphetamine on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said police had accounted for 41 of the "lollies", and had recovered 33 of those.</p>
        
            <p>Information received by Operation Tirade from affected families suggested some of the lollies already discarded were either flushed down a toilet or thrown out.</p>
        
            <p>Baldwin said the total number of meth "lollies" handed out was at least 65, after 24 families contacted the mission today saying they had received them.</p>
