            <p>Firefighters are battling a large fire in Kirwee in the Selwyn district.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the six-hectare blaze on Thursday moning was in what appeared to be a pine plantation.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called just before 6am.</p>
        
            <p>Seventeen fire trucks and two helicopters are at the scene, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second major fire incident around Kirwee in five days.</p>
        
            <p>Several spot fires broke out along a railway line between Aylesbury and Darfield, west of Christchurch on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The fires were sparked by a freight train shunting wagons from a milk factory in West Rolleston.</p>
        
            <p>At one stage they threatened about 40 homes, an "incredibly stressful" experience for residents, Malvern Ward councillor Lydia Gliddon told RNZ on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The latest blaze has broken out on a day when the MetService has warned of very high temperatures in Canterbury over the next few days.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, investigators are looking into the cause of a large building fire in Golden Bay during the early hours.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called just before 3am to a large commercial building in Takaka.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze was "well-involved" when firefighters arrived in 13 trucks and one support vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was contained within two hours.</p>
