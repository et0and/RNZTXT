            <p>The singer-songwriter Ria Hall says "it's time for a change" as she puts her hat in the ring to be Tauranga Mayor.</p>
        
            <p>The city will return to fully elected governance in July after being run by commissioners since 2020 due to infighting and dysfunction.</p>
        
            <p>Those elected this year will serve for four years instead of three, before Tauranga rejoins the national three-year cycle in 2028.</p>
        
            <p>Hall, who is born in Tauranga, told Morning Report that it was an exciting time.</p>
        
            <p>"People are really galvanising and talking on the ground and there's lots of murmurs.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cool for our city and it's cool for people to start thinking about what Tauranga could look like."</p>
        
            <p>Residents were ready to move on from having commissioners in place, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said if she was elected, she would bring her energy to the role and focus on infrastructure, transport, environment and creating a more connected, cohesive society.</p>
        
            <p>"Our infrastructure hasn't been able to keep up with the inevitable increase in population in size.</p>
        
            <p>"Our roads are pretty hard to get around, accessibility's a biggie."</p>
        
            <p>The musician said she loved the city and coincidentally started studying her masters of regional development through Auckland University this year.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped there would be a big pool of people who put their hand up for the job.</p>
        
            <p>"In the past that hasn't so much been the case, it's kind of been status quo operations so this is, again, a super exciting time.</p>
        
            <p>"Competition is healthy. I think it's a good thing and it's good for our democracy because it means that maybe voices will come through that weren't necessarily heard before."</p>
        
            <p>Former deputy mayor Tina Salisbury has also announced her bid to run for mayor.</p>
        
            <p>Nominations for the mayor and and nine local councillors opened at the end of last month and will close on 24 May.</p>
