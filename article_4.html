            <p>Up to 500 properties in the Wellington suburb of Karori are without water.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said its crews were responding to a burst water main on Monaghan Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>The area affected includes:</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said to carry out repairs its crews also had to turn the water off to Monaghan Avenue from Karori Road to Paparata Street, including all of Hawick Street, Selkirk Way, Laidlaw Way, Ridd Crescent.</p>
        
            <p>Two water tankers have been arranged to provide drinking water to those affected which Wellington Water said would remain in place until the water was restored.</p>
        
            <p>There is a tanker at 1 Parata Street and another one on the intersection of Collier Avenue and Richmond Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>Residents could notice that their water appeared cloudy or had air pockets once it was turned back on, Wellington Water said.</p>
        
            <p>But it said its crews would flush the hydrants in the zone once the repair had been completed.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it expected water to be restored to the area at about 5pm on Wednesday.</p>
