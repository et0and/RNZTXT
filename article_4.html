            <p>An addiction counsellor may face legal action after sending clients images of her breast augmentation and asking one to serve drinks at her wedding</p>
        
            <p>A report released on Monday found the counsellor breached professional boundaries and abused trust in her position towards two clients.</p>
        
            <p>The Deputy Health and Disability Commissioner has referred the woman to the Director of Investigators to decide if she should be taken to court.</p>
        
            <p>Both clients complained to the Addiction Practitioners' Association of Aotearoa NZ (DAPAANZ) about the counsellors conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Since then, the counsellor has been de-registered and had her membership revoked.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Vanessa Caldwell found the woman, who was the director, breached the code for not operating services that met professional and ethical standards.</p>
        
            <p>There were several breaches, including the counsellor sending them images of her recent breast augmentation.</p>
        
            <p>She also asked for multiple favours such as asking one woman to provide and serve drinks at her wedding and another client to house-sit for her.</p>
        
            <p>There were numerous personal interactions between the counsellor and one women outside the therapeutic relationship, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband, another director and counsellor, also breached the code for not providing ethical or professional services.</p>
        
            <p>The counsellor also did not keep records of her treatment or provide treatment plans for the two women.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband was found to have sent inappropriate messages on social media to one of his clients when he discovered she complained to DAPAANZ.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Caldwell said all relationships between patients and health professionals, especially when people are vulnerable, involves trust.</p>
        
            <p>"[The counsellor] held a position of trust, and there was a substantial power imbalance in her relationship with Ms B. Mrs C grossly abused this position of trust when she took advantage of Ms B for her own gain," Caldwell said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Caldwell has made a number of recommendations including both directors apologise to the women and for them both to undertake supervision.</p>
        
            <p>She wanted updates from her supervisor each six months for two years to ensure the counsellors were performing at an ethical standard.</p>
        
            <p>She also recommended for the counselling service to develop a complaints policy to be approved by independent DAPAANZ approved practitioners.</p>
