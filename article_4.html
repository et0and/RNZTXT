            <p>As the nationwide hīkoi for Te Tiriti made its way through Auckland it stopped at two sites synonymous with Māori resistance - Bastion Point and Ihumātao.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Harbour bridge shook under the weight of an estimated 10,000 people as they made their way across two closed northbound lanes just after 9am in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>It was a sight reminiscent of both the 1975 hīkoi led by Dame Whina Cooper and the Foreshore and Seabed march of 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Herbert Manupiri remembers the 1975 land march well - he was there - now he is back out on the march.</p>
        
            <p>"The 70s march with Whina Cooper, I marched with them and I'd be one of the oldest left to come out with my young people, we've got to be with our young people."</p>
        
            <p>It was wāhine Māori - women like Cooper, Eva Rickard and Titewhai Harawira who have pushed Māori protest forward, Manupiri said.</p>
        
            <p>Kaumātua need to be brought along in the Toitū te Tiriti movement to share their experiences with the younger generations who are leading the hīkoi, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has to come through our young people you know, and that's where our young people have to sit down with the old people and our old people have to teach them."</p>
        
            <p>Marchers chanted 'Ka whawahi tonu mātau, ake, ake, ake" and cars tooted their horns in support as the hīkoi made their way across the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Green Party MP Huhana Lyndon was there with the hīkoi - she said it's a sight that reminds her of past protests.</p>
        
            <p>"It's reminiscent of our Whaea Dame Whina Cooper 1975, but also the hīkoi mo te takutai moana and paying tribute to all of those wise heads who led that out."</p>
        
            <p>Toitū te Tiriti spokesperson Eru Kapa-Kingi said they made the decision to take the hīkoi to Takaparawhau - Bastion Point to acknowledge Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei's struggle to retain their land.</p>
        
            <p>"To acknowledge Joe Hawke and Ngāti Whātua who exemplified what we are exemplifying today, standing for our mana motuhake."</p>
        
            <p>Members of Ngāti Whātua were evicted from their homes at Ōkahu Bay in the early 1950s, their houses demolished and their meeting house burned.</p>
        
            <p>They were 'booted' up to nearby Kitemoana Street - which become known as Boot Hill.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>In 1977 the late Joe Hawke led a 506-day occupation of Bastion Point - hoping to secure the return of Ngāti Whātua's land - the occupation helped raise awareness of Māori land grievances.</p>
        
            <p>Just before the hīkoi arrived at Takaparawhau an archive clip of Hawke calling the government to "give our land back," was played out to the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>On the other side of the city at Ihumātao in South Auckland spirits were high. Several hundred supporters gathered to welcome the hīkoi contingent.</p>
        
            <p>The land at Ihumātao has been occupied by protesters opposed to the land being developed for years - with little progress being made.</p>
        
            <p>Mana Whenua kaikōrero Qiane Matata-Sipu gave an update on the status of the whenua.</p>
        
            <p>She said despite what the Minister of Māori development said, mana whenua only want one thing - hoki whenua mai - their land back.</p>

            <p>The convoy continued their march to another site of Māori resistance - Rangiriri north of Huntly - the site of a major battle during the Waikato war.</p>
        
            <p>Around 40 Māori and the same number of British soldiers were killed during the battle and 180 Māori taken prisoner.</p>
        
            <p>The hikoi will resume its journey from Huntly to Parliament Thursday morning.</p>
