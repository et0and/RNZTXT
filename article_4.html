            <p>Human Rights Commission staff are being asked if they want voluntary redundancy, as part of wider public sector cost-cutting measures.</p>
        
            <p>The commission said it was "already a very lean organisation" which employed 61 people.</p>
        
            <p>While it is an independent Crown entity, the commission reports to the Ministry of Justice, which has been directed to save 6.5 percent of its budget.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot share the scope or any further details of the process, due to budget confidentiality and to protect the privacy of our kaimahi who deserve to navigate these tricky processes without undue public scrutiny," it said.</p>
        
            <p>This week, the number of public sector jobs lost or set to go topped 5000.</p>
        
            <p>Some organisations directed to make savings had not yet made their plans clear, citing Budget sensitivity - so the full scale of public sector job losses is set to be revealed after Thursday.</p>
