            <p>A crash in central Auckland disrupted motorway traffic on Friday afternoon, with motorists urged to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a vehicle towing a trailer was involved in a crash at the city end of the Northwestern Motorway (State Highway 16) at 2.42pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully, no one has been injured."</p>
        
            <p>The Stanley Street exit off the motorway was blocked, with traffic being diverted off at the Wellesley Street exit.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi / New Zealand Transport Agency closed SH16 between Wellesley St and Grafton Rd. It said in an update shortly after 4pm the motorway had been reopened.</p>
        
            <p>"Exit SH16 at Wellesley St off-ramp and rejoin SH16 at Grafton Rd on-ramp," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said motorists should expect delays, and avoid the area if possible.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency staff were also at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The accident came ahead of a number of closures on the Auckland motorway network over the next week, including parts of the Northwestern Motorway.</p>
