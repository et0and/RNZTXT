            <p>The head of Hawke's Bay Rugby says a shotgun attack on a team van at the weekend was "deplorable" and that protocols at the match were not followed.</p>
        
            <p>Police are following "strong lines of enquiry" after a fiery rugby match at Bill Mathewson Park in Hastings was called off and a team van shot at on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Rugby chief executive Jay Campbell said the incident was "very, very disappointing".</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby prides itself on bringing communities together and to have something like this happen - it's deplorable, really."</p>
        
            <p>Campbell told RNZ the regional organisation had received reports on the incident from the two clubs involved, as well as from the referee and police.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell said there were game day protocols that the Tamatea Rugby Club clearly had not adhered to when hosting the match.</p>
        
            <p>"One of them is the field needs to be roped off - and that wasn't done right - and having a ground controller."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were working with the club on why the protocols were not followed.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell told RNZ this was not the first gang-related issue to happen in Hawke's Bay but it was a shame it had happened during a rugby match.</p>
        
            <p>"Rugby is generally 100 percent a really safe environment, where communities come together and play."</p>
        
            <p>He said community leaders needed to work on eradicating these issues from sport and the community.</p>
        
            <p>The team van was attacked after a match between Tamatea and Young Māori Party (YMP) third-division teams.</p>
        
            <p>The match was abandoned early due to safety concerns, but YMP's van encountered trouble after it left.</p>
        
            <p>The Hastings YMP was established in 1956 and is not related to the political organisation Te Pāti Māori nor the Young Māori Party rugby club based in Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Sunday said the shotgun attack was "gang-linked".</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District councillor Malcolm Dixon told RNZ he was absolutely shocked by the event.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt sorry for the wider community, [and] I actually felt sorry for all of those ... at the rugby game, because it was completely out of all their control."</p>
        
            <p>Dixon said he had previously been a local rugby referee for 35 years and that, historically, both clubs had gang links.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a historic problem they've had for a long, long, long time with the YMP and Tamatea, because there's two different [gangs] involved.</p>
        
            <p>"And look, most of the time they go very, very well but occasionally the unexpected happens."</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Kahungunu iwi chairperson Bayden Barber also condemned the shooting that took place after the game.</p>
        
            <p>"This sort of behaviour has no place in our community. Our sports grounds are supposed to be safe places for whānau to enjoy sport and recreation.</p>
        
            <p>"The violence that took place over the weekend was disgraceful. We are very fortunate that no one was injured - or worse - by these actions."</p>
        
            <p>Since news of the Hastings incident emerged, there has been a report of a second sports event involving gang members over the weekend - this time in Paraparaumu, on the Kāpiti Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Police said one person was arrested following a disorder incident at Te Atiawa Park on Sunday, where a women's social softball tournament was being held.</p>
        
            <p>One person, believed to be involved in the disorder incident, was found with drugs.</p>
        
            <p>The police said it appeared to be gang-related, and were continuing their enquiries.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted the organisers of the softball tournament for comment.</p>
