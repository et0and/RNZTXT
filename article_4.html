            <p>Three people have been arrested following multiple fires on Auckland's Māngere Mountain this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the scrub fire covered an area of 60 metres by 50 metres at its peak.</p>
        
            <p>About 20 firefighters had been tackling the blaze which had been extinguished by around 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>The firefighters remain at the scene, dampening down hot spots on the south-western side of the mountain, facing Wallace Road which remains closed.</p>
        
            <p>Police were alerted about 4.30pm, and assisted Fire and Emergency at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said there were at least three fires on the hillside, and it was reported to police that three males had been seen deliberately starting the fires.</p>
        
            <p>Three people were taken into custody at an address on Kupua Road.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said motorists could expect delays in the immediate area.</p>
