            <p>Covid-19 cases have dropped since last week, but there were still 20 further deaths attributed to the virus, according to Ministry of Health figures.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 6656 new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand over the week to Sunday, and 20 further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Of the new cases, 1131 were probable cases and 3553 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 332 cases in hospital and one in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-day rolling average of new cases was 951 per day.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 booster vaccinations are available for anyone aged over 30 if it has been at least six months since their last injection or period of Covid-19 infection.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University public health expert Michael Baker last week told Morning Report boosters were "vital", particularly for older people and those who had underlying health conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"This is basic preventative medicine and if people are not getting their boosters they are far more likely to go to hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Te Whatu Ora reported 6814 new cases and 27 deaths, including a child aged under 10.</p>
