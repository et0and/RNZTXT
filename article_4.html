            <p>A driver has died after a crash between two cars, which shut down part of Wellington's motorway overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the crash about 11:30pm Saturday, in the northbound lanes of the busy Kaiwharawhara section of State Highway 1, heading north out of Wellington City, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of one car died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The passenger from that car, and the driver from another car were injured and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The motorway reopened about 3:45am Sunday, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington drivers also faced major closures during the weekend on several sections of State Highway 2.</p>
        
            <p>A section of SH2 was closed at Kaitoke on Saturday evening, due to a police incident, but reopened by 6:30pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>While sections of SH2 were closed from Saturday evening at both Carterton and Featherston, in Wairarapa, due to a police operation - with both reopened by 6am Sunday, NZTA said.</p>
