            <p>The main centres are set to enjoy plenty of sunshine this weekend with warmer temperatures hinting summer is just around the corner.</p>
        
            <p>An area of high pressure over Aotearoa is responsible for the more settled weather - respite for those regions which have already exceeded their monthly rainfall record for October, such as southern regions of the South Island, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist John Law said Invercargill will be one of the warmest spots in the country reaching 20 degrees Celsius on Saturday, while Aucklanders can expect the odd shower for a few hours and a high of 19degC.</p>
        
            <p>Those in the capital at the weekend can expect a mix of cloud and sun and highs of 17degC and 18degC while further south in Christchurch it will be 17degC on Saturday while Sunday is sunny with a maximum of 21degC.</p>
        
            <p>There will be some showers inland in Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>It will be mostly settled, dry and fine on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"What we find in the South Island on Sunday is some pretty warm temperatures round that eastern side ...with many spots set to reach 19 or 20 degrees Celsius," Law said.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist Clare O'Connor said: "The ridge of high pressure over the country does a great job of preventing - or blocking - the progression of an area of low pressure sitting in the Tasman Sea.</p>
        
            <p>"However, as these areas gradually move eastwards, some tendrils of the low make it to our western shores as brief showers and cloudy periods although there will be plenty of blue skies in between."</p>
        
            <p>The showers forecast for inland areas over the weekend were another sign of the move towards summer weather patterns, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"These warmer, drier conditions are also expected to continue into the week ahead, but it is still too early to offer a definitive outlook for the upcoming long weekend. However, there are indications for warm temperatures to kick off the (extra) long weekend about Hawke's Bay."</p>
