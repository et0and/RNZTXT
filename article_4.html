            <p>A petrol station blunder gifted Dunedin motorists a barely believable bargain.</p>
        
            <p>A sign at the Waitomo Northgate fuel station, in Cumberland St, advertised 95 unleaded fuel at $0.82 per litre on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The error caught the attention of customers on Facebook, with many commenting on how cheap the price was.</p>
        
            <p>One commenter said some customers had managed to buy fuel at that price until the error was fixed.</p>
        
            <p>A Waitomo Group spokeswoman said there had been a "glitch" with their system on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>A pricing error had been made and a "2" had been incorrectly replaced with a "0", which was attributed to human error.</p>
        
            <p>The spokeswoman confirmed the error was displayed both on the sign and at the pump, allowing customers to get an unofficial discount off their fuel.</p>
        
            <p>However, Waitomo was not concerned about any losses arising from the error.</p>
        
            <p>"We made an error, so that's what the price was.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't meant to happen, it was our bad so we fixed it."</p>
        
            <p>The station was unmanned and the error had been made remotely from the company's main office in Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>The error was visible for about an hour before it was quickly identified and remedied, the spokeswoman said.</p>
        
            <p>"The good thing is our sites down there are really popular, so people do notice what we're doing because we've brought a lot of competition to the market down there.</p>
        
            <p>"Occasionally these things do happen, we do have controls in place and we put another control in place after yesterday," the spokeswoman said.</p>
