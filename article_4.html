            <p>A 70-year-old man who police say threatened to blow up a Christchurch community housing complex will remain behind bars and keep his name a secret for now.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of the suburb of Sydenham were locked down for several hours on Monday with nearby homes and businesses evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>A 100-metre cordon was put in place by police around the Percival Street address.</p>
        
            <p>The man appeared in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday via audio-visual link and was granted interim name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>He was facing one count of threatening to damage a building.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the man contacted the Christian Superstore on Colombo on Monday at about 10.20am, with police alleging he said he "had a bomb and was going to set it off".</p>
        
            <p>About ten minutes later, he called again and allegedly threatened to let off three gas bottles if police got too close to his house.</p>

            <p>The man resided at a home owned by the Beckenham Community Housing Trust.</p>
        
            <p>The court also heard details of an ongoing tenancy dispute between the man and the trust's owner, the Beckenham Baptist Church.</p>
        
            <p>Duty lawyer David Goldwater said the church had tried to evict the man multiple times.</p>
        
            <p>Residential tenancy laws had recently come into effect which allowed landlords to end a periodic tenancy without giving a specific reason, Goldwater said.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a cry for help - out of frustration and despair," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Goldwater sought bail for the man, but police argued he was a risk to the community.</p>
        
            <p>Community Magistrate Elder Robati remanded him in custody.</p>
        
            <p>The man would reappear next month.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted the Beckenham Baptist Church for comment.</p>
