            <p>Firefighters have been battling house fires in the lower and central North Island on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>In Ngapuke, near Tūrangi four fire crews and a tanker were called to a blaze just after midnight.</p>
        
            <p>The house burnt to the ground but there were no injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Further south in Lower Hutt's Wainuiomata five fire trucks and three specialist crews were called to a home after multiple 111 calls at around 2.20am.</p>
        
            <p>Two hours later the blaze was under control and there were no reports of injury to the public, but a firefighter did receive minor burns.</p>
        
            <p>Investigations will be launched into both fires.</p>
