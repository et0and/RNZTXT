            <p>Two of Auckland's heritage hotels have been given a financial boost in the latest Auckland Council Regional Historic Heritage Grant.</p>
        
            <p>The Puhoi Hotel and the Kentish Hotel are among 21 applicants given a share of $530,000 from the grant to help them future-proof.</p>
        
            <p>The Puhoi Hotel in Auckland's north will receive $50,000 for repairs while the Kentish Hotel in Auckland's south was awarded $48,435.</p>
        
            <p>"It's essential that historic heritage places are preserved so they can be enjoyed by Aucklanders now, and for years to come," said Councillor Angela Dalton, chair of the council's Community Committee.</p>

            <p>"These taonga give a window into the past of Tāmaki Makaurau and preserving them is crucial for the region's identity.</p>
        
            <p>"The Regional Historic Heritage Grant enables these historically significant taonga to be improved and future-proofed.</p>
        
            <p>"This round we allocated funds to 21 applicants from a total of 35 applications. We thank all those who gave their time and effort to apply."</p>
        
            <p>The Puhoi Hotel was established by John Schollum, a Bohemian migrant who arrived in 1863.</p>
        
            <p>The first version of the hotel was built in 1876 before it was replaced by the current building in 1901.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Auckland Council for approving our grant application," said Puhoi Hotel owner Bernie McCallion.</p>
        
            <p>"This funding will make a significant difference in enabling us to bring The Puhoi Pub, Hotel and Stables back to life.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate the council's support and commitment to help the hub of Puhoi be used to its full extent and allowing the verandah to be safe and secure for tourists and the community."</p>
        
            <p>The Kentish Hotel was built in 1852 by Edward Constable who emigrated from Maidstone, Kent in England.</p>

            <p>The Waiuku establishment also holds a bit of history, laying claim to the longest continuous liquor licence in New Zealand since 10 January 1853.</p>
