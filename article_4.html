            <p>Moeapulu Frances Tagaloa, a member of the Royal Commission's Survivor Advisory Group of Experts, has been made a Companion of the King's Service Order for services to survivors of abuse in care.</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa spoke to RNZ Pacific about her surprise at receiving this honour, and how faith had assisted her with her own recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"It's, you know, it was unexpected, and I guess I would firstly want to thank the Lord for this.</p>
        
            <p>"My faith has been a major part of my healing, healing from faith based abuse by Catholic Marist Brother, brother, Bede, and I'm a Christian, so with personal relationship with God, and so I became a survivor advocate, not only because of my lived experience, but because just I believe in justice and that, you know, God has called me to this, to the survivor space."</p>
        
            <p>She also thanked her husband and family.</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa explained that she and the other survivors had told their stories to the Royal Commission "because light needed to be shone on the horrific atrocities that additional tragedy really of abuse and state and faith-based care, and, you know, our stories went global, but this is really our country's shame."</p>
        
            <p>She also explained that while this was an opportunity for transformational change, and justice, the truth remains that she and other survivors raised the alarm about their abuse decades ago.</p>
        
            <p>"Those who were in power did not listen," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Tagaloa said that she accepted the honour on behalf of all the survivors, but the need remained for changes in the system, to ensure that children and vulnerable adults were safe, while in care. She also stated that a system of redress was necessary.</p>
        
            <p>She told RNZ Pacific that she encouraged all survivors to come forward and share their experiences. That doing so had been an important part of her own healing process.</p>
        
            <p>While the survivors formed a community, it was a community built on pain and trauma "and committed to removing the darkness and finding the light to protect our future generations. "</p>
