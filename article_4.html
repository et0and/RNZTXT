            <p>A boat, believed to have two people on board, is missing off the coast of Gisborne after it failed to return from a fishing trip.</p>
        
            <p>Police received a report that a group of fishers had not returned as expected at about 4.50pm on Monday, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne Tatapouri Sports Fishing Club president Roger Faber said three boats were out fishing and one had failed to return.</p>
        
            <p>Two people were on board the 6m-long trailer boat that was missing, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The people on the missing boat had set off an emergency beacon and a helicopter and the coastguard were out searching for them, Faber said.</p>
        
            <p>Faber, who was on one of the three boats, said his boat and another boat had turned around to come home "because it was pretty gnarly".</p>
        
            <p>They called the people in the other boat who didn't answer, and presumed they had come in to shore as well.</p>
        
            <p>"It wasn't until we got back to the boat ramp and saw there trailer was still there that we had concerns for them."</p>
        
            <p>Faber said the whole fishing community had real concerns and were keeping their fingers crossed that there was a favourable outcome.</p>
