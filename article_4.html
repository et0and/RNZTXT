            <p>The first-ever Beyond COP21 Symposium to be held in Oceania hopes to open young people's minds to the possibility of a more sustainable future.</p>
        
            <p>The Green School in Taranaki is hosting 150 intermediate and high school students from around the country who are participating in discussions, workshops and presentations stemming from the Paris Climate Accords adopted in 2015, as well as the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals.</p>
        
            <p>Group head of sustainability and global citizenship at Education in Motion, d'Arcy Lunn, said the event was about building a conviction to do things better.</p>
        
            <p>"You have two choices, one is to throw rocks and say how terrible things are and the other is to embrace it and try and turn it into something more authentic grounded in connection and conversation, but then action.</p>
        
            <p>"I work a lot with young people and I'm continually inspired not only by their altruism, but actually how they turn these ideas into positive impact around the world."</p>

            <p>He hoped the young people would build networks that would stay with them for life.</p>
        
            <p>"The tangible aspect of this is the connections. So, yeah there would be a lot of discussions, but also a lot of connection and I think the connection is critical for us to find solutions and look to the future.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's not about having a plan of action that's going to change the world tomorrow. It's about having a conviction that your ears and eyes are going to be open to making a change in your community."</p>
        
            <p>First held in Dubai in 2016, Beyond COP21 has since been held in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America.</p>
        
            <p>Speakers at the Green School included Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick, Indonesian climate activist Melati Wijsen, know for her efforts to reduce plastic bag consumption in Bali, and Pounamu Skelton a Taranaki advocate for kai resilience and Mātauranga Māori.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth Girls High student Lautaimi Sifa was looking forward to the Grow Your Own Kai workshop.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a big person and I like to eat and I love my food, so I want to see their version and the plants they use and hear about how we can make sure when we make our food it involves sustainability and saving the environment."</p>
        
            <p>Schoolmate Teutusi Faoagali had a message for the adults involved in the original Paris Accords.</p>
        
            <p>"Make sure your actions match your words and that you're going to stick to it instead of saying something, but not going for it."</p>

            <p>Year 12 student at the Green School, Amelie Harris, was looking forward to meeting more of her mainstream colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm looking forward to the workshops, but then also really like social connections as well meeting people from other schools who are thinking about the same kinds of things, like to do with the planet and all that."</p>
        
            <p>The 15-year-old said it was important for young people to start thinking about sustainability early so when they get older they can take action.</p>
        
            <p>Dini Mohamed Faizudin was part of the Enviro Group from Whanganui Girls College.</p>
        
            <p>The Year 9 student was signed up for a Next Gen workshop.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about creating a better future for us and future generations, creating a healthier earth and better environment. We can start small creating recycling, improving environments and habitats and move on to bigger things like bringing back endangered species."</p>

            <p>Ostyn Marriner from Stratford Primary School's Environ Group was one of the younger students involved.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm hoping to learn some more things about climate change and the environment."</p>
        
            <p>The 12-year-old was enjoying his time at the Green School.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, we don't have circle buildings like these. I think they're pretty cool, pretty modern."</p>

            <p>Stratford Primary's Environ co-ordinator Marlene Lewis said the symposium was a wonderful opportunity for her students.</p>
        
            <p>"Just being part of an environment where we can make a change. It's being totally immersed and giving them an opportunity with like-minded people.</p>
        
            <p>"Even observing the planting here. What can they do? What can they take back to their school or their family and what can they do to make a difference.</p>
        
            <p>"We look at climate change and global warming and it's such a big issue it sort of doesn't belong to us, but hey it does and we are very powerful and we can make a difference. Each individual globally can make a difference."</p>
