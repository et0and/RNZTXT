            <p>Winter this year was the third-warmest on record, data released on Thursday showed.</p>
        
            <p>Notable temperatures were recorded in Hastings, which reached 25.7C on 10 June, the second-highest ever recorded in a New Zealand winter; and Dunedin, which had its warmest winter ever, averaging 8.7C (Dunedin's previous warmest winter was last year).</p>
        
            <p>Auckland was the warmest of the main centres, averaging 12.3C. Wellington had a mean temperature of 10.4C, Hamilton 9.6C, Christchurch 7.2C and Tauranga 11.5C - all above the long-term average recorded between 1991 and 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The nationwide average was 9.6C, 1C higher than the long-term average, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said.</p>
        
            <p>"Winter 2024 mean sea level air pressure was higher than normal over, east and south of Aotearoa New Zealand," NIWA said in its latest Seasonal Climate Summary.</p>
        
            <p>"This was associated with more easterly and northeasterly winds than normal, particularly over the South Island, with relatively few cold southerly outbreaks. This resulted warmer than average temperatures throughout the season."</p>
        
            <p>Five of New Zealand's six warmest winters have occurred since 2020.</p>

            <p>Following Hasting's impressive 25.7C, record highs were also posted in Purerua (21.C), Te Puke (20.6C), Kawerau (22.1C), HƒÅwera (19.3C) and Tautuku (23.5C).</p>
        
            <p>None of NIWA's temperature monitoring stations recorded anything close to a record low maximum air temperature.</p>
        
            <p>Waipounamu's -7.4C on 15 July equalled its lowest-ever winter temperature, while the coldest chill recorded - -9.4C at Middlemarch - was its equal fourth-lowest. The lowest temperature recorded was -11.8C at Lake Tekapo on 3 August.</p>
        
            <p>While most of the country enjoyed at- or near-record levels of warmth, rainfall was less consistent - with some areas staying relatively dry, while others were drenched.</p>
        
            <p>"Stations at Mt Ruapehu Chateau and Waiouru observed their lowest and third-lowest winter rainfall totals on record," NIWA said.</p>
        
            <p>Russell had the most extra rain relative to the past, with 755mm - 161 percent of its usual winter rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>The wettest day for any one location was 9 June, when 139mm fell on Arthur's Pass. Gisborne on 25 June was not far behind with 126mm, followed by Waihau on June 25, with 123mm.</p>
        
            <p>"June and July were dry months for many parts of the country, although eastern and central areas of Otago were relatively wet during these months," NIWA said.</p>
        
            <p>"The lack of rain contributed to low hydro lake levels for the time of year. Unsettled westerly airflows prevailed over the country during the second half of August, with a number of fronts passing over the country.</p>
        
            <p>"This weather pattern delivered abundant precipitation to the main divide, boosting hydro lake levels, and balancing out overall winter rainfall totals for parts of the country that had been drier than normal up to that point."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington was the wettest of the main centres. Christchurch was the coolest and driest, Tauranga the sunniest and Dunedin the darkest.</p>
        
            <p>The sunniest region overall was Nelson, with 1766 sunshine hours, followed by Marlborough (1758), Bay of Plenty (1737) and Tasman (1717).</p>
        
            <p>The strongest wind of the season was recorded at Cape Turnagain, Hawke's Bay, at 181km/h on 12 August.</p>
