            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled a charity which helps reintegrate prisoners into society can be named in connection with convicted murderer and rapist Joseph Brider.</p>
        
            <p>Brider brutally killed Juliana Bonilla-Herrera in her Christchurch home in January 2022, just nine weeks after he was paroled from prison on a rape conviction.</p>
        
            <p>It can now be reported that he lived next door to Bonilla-Herrera in a flat owned by Pathway Trust, which had also been working with Brider for five months before his release from Christchurch Men's Prison.</p>
        
            <p>Bonilla-Herrera was not aware of his prior offending.</p>
        
            <p>Pathway Trust had obtained an order from the High Court preventing its name from being published due to "undue hardship if named in connection with the murder".</p>
        
            <p>"It submitted that the negative publicity would cause reputational damage and reduce its capacity to perform its purposes, which is dependent on the receipt of donations," the Supreme Court ruling said.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Supreme Court found there was a "legitimate public interest" in Pathway's involvement with Brider being made known.</p>
        
            <p>"The court accepted that decisions about Brider's accommodation, his release conditions and public notification ultimately rested with the Department of Corrections and the Parole Board," the ruling said.</p>
        
            <p>It said there was little indication that Pathway had done anything wrong.</p>
        
            <p>Pathway remained deeply shocked and saddened by the death of Bonilla-Herrera, its reintegration spokesperson Anaru Baynes said.</p>
        
            <p>"More than two years on, our deepest sympathies and condolences remain with her family and friends," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Pathway's work in Christchurch Men's Prison focused on preparing prisoners to re-enter the community, and once there, provided support designed to lessen the chance of reoffending and help them to rebuild their lives, Baynes said.</p>
        
            <p>"Joseph Brider betrayed Pathway's values, everyone who was involved in his rehabilitation and the community, by committing a deplorable crime."</p>
        
            <p>While he chose not to "make a genuine fresh start", there were many others who benefited from the practical support Pathway offered to "reverse the cycle of reoffending", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Parole Board previously claimed that Corrections had supplied incorrect information while it was deciding upon Brider's release conditions, but an independent review in 2023 found this was not true.</p>
        
            <p>That review, however, did find that the information supplied had "ambiguities".</p>
        
            <p>Corrections and the Parole Board said at the time they would "strengthen information-sharing processes".</p>
        
            <p>"The Parole Board chair and I agree that Corrections' current guidance to our frontline staff could be clearer on what information is shared with the Parole Board in high-risk cases, to ensure different release proposals can be fully explored before deciding to grant someone parole," Corrections chief executive Jeremy Lightfoot said.</p>
        
            <p>Following a separate independent review, Corrections also changed its community notification policy in 2023 to include adult sex offenders.</p>
