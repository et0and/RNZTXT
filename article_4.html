        <h2>Most central Tāmaki Makaurau beaches safe for swimming</h2>

            <p>The rāhui over Waitematā Harbour has been lifted and Watercare says most beaches are now safe for swimming.</p>
        
            <p>Millions of litres of sewage per second spilled into the Waitematā Harbour when the Ōrākei sewer collapsed on 28 September creating a massive sinkhole.</p>
        
            <p>A rāhui was placed over Waitematā Harbour in response and Auckland Council has been keeping an eye on a number of inner city beaches which have been marked 'do not swim' on its Safeswim website.</p>
        
            <p>Tangata whenua and ahi kā of central Tāmaki Makaurau, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, held a karakia Thursday morning at Ōkahu Bay to fromally lift the rāhui.</p>
        
            <p>Several beaches remain unsafe to swim at according to the Safeswim website on Thuirsday morning, though at Ōkahu Bay was listed as 'safe'.</p>
        
            <p>Lifting the rāhui is a traditional means for recognising and managing the effects of such disruptions, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust chair Marama Royal said.</p>
        
            <p>"After close consultation with Watercare, and having conducted our own assessments, we are now confident that the mauri of our cherished Waitematā has recovered sufficiently.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pleased to announce the lifting of the rāhui. Activities such as swimming, fishing, and paddling can now resume," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank everyone for respecting the rāhui, and as we move into this next phase, let's remember our collective responsibility as kaitiaki."</p>

            <p>Watercare chief executive Dave Chambers said the overflows were heartbreaking to many Aucklanders but particularly for the people of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei as kaitiaki of the Waitematā.</p>
        
            <p>"Our water quality and wider environmental programme is ongoing, but the results so far indicate the harbour is recovering incredibly well and as a result, most beaches have green water quality pins on Safeswim again, which is great news ahead of summer."</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and Watercare are meeting with experts in environmental systems regeneration next week to begin planning for the rehabilitation of Waitematā.</p>
