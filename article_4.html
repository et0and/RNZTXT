            <p>Customs have arrested a 23-year-old woman for smuggling approximately 15.1 kilograms of methamphetamine, on a flight from Canada on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>During a baggage search at Auckland International Airport, Customs officers found 14 individually vacuum-sealed packages containing a white crystal substance.</p>
        
            <p>Initial testing returned a positive result for the presence of methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>She is facing charges of importation and possession for supply of a Class A controlled drug. </p>
        
            <p>The seized methamphetamine equates to a potential street value of up to NZ$4.55 million, and the seizure is estimated to have prevented up to NZ$15.9 million in social harm and cost to New Zealand.</p>

            <p>Customs Airport manager Paul Williams said trans-national serious and organised crime groups continued to manipulate and exploit individuals to carry out their illicit trade.</p>
        
            <p>"Customs is laser-focused on combating the harm that illicit drugs wreak across communities. This should send a message to others about the dangers of carrying out the leg work for organised crime.</p>
        
            <p>"No amount of money is worth the cost of getting caught and, in this instance, risking life imprisonment."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with suspicions about possible drug smuggling can contact Customs confidentially on 0800 WE PROTECT (0800 937 768) or Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
