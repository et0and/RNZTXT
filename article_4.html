        <h2>'Nothing like it': Running, solving riddles around Canterbury high country</h2>
        <p>
Nearly 500 people explored Canterbury's high country for 24 hours as part of TWALK, solving riddles in a rogaine-style event.

            <p>For 24 hours over the weekend, 500 people sprinted, ambled and wandered around the grassy plains of Canterbury's high country, searching for small markers and solving silly riddles in a rogaine-style event.</p>
        
            <p>TWALK - the 24-hour walk - has been running since 1967. It is organised solely by volunteers from the Canterbury University Tramping Club. The club selects a secret location, negotiating with local farmers for access, to host the event.</p>
        
            <p>The first event, organised by Greg Martin, was held at Mt Thomas. He had brought the idea to New Zealand from Australia after participating in a similar event while studying at Melbourne University. He did not alert landowners that there would be hundreds of strangers traipsing over their land, which led to a few confrontations that year with local farmers.</p>
        
            <p>TWALK 2024 organiser Alex Monckton said now landowners were always involved and were often provided with a small donation or community work as thanks.</p>
        
            <p>This year, the event was held in Mesopotamia, near the Rangitata River. The winning team called themselves Pack of Rafters.</p>

            <p>Over its history, TWALK locations have been scattered across Canterbury, including around Lake Heron, the Hakatere Conservation Park, Lake Coleridge, the Banks Peninsula and Mt Lyford.</p>
        
            <p>"Every year we aim to find somewhere new and this comes with many additional challenges managing the event in remote, unused-before locations," Monckton said.</p>
        
            <p>CUTC president Nick Slegers said the event had been growing yearly, with this year and last, being the biggest TWALK events ever.</p>
        
            <p>"We get a diverse range of participants, more so than your typical club rogaine event. It's open to the public and is a way to give thanks to our outdoors community that helps us do so much."</p>

The control is that way... maybe?

            <p>Monckton said the organisers were "free to go crazy and make the event whatever they want it to be".</p>
        
            <p>"It's special because it's so different to other rogaining competitions in that it's more about the amusement and fun rather than the technical and physical competition, which is, of course, still a large part of it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But when we throw in costumes, paper plates with silly unhelpful clues, a mystery location that no one knows until they arrive, random competitions like a colouring competition onto the map, there really is nothing else like it."</p>

            <p>At some point in the late 1980s, costumes were introduced to the competition, which participants must wear for at least the first leg.</p>
        
            <p>Slegers said it was an unofficial rule that those with orienteering backgrounds must make their costume particularly hulky, as a handicap to their team. World champion orienteers often compete.</p>
        
            <p>"The better you are at orienteering, the more gung-ho you are, the more incapacitating your costume should be."</p>
        
            <p>The best-dressed winner this year had built a cardboard car to wear.</p>
        
            <p>Another team had a model house with balloons suspended above their head like the home from the movie Up.</p>
        
            <p>There was also the Matagouri Huggers team that covered themselves in fake cuts and scratches, replicating the injuries trampers get when walking through the prickly plants.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of the event, participants will have hiked 100 kilometres, completing five legs, each around 10km to 20km long.</p>
        
            <p>Along the way, the teams must solve cryptic clues, such as "Good thing you aren't a cat," - relating to an orienteering control you had to cross a river to find, and "something amiss in the abyss," - for a control shoved down a crack in a rock.</p>

            <p>The Hash House provides a place of rest and rehabilitation in the form of tasty hot food cooked up by volunteers. One year volunteers cooked over an open fire, true camp style.</p>
        
            <p>Slegers said he was more proud of helping run TWALK than of his university studies.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all just students volunteering our time in between studies, work and our lives generally, which is such a big challenge," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's pretty special and pretty impressive that with such a high turnover of the club, we pull off such a monumental thing with just a bunch of passionate people who want to make it happen."</p>
        
            <p>
Hash House has been a part of the event since it first began; it's the base of operations where hot food is served to fuel race participants.
