        <h2>Twin baby dies after condition missed five times</h2>
        <p>
A sonographer and radiologist failed to diagnose critical conditions in two separate pregnancies, a new report reveals.

The Health and Disability Commissioner said the senior sonographer should have ensured the scan was correctly interpreted, or conveyed doubt.

            <p>A sonographer and radiologist failed to diagnose critical conditions in two separate pregnancies, including one involving twin babies where one later died, a report has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Health and Disability Commissioner Rose Wall has detailed problems in the handling of multiple ultrasounds.</p>
        
            <p>In the first case, signs of congenital pulmonary airway malformation were missed in a foetus, despite multiple ultrasounds. The condition was detected at 36 weeks by a different radiologist, delaying treatment that could have been carried out as early as 20 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>The baby underwent surgery before and after being born by Caesarean, including the removal of their right lung.</p>
        
            <p>Three of the four scans performed had "suboptimal images", failed to meet guidelines and often had incorrect labelling, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>The radiologist did not recognise the cystic mass and failed to recommend the mother for tertiary referral at the time of the scan.</p>

            <p>The second complaint involved a twin pregnancy where possible renal anomalies in one twin were overlooked during five scans.</p>
        
            <p>Despite evidence of abnormalities as early as 20 weeks, necessary follow-up steps were not taken, the radiologist signed off reports without seeing all the images, and one twin died three days after birth.</p>
        
            <p>Wall said these cases underscored the importance of maternity ultrasounds as vital tools for early detection of foetal issues.</p>
        
            <p>"In each case, this resulted in missed opportunities to diagnose medical issues with the developing foetus at the earliest opportunity. This delay in diagnosis had a profound and lasting impact on the consumers concerned and their wider whānau," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Both practitioners were referred to the Medical Council of New Zealand and the Medical Radiation Technologists Board.</p>
        
            <p>The radiology service involved in the breach of the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights had since introduced additional staff training and an audit of past scans.</p>
        
            <p>Wall also made further recommendations for improving standards and accountability within the radiology service in question.</p>
