            <p>Police and the family of Hawke's Bay teenager Ariki Rigby who was killed two years ago today have renewed pleas for anyone with information about her death to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old's body was found in a burnt-out car near Havelock North in September 2022, three days after her family reported her missing.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Rigby's whānau said two years on, they were still hurting.</p>
        
            <p>"She had her whole life ahead of her and was taken from us far too soon.</p>
        
            <p>"People out there know who is responsible for her death, and now is the time more than ever to break the silence and talk to police.</p>
        
            <p>"Ariki would have turned 21 later this month and instead of celebrating with her, we are left holding onto the memory of our beautiful girl who we wish dearly was still with us today."</p>
        
            <p>Police were committed to holding those responsible to account, and giving Rigby's whānau the closure they were yet to receive, Detective Senior Sergeant James Keene said.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the last two years, a dedicated investigation team with a wealth of experience has worked tirelessly on this case, reviewing hundreds of hours of footage, and assessing every piece of information police receive in relation to Ariki's death," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone with information that could help the investigation to speak with police.</p>
        
            <p>"People will be out there who know what happened to Ariki, and we urge them to do the right thing."</p>
        
            <p>Rigby's body was found in a dark grey Toyota Corona in River Road Recreational Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>Her death was initially treated as unexplained, before police launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>They reviewed their response after officers checking on the car failed to realise there was a body inside it for two days.</p>
        
            <p>Police were alerted to the car on 3 September 2022 after a caller reported what they thought was the body of an animal on the floor in the back of the car.</p>
        
            <p>After that officers had visited the car, but the body was not discovered until 5 September.</p>
        
            <p>"The condition of the vehicle and debris from the fire meant staff did not immediately identify the human remains," Eastern District Commander Jeanette Park said at the time.</p>
