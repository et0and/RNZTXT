        <h2>Splash Planet defends $45 ticket price</h2>
        <p>
Hastings District Council says criticism of pricing at Splash Planet is unfair because the attraction compares well with similar tourist drawcards in New Zealand.

            <p>Hastings District Council says Splash Planet's cost compares well with other similar tourist drawcards in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The council last week said miserable weather was to blame for 12,000 fewer people entering Splash Planet this summer season so far, compared to the same time last year, prompting criticism from readers who said its prices were what had put them off.</p>
        
            <p>Entry this summer is $45 for an adult (14 years and over), $35 for a child (six to 13 years), $32 for senior citizens, $15 for spectators, and children up to five years old are free.</p>
        
            <p>Group manager of community well-being and services Rebekah Dinwoodie said the park was unique because it combined wet and dry attractions, so it was difficult to compare it to other facilities in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But the pricing remained reasonable for a theme park attraction, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some examples of destinations we use to try to benchmark where we set our pricing are below, these facilities are similar but not the same," Dinwoodie said.</p>
        
            <p>"In comparison, Splash Planet is good value for money for a full day of varied entertainment," she said.</p>
        
            <p>While visitors can take picnics into the park, no takeaway food is allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Dinwoodie said the barbecue facilities were removed because health and safety requirements meant the hire service was not feasible.</p>
        
            <p>The park has a full capacity of 3000 visitors. The council says the cool summer is the main reason entry numbers are down.</p>
        
            <p>"On opening day Monday, November 18, there were 74 visitors. This low number was unsurprising as it was a cold day and children were still at school."</p>
        
            <p>Aquatics manager Tom Page said last week they were hoping for some real summer weather, "so we can all get out and enjoy the water, at whichever facility we prefer".</p>
        
            <p>At that time, park numbers were down on the previous summer by 12,000 and revenue was down by $320,000 (excluding GST).</p>
        
            <p>Numbers were still down over the past week.</p>
        
            <p>Dinwoodie said in the last week they had averaged 1165 per day versus 1329 for the same period last year.</p>
        
            <p>"The whole season's average is 824 visitors a day compared to 1124 for same period last year."</p>
        
            <p>To save money when the park is quiet, it is run with fewer staff.</p>
        
            <p>"There is lower use of power and fuel, and consumption of items such as pool chemicals, cleaning materials, and toiletries are down."</p>
        
            <p>Splash Planet closes for the season on 30 March.</p>
