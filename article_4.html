            <p>A professional motorsport racer says there's a culture of young drivers in the sport, but they are often more skilled than general adult drivers.</p>
        
            <p>Many young drivers were getting into the sport, some as young as 12, and it was not uncommon at all, motorsport legend Greg Murphy told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was a rigorous process before young people were allowed behind the wheel, and they were racing in a controlled environment.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to have dispensation to do that, but again, it's not on public roads. It's a closed competition environment, just like on a race track, effectively.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's not uncommon at all for younger drivers - 12, 13, and 14 years old to have competition licences because of the controlled environment.</p>
        
            <p>"We see it all the time - young talent coming through that's come through from karting and the other forms of the sport that deserve to be able to go and compete."</p>
        
            <p>He was commenting after Brooklyn Horan, 15, and Tyson Jemmett, 35, died when their car crashed into a ditch during the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa on Sunday, 25 February.</p>

            <p>Murphy said Brooklyn was already proving to be well ahead in his experience.</p>
        
            <p>"Someone like Brooklyn is already far, far, far more experienced and capable than people that have been driving on our public roads for 20-30 years."</p>
        
            <p>IndyCar champion Scott Dixon started racing at 13, Murphy said.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember racing Scott at Pukekohe when he actually rolled his Nissan Pulsar way back in the mid-90s," Murphy said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a culture now within the sport, starting earlier and earlier all around the world.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got young drivers showing their skill sets and prowesses and starting to compete long before they get a licence to drive on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"And the skills that they learn doing motorsport are just absolutely phenomenal. That's the best thing that can happen."</p>
        
            <p>He said young drivers competing did not need to have a co-driver, just a passenger at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"When you are competing in a rally which requires a road licence then you have a co-driver."</p>
        
            <p>In this situation, he said it was permitted as part of doing rally sprints because "effectively it is a rally except you just return and do the same bit of roads multiple times and it's all timed".</p>
        
            <p>"So it's a competition event in a closed environment where the road is closed, so that's how that works."</p>
        
            <p>Murphy told Checkpoint the incident "epitomises the word tragedy in this case".</p>
        
            <p>"I got to know Brooklyn pretty well over the last sort of 15 odd months and ... [he was] just a joy to be around, really infectious smile, just a wonderful young man who had been brought up incredibly well and just loved getting out there and enjoying his motorsport.</p>
        
            <p>"He was doing lots of different disciplines of the sport too and was clearly going to be a successful driver in his own right as he got more and more experience."</p>
        
            <p>Murphy said Brooklyn was following in the footsteps of his father, who was a good rally driver.</p>
        
            <p>He said Brooklyn was doing something that he loved yesterday but "ended in a situation where tragedy has taken him".</p>

            <p>Professional driver Hayden Paddon posted to social media, saying Brooklyn was a talented driver who would've gone all the way in the sport.</p>
        
            <p>He described the teenager as one of the nicest and most humble young men he had ever met.</p>
        
            <p>Paddon said he met Jemmett when he was waving the New Zealand flag at the World Rally Championships in 2017 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>He described him as a great business, sporting and family man, who always pushed to raise the profile of the sport.</p>
        
            <p>According to the rules on the MotorSport New Zealand website, the junior driver programme "allows people aged between 12 and 16 the ability to obtain a competition licence with a few extra steps".</p>
        
            <p>MotorSport New Zealand said it would cooperate with all investigating agencies as well as undertake its own thorough investigation into the two deaths.</p>
