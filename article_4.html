            <p>Thousands of people descending on Gisborne for the Rhythm and Vines festival have been warned to steer clear of waterways and beaches due to health risks.</p>
        
            <p>Severe rain on Boxing Day overwhelmed the city's wastewater systems, and the emergency sewer valve had to be released.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving said this resulted in contamination in the Taruheru and Turanganui rivers, which flow into Gisborne's beaches.</p>
        
            <p>SafeSwim have also issued a warning not to swim at Waikanae Beach, Wainui Beach, Tolaga Bay and Ocean Beach due to dangerous conditions, including large breaking waves, strong currents and strong winds.</p>

            <p>Surf Live Saving eastern region assistant life saving manager Nick Wagstaff is urging people to stay out of the water to avoid the risk of illness.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just advising the public to follow the Gisborne District Council's advice around not swimming in the affected waterways.</p>
        
            <p>"Just coming into contact with contaminated water is too big a risk."</p>
        
            <p>Wagstaff said all patrolled beaches in the area are showing a red water quality alert.</p>
        
            <p>"So we've still got a lifeguard in presence on Midway [Beach], Waikanae [Beach], Wainui [Beach] and Tolaga Bay.</p>
        
            <p>"Our lifeguards will be out on the beaches, roaming, keeping an eye on any public that do go swimming.</p>
        
            <p>On Facebook, Surf Live Saving said the Gisborne District Council was monitoring the situation and will provide updates as conditions change.</p>
        
            <p>The Rhythm and Vines music festival in Gisborne began on Sunday, with up to 30,000 people expected to attend over the next three days.</p>
        
            <p>Festival-goers had been taking the region's wettest December since records began in their stride, organisers said.</p>
        
            <p>Celebrations on the Waiohika Estate began last night with warmup events including New Zealand-based drummer and DJ, Messie.</p>
        
            <p>The festival had raised more than $30,000 for the Gisborne Mayoral Flood Relief fund.</p>
