            <p>Canterbury health officials are warning people to avoid the Waikirikiri-Selwyn River at Glentunnel because of a potentially toxic algae.</p>
        
            <p>Benthic cyanobacteria - which looks like dark brown or black mats attached to rocks - can be harmful to people and animals, Te Whatu Ora Waitaha Canterbury said on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Exposure may cause skin rashes, nausea, stomach cramps, tingling, and numbness around the mouth and fingertips," Dr Cheryl Brunton, medical officer of health, said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora says the algae can cause rashes, nausea, stomach cramps, tingling, and numbness around the mouth and fingers.</p>
        
            <p>"If you experience any of these symptoms, visit your doctor immediately," Brunton said.</p>
        
            <p>The algae had a "strong musty smell", the result of "a combination of available nutrients in the water and sediments (such as nitrogen and phosphorus), a sustained period of low and stable flows, and favourable weather conditions", such as warm, still days.</p>
        
            <p>Pets that come into contact with benthic cyanobacteria should be taken to the vet immediately, should they show signs of illness.</p>
        
            <p>"There are also other access points along the Waikirikiri-Selwyn River at Glentunnel that may have benthic cyanobacteria present," Te Whatu Ora said.</p>
        
            <p>The algae has appeared in previous years, prompting warnings.</p>
