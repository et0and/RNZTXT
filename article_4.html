            <p>How much did your school manage to fund-raise with raffles and sausage sizzles? Little tip, it helps when the world's biggest superstar is involved.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington primary school has raised an astonishing $112,500 by raffling off two Taylor Swift tickets, including airfares to London, seven night's accommodation and spending money.</p>
        
            <p>The money will go towards upgrading Clyde Quay School's hall.</p>
        
            <p>School board chairperson Michelle Little told Checkpoint the idea arose during a PTA meeting as an offhand comment.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine if we could? And then once we started looking into it, we realised actually maybe we just can," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We started scrambling to try and see what we could do to make it happen."</p>
        
            <p>She said putting up the price was a risk, as previously they had put items up for sale around $25,000.</p>
        
            <p>"We put up that price through previous fundraisers that we had run, bake sales, previous raffles, all the small school methodologies that we would usually use."</p>
        
            <p>Little said in some ways they risked the money with the knowledge and hope they would have some success and at least break even.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been blown away, absolutely blown away with the support that we've received with this," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The school has sold 4500 tickets for $25 each.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, when we were watching at [the] count down yesterday [for the tickets] to be sold out, all of us were just sitting here floored," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said they were hoping they would sell a little over their break even.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we passed the halfway point and we just couldn't believe it. This is obviously unreal and it's beyond our wildest dreams," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Little said after paying all of the tickets and paying tax, they will be looking at between $70-$75,000 raised for the school.</p>

The money from the raffle will be put towards upgrading Clyde Quay School's hall.

            <p>For another fundraiser in the future, they would consider buying Taylor Swift concert tickets again, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have definitely floated that as an idea, given the success we've seen of this and the support we've seen not only within Wellington, but all around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It really has seemed like it has been quite a successful method of raising money for otherwise quite difficult and cost effective construction work," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Little said the $75,000 would not cover the entirety of the construction work required, but it would make a significant dent in what the school aims to achieve.</p>
        
            <p>"The kids are very excited, as you can imagine. Taylor Swift is a very hot ticket right now. Every kid in the school is so excited and I believe every kid in school wishes that they were the one winning=."</p>
        
            <p>The raffle is set to be drawn on 1 August at 3.15pm.</p>
