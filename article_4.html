            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says he hasn't seen "independent advice" being cited by Associate Health Minister Casey Costello over a heated tobacco products tax cuts, amid concerns the change will benefit a tobacco giant.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, RNZ In Depth revealed officials told Costello that Philip Morris - the "sole supplier" of HTPs in New Zealand, would be the only commercial beneficiary of the tobacco tax cuts.</p>
        
            <p>Costello announced the cut on excise tax on HTPs in July saying she aimed to make them more attractive as an alternative to smoking.</p>
        
            <p>Treasury said there was clear evidence that HTPs were more harmful than vaping, but Costello said she had independent advice supporting the move.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ asked where the "independent advice" came from, but Costello would not say.</p>

            <p>Luxon told Morning Report he had not seen the independent advice.</p>
        
            <p>However he said the government was committed to trying anything that would stop people smoking tobacco.</p>
        
            <p>"It's simple as, we've got a smokefree target... vaping has helped get people off cigarettes</p>
        
            <p>"(HTPs are) potentially less harmful than smoking and we will try anything to get New Zealanders off smoking."</p>
        
            <p>The use of HTPs was a 12 month trial after which it would continue if successful, or be cut if not, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"The reality is we'll see how it goes... what we're focused on is the big picture which is making sure people come off smoking, that's what this is all about.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to try all of the alternatives and this is one of them."</p>
        
            <p>Luxon said ministers received a range of advice and while he hadn't see this specific piece he had confidence in Costello.</p>
        
            <p>"I have every confidence in the minister."</p>
        
            <p>She, like the government, was committed to lowering smoking rates in New Zealand, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Costello was reprimanded by the Chief Ombudsman last month for her handling of a mystery document containing tobacco-industry friendly ideas, which she passed to health officials to develop policy.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, Costello has denied having recieved advice from the tobacco industry.</p>
