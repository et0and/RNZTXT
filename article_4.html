            <p>A cannabis operation worth up to $15 million has been found in Auckland, and more than 5450 plants destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Simon Taylor said police had conducted search warrants in rural south Auckland this week, including in Āwhitu, Runciman and Glenbrook.</p>
        
            <p>They resulted in nine arrests so far.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said the operation was using the sites as "market gardens".</p>
        
            <p>"We believe the set-up, particularly in Āwhitu, is likely one of the largest we have come across within the Counties Manukau Police district," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This enforcement action has caused a considerable dent and there is no doubt this will have an impact on organised crime as a result."</p>
        
            <p>Taylor said such operations were a large source of income for gangs and organised crime groups.</p>
        
            <p>Police would continue to target them and shut the down.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to target such operations given they are funding organised criminal groups' operations, which in turn means harm continues to be imposed on our communities."</p>
        
            <p>In Āwhitu, police said more than two tonnes of cannabis plants at varying maturity levels were located alone.</p>
        
            <p>More than 5450 were destroyed from all three locations.</p>
        
            <p>Four Vietnamese nationals were arrested at the Āwhitu site, and a further five Vietnamese nationals were arrested at Glenbrook.</p>
        
            <p>The men are between the ages of 29 and 40, and six of them are facing charges of cultivating cannabis in Pukekohe District Court.</p>
        
            <p>Police were working alongside Immigration New Zealand with regard to the remaining three.</p>
