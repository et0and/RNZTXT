            <p>Rubbish - is what some people think of a proposal to cut Auckland's household waste collection from weekly to fortnightly.</p>
        
            <p>The idea is part of a plan to get the supercity closer to a zero-waste vision.</p>
        
            <p>Since November, Auckland Council has already been binning bins it says contractors often find empty, in an effort to save ratepayers $1.4 million a year.</p>
        
            <p>And some councillors fear halving household rubbish collection will lead to a dirty city.</p>
        
            <p>​Manurewa-Papakura Ward councillor Daniel Newman said he was yet to be convinced it was a good idea.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm trying my very level best to think about how this could work and how it could be convenient and work for my constituents," Newman told Checkpoint.</p>

            <p>"The idea in theory is great because [we] want to encourage people not to dump. But the reality is that some people will need to have that service more regularly.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the families that I represent in South Auckland, I think that they will struggle if they go from a weekly to a fortnightly rubbish collection service."</p>
        
            <p>He was concerned about fly dumping because it was already happening around Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I just don't want our community to be dirty. I don't want it to be a place where people tip their rubbish out."</p>
        
            <p>He said some people in council believed once the food scraps bins were well established, households would not need the landfill bins every week.</p>
        
            <p>Newman was not sure that would work.</p>
        
            <p>"When you factor in the additional fly-tipping costs, I don't think it's going to save money. I think it's going to probably come out about the same but with the lack of convenience for households that have gone from weekly to fortnightly."</p>
        
            <p>A draft of Auckland Council's Waste Management and Minimisation Plan for 2024 outlines a plan to "transition to a fortnightly kerbside rubbish collection".</p>
        
            <p>But that would only happen once the kerbside food scrap bins were "well established," the draft said.</p>
        
            <p>The council's goal was to incentivise waste reduction.</p>
