            <p>A Taranaki man who stole a car with a baby inside was watched from the public gallery by the child and its mother when he appeared in the New Plymouth District Court.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Jai Smith has pleaded not guilty to abducting a child, but admitted a raft of other charges including car theft, dangerous driving causing injury, burglary and breaching parole conditions among others.</p>
        
            <p>At the beginning of Thursday's proceedings, the court was advised the baby and its mother would be in the public gallery.</p>
        
            <p>In May, Smith - who appeared via an audio visual link - stole a car that was left unlocked with the motor running from outside a Waitara dairy.</p>

            <p>Discovering the baby inside, the 34-year-old pulled over not far away and left the child on the grass verge.</p>
        
            <p>Security camera footage showed Smith getting out of the car after driving a few hundred metres - and while it was still moving - grabbing something from the back seat and putting it on the verge on Cameron Street.</p>
        
            <p>Smith's defence counsel Nathan Bourke told the court the abduction charge was the last outstanding matter and involved a legal matter.</p>
        
            <p>At an earlier appearance, Bourke said the facts were acknowledged, it was just a question of whether the abduction charge was appropriate given the circumstances of the offending.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped that argument could be resolved at a pre-trial hearing.</p>
        
            <p>Today, a pre-trial hearing date was set for September and a nominal sentencing date in November should the abduction charge issue be resolved.</p>
        
            <p>Smith continued to be remanded in custody.</p>
