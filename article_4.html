            <p>At least two dogs have become sick after eating a fatty, smelly substance that was found on a beach south of Napier over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council cleared the unknown substance from Haumoana Beach, and sent samples away for analysis.</p>
        
            <p>But the council said it would "take some time" to find the cause.</p>
        
            <p>One commenter on its Facebook post said their dogs had become sick on Saturday after they ate the substance.</p>
        
            <p>"My dogs both ate this substance today, they went straight for it and I couldn't get them to stop, they're both vomiting."</p>
        
            <p>The council said it was continuing to monitor the beach.</p>
        
            <p>It asked people not to swim, and to keep dogs off the beach.</p>
