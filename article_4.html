            <p>A homicide investigation has been launched after two people were found dead at a home in Tūrangi.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Ryan Yardley said police were called to the Poihaere Street property shortly before 10pm on Wednesday night and located the bodies.</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard remains in place while an examination is carried out.</p>
        
            <p>Yardley said the public could expect to see an increased police presence over the coming days while police work out what has happened.</p>
        
            <p>"Police extend our deepest sympathies to the whānau and loved ones of the deceased, who we will continue to keep updated as the investigation progresses."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information, or who may have seen anything suspicious, is asked to call police on 105 and reference file number P059649530.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō District Mayor David Trewavas has talked to a family member at the scene and said he understood the deceased were a local couple.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes I think they are in a partnership situation, nothing is confirmed yet but the community is very safe. There are no other people involved," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Trewavas told RNZ the family was in shock.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty upset that's for sure. It's a quiet little beautiful street in Tūrangi, and yeah for this to happen on a Wednesday night is pretty devastating for everyone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was far too early to know what went so tragically wrong for the couple.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation teams are on the scene and probably will be here until tomorrow," Trewavas said.</p>
