            <p>Rock band Metallica will bring their M72 world tour to New Zealand in November 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The show at Auckland's Eden Park promises a whole bunch of experiences including access to a meet and greet, production and stage tours, food and beverage in the "black box" lounge, early entry into the venue, and access to what's called the "snake pit" - spots by the stadium as close to the band as possible.</p>

            <p>Metallica last performed in Aoteroa nearly 15 years ago where they unleashed two shows in Christchurch and two in Auckland. The band - made up of James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo - cancelled their tour of NZ in 2019 about a month before the scheduled shows, after Hetfield, the band's vocalist and guitarist, checked into an addiction recovery programme.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released at the time, the band members said: "As most of you probably know, our brother James has been struggling with addiction on and off for many years. He has now, unfortunately, had to re-enter a treatment programme to work on his recovery again."</p>
        
            <p>They said they were looking at securing a new tour period and would travel to Australia and New Zealand "as soon as health and schedule permit".</p>
        
            <p>The first Auckland concert at Mt Smart Stadium, which had been scheduled for 31 October 2019, sold out within 12 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The 2010 shows were Metallica's first in New Zealand since headlining the Big Day Out in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>Tickets for the 2025 set go on sale Monday, 4 November at 12pm. Fan club pre-sales begin Tuesday, 29 October. For more info visit metallica.lnk.to/M72-AU-NZ-2025</p>
