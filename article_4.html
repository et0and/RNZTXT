            <p>A ride at Auckland's Rainbow's End theme park has been closed until Wednesday morning, after it tipped over while people were onboard.</p>
        
            <p>Ranbow's End chief executive Karen Crabb said the log flume ride was caught as it was sliding down towards its end, tipping onto its side.</p>
        
            <p>Crabb said the park's staff immediately helped people out of the ride safely.</p>
        
            <p>There were no injuries, but the people at the front of the ride got wet, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Crabb described it as an "extraordinary event".</p>
        
            <p>She said there was no risk to passengers in the event of the ride tipping, other than getting wet.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff is reporting it was the third time the ride had flipped today.</p>
        
            <p>The ride was closed for the remainder of the day, as engineers check the ride railings, and is due to re-open on Wednesday.</p>
