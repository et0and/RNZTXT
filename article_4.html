        <p>
Those from Te Hāpua, near Cape Rēinga in the north, to Mangawhai in the south should be able to hear the sirens.

            <p>More than 200 tsunami sirens across Northland will be tested on Sunday morning to make sure they are working as intended.</p>
        
            <p>The first test will take place at 10am and last 10 minutes, with the second at 10.30am for 30 seconds.</p>
        
            <p>The region's extensive tsunami siren network stretches from Te Hāpua, near Cape Rēinga in the north, to Mangawhai in the south and Ruawai in the west.</p>
        
            <p>Northland Civil Defence spokesman Zach Woods said new sirens were currently being installed around the region, but only the existing network would be tested on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The twice-yearly siren tests were timed to coincide with changes in daylight saving time.</p>
        
            <p>Woods said it was important Northlanders also recognised nature's tsunami warning signs.</p>
        
            <p>"Local source tsunami - those generated close to the coast - can arrive ahead of any official warning, so everyone who spends time on the coast should know the natural warning signs of a tsunami.</p>
        
            <p>"They are a strong earthquake that's hard to stand up in or one that lasts longer than a minute, or unusual sea behaviour, such as a sudden rise or fall, or unusual noise."</p>
        
            <p>Woods said the old sirens would continue to be used and maintained until all the new sirens were operational. Only then would the old ones be removed.</p>
        
            <p>He said Northlanders could also use [www.nrc.govt.nz/evacuationzones Northland Civil Defence's interactive maps] to plan their quickest route to safety in the event of a tsunami.</p>
        
            <p>Northland's outdoor tsunami sirens are funded and owned by the Far North District, Whangārei District, Kaipara District, and Northland Regional councils.</p>
