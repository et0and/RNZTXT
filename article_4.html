        <h2>Mysterious Moa Point statue will return to its perch, locals vow</h2>
        <p>
Residents near the coastal community of Wellington's Moa Point say they will work to repair a mysterious Moa statue that has fallen from its perch high on a rocky outcrop just beyond the city's…

            <p>Residents near the coastal community of Wellington's Moa Point say they will work to repair a mysterious Moa statue that has fallen from its perch high on a rocky outcrop just beyond the city's airport.</p>
        
            <p>The more than two-metre tall bird was stealthily installed by Canadian guerrilla artist Lindsey Manning as a farewell gift to the area nearly six years ago.</p>

            <p>But some time ahead of new year the Moa - dubbed 'Cliff' - disappeared from view.</p>
        
            <p>Andrea Cootes has lived in Moa Point for the past 35 years.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was always a pleasure to look up and see the bird's silhouette staring out from the coast</p>
        
            <p>But she said the strong winds that battered the coastal suburb occasionally got the better of the plywood structure.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a lovely piece of artwork to view but when its not there you know it's been extremely strong, that it's once again come down," Cootes said.</p>
        
            <p>A former Moa point resident - who did not want to be named - said he took it upon himself to repair the Moa when it blew over in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>He said he planned to head back up the hill to re-erect the statue as soon as conditions allowed but the bird's remote location made it a real challenge to fix.</p>
        
            <p>"I tried several missions to get there and eventually I did. I tied a couple of ropes up there. It's a tiny little rock outcrop. How the original people that put it up there? I don't know how they found that spot," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Devon Diggle regularly cycled the coast road and said he always enjoyed the moment when the creature came into view.</p>

            <p>"It was quirky, fun and it was clever. Because you wouId look up and suddenly it would be there silhouetted against the sky.</p>
        
            <p>"I started to wonder whether I was going to have to duck because a Haast eagle would come by next. The Moa was quite real the way it sat up there so you always did a double take until you then realise you were actually at Moa point and maybe that was the point," Diggle said.</p>
        
            <p>Diggle said that when the statue disappeared from sight, it made him wonder if the people responsible for erecting it realised how much locals enjoyed its' presence.</p>
        
            <p>"There's something about art and sometimes there's something about guerilla art that can bring a community together and create those moments of contact that connect our community. I think that those are important things and for that I'm grateful. They're community touch-points," Diggle said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ tracked down the artist responsible for Cliff - Lindsey Manning - now living in Calgary, Canada.</p>
        
            <p>Manning said she built the statue with a friend in the week before she left New Zealand - after three years in the country on a visitors visa.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember looking up and thinking 'why does Moa point not have a Moa? I should make a Moa'. I phoned my best mate and his response was 'lets go to Bunnings and get you some ply'.</p>
        
            <p>"We went out to the cliffs and got pretty torn up by gorse in the process. We hauled up this eight foot Moa. I think that both of us nearly fell off the cliff more than once," Manning said.</p>

            <p>Manning said Cliff remained one of her favourite pieces and she was thrilled the community had taken him to heart.</p>
        
            <p>"It's blown me away that there's people that have rallied around Cliff. This is incredible.</p>
        
            <p>"To use my spark of madness to pass on a moment of joy - even if its brief - to another human. So I hope the Moa has been a joy for the majority of people and long live Cliff," Manning said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport - which owned the land Cliff once stood proudly upon - declined to comment on the Moa's presence or disappearance from the hillside near their runway.</p>
