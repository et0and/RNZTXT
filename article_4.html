            <p>A man jailed for murdering Christchurch woman Angela Blackmoore has told the High Court David Hawken threatened to kill his family if he did not commit the crime.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken and Rebecca Wright-Meldrum are on trial for the 1995 murder of Blackmoore, who was bludgeoned and stabbed 39 times in her Wainoni home while her two-year-old son slept in a nearby room.</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Powell confessed to Blackmoore's murder in 2019 and on Wednesday appeared as a Crown witness, when he told the court Hawken offered him and Wright-Meldrum $10,000 for Blackmoore's murder.</p>
        
            <p>"It was more money than I could ever imagine back then. It seemed like a huge amount," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said Hawken also threatened to kill his family if he did not murder Blackmoore, and he took the warning seriously.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew I he had gang connections. I believed he had done six murders up north. He was a very scary guy," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said he killed Blackmoore several days later and felt panicked before, during and after her murder.</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not have a detailed recollection of it.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember hitting her two or three times with a bat, I remember the bat breaking," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said he hit her with a bat first because he wanted to knock her out "so that she wouldn't feel anything".</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't want to hurt her," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said Hawken never paid him after the killing.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken's defence lawyer Anne Stevens KC argued Powell killed Blackmoore for his own satisfaction.</p>
        
            <p>She put it to Powell that he had invented Hawken's involvement to avoid taking the blame for her death.</p>
        
            <p>"You're saying this man contracted you to kill a woman you barely knew?" she asked.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes," Powell replied.</p>
        
            <p>"I suggest that did not happen, and that you have made that up to minimise your involvement - to blame somebody else for why you killed a woman in her own home in her kitchen," Stevens said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell denied this, and responded saying he accepted full blame for the killing.</p>
        
            <p>He agreed it was a cruel act and that Blackmoore died in terrible circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
