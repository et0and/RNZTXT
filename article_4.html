        <h2>Is Ōtara town centre really alcohol free?</h2>
        <p>
Ōtara town centre is legally an alcohol free zone, but "you wouldn't know it" according to some community advocates.

            <p>Ōtara Youth Hub manager Victoria Hearn said drinking is a "huge issue" in the town centre, even though it has been an alcohol-free zone 24 hours a day, seven days a week since 2015.</p>
        
            <p>"The town centre has a 24-hour alcohol ban but you wouldn't know it," Hearn told Local Democracy Reporting.</p>
        
            <p>She said the area outside the Ōtara TAB and liquor store is "a public drinking spot", with people avoiding shopping in problem drinking areas.</p>
        
            <p>"Girls report lewd comments from people drinking. People don't shop in problem drinking areas. It has been like that for 20 to 30 years," Hearn says.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to do something to stop it."</p>
        
            <p>Last weekend, Ōtara Youth Hub ran Proud to be Alcohol Free to raise awareness of town centre rules and "show people what the town centre should look like".</p>
        
            <p>Hearn said the event was to raise awareness positively: "We held the event in a part of the town centre where the worst part of public drinking happens."</p>
        
            <p>She said the local playground is in the worst part of town as people drink next to it.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to make a statement. This should be a place families can use," she said.</p>

            <p>But Hearn said the Proud to be Alcohol Free event wasn't without disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>"We had some confronting moments where rangatahi were painting signs on the footpath whilst elders were drinking," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had rangatahi from the Youth Hub pick up cans from people's feet."</p>
        
            <p>She said alcohol use generally comes from older community members.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to challenge that," she said. "It was the first time we saw kids walking around."</p>

            <p>South Auckland has among the highest concentrations of liquor stores in Auckland, which Hearn said could be normalising public consumption.</p>
        
            <p>She said awareness of liquor-free zones and tackling addiction were essential.</p>
        
            <p>"Lots of people are not aware it's an alcohol-free free area.</p>
        
            <p>"With alcohol and drug services, there is not a lot of uptake for regular drinkers. It is an addiction issue."</p>
        
            <p>The event involved educating people in the community on what to do when they saw an alcohol-related issue, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to report it to the police through the 105 number or online," she said, as this built data on the number of incidents in Ōtara town centre.</p>
