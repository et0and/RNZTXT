        <h2>Bringing the council to the people: Community hub caravan built for natural disasters</h2>
        <p>
It is designed to play an important role in supporting Marlborough to respond, recover and develop resilience to natural disasters and emergencies.

            <p>A purpose-built caravan that functions as a community hub during natural disasters - the second of its kind in the country - has been gifted to Fire and Emergency New Zealand in Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>The $135,000 mobile community hub is one several being funded by Rotary clubs, Air Rescue and other community organisations to be deployed in communities across the motu.</p>
        
            <p>It was designed to play an important role in supporting Marlburians to respond, recover and develop resilience to natural disasters and emergencies.</p>
        
            <p>Whakatū rotarian Trevor Marshall said the inspiration came after a FENZ mobile community hub caravan prototype from Christchurch was brought up to support Nelson during the 2022 floods.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was "incredibly successful" as it provided the community with an instant response and support. Alongside FENZ, the Nelson City Council and Civil Defence used the hub as a base on the ground to connect with people during the disaster.</p>
        
            <p>"A range of agencies were using it so they could get information to people and action things straight away, rather than setting up in a hall or trying to find another location or send them to the council ... it brought the council to the people."</p>
        
            <p>The units were designed to bridge the gap between the developing emergency and the arrival of other support agencies and local and central government assistance.</p>
        
            <p>The first mobile hub was introduced in Nelson late last year and was put into use during the February forest fire in the Lee Valley.</p>

            <p>Marshall said it was suggested that other rotary clubs might want to support their communities with a mobile community hub and he was now the project manager - with 11 other clubs around the South Island putting orders in for units to be deployed in their regions.</p>
        
            <p>The 5.5-metre long caravans were built in Ashburton and had a high clearance so they could be taken into rough terrain and were capable of being towed by a standard ute.</p>
        
            <p>The units were equipped with roof top solar panels and portable generators so they could function off grid during a disaster. They had a full kitchen set up with gas for cooking, along with fresh and grey water tanks. They also contained a defibrillator, first aid kit and fire extinguisher, and were equipped with charging stations and wifi.</p>
        
            <p>"They can be divided into a lounge and kitchen ... the sides of it open to become a stage with TVs and a speaker system that can be used for presentations.</p>
        
            <p>"The big thing in any disaster is keeping people informed and up to date with what's happening."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said Whakatū Rotary planned to introduce another four units in the top of the South Island and there was also work underway to build mobile hubs to support the East Coast, particularly after Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>"It really identified how vulnerable a lot of these small communities are and how long it can take for help to come, so we want to see these positioned in every medium-sized town so they have something they can use in response."</p>
        
            <p>The Marlborough mobile hub was blessed on Monday morning and was now operational. It would be stored at the Blenheim Fire Station.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ Nelson Marlborough assistant commander Steve Trigg said the mobile community hubs were incredibly versatile and could be used in a range of settings.</p>
        
            <p>"It will serve various purposes such as community support during incidents, as evidenced during the Nelson floods and the Lee Valley fire, community events like A&P shows, post-fire incidents and investigations, station open days, recruiting initiatives, and other endeavours that brigades deem fitting to support the community and spread our message of safety and support.</p>
        
            <p>Trigg thanked Rotary for its efforts in raising the funds to purchase the hubs.</p>
        
            <p>"Their dedication and hard work have made it possible for us to bring this valuable resource to our community."</p>
