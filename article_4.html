        <p>
Air Marshal Kevin Short loves his role, but says it comes with stresses that can't be delegated away.

            <p>New Zealand's Chief of Defence Force has been recognised for his service, after a career in the Air Force that has spanned nearly 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>Air Marshal Kevin Short has been appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the King's Birthday Honours for services to the New Zealand Defence Force.</p>
        
            <p>He said he loved the diversity of the role, but with it came the odd sleepless night.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things that makes me lie awake at night is the missions that we send our people on and the risks that I take and they take for New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Those deployments are about preserving the security globally, making sure the international rules-based system is working, but people do put themselves in harm's way."</p>
        
            <p>Short's tenure as the Chief of Defence Force has included several significant events, including the Whakaari/White Island eruption, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the evacuation of New Zealanders from Kabul during the 2021 Taliban take-over of Afghanistan.</p>

            <p>He said he felt honoured to receive such recognition for his work, and felt it reflected the work of the team that had worked alongside him.</p>
        
            <p>"I do want to acknowledge the great people who serve in the New Zealand Defence Force, because I personally believe it's their efforts that have allowed me to be recognised."</p>
        
            <p>Short joined the Air Force in 1976 as as a general duties navigator at 18 years old, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, father, two uncles and his older brother.</p>
        
            <p>"The pressure was to make sure I didn't fail, that I was successful, because I had a lot of people looking at how I would go in those early days."</p>
        
            <p>He then joined the No.5 Squadron in Whenuapai, flying a P-3B Orion.</p>
        
            <p>"I did four tours on that aircraft over a 15-year period and I absolutely loved the role, the maritime surveillance, the anti-submarine warfare, the search and rescues, those sorts of missions, I just loved everything about it."</p>

            <p>He spent four years in the late 1990s working in a standardisation role for the air force at the Pentagon in the United States. He also participated in missions to Afghanistan.</p>
        
            <p>Short was deployed as a task group commander in 2006, providing leadership for the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamiyan Province.</p>
        
            <p>"It was probably my most memorable role within the Defence Force.</p>
        
            <p>"When you put on that uniform and go into an operational area where there is a high threat to you and your people, it has quite a different effect on you and your leadership."</p>
        
            <p>Short was appointed Chief of Defence Force in July 2018 and will retire from the role in early June.</p>
        
            <p>He said the role came with responsibilities that could not be delegated to anyone else, but had to be managed.</p>
        
            <p>"As long as you have done everything you can to address a risk or issue then you should sleep well at night."</p>
        
            <p>He said the Covid-19 response resulted in challenges for the Defence Force, after deployment in managed isolation and quarantine facilities led to high attrition rates.</p>
        
            <p>It had taken some effort to try and stabilise the Defence Force so it could operate to the government's requirements, he said.</p>
