            <p>One of Wellington's most prominent property developers says the government's fast-track legislation makes him excited about building.</p>
        
            <p>At the weekend, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop announced 149 projects to be included in the Fast-Track Approvals Bill. Eleven of those were in the Wellington region, including projects such as a new sea wall for Wellington Airport and a second Mt Victoria Tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>But much of the items on the list relate to new housing developments, with the maximum number of homes that could be built from these projects equating to over 8600.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the projects, in Paraparaumu and Ōtaki, were being done by the Wellington Company.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Ian Cassels told RNZ it made him excited. Cassels said it was daunting for developers to go through the current consenting system at huge expense.</p>
        
            <p>"When you bear in mind what the positive is, [projects] get bogged down into all sorts of things that are quite, quite minimal in my mind."</p>
        
            <p>Cassels said that the legislation could allow projects to go ahead that would not be considered before.</p>
        
            <p>"Every now and again I wonder why on Earth anyone would want to be a developer, because there's piles and piles and piles of obstacles that people gleefully put in your way."</p>
        
            <p>Another development included in the fast-track list was Porirua's Plimmerton Farm - a development planned to deliver 2400 homes accompanied by a range of services.</p>
        
            <p>For some the project has been controversial, with environmental groups having criticised its proximity to Taupō Swamp, a 25-hectare lowland swampland classified as nationally significant.</p>
        
            <p>In comments made by the Greater Wellington Regional Council to the Environmental Protection Authority, it said it was critical that any sediment discharges as a result of the project were well understood.</p>
        
            <p>Porirua Mayor Anita Baker supported the project, and was confident environmental checks were in place to ensure Taupō Swamp was protected. Baker told RNZ the city needed this type of development.</p>

            <p>"We absolutely do need more housing, so yes, it's always been on our long-term plan, so it is something we need to grow into."</p>
        
            <p>Regarding the housing developments on the fast-track list for the Wellington region, Bishop told RNZ building more homes was a consideration for the list.</p>
        
            <p>"The housing developments included on the list could add more than 8500 new homes across the region in Porirua, Upper Hutt and Kapiti, if all are consented, which would make a huge difference for ensuring every Wellingtonian has a warm, dry home."</p>
        
            <p>On the topic of the second Mt Victoria Tunnel, Bishop said the government had included the Basin Reserve improvements, the second M=t Victoria Tunnel and the long tunnel in the fast-track list to speed up whatever option was selected.</p>
