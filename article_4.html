            <p>Changes to Auckland's kerbside recycling are set to hit from next month as new national standards come into play.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 February, only paper and cardboard, glass, tin cans and plastic types 1, 2 and 5, will be accepted for recycling, Auckland Council announced on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Aresol cans, tetrapacks, and all other types of plastics will no longer be able to go in the recycling bin.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council said this would reduce contamination of recycling loads by non-recyclable items, such as nappies or bagged rubbish, which costs $3 million every year to sort.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's planning, environment and parks committee chairman Richard Hills said putting the right items in recyle bins would help increase the quality of material collected and reduce disposal costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Reducing the use of single use items is the best way to reduce waste, following that, it is recycling right."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council collects about 132,000 tonnes of recycling every year from kerbside recycling bins, which are sent to facilities onshore and offshore.</p>
        
            <p>The changes, announced by the previous Labour government last year, meant the same items will be accepted for kerbside recycling across New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, no one item was recycled by all councils.</p>
