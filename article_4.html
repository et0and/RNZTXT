            <p>Otago residents are today taking stock in the wake of widespread floods. We've collected what you need to know about roads, today's weather, essential services, where to get help.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin and the Clutha District remain under a state of emergency, houses have been flooded in Dunedin, people have been evacuated, and there are water outages in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>Across Otago, 130 roads and highways were closed on Saturday morning with widespread slips, blocks and damage - and by 1pm, more than 60 remained closed. But both Dunedin City Council and Clutha District Council have urged people not to venture out unnecessarily.</p>
        
            <p>If there are immediate threats to life or property, always dial 111 for Police, Fire or Ambulance. Local authorities are responsible for civil defence emergency management in their area.</p>
        
            <p>There have been cell tower outages in places, and officials and welfare teams are working to make contact with those who have been cut off, including some isolated communities.</p>
        
            <p>There have been reports of wastewater treatment plants overflowing, and people in flooded areas are warned to treat all floodwater as contaminated.</p>

            <p>RNZ is NZ's statutory Civil Defence lifeline radio broadcaster, providing vital information and updates as they come to hand. All frequencies can be found here.</p>
        
            <p>Road crews are out today assessing damage to infrastructure and starting work to get all roads reopened.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite the weather easing, the city has experienced several slips, including a large one on the West Harbour, and some that have affected houses," Dunedin Civil Defence controller Sandy Graham said.</p>
        
            <p>"Connectivity in, out and within the city is a priority."</p>
        
            <p>By lunchtime Saturday more than 60 roads were sill closed, including 26 local roads in Dunedin, 17 in Waitaki District, 17 in Clutha District - but many highways had reopened.</p>
        
            <p>But many other roads had also been affected by the flooding and slips, so while people have been told to stay put unless necessary, anyone using the roads has been warned to do so with "extreme caution".</p>
        
            <p>New slips and fresh road closures are still expected because the ground is so sodden, with bad erosion in many places, Emergency Management Otago group manager Matt Alley said.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Airport is open, but has warned that road closures could affect those going to or from the airport.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, the council said their focus is to open the main arterial routes, "and provide access to the isolated areas including Toko Mouth, Kaka Point, Purakanui, Long Point, Papatowhai and Measley Beach."</p>

            <p>Several sections of highway south of Dunedin that were closed into the morning were reopened before midday, including SH1 between Waihola and Milton. While north of Dunedin, SH85 from Kyeburn to Palmerston had been reopened.</p>
        
            <p>Many stretches of highway are closed:</p>
        
            <p>SH1 north of Dunedin between Hampden to Evansdale had reopened by 1pm Saturday. Contractors there had been dealing with a 300 cubic metre slip of rock just south of Waikouaiti, Alley said.</p>
        
            <p>After yesterday's heavy rain red weather warnings were lifted by MetService by about 8pm Friday, the final severe weather forecast for Otago - a yellow heavy rain watch - was lifted from the map by mid-morning Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Conditions forecasters had warned could generate thunderstorms across the South Island until Saturday evening had largely gone. And while Clutha could still see "heavy thundery conditions" into Saturday evening, only showers were expected to accompany the clouds, forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>However, with the area still sodden, people should keep up-to-date with the latest forecasts, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Water: Water is still out for Dunedin's West Harbour and Otago Peninsula areas. Infrastructure has been damaged by a huge slip near Ravensbourne, and people are being asked to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin mayor Jules Radich said "with any luck" the water to the end of the peninsula could be reconnected by the end of Saturday. But the slip was expected to make restoring water to Port Chalmers and West Harbour communities "a significant logistical difficulty".</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known how long it will take to restore water to Dunedin's West Harbour and Otago Peninsula areas. Infrastructure has been damaged by a huge slip near Ravensbourne, and people are being asked to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday afternoon people can take containers to collect drinking water from tanks at Vauxhall, Mcandrew Bay and Portobello (check the DCC website as they may shift).</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, there are disruptions to the water supply for Tuapeka East, Glenkenich, Tapanui, Waipahi and Richardson North. And Tapanui has been issued an urgent conserve water notice as intake at the water treatment plant is cut off.</p>
        
            <p>A tanker is available at Bushyhill Park with drinking water - and Clutha District Council said they would prefer that water is used before the town supply.</p>
        
            <p>"While the water is currently safe to drink, we encourage you to fill up any drinking/cooking water from the tanker, to prevent the town running dry. We are running extremely low in the Tapanui reservoirs."</p>
        
            <p>In North Otago, Waitaki District Council warned people in Awamoko and Windsor to conserve water.</p>
        
            <p>Welfare centres: An evacuation centre is open at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin, where about 30 people stayed overnight. The East Otago Community Centre is also open for people to take shelter there.</p>
        
            <p>Food is available at both, and anyone seeking shelter is reminded to take any medicines or medical equipment they may need.</p>
        
            <p>"Pets are also allowed if caged or under control," the council said.</p>
        
            <p>In Clutha, three welfare centres that were open earlier have now closed, but the Red Cross is still running one at Te Whare PuƒÅwai o Tokomairaro in Milton.</p>
        
            <p>Waitaki District Council has now closed a welfare centre that was operating at Hampden Hall as those in need of a place to stay - mostly travellers - have been given places to stay with locals.</p>
        
            <p>Other essential services: Mt Cooee landfill and all Clutha transfer stations have been closed due to the heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Dogs and cats should be kept indoors until the floodwaters have gone, as cats can become trapped in areas by the water and dogs are at risk of injury or illness from swimming in contaminated water where hidden objects could also injure them, SPCA advice online said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency Management Otago group manager Matt Alley said support is available for farmers through the Rural Support Trust (0800 787 254), and dairy providers can contact milk suppliers if they have any concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Otago regional councillor Lloyd McCall said stock and pastures had been very much affected, especially lambs. But he warned farmers should prioritise their own well-being and safety, so they could do their best to keep looking after their stock, and to keep remembering that spring and summer are on their way.</p>
        
            <p>Insurance lawyer Peter Woods spoke to RNZ in 2023, about what to know about claiming insurance after damage to your home from floods.</p>
        
            <p>He said while people's instinct is often to get rid of flood-damaged items immediately, that could create problems for insurance claims. He recommended they speak to their insurance company about their plans to get rid of things before going taking action.</p>
        
            <p>When taking photos, he warned people to get photos of makes and models and any details that can help prove what the items are and their value.</p>
        
            <p>"You've got an obligation to prove your loss, which means that you should be taking photos of the damage, photos of the contents - [but] you should keep them even though you're pulling them out.</p>
        
            <p>"The insurance company should have the opportunity to check the contents before you dispose of them ... because otherwise there is a risk the insurer will argue about the value of the material that's being disposed of."</p>
