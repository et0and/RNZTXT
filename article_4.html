            <p>Wﾄ］aka residents are objecting to an application for a 24-hour McDonald's, saying it would go against the town's core community values.</p>
        
            <p>The company has applied for consent to build a fast-food restaurant in the town, with seating for 75 people, a drive-thru, and parking for 24 cars.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Sarah Morrison has organised a petition against the proposal, saying the fast food giant offered unhealthy food.</p>
        
            <p>McDonald's also produced large amounts of food waste and pollution, which did not belong in their town, she said..</p>
        
            <p>"We're not a place that encourages kids to be going out and eating a lot of fast food and a lot of things that are unhealthy for them.</p>
        
            <p>"We're a town that's really focused on wellness and sports and environment."</p>
        
            <p>Residents preferred to support local businesses that offered healthier foods and were more sustainable, Morrison said.</p>
        
            <p>Wﾄ］aka Chamber of Commerce general manager Glenn Peat said the proposal presented both opportunities and challenges for the town.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got a lot of infrastructure challenges that we need to address and part of that is going to create opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>"So therefore, is McDonald's part of that scenario? I don't know. That needs to be left up to the powers that be who make those decisions," Peat said.</p>
