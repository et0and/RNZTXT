        <h2>North Island town's beloved glockenspiel stops working</h2>
        <p>
The instrument usually performs a scene by Shakespeare's most famous star-crossed lovers.

            <p>The glockenspiel tower in Stratford, Taranaki's Shakespeare town, is out of order.</p>
        
            <p>The Stratford-revered glockenspiel has stood proud in the main street, Broadway, since it officially opened in 1996, but it had stopped working over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Usually it performs a scene of Shakespeare's most famous star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet, emerging for the balcony scene, reaffirming their vows of love, four times a day for about five minutes, after the hour chimes at 10am, 1pm, 3pm and 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>Stratford District deputy mayor Min McKay said it was a large tourist attraction.</p>

            <p>"It's iconic to Stratford and Taranaki in general," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"People would think of the glockenspiel when they think of Stratford.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's ever been a time where I've been around the tower with the songs going off that there wasn't someone or a few people watching from the road."</p>
        
            <p>She did not know the reason why it had stopped but hoped an engineer would check it on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Stratford is the sister city of Stratford Upon Avon, in the United Kingdom, which is the birthplace of Shakespeare.</p>
        
            <p>The life-size figures were created by Nigel Ogel, owner/curator of Tawhiti Museum, near Hawera.</p>
