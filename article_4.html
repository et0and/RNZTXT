        <h2>'Beloved' bell stolen from Wellington school</h2>
        <p>
A treasured school bell has gone missing from a Wellington school.
</p>
        
            <p>
A school bell that normally hung from this frame, and had been at Kelburn Normal School in Wellington for more than 100 years was reportedly taken on Tuesday 11 February, 2025.

            <p>A treasured school bell has gone missing from a Wellington school.</p>
        
            <p>Kelburn Normal School staff shared a post to Facebook that their "beloved school bell" was stolen from school grounds.</p>
        
            <p>The bell - which has been part of the school for more than 100 years - was more than just an object to the school, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a taonga, a symbol of generations of tamariki, whānau and staff who have been part of our kura over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"It is deeply upsetting to have something so significant stolen from us."</p>
        
            <p>Recently installed security cameras captured the theft on Tuesday evening, but it was not clear who the perpetrators were.</p>
        
            <p>The school has had previous issues with vandals, with some damage costing thousands in repair costs.</p>

            <p>Principal Danielle Sanders said she was shocked when she realised the bell had been taken: "It's just one of those things you don't think people would take."</p>
        
            <p>Sanders called on the people who took the bell to return it to where it belongs.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though they might think they can get a lot of money for it, it's probably not worth much - but it's worth a lot to our community," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Anybody with information on the disappearance of the bell is encouraged to get in touch with Kelburn Normal School, or police.</p>
