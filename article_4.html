            <p>New versions of two Covid-19 vaccines are up for approval by Medsafe.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation said it had accepted applications for the latest updates of the Pfizer and Novovax vaccines which cover the XBB 1.5 strain of Omicron.</p>
        
            <p>XBB dominated Covid case numbers during the winter, although now made up only about a fifth.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the approval process, the vaccine companies had been sending data and information for several months to Medsafe, which approves medicines used in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The agency now had enough to formally accept the applications, and would begin reviewing them.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris said that even though the updated vaccine was aimed at the now dwindling XBB, its protection would go further.</p>
        
            <p>"It's able to raise some quite robust antibodies against these emerging variants, including those that are starting to dominate here," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Older versions of the vaccine would still have an impact on newer virus strains - particularly against serious disease or death, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Funding for Covid vaccines had now been looped into Pharmac's budget, unlike early in the pandemic when the government created a separate fund.</p>
        
            <p>No decision on the new versions had been made yet, but Pharmac pharmaceuticals director Geraldine MacGibbon said she understood people were interested in being able to have them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with suppliers and the health sector to give New Zealanders access to these as soon as possible," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The number of people getting the current Covid boosters has spiked in the past few weeks as another wave of the virus hits the country.</p>
        
            <p>Wastewater analysis showed the virus was still on the increase in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Because people were no longer required to report when they had Covid, official daily case numbers did not reflect the actual cases in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora figures showed there were 332 people in hospital with the virus on Sunday, 3 December, 120 more than the same time a month earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The last time hospitalisations were trending that high was April.</p>
        
            <p>Current boosters are available to anyone over 30, and people over 16 at higher risk of serious illness, six months after their last booster or bout of the virus.</p>
