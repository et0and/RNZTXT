            <p>One of the founders of New Zealand's pirate radio station and then first commercial radio station Radio Hauraki, David Gapes, has died.</p>
        
            <p>In 1966, David Gapes was one of a group who took a boat out into international waters in a bid to bring pop music to the people of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>After four years of operating from sea, Radio Hauraki was granted the first licence for a commercial station in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Gapes stayed on as an executive at the station until 1977.</p>
        
            <p>He then managed the band Hello Sailor, one of New Zealand's most popular bands at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Gapes later returned to journalism, working for the Star, and then as the first editor of film and television industry magazine OnFilm, and later the editor of AdMedia.</p>
        
            <p>He was awarded the officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to broadcasting in 2019.</p>
