            <p>A slip has come down on the French Pass Road in the Marlborough Sounds, blocking access to the French Pass settlement.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough Roads engineers are assessing the site today and diggers are on the scene to begin shifting the slip material off the road. Marlborough District Council said it's hopeful the road can be reopened by Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The rockfall occurred about half a kilometre from the Te Aumiti/French Pass settlement.</p>
        
            <p>Signage is being installed at Okiwi Bay and Rai Valley warning drivers that the road is closed. There is no alternative land route into French Pass.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough District Council said the Emergency Management team has been advised and will be assisting the French Pass community where needed.</p>
        
            <p>D'Urville Island Wilderness Resort is running a boat from French Pass to Nelson around 4pm on Friday, returning to French Pass on Sunday. People needing to get to town can contact the resort for more information.</p>
