            <p>Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly is heading to Aotearoa for a special one-off show in March.</p>
        
            <p>The 69-year-old will be joined on stage at Auckland's Hollywood Avondale by his nephew Dan Kelly and Goodshirt's Rodney Fisher.</p>
        
            <p>The intimate show marks Kelly's first return to Auckland since performing a sold-out New Zealand tour in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Kelly, who was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity, has 19 studio albums, several film and TV soundtracks and multiple awards to his name.</p>
        
            <p>While his back catalogue is full of timeless classics, fans can perhaps expect a few contemporary additions next month too - Kelly has recently covered Taylor Swift's 'Anti-Hero'.</p>
