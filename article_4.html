            <p>Massey University has cancelled online supervised exams today due to technical problems.</p>
        
            <p>The decision has come just days after Massey's two-week, mid-year exam season began.</p>
        
            <p>A message seen by RNZ said there were "technical issues" with the university's online supervised exam provider.</p>
        
            <p>It said the university would update students later today about exams scheduled for later this week and next week.</p>
        
            <p>Students sit online supervised exams from home or work, but are monitored via the cameras on their computers.</p>
        
            <p>"The university is deeply disappointed by this failure of service, and I appreciate the exam period is already a stressful time. Many of you are likely to have made arrangements to sit these exams, taking time off work or needing childcare, I acknowledge and apologise for this disruption," the university's provost, Professor Giselle Burns said in the message.</p>
        
            <p>"A full investigation into how this issue occurred is underway. Decisions around next steps for the remainder of the exam period are being prioritised and we will be in touch via email by close of business today with an update."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands problems also halted some exams on Tuesday.</p>
