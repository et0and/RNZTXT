            <p>After more than 40 years weathering storms, snow, glaring sun and gale-force winds the much-loved Pouākai Hut in Te Papa-Kura o Taranaki / Egmont National Park is being replaced.</p>
        
            <p>One of the oldest huts in the national park, Pouākai Hut sits just below the junction of Mangorei and Pouākai Tracks on the range from which it takes its name.</p>
        
            <p>Since it was built in 1981, the existing 16-bunk hut - which has commanding views over the northern Taranaki coastline - has sheltered generations of day walkers and overnight trampers - and more recently thousands of Instagram hopefuls trying to capture the mirrored image of Taranaki Mounga in the nearby Pouākai Tarns.</p>
        
            <p>The original hut has been dismantled, and it is replacement will feature 34 bunks across four bunk rooms with an additional two separate bunks for wardens.</p>
        
            <p>The start of construction marks a new phase of development for the Taranaki Crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Kānoa - the Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit - is investing $13.4 million in the Taranaki Crossing, with the Department of Conservation providing another $3.4 million.</p>
        
            <p>The project is a partnership between Ngā Iwi o Taranaki, DOC.</p>
        
            <p>DOC Hauraki-Waikato-Taranaki regional director Tinaka Mearns said Pouākai Hut was the busiest in the national park, with a 95 percent occupancy rate during the summer period.</p>
        
            <p>"After years of service Pouākai Hut is now showing signs of considerable wear and tear - and with demand for overnight stays increasing, it's appropriate to provide visitors with a facility that is fit-for purpose," said Mearns.</p>
        
            <p>Co-chair of the project and Ngā Iwi o Taranaki representative, Liana Poutu, said the replacement work was a significant component of the Taranaki Crossing Project.</p>
        
            <p>"The increased capacity of the hut will assist in managing the safety and environmental impact of increased visitor numbers to the area.</p>
        
            <p>"The new hut will provide a facility not only for increasing visitor numbers, but also opportunity for visitors to engage in the cultural narrative for the hut's design."</p>
        
            <p>The build is costing approximately $2.4 million.</p>
        
            <p>The hut gets many visitors coming for the day to visit the tarns, it has been designed to accommodate them without them stumbling over those staying overnight.</p>
        
            <p>There will also be a large deck area, and two toilets separate from the hut toilets to accommodate short-term guests.</p>
        
            <p>Some overnight visitors will also be pleased to find the sleeping and dining areas will be separate in the new building.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki iwi representative Jacqui King said mana whenua had been involved since the start in helping shape the design to honour ngā maunga and manaaki for manuhiri throughout.</p>
        
            <p>"Collaborating closely with DOC, the process has come up with a building that ensures the hut's footprint is no larger than the existing site to lessen the impact on the taiao," said King.</p>
        
            <p>"This was balanced with the need to ensure manuhiri have the necessary manaaki and extended facilities to cope with the growing visitor numbers.</p>
        
            <p>"[Local hapū] Ngā Mahanga a Tairi's cultural narrative is being developed in readiness for the final stages of the build to help deepen manuhiri connection and respect for ngā maunga. As tangata whenua, we are looking forward to sharing these stories with the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>The Mangorei Track to Pouākai Tarns would remain open throughout construction, with the track re-routed around the active work site. Visitors are asked to follow the advice of signage or workers on site to keep everyone safe.</p>
        
            <p>Pouākai Hut had been temporarily removed from the DOC booking system while works were underway, and camping would not be permitted.</p>
        
            <p>Mearns said while temporary toilets had been established, there would be no water on site, so visitors should come prepared for the changed conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect to open the new Pouākai Hut to be open to visitors in May 2025, with bookings reopening closer to the time," Mearns said.</p>
        
            <p>"Like all our work on the maunga, this project relies on good weather, so we can't set a firm date for completion. However, we will provide updates on this mahi as it progresses."</p>
        
            <p>Construction of the new Pouākai Hut is being undertaken by Taranaki-based firms, further supporting the Taranaki Crossing Project's economic goals.</p>
