        <p>
"The [council] and their paid bureaucrats clearly are out of touch with what the people of Hamilton can afford," one submitter says.

            <p>Anger, understanding and pleas for niche funding areas are all part of the nearly 3000 submissions received for the Hamilton City Council's draft Long-Term Plan.</p>
        
            <p>The council has proposed a 19.9 percent rates rise for the next financial year, with annual increases adding up to 81 percent over five years.</p>
        
            <p>Many submitters like David Bird expressed horror at the proposal. In his submission, Bird said the proposal was "obscene".</p>
        
            <p>"The [council] and their paid bureaucrats clearly are out of touch with what the people of Hamilton can afford," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, some submitters expressed empathy for the situation the council was in.</p>
        
            <p>"Better the books are balanced as soon as possible," Paula Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>Submitters were asked to provide their ideas on how the council could save money and lower the proposed rate rises.</p>
        
            <p>Maree Szanto's main feedback was to ask how things got so bad.</p>
        
            <p>She wondered whether councillors would take a pay cut, but she wanted to see the Boon Street Art Festival still funded and more public artwork on council owned buildings.</p>
        
            <p>Submitter Helen Roach said the mayor, councillors, and chief executive should all take a pay cut.</p>
        
            <p>Susan Graham submitted lots of ideas for cutting costs and said the council should remove education programmes, climate-related projects, buses that "do not earn their way", city safety projects, events, the museum, street cleaning, council communications and marketing, and anything that volunteer groups could do.</p>
        
            <p>However, Russell Knaap said in his submission that "actually it's not my job to identify individual savings".</p>
        
            <p>More than 120 submissions were on behalf of an organisation.</p>
        
            <p>Many of these focused on specific parts of the budget. For example, Richard Tuhoro submitted on behalf of the Hamilton Baseball Association on the need for lighting at Mahoe Park.</p>
        
            <p>Several national organisations and businesses, including Air New Zealand and SkyCity, were critical of the proposal to reduce funding of Hamilton and Waikato Tourism (HWT) by 50 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"In our view, HWT is one of the most high-performing Regional Tourism Organisations (RTO) in New Zealand who operate with the least funding," Jason Dawson, on behalf of Air New Zealand, said.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the visitor economy is still suffering from the long-tail of impacts from Covid-19 and the current cost-of-living crisis, the timing is not right to reduce any further support for HWT as the sector struggles to rebuild and maintain competitiveness in an ever-changing international market," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff will now prepare a report on the submissions which will show any themes or patterns to the feedback.</p>
        
            <p>Council will hear verbal submissions in late May.</p>
