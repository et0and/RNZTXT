            <p>The police are launching a new operation to track down fugitive Tom Phillips and his three children, who have been on the run since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Andy Saunders said police will be in the wider Marokopa area over the next few days as part of their search for the family.</p>
        
            <p>Officers will be investigating north of Marokopa, in and around Te Waitere and Te Maika.</p>
        
            <p>"This has not been prompted by any specific sighting - it is simply a continuation of the ongoing investigation," Saunders said.</p>

            <p>In June 2024, an $80,000 police reward for information that led to the safe return of the children expired, with no sign of the fugitive father or his kids.</p>
        
            <p>The hunters' video had been the first sighting of the missing family in nearly a year.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2023, CCTV footage in the southern Waikato town of Piopio allegedly showed Phillips, along with a child, smashing the glass of a Piopio store.</p>

Police are seeking information about a quad bike which was reported stolen from a Marokopa Road property in Te Anga on 2 November and is believed to have been driven south by Tom Phillips and one of his children.

            <p>In September 2023, police issued a warrant for Phillips' arrest in connection with an armed robbery of a bank in Te Kūiti in May that year.</p>

            <p>In August 2023, a masked man believed to be Phillips was spotted at Bunnings hardware stores in Te Rapa and Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>The man used what police described as a large amount of cash to make purchases at both stores, including headlamps, batteries, seedlings, buckets and gumboots.</p>

Police released an image of Tom Phillips wearing a white beanie, a surgical mask and glasses taken at Bunnings in Te Rapa, Hamilton, on Wednesday 2 August.

            <p>The children's mother, known as Cat, told Mata Reports she recognised her former partner in the Hamilton Bunnings carpark in the same incident.</p>
        
            <p>Also in August 2023, Phillips was involved in a car chase on the road to Kāwhia, which began after a member of the public recognised the stolen ute he was driving in the Waikato town of Pirongia.</p>

            <p>The family first disappeared in September 2021, sparking a 17-day search in dense bush surrounding Marokopa.</p>
        
            <p>Police later charged Phillips with wasteful deployment of police resources, but he failed to show at Te Kūiti District Court on 12 January 2022.</p>
