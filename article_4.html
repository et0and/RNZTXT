            <p>Invercargill mayor Nobby Clark has publicly apologised for repeatedly breaching the council's code of conduct.</p>
        
            <p>Clark had been censured twice for using racial and homophobic slurs, along with insulting and degrading behaviour during a TV interview.</p>
        
            <p>He first used the n-word at an Art Foundation event in March 2023, then repeated it in an episode of satirical news show New Zealand Today.</p>
        
            <p>Two other councillors laid a complaint about it.</p>
        
            <p>He was formally censured last month and a council vote to formally ask him to resign was narrowly defeated after a different Code of Conduct complaint for offensive behaviour at a firefighter prizegiving.</p>
        
            <p>He refused to step down from public appearances before admitting he returned to work too soon after open heart surgery and took a month off.</p>
        
            <p>Clark was censured for a second time at an extraordinary meeting last week.</p>
        
            <p>At a regular council meeting today, he publicly apologised for his actions.</p>
        
            <p>"I openly apologise for breaching the Code of Conduct and the expectations that you would have of my role," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>"I apologise for the negative impact it's had on my colleagues and on the council's standing in the community and the wider community."</p>
        
            <p>Clark said he had also apologised to the united fire brigade association and Miss X who were involved in the second breach.</p>
        
            <p>"Given that Miss X wasn't the MC of the event, she had nothing to do with the running of it, but I'm not prepared to make an issue of that," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Clark hoped his apology today would "put the issue to rest".</p>
        
            <p>The apology was a condition of the council's extraordinary meeting last week, which was called to discuss his actions.</p>
        
            <p>As a result he was asked to make a "sincere public verbal apology".</p>
