            <p>An Auckland house fire which left two young men dead and a third seriously injured was started as a fire in the home's chimney.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwa Ropitini-Fairburn, 25, and Tony Marsters, 24, died in the blaze on Freshney Place in Hillpark, shortly before 7am on 13 May.</p>
        
            <p>The pair had been living at the home with their friend, who survived the fire and is recovering from serious burns.</p>
        
            <p>A full investigation into the cause of the fire has now been completed.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency New Zealand spokesperson said the cause had been a fire in the home's chimney which was [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/517085/hillpark-fatal-house-fire-not-suspicious-police-say</p>

            <p>The spokesperson said it was a reminder for anyone with a fireplace to get their chimney cleaned before the first fire of the season.</p>
        
            <p>It was also found the home had no smoke alarms.</p>
        
            <p>"Fire and Emergency recommends working smoke alarms in every living area, hallway and bedroom," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Ropitini-Fairburn had been a "loved member" of Kaihaka kapa haka group, founder and owner Eru Rarere-Wilton said.</p>
        
            <p>He noted Ropitini-Fairburn travelled to other countries, including China and Italy, to perform with the group.</p>
        
            <p>"Kiwa was my wife's nephew and lived with us for a bit before moving into that house with his best friends.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all come as a shock. He was such a loving and beautiful soul and so talented.</p>
        
            <p>"He had an amazing singing voice and when we were in China they all called him the karaoke king."</p>
        
            <p>Learning of the deaths of Ropitini-Fairburn and Marsters was "deeply saddening", Rarere-Wilton said.</p>
        
            <p>Kiwa Ropitini-Fairburn and Tony Marsters were "like brothers", Rarere-Wilton said, after becoming friends at Kia Aroha College while studying coding.</p>
        
            <p>They both continued their education in communications at AUT, and recently worked in hospitality, he said.</p>
