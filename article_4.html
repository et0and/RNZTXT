            <p>Four men smashed their way into an Auckland petrol station overnight and escaped with a range of items.</p>
        
            <p>It's the latest in a string of robberies targeting petrol stations across the city, with a Western Springs Caltex worker threatened with a hammer in another break in over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the burglary began at the closed Remuera petrol station at 11.06pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the offenders smashed a window to get in, before taking a range of merchandise and fleeing in the green station wagon they arrived in.</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter was among the units that responded and the car was found abandoned in a nearby street.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a number of inquiries were underway and they asked anyone who can help to call 105 or Crime Stoppers, quoting file number 240306/4766.</p>
