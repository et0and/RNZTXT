            <p>Gisborne's Rhythm and Vines is kicking off at 2pm with a damp start, as well many other New Year's celebrations across the country, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>The music festival is expected to have 30,000 people attend over the next three days.</p>
        
            <p>But when rain forecasted to linger and a high of 26 degrees Celsius today, and 22C overnight MetService meteorologist John Law warned campers could be in for a muggy night.</p>
        
            <p>A front was set to move up the country on Sunday, and Law said it would be a wet and cloudy one for people celebrating in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"But for places like Taranaki, an improving story through the day time, with some clearer skies returning just in time for the evening.</p>
        
            <p>"While down the eastern coast of the South Island, for places like Christchurch, we'll see a touch more cloud as we head through the evening, and a few showers and they may just push their way up to the capital as well."</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said whether 2023 ends on a wet or dry note will depend on how fast that front moves through.</p>
        
            <p>"The outlook is favourable for the Deep South and Otago at the stroke of midnight, however things may be a bit dicey elsewhere. It is worth saying though, being a few days away, there's still some wiggle room with those timings."</p>
        
            <p>As the sun rises on 2024, a ridge of high pressure was forecasted to arrive and should bring settled weather to the country.</p>
        
            <p>"Apart from some showers in the western South Island and windy westerlies along the Southland coast, the outlook for Monday and Tuesday is not a bad way to start a new year," Makgabutlane said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, there were multiple warnings and watches across the country for Friday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the ranges of Westland, south of Otira could expect a further 90 to 120 mm of rain on top of what has already fallen.</p>
        
            <p>There would be peak rates of 20 to 30mm per hour expected until late afternoon, with another burst of heavy rain expected overnight Saturday into Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>An orange warning was also in place for the Tasman district northwest of Motueka, and in the North Island, around Taranaki Maunga.</p>
        
            <p>MetService was forecasting a further 70 to 90mm of rain and 70 to 110 mm of rain, respectively.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said there was likely to be "flashes of lightning, rumbles of thunder and some pretty intense bursts of rainfall".</p>
        
            <p>He said there were also several heavy rain watches in place, for northern and central parts of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Northland, Auckland, including Great Barrier Island and the Coromandel Peninsula, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taup≈ç, Tongariro National Park, the Kaimanawa Mountains, and even further east like the Bay of Plenty and Rotorua could get hit with downpours of 25 to 40 mm per hour.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, the Taraua Ranges also has a heavy rain watch, as does Buller, Richmond and Bryant ranges, including the Rai Valley and Fiordland, north of Doubtful Sound.</p>
        
            <p>And while other parts of the country were not forecast to get to watch or warning level, "we're all going to get a bite of rainfall", Law said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rain is spreading quite nicely across most of the North Island and even on that eastern side of the South Island, we'll have a spell of rain for a time before it clears out."</p>
        
            <p>Law said it was not the kind of camping weather people would be looking forward to between Christmas and New Year.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a fairly significant amount of rain to come through and it may well lead to things like streams and rivers rising pretty rapidly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of these areas that have the watches and warnings are your classic spots where people like to get out and about, so as always it's always worth checking the forecast before you plan to head out on any tramps."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Christchurch and Ashburton were forecast to hit 30 degrees Celsius on Friday, prompting MetService heat alerts advising people to keep hydrated, seek shade, check in with vulnerable people and look after pets and livestock.</p>
        
            <p>Law said it would also be hot in Napier and Hastings with an overnight "low" of about 20C and forecast highs of 33C on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not great weather if you're in a tent," he said.</p>
