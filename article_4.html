            <p>A person has died and others are unaccounted for after a house fire in Southland, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency service were called to the house fire on View Street, Manapouri shortly after 3.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Mark McCloy said they were still working to account for all residents.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was underway and the cause of the blaze continued to be unexplained, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbour Allan Biggs said a few neighbours had gathered on the street and he could hear the fire crackling.</p>
        
            <p>"With the siren going off, eventually curiosity got the better of me and I got up and just surprised to see the house well alight across the road," Biggs said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do get the odd callout of a fire engine in the middle of the night, but it's usually a traffic accident or something like that, nothing like this before."</p>
