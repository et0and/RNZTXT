        <h2>Marlborough's 100-year bridge</h2>
        <p>
A temporary bridge that was "rattling" more by the day has been retired, and a new bridge should be future proofed for the next 100 years.

            <p>A temporary bridge that was "rattling" more by the day has been retired, after a new $4m bridge was opened in the Waihopai Valley in Marlborough on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The single lane bridge over the Waihopai River is 100m upstream from the former bridge site which was swept away following flooding in July 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the local community celebrated its opening with Marlborough mayor Nadine Taylor, councillors, NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi representatives, Marlborough Roads staff and contractors on Monday afternoon.</p>

            <p>The completion of the project had future-proofed road access to and from the Waihopai Valley, Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>"This new structure is impressive and a vast improvement on the one we lost. It will be of benefit to all users and its completion marks a final return to normality for the community.</p>
        
            <p>"The new road downstream of the bridge is also more resilient with it now higher up on the terrace to protect it from future flooding," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was expected to have a 100 year life, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor told a small number of community members that came to the celebration the bridge was built for them.</p>
        
            <p>She said a "mighty storm" had washed the previous bridge away and the council had worked consistently to get the consents it needed to rebuild and reconnect a community.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything should now go back to normal, if not better," she said.</p>

            <p>Judy Hull, who lived about 3km past the bridge, said she was happy to see the bridge opened, as the temporary bailey bridge was "rattling" more by the day.</p>
        
            <p>At last count, she understood more than 80 people lived past the bridge.</p>
        
            <p>Alison MacKenzie, who lived 11km past the bridge, said it was great to see the bridge opened.</p>
        
            <p>Both MacKenzie and Hull agreed that shingle and logs had built up on the old bridge, and hoped the new bridge would resolve this.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA Waka Kotahi senior project manager Andrew Adams said options for the new bridge location were confirmed in 2022 and geotechnical investigations concluded by mid-2023.</p>
        
            <p>The contract was awarded to Egypt Ltd, a Nelson-based bridge contractor with a yard in Havelock, in November 2023.</p>
        
            <p>
The new bridge cost $4m and came in under budget.

            <p>Their designer Thelins completed the detailed bridge design by early 2024 with construction starting in April last year.</p>
        
            <p>"The reinforced concrete bridge beams were precast in Nelson - each weighing 24 tonnes - and were delivered on low-loader and placed by crane from the riverbed.</p>
        
            <p>"Egypt Ltd's team stayed locally during the week to undertake the construction, only going home on weekends.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a fantastic effort and a great result to have the bridge finished on schedule."</p>
        
            <p>Egypt Ltd project manager Mary Barnett said the project was special, as it was their biggest bridge built to date.</p>
        
            <p>They were grateful for the local support, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The bridge was completed in December with finishing works on the 800m of road alignment to and from the bridge completed in early February.</p>
        
            <p>Taking away the temporary Bailey bridge and the remains of the old bridge had also been completed.</p>
        
            <p>The bailey bridge, a portable, prefabricated truss bridge, had been in place since August 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The project cost was approximately $4m and came in $1.1m under budget. This included design and construction, road realignment, surfacing and drainage, geotechnical investigations, alignment design, land and consents. It was 95 percent funded through NZTA's Financial Assistance Rate.</p>
