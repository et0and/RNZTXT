        <h2>Risky sewerage pipe could cause major motorway to slump</h2>
        <p>

            <p>A 60-year-old sewerage pipe that runs under State Highway Two would cause the motorway to slump if it collapses, Wellington Water has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported last week that the pipe - which was laid in 1963 and carries all of Upper Hutt's sewage - is at risk in two separate areas.</p>
        
            <p>A new statement from Wellington Water said due to corrosion, a 360-metre section of the pipe in Melling was at risk of collapse and could cause State Highway Two to slump.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water wastewater chief advisor Steve Hutchinson told RNZ they were looking at contingency plans to "mitigate any impacts a collapse may have".</p>
        
            <p>Infrastructure Minister and Hutt South MP Chris Bishop said it was very concerning.</p>
        
            <p>"State Highway 2 is a critical thoroughfare for the Hutt Valley and indeed the wider region, [it] carries tens of thousands of cars per day and so obviously we need to figure out a plan."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said it reflected the state of water infrastructure in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it speaks to the level of under investment in pipes over the years in the Wellington region, which we are now grappling with as a region and as a government as well."</p>
        
            <p>He said as a local MP he will be following up with the relevant agencies to make sure they came up with a plan for the pipe.</p>
        
            <p>Hutchinson said Wellington Water were working with NZTA Waka Kotahi, Upper Hutt and Hutt City Council on what their next steps would be.</p>
        
            <p>The water provider was first notified of the problem at the end of March by workers on the Riverlink project - a programme designed to improve flood protection along the Hutt River.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reported last month that the 12-kilometre pipe has been at risk from a slip at Taita Rock for years.</p>
        
            <p>The pipe will be discussed at Hutt City Council's Audit and Risk Subcommittee which will be held at 2pm today.</p>
