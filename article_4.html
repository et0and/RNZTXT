            <p>A woman who won tickets to see Taylor Swift in London after entering a Wellington primary school raffle has a new problem: who to take with her.</p>
        
            <p>Clyde Quay School raised an astonsihing $112,500 to fix their hall by raffling off two Taylor Swift tickets, including airfares to London, seven night's accommodation and spending money.</p>
        
            <p>The winner, Sarah Mcllroy, was announced on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Mcllory told Midday Report she was a big fan of Swift and the win came as an amazing surprise.</p>

            <p>"I never win anything. I bought this ticket because I heard it advertised as a promo... and I thought what an amazing fundraiser because I've been a parent on many PTAs trying to raise money and I thought that's just a great thing to support, so I seriously bought a ticket just to help the school and I never dreamed of winning," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just feeling incredibly fortunate."</p>
        
            <p>Mcllory said she was still deciding who to take with her.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been tricky and it's still up for negotiation at the moment, there's a short list now so we're just working on that."</p>
        
            <p>Clyde Quay School's parent-teacher association (PTA) chairperson, Phernne Tancock, said fundraising was tricky in the current economic environment and it was necessary to think outside the box.</p>
        
            <p>The school usually ran a travel raffle each year, but with Taylor Swift fever sweeping the country, the PTA joked that tickets to one of her concerts would be a more tempting prize.</p>
        
            <p>What started as a joke soon became reality when a member of the PTA managed to source two of the highly sought-after premier tickets through a concierge friend in London.</p>
        
            <p>"Once we knew we had the golden tickets of our era, we pooled our bake-sale money and the rest is history."</p>
        
            <p>Tickets sold for $25 each.</p>
        
            <p>All proceeds would go towards an upgrade of their school hall, which would have toilets and a kitchen installed.</p>
