            <p>Businesses on Auckland's Ponsonby Road are facing intermittent power cuts on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Vector Energy was investigating a fault impacting most of Ponsonby and parts of Freemans Bay, but hasn't confirmed how many customers were impacted.</p>
        
            <p>Ponsonby Road cafe Sol's Place said it lost power between 6-7am, and then again from 7.45-8.15am.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it was called to a fire at a power plinth in Mt Eden at half-past-seven, but couldn't confirm if it was related to the outage.</p>
        
            <p>- More to come</p>
