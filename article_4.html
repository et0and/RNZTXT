            <p>The Lindis Pass north of Cromwell in Otago is blocked following a serious crash.</p>
        
            <p>The pass on State Highway 8 is the main inland route between Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the crash took place about 15 kilometres from the summit of the pass on State Highway 8, and involved two vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>SH8 TARRAS TO OMARAMA (LINDIS PASS) - SERIOUS CRASH - 9:45AMDue to a serious crash, SH8 Lindis Pass is now CLOSED. Avoid the area, use an alternative route or delay your travel through the Pass this morning. ^CS pic.twitter.com/g9QPhFPuRC</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said on Facebook that the serious crash unit was likely to attend the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were advised to take an alternate route, as the road was expected to be closed for some time.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said southbound traffic could detour via SH83, SH1, SH85 and back onto SH8, with the reverse available for northbound traffic - with advice to allow up to an additional 2.5 hours for this route.</p>
