            <p>Police say a man's body found on Matangi Road, just outside Hamilton on Saturday afternoon, is believed to be that of missing Tauranga man Jarrad Ormsby.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said although formal identification was still continuing, police believe the body to be that of the 45-year-old, who was reported missing on 19 December.</p>
        
            <p>Ormsby was last seen in Hamilton where he recently lived.</p>
        
            <p>Matangi Rd and some surrounding roads near Morrinsville Rd were closed and diversions were in place last Saturday.</p>
