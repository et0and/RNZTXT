            <p>Public trust in police has risen slightly year on year, according to the latest Ministry of Justice Crime and Victims Survey.</p>
        
            <p>The annual survey gathered responses from 7705 New Zealanders about their perceptions, experiences, and views on police.</p>
        
            <p>Public trust and confidence in police rose from 67 percent to 69 percent between October 2023 and October 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Deputy Commissioner Mike Pannett said building and maintaining high trust and confidence within communities was a priority for police, and it was encouraging to see the numbers trending in the right direction.</p>
        
            <p>"These numbers are the direct result of the hard work our staff put in everyday when dealing with victims of crime," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"While these results are encouraging, we know there is more work to do," said Pannett.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to see these numbers continue to increase as we want to have the trust and confidence of all New Zealanders."</p>
