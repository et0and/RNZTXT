If you felt a big earthquake and a tsunami siren didn't sound, what would happen to you?

            <p>If a tsunami were to happen right now, would you know what to do? And if you felt a big earthquake and a tsunami siren didn't sound, what would happen to you?</p>
        
            <p>Wellington does not have an active siren system. A local-source tsunami could arrive in as little as 10 minutes, and Wellington Region Emergency Management Office spokesperson Ren√©e Corlett says a long or strong earthquake would be the only warning.</p>
        
            <p>"It is really vital that people know the warning signs of a tsunami, and even more important that they know what actions to take," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many people were saved in the Japanese 2011 earthquake because they knew what to do, and they were able to take action, and that's what I want here for my community as well."</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington Region Emergency Management Office, the National Emergency Management Agency, GNS Science and the Tsunami Working Group had all agreed that tsunami sirens were inappropriate as a warning system.</p>
        
            <p>"There are a few reasons why we don't have sirens, and a lot of it comes from international research, and, unfortunately, really hard, hard learn lessons from overseas, like Japan," Corlett said.</p>
        
            <p>International research - especially from Japan - showed that having sirens created a false sense of comfort.</p>
        
            <p>"What we don't want is people to be waiting for a siren that never comes," Corlett said.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council senior hazards analyst Dr Iain Dawe said there were a lot of misconceptions around tsunami.</p>
        
            <p>"A number of people think that it is just one wave, and there have been people who have, unfortunately, been hurt or lost their lives by going back into a tsunami zone after the big wave has come through when there are still more waves to come," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact, the first wave often isn't even the biggest, it can be the third or fourth wave, and that might be two or three or four hours after the first wave has come on shore."</p>
        
            <p>National Emergency Management Agency chief science advisor Tom Wilson said there was also a misconception that there would be someone that would come and help you evacuate if a tsunami was to happen.</p>
        
            <p>"If an event does strike, it is unlikely we will have lots of emergency services or civil defence emergency management staff around, so you have really got to be able to try and look after yourself," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have seen that from lots of recent disasters, but that will be particularly important with a tsunami event where there may be very, very little time to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>"So it is important to know what to do know, know your zone, know what the warning signs are, and to be able to evacuate out safely."</p>
