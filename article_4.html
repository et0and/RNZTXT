            <p>Police have charged another man linked to a secretive sect with historical sex crimes against multiple victims who were young boys at the time.</p>
        
            <p>An 80-year-old man appeared in WhangƒÅrei District Court on Thursday facing a raft of charges, including sodomy and bestiality, spanning almost two decades.</p>
        
            <p>He pleaded not guilty and has interim name suppression until his next court appearance in February.</p>
        
            <p>The four complainants were aged between 12 and 15 at the time of the alleged offending, in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>The man is charged with 12 counts of indecent assault on a boy aged between 12-16, two indecent acts on a boy aged between 12-16, one charge of sodomy on a person under 16 and one charge of bestiality.</p>
        
            <p>He was part of a religious group known as the Two by Twos or The Truth, which is under investigation by the FBI for historical child sexual abuse.</p>
        
            <p>Former members warn it is a highly controlling and insular group, with many unwritten rules.</p>
        
            <p>The Christian sect has about 2500 members and 60 ministers in New Zealand, is not registered as a charity and has no official name or church buildings.</p>
        
            <p>A hallmark of the group is that its itinerant ministers travel in pairs and stay in members' homes.</p>
        
            <p>The arrest follows the conviction of Kerikeri man Bill Easton, who pleaded guilty to sexual offending against boys that spanned three decades when he was part of the sect.</p>
        
            <p>Easton was a former minister of the sect. He is due to be sentenced on 6 December.</p>
