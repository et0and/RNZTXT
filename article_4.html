            <p>Residents of a new Salvation Army social housing complex in Hamilton say they are grateful to live there.</p>
        
            <p>The 21 new houses - together with a green space and playground, community room and outdoor basketball court - were officially opened on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>But some residents have been living in the houses since July.</p>
        
            <p>Mum-of-four Rochelle Herbert said her brand new home was amazing and her children were happy there.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old's previous home in Ngāruawāhaia was cold and damp.</p>
        
            <p>"But I was still grateful for that because it was a roof over our head, but coming home... to a brand new home, I love it."</p>
        
            <p>Her message to those still in need: "There's a lot of struggle out there finding a home... but don't give up looking."</p>

            <p>The complex was funded by a $7 million donation from the late Charles Hoy, who the community centre was named after.</p>
        
            <p>Hoy's legacy and the Salvation Army's resolve made the complex possible together with support from the government, Hamilton City Council and KiwiSaver funds.</p>
        
            <p>The 31 new buildings add to an existing social housing site of 54 homes and is situated next to a daycare centre and up the road from a supermarket.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident Sophia Frost, who has a young daughter, said she and her husband relocated from transitional housing and she felt blessed to live at the complex.</p>
        
            <p>Frost - who sings in her church choir - said they moved from Samoa last year and now had a proper home.</p>
        
            <p>In June this year there was 1458 applicants on the Housing Register in Hamilton alone, the third highest district in need across the country.</p>
        
            <p>A further 261 applicants were registered as needing housing in the Waikato District.</p>

            <p>Salvation Army colonel Gerry Walker told about 80 people gathered at the complex in Grandview Road the houses were designed with families in mind.</p>
        
            <p>"As you walk around you can get a sense of what this place is and what community has been created.</p>
        
            <p>"We have major problems in this country and the Salvation Army is committed to doing our part, and this is one of a significant number of developments that we have right across the motu."</p>
        
            <p>The houses were described by Associate Minister for Housing Tama Potaka as a whānau space.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka helped plant a tree at the site before visitors took a tour of one of the homes.</p>
        
            <p>Property manager Anya Bourne said the Salvation Army met with more than 80 families vying for the 21 units.</p>
        
            <p>Whānau were matched to homes depending on their size and Bourne said the complex was not at capacity, to allow families to grow while remaining in their homes long-term.</p>

            <p>Salvation Army territorial director of social housing and property Greg Foster said about $17m was borrowed to build the complex and he acknowledged investors.</p>
        
            <p>Foster brought his mother Carole and brother - former All Blacks coach - Ian Foster to the opening.</p>
        
            <p>"Whenever I go through a home or whenever I'm building a home, I walk through and think is this a place where I'd be proud to have my mother live."</p>
        
            <p>Foster said altogether the Salvation Army had borrowed $100m to build housing complexes like the one in Hamilton, across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"And we do that because we believe that a home is the foundation for life."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton City Councillor Sarah Thomson - speaking on behalf of mayor Paula Southgate who could not attend - said having a warm, safe, secure home was an "absolutely critical foundation to doing well in every other part of life".</p>
        
            <p>"When I walked onto the site I was struck by the absolute sense of community that has been created here... the feeling of being able to just relax and enjoy a communal space together."</p>
        
            <p>The council supported the project through development contribution remissions.</p>

            <p>Resident representative Raymond Bishop called the houses amazing but said the community centre was equally important and was being used in positive ways.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the neat things since starting here is we've started to use the space that is here, our hall, to be able to include activities like learning Te Reo Māori."</p>
        
            <p>Salvation Army national housing operations manager Fiona Matthews gave context to Hoy's life saying he was born into hardship and homelessness in England in 1925.</p>
        
            <p>"Having lost his mother at birth, he was placed into a boys' institution."</p>
        
            <p>Hoy was collected by an uncle when he was eight and taken to live on a farm in Cornwall.</p>
        
            <p>After a stint in the Merchant Navy as cook during the second world war, Hoy moved to New Zealand and made Hamilton his home where he farmed and forged lifelong friendships.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a quiet humble gentleman with a strong sense of wisdom and community and he knew what it took to be part of one."</p>
        
            <p>Matthews said Hoy's good humour and kind generosity was his lasting legacy.</p>
        
            <p>He often said: "You cry alone and laugh together".</p>
