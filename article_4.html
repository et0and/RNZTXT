            <p>The fatty, smelly substance found on a beach south of Napier that made two dogs sick was a waste byproduct from animal or food processing, and also contained hydrocarbon.</p>
        
            <p>The substance was found on Haumoana Beach on 1 December.</p>
        
            <p>A local said her dogs "went straight for it" and then started vomiting.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council sent samples away for analysis and the results had been returned, policy and regulation manager Katrina Brunton said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with Hastings District Council to identify the source of the contamination.</p>
        
            <p>"Since the initial incident and the days following there has been no further contamination wash up on the beach."</p>
        
            <p>The area is safe to swim, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council has been approached for comment.</p>
