            <p>Several gang members have been charged after a post on social media showed them wearing banned insignia.</p>
        
            <p>A half dozen King Cobra gang members aged between 28 and 58 have been charged with the prohibited display of a gang patch, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The charges came after a social media post showed King Cobra members standing outside the Auckland High Court wearing gear with gang insignias.</p>
        
            <p>"The public display of gang patches or insignia is now illegal under new legislation, and we continue to remind gang members around consequences of choosing to breach these rules," Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Under the new law, people caught displaying gang insignia in public are liable for a $5000 fine or up to six months imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>Search warrants executed at several properties in Auckland and Waikato also uncovered drugs and firearms which resulted in further charges.</p>
