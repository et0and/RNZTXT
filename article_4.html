            <p>A Rimutaka Prison detector dog found drugs hidden in shoes.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, detector dog Bart stopped cocaine and methamphetamine from entering the Upper Hutt prison.</p>
        
            <p>Bart gave a very strong indication on a box of trainers during a routine search of incoming property.</p>

            <p>At first, handler John Thorne did not find anything of concern.</p>
        
            <p>"Bart was adamant that he was right, so I knew I needed to keep searching," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I ripped open that cavity and found a bag of white powder. I then felt the padding on the other side of the shoe and I felt a similar inconsistency. I checked the other shoe and it was the same on both sides."</p>
        
            <p>The incident was immediately reported to police and the substances were collected to be tested.</p>
        
            <p>Police later confirmed it was approximately 22.5 grams of cocaine split between four large bags and 2.5 grams of methamphetamine in two small bags.</p>
        
            <p>"I trusted my dog and so I couldn't accept that there was nothing there," Thorne said.</p>
        
            <p>"Let this be a clear message to anyone attempting to bring in or send any contraband to our sites - you will be caught.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no place for drugs in prison. They create a more dangerous working environment for our staff, and prevent prisoners from engaging in rehabilitation, education and employment opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Corrections said a range of methods were used at prisons across New Zealand to prevent drugs, weapons, cellphones and other prohibited items from entering.</p>
        
            <p>They include 22 operational detector dog handlers operating 26 dogs across the country, x-ray technology, telephone monitoring of prisoners' calls and single points of entry to sites.</p>
