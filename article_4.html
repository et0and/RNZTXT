            <p>The start of a High Court trial of the man charged with murdering Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao has been delayed this morning due to translation issues.</p>
        
            <p>53-year-old Tingjun Cao, a Chinese national, was charged with the murder of Yanfei Bao on 19 July 2023, the day she went missing.</p>
        
            <p>He had pleaded not guilty.</p>
        
            <p>Bao went missing in July last year and her body was found in farmland near Christchurch just over a year later.</p>
        
            <p>Tingjun Cao does not speak English, and a Mandarin translator was assisting him during the trial.</p>
        
            <p>The trial was due to get underway at 10am Tuesday, with the first witnesses due to speak to the court.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Lisa Preston said that the logistics of translating and relaying yesterday's opening addresses, and the Judge's opening remarks, had not yet been able to be completed.</p>
        
            <p>She said the trial would restart at 12pm.</p>
