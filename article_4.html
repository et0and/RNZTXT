            <p>Children will be learning more about grammar and less about pictures and video under the new primary school English curriculum.</p>
        
            <p>A draft version of the curriculum for children in Years 0-6 was published on Monday. Educators told RNZ it gave teachers a lot more guidance about what they should teach and how.</p>
        
            <p>The draft recommended seven to 10 minutes a day of handwriting for the youngest children, explicit teaching of punctuation for older children, and reading a wide variety of texts, including poetry and children's literature.</p>
        
            <p>South Canterbury teacher Barb Curran, who is also a primary school representative on the the Educational Institute executive, said the draft was a lot bigger than the curriculum it was replacing.</p>
        
            <p>Curran said she agreed with some aspects of the draft.</p>
        
            <p>"I was really pleased to see the focus on oral language because we know how important that is for literacy and learning and there's a big focus on that."</p>
        
            <p>The curriculum was also much more explicit about what teachers should teach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly provided clarity and specificity about what is to be taught and I think that will be of use to schools," Curran said.</p>
        
            <p>A key change was a focus on structured literacy for teaching young children to read and write, an approach that emphasised decoding the sounds associated with different letters.</p>
        
            <p>Curran said her school, like many others, was several years into adopting that approach.</p>
        
            <p>"So in terms of the focus on letter-sounds, on spelling patterns, on decoding and encoding, all those things are things that we've been doing. Having said that, I don't think that you needed to have been doing a structured approach to be teaching those things," she said.</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland school of curriculum and pedagogy associate professor Aaron Wilson said the draft dropped visual language completely and there was a big focus on what teachers should teach and how.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite specific about some teaching actions both in terms of content and approaches and I think many teachers will find that level of specificity quite helpful. I think that some teachers might find it on the other hand disempowering," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wilson said overall, the curriculum was less of an English curriculum and more of a literacy curriculum, meaning it required more explicit teaching of aspects of reading and writing.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a greater focus on correctness then there has been in the past. Like correctness of spelling and grammar so it's a big focus on accurate spelling and grammar."</p>
        
            <p>Principals Federation president Leanne Otene said the shift to more explicit guidance for teachers was something the previous government had been working on too, so schools were ready for that.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously what we have got though is a change in approach, so we're now looking at a structured literacy approach versus and a whole language approach... That's a significant difference," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Otene said the entire workforce would need a lot of training to ensure the change was successful.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the draft English curriculum closes on 20 September.</p>
