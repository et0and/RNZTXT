            <p>Southland's regional council is investigating reports of an algal bloom in Doubtful Sound and whether it's connected to local fish deaths.</p>
        
            <p>The algal bloom was reported in Crooked Arm and commercial operators in Doubtful Sound reported an unusual number of jack mackerel deaths in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Samples are being analysed to check whether the jack mackerel deaths are connected to the algal bloom.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Southland aquatic ecosystems team leader Ash Rabel said algal bloom was not uncommon, but it was concerning as they could damage ecosystems and be harmful if touched or consumed.</p>
        
            <p>"We're urging water enthusiasts visiting Doubtful Sound to be vigilant about contact with the algal bloom, and to keep their equipment clean to avoid any spread of harmful species," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Shellfish should be avoided until it is clear what is causing the bloom and any fish collected should be thoroughly cleaned and cooked before eating.</p>
        
            <p>An update on the algae species and cause of the fish deaths was expected later next week.</p>
