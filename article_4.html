            <p>A fire at the old 'Boys Institute' in Wellington overnight is being treated as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the abandoned building on Tasman Street, Mount Cook, at 12.23am.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency shift manager Murray Dunbar said first responders initially feared the building may have been inhabited by squatters, but a later search found it empty and no injuries were reported.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the Boys Institute complex was demolished in 2008, and the front building and facade, which remained, had been "totally destroyed" by the fire, Dunbar said.</p>
        
            <p>It had since been extinguished, though firefighters remained on stand-by in case of hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>The building remained cordoned off and would be examined by police and specialist fire investigators.</p>
        
            <p>Five pumping and two aerial appliances attended the blaze, along with three support vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>There were also some concerns about the brick and concrete building's structural integrity, particularly that the roof may collapse, Dunbar said.</p>
        
            <p>The Boys' Institute began as a subsidiary of the YMCA but started to operate as a separate entity in 1892. Construction on the Tasman Street buildings began in 1914.</p>
