            <p>KiwiRail is urging West Coast locals to be extra vigilant at level crossings once the Tawhai Tunnel reopens this Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The tunnel, near Reefton, was closed in June last year after structural damage to the tunnel lining was discovered. It is scheduled to reopen on 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail regional infrastructure manager for the South Island, Gary Ikin, said rail freight services would run from Ngakawau seven days a week, as a backlog of coal is moved.</p>
        
            <p>"There are 30 public level crossings and numerous private level crossings between Ngakawau and the Tawhai tunnel, and it has been almost eight months since freight services have run in the area," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge everyone in the Buller community to be extra vigilant and cautious any time they approach a rail level crossing. Always obey signage and always take a good long look in both directions before crossing the tracks."</p>
        
            <p>Last June, the lining of the 134-year-old Tawhai Tunnel was closed after some crumbling of the tunnel lining was discovered by a digger operator during track renewal work, with a further inspection uncovering structural damage to three sections.</p>
        
            <p>Ikin said rebuilding the 370m long tunnel had been a massive undertaking.</p>

            <p>"Since then, our 70-person tunnel team has carried out the needed structural repairs and undertaken a lot of work to improve the resilience of the tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>"The tunnel team have been working in cramped, difficult conditions for months and have maintained a solid focus on safety and delivering the work quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"About 50,000 hours has gone into the repair, with much of it happening 24/7."</p>
        
            <p>Ikin said the tunnel was now much stronger and had better drainage, which would reduce the risk of problems in the future.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to again thank our customers, the council and the whole Buller community for their patience and support over the last eight months."</p>
