            <p>A jury has found both David Hawken and Rebecca Wright-Meldrum guilty of the murder of Christchurch woman Angela Blackmoore in 1995.</p>
        
            <p>The pair have been standing trial over the past four weeks at the High Court in Christchurch after pleading not guilty to the killing.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the trial which was abandoned in May after after new material came to hand that lawyers needed time to review.</p>
        
            <p>The verdict was revealed to the court on Friday after two days of deliberations.</p>
        
            <p>A pregnant Blackmoore was bludgeoned and stabbed 39 times in her Wainoni home while her two-year-old son slept in a nearby room on 17 August, 1995.</p>
        
            <p>The cold case hit a major breakthrough when a third person Jeremy Powell, confessed to Blackmoore's murder in 2019 after he was re-interviewed by police.</p>
        
            <p>He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years, a year later.</p>
        
            <p>Powell previously appeared as a Crown witness, when he told the court Hawken was instructed to carry out Blackmoore's murder with him and Wright-Meldrum offered $10,000 to aid a property deal.</p>
        
            <p>He told the jury that Hawken threatened to kill his family if he did not murder Blackmoore, and boasted about his numerous gang connections.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown argued that Powell was a "candid" and reliable witness during the trial, proposing Wright-Meldrum aided and abetted the man to murder Blackmoore.</p>
        
            <p>The jury heard that Powell was reluctant to carry out the killing, but eventually succumbed to Hawken's threats.</p>
        
            <p>"I knew he had gang connections. I believed he had done six murders up north. He was a very scary guy," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>The prosecution described their key witness as a "young man who was out of his depth" who had accepted his part in the killing.</p>
        
            <p>Powell explained that he killed Blackmoore several days later and felt panicked before, during and after her murder.</p>
        
            <p>"I remember hitting her two or three times with a bat, I remember the bat breaking," Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Powell said he hit her with a bat first because he wanted to knock her out "so that she wouldn't feel anything".</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't want to hurt her," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Wright-Meldum, who was a friend of the Blackmoores, was described as essential in securing access to the Wainoni property on the night of the murder.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken never paid him after the killing, Powell said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the defence argued that Powell's evidence could not be relied upon as he had shown a tendency of lying and that Powell carried out a "sadistic death on Blackmoore with his own volition and for his own pleasure".</p>
        
            <p>Hawken's defence counsel Anne Stevens KC submitted Powell lied to police, both in 1995 and again in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Stevens also argued that Powell initially claimed innocence around the presence of extreme pornography on his computer, claiming he downloaded the material "accidentally".</p>
        
            <p>Powell's interest in the board game Dungeons and Dragons and "obsession with death" was also proposed by the defence.</p>
        
            <p>Wright-Meldrum's lawyer, Philip Shamy, said that prosecutors "cherry-picked evidence" during the trial and chose to overlook forensic evidence at the crime scene, pointing to the fact only Powell's footprints were found.</p>
        
            <p>This is despite allegations that Wright-Meldrum helped clean up the scene following the killing.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken and Wright-Meldrum will be sentenced in April next year.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement police have acknowledged the guilty verdict.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have tirelessly sought to bring justice for Angela and her family since her death nearly 30 years ago," Detective Sergeant Todd Hamilton said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time I would like to acknowledge Angela's parents, Pauline and Ray, who unfortunately are no longer with us to see this result that has been achieved for Angela."</p>
        
            <p>Police also wanted to acknowledge other members of her family Jill and Leanne and her partner at the time of her death, Laurie, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton thanked all the police staff who had been involved in the investigation over the years and the small team that bought the case to trial.</p>
        
            <p>"We reiterate our sympathies to the family of Angela; the outcome today doesn't bring her back but we hope it gives her family some closure," he said.</p>
