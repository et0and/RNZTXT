        <h2>Some Marlborough roads still closed after heavy rainfall</h2>

            <p>Parts of Marlborough are still recovering from the weekend deluge that saw slips and flooding close a number of roads across the district.</p>
        
            <p>Council data showed the Awatere Valley received 127mm of rain in two and a half days - more than one and a half times its average October rainfall of 76mm.</p>
        
            <p>The northerly weather system brought significant rain across Marlborough, from the Tunakino and Richmond Range to The Branch area about 75km west of Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>A southerly front moving up the country then trapped the rain system over inland and southern parts of Marlborough, and the Awatere and Molesworth Station received significant amounts of rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>Rivers and drainage engineering manager Andy White said the flood protection network did not experience any issues and functioned well.</p>
        
            <p>The lower Wairau River peaked at 3500 cumecs just after midnight on Sunday morning and Peninsula Road in Spring Creek where two stopbanks have been deemed at "catastrophic risk of failure" due to previous heavy rain and seismic activity.</p>
        
            <p>No precautionary evacuation was required and the recent river bank work completed over winter had proved beneficial, White said.</p>
        
            <p>The Taylor River through Blenheim would remain high for several days with sections of berm and footpath within the floodway reserve to remain under water for some time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A full assessment of damage to the flood protection network would be conducted by Council's rivers and drainage engineering team once the flows have reduced later this week.</p>

            <p>A large number of local roads and state highways were affected by flooding or minor slips closed on Saturday, but almost all were able to reopen on Sunday and Monday</p>
        
            <p>The Awatere Valley Road remains closed, around 4km up the valley from Limestone, with crews working to reopen it.</p>
        
            <p>Jones Road in Grovetown is also closed approximately 1km before the Morgans Road intersection.</p>

            <p>The Seddon Transfer Station reopened this afternoon - after repairs to the accessway were completed.</p>
        
            <p>Caution is advised on Port Underwood Road near Whatamango Bay when travelling from Picton and on Archers Road, Tennyson Inlet near Tuna Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Wakamarina Road and Northbank Road are down to one lane in places and road users are advised to travel with caution. The Taylors Pass Road ford is 4WD only</p>
        
            <p>Motorists are also urged to take care on Tapps Road in Canvastown, Top Valley Road and Onamalutu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Council managed mountain bike tracks across Marlborough will remain closed to allow them to dry out this week.</p>
