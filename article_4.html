            <p>Two men have been arrested after an increase in thefts of garden pots and ornaments in the Palmerston North suburbs of Kelvin Grove and Cloverlea.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Hotpot saw multiple search warrants executed on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The men, aged 38 and 40, have been charged with two and 16 charges of burglary respectively.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we can overlook the value of items we have on display in our gardens, but more importantly the sentimental value that can be associated with them," Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Thompson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was clear that many of the people who had these items stolen had been deeply affected.</p>
        
            <p>"It is pleasing that we can bring this result to them."</p>
        
            <p>Police were wanting to reunite the stolen items with their owners.</p>
        
            <p>The men were due to appear in the Palmerston North District Court Tuesday.</p>
