            <p>A third man has been charged over the homicide of South Canterbury man Anaru Moana, who has not been seen since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Moana was reported missing on 23 December, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In 2022, two men were charged with Moana's murder, and they are expected to go on trial later this year.</p>
        
            <p>A 25-year-old man was arrested in Waimate on Thursday and charged with Moana's murder.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Nik Leigh said while police have not found Moana, it was pleasing to have put people before the courts in relation to his death.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation is ongoing, and we know there are people in our community that know what happened to Anaru," Leigh said. "We are asking those people - please, it's time to come forward. Help us provide his whƒÅnau with some closure."</p>
        
            <p>The investigation and search for Moana has involved detailed searches of waterways in the Waitaki and Waimate areas, with the assistance of the police National Dive Squad.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to murder charges, the two previously accused men were also charged with the serious assault and kidnapping of an Oamaru man last October.</p>
        
            <p>One of the men was also accused of possessing methamphetamine for supply.</p>
        
            <p>The pair entered not guilty pleas to all charges when they appeared in the Timaru High Court in December 2022.</p>
