            <p>Environment Canterbury chairperson Peter Scott has resigned.</p>
        
            <p>His departure as regional council chair follows revelations his council-provided car exceeded the speed limit 678 times since January, with a top speed of 157km/h.</p>
        
            <p>A speeding report from his council-provided car showed it exceeded the posted speed limit by 50km/h on five occasions, including travelling at 105km/h through a 50km/h zone on 10 May.</p>
        
            <p>The council's policy indicated anything in excess of 15km/h above the speed limit was considered excessive and the report showed there were 326 instances in which Scott's car travelled at excessive speeds this year.</p>
        
            <p>The council said there was no code of conduct or disciplinary procedure underway, and no further action was needed from the chief executive.</p>
        
            <p>The Toyota Highlander had now been returned to Environment Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>In July, Scott also received a formal warning following an independent investigation into his own claims he was "operating illegally" on his South Canterbury farm.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Stefanie Rixecker ordered the investigation in May after Scott revealed in a NewstalkZB interview he was not operating with formal resource consents because of processing delays.</p>
        
            <p>"Following recent publicity about my personal behaviour it has become increasingly apparent that the focus on me is a distraction from the work of the Canterbury Regional Council," Scott said, in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Although this publicity has not been directly related to my work as Chairman, I recognise the damage it is doing to this organisation, and I have decided to step down as chair, effective tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"I acknowledge I've made mistakes from a personal perspective, and these are for me to learn from. By stepping down as chair, I expect the focus to shift from me to the work we need to deliver for the environment and the people of Waitaha."</p>
        
            <p>Scott said he was proud to have led the council through "important and challenging work" since 2022's local elections.</p>
        
            <p>He would remain on the council in his role as councillor for South Canterbury-ÅŒtuhituhi.</p>
        
            <p>"I make no secret of my ambitions for the region and as chair I have advocated strongly on Canterbury's behalf - something I will continue to do.</p>
        
            <p>"As a council and an organisation we've achieved a lot but there is more work to be done."</p>
        
            <p>Deputy chair Craig Pauling would step in as acting chair until a new chair was appointed for the remainder of the term at the council's 23 October meeting.</p>
        
            <p>Commissioners were previously installed at the council at 2010 and remained in place in some form until 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Scott was first elected as a councillor in 2016 during a mixed governance period and re-elected in 2019 and 2022.</p>
