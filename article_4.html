            <p>An investigation continues into Environment Canterbury's chairperson, five weeks on from him standing down from the role.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Scott stepped aside as chairperson of the regional council on 3 May while an independent investigation was undertaken into claims he made during a radio interview.</p>
        
            <p>ECan this week had nothing further to add to the situation other than to clarify that he had "stepped down as chair, but still retains his duties and responsibilities as a councillor".</p>
        
            <p>That means he has remained at the table for the long-term plan deliberations, council, and committee meetings.</p>
        
            <p>During an interview with Newstalk ZB in April, Scott was discussing how ECan had put in new procedures to manage a backlog of consent applications and detailed how two of his consent applications for irrigation had been delayed by another government agency for six years.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was that ECan found a parcel of land on Scott's farm, which it is understood he has since sold, was potentially Crown land, but he continued to farm it.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm carrying on and ignoring the fact that I haven't got one so I'm actually operating illegally, and I'm the chairman of Environment Canterbury."</p>
        
            <p>Those remarks, the consent situation and farming activity are under investigation by an independent external reviewer that ECan said in early May would "take several weeks".</p>
        
            <p>Deputy chairperson Craig Pauling continues to be the acting chairperson.</p>
