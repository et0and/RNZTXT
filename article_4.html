            <p>The man who escaped police custody outside the Taupō District Court has a history of sleeping rough and stealing boats, say police.</p>
        
            <p>Samir Derek Belhajjam, 30, fled from a police transport vehicle at the court building on Story Place on Monday night, and is still at large.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing green prison-issue shorts and tee-shirt, as well as an orange hi-vis vest, at the time he escaped.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō area commander Inspector Phil Edwards said Belhajjam was being taken back to prison after a court appearance when he managed to evade his police escort.</p>
        
            <p>Enquiries into how this occurred were ongoing, he said, and police would be conducting a full review of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>But he said there were no concerns about staffing levels at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Police understood Belhajjam knew people in Taupō, and was possibly receiving help to avoid police.</p>
        
            <p>He said he also had a history of breaking into properties, Edwards said.</p>
        
            <p>Belhajjam is the third person to escape custody in the Waikato region in recent months - however, the other two were in the custody of Corrections officers, not police.</p>
