            <p>A woman's death discovered in Northland is being treated as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>Police said her body was found in the Kaipara District between Omamari and Aranga beaches Friday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Her vehicle was later found at Omamari Beach.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant John Clayton said the woman was reported missing earlier that day after failing to return home on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>The scene and her vehicle have been cordoned off as forensic examinations take place.</p>
        
            <p>A post mortem is due to take place in Auckland today.</p>
        
            <p>Clayton is asking anyone who saw a woman wearing a green puffer jacket north of Omamari Beach between 8pm on Thursday, 1 August and 10am the next day to contact the police, or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
