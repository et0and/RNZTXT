            <p>A 10-year-old boy who took himself on a 27km "adventure" almost sparked a search and rescue mission on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>The boy, who lives in Charleston with his family, was last seen about 10am yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Senior constable Sarah Cook said the boy had gone to visit neighbours, and then decided to take himself for a walk.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified in the evening, after family and locals tried their best to find the boy during the day.</p>
        
            <p>Cook said police search and rescue was notified, and Land Search and Rescue teams from Westport, Reefton, Grey, and a dog team from Hokitika, were activated.</p>
        
            <p>Just as teams were preparing to gather, the boy arrived home safe and well.</p>
        
            <p>Cook said the boy had gone on an "adventure", walking a trail inland from Charleston, before being found by a local who dropped him off near home.</p>
        
            <p>The boy was understood to be wearing only a singlet and fleece pants so, as it got darker and colder, police became concerned about him, Cook said.</p>
        
            <p>She reminded people to always call police promptly for advice if someone was suspected as missing.</p>
