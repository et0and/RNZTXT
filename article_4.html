            <p>Police say a man who died on the Southwestern motorway on Friday morning was struck by three vehicles, none of which stopped.</p>
        
            <p>The man died on a section of State Highway 20, near Mt Roskill, after walking onto the motorway from the northbound on-ramp at Dominion Rd around 1:30am.</p>
        
            <p>He was struck by at least three vehicles, Detective Senior Sergeant Kathy Bostock said.</p>
        
            <p>"None of the vehicles stopped at the time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are asking these motorists to contact us, as they are an important part of us establishing the circumstances of this tragic event."</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was carried out in the early hours of Friday morning and road closures have since been lifted.</p>
        
            <p>Police are now seeking anyone travelling on State Highway 20 between 1:30am and 2am to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"An investigation is now underway and it's important those motorists do the right thing and come forward," Bostock said.</p>
        
            <p>Police would also like to hear from anyone who has dashcam footage.</p>
        
            <p>A second person was killed in a separate incident on Friday morning, a single-vehicle crash near Ōtara.</p>
        
            <p>One person died at the scene, while two others were transported to Auckland Hospital in a critical condition and two more transported to Middlemore Hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>The crash happened on the road ahead of Te Irirangi Drive just after 2am.</p>
        
            <p>Seven ambulances and three rapid response units were called to the crash, along with two firetrucks and two rescue appliances.</p>
        
            <p>Another two passengers were in the vehicle at the time of the crash, according to a FENZ spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>Friday morning's crashes are just the latest in what's been a dangerous week on the Auckland roads for pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>A man was killed on Wednesday afternoon after being hit by a truck in the central suburb of Parnell.</p>
        
            <p>St John responded just after 2pm and sent two ambulances and a rapid response vehicle to the scene on The Strand.</p>
        
            <p>The man was taken to hospital in a critical condition but later died.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a cyclist was left with life threatening injuries after crashing into a stationary vehicle on Chivalry Road in Glenfield on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>AA road safety spokesperson Dylan Thomsen said crashes happening in quick succession were a reminder of how dangerous the roads could be.</p>
        
            <p>"One moment of things going wrong, one moment of somebody making a mistake, can have enormous consequences," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to approach being out on the roads with a lot more care and focus than we often do in New Zealand sadly."</p>
        
            <p>Thomsen said drivers needed to be hyper alert and watchful on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"Drivers need to be looking out for pedestrians, for cyclists, for other vehicles that are around them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There is huge responsibility for every driver, when we're out on the roads, to be looking and aware of anybody that is around their vehicle."</p>
        
            <p>He said crash statistics over recent years have shown the summer months to have the highest risk on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"People often think of winter of being the time that actually there's more risk, but no, it's summer, when we tend to see a higher number of crashes.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of that is because there's just a lot more people and traffic out on the roads at these times."</p>
