            <p>The board of ACC has commissioned an independent review into the agency's workplace culture.</p>
        
            <p>It follows investigations by Stuff, which revealed concerns over the behaviour of two deputy chief executives, who were eventually stood down.</p>
        
            <p>ACC board chair Dr Tracey Batten said the board was committed to ensuring ACC had a workplace culture that felt safe and inclusive, where people felt supported to speak up.</p>
        
            <p>"An important role of any board is to ensure an organisation is fostering an inclusive and values-based culture where employees role model the right behaviours," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The terms of reference, published on ACC's website, said the review would consider ACC's workplace culture, the experiences of its employees, as well as existing policies, systems, and procedures related to inappropriate conduct and behaviour, as well as whether ACC had appropriate measures in place deal with inappropriate conduct and behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>It would also consider whether ACC's recruitment and appointment processes and systems represented good practice and appropriately identified any issues related to conduct and behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>It will not be investigating any individual past or current complaints, and will not make any findings or make any comment on the conduct, performance, or competence of any individual who is a complainant or the subject of a complaint.</p>
        
            <p>All employees who wanted to participate would be able to, through a confidential process.</p>
        
            <p>Director at RDC Group Doug Craig, and Pip Muir, chair and partner at law firm Simpson Grierson, will conduct the review.</p>
        
            <p>They will begin their work next week.</p>
        
            <p>The review has the backing of ACC Minister Scott Simpson, who said he was concerned about the reports regarding ACC's workplace culture and conduct</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased the ACC board are taking the matter seriously and have commissioned an independent review. They have assured me it will be a rigorous process," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The findings and recommendations will be presented to the board in by 2 June, before they are made public.</p>
