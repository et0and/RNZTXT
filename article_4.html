            <p>A highly trusted assistant manager who stole $88,000 worth of cash and cigarettes from an Invercargill bar has avoided prison and will not have to repay what she took.</p>
        
            <p>Sandra Maree Waddick, 58, was sentenced to 12 months' home detention in the Invercargill District Court this morning after she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft in a special relationship.</p>
        
            <p>The defendant had worked at the Northern Tavern for more than 20 years, and was in charge of weekly stock takes.</p>
        
            <p>In June last year, the Invercargill Licensing Trust (ILT) investigated discrepancies in the cigarette stock levels at Waddick's workplace.</p>
        
            <p>When the defendant was questioned about these inconsistencies, she admitted she had been falsifying the figures for almost 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>Following this revelation, Waddick was fired and the trust audited other areas of the Northern Tavern.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation found that since May 2019, TAB betting books had not been banked.</p>
        
            <p>It was part of the defendant's duties to deposit this income, which amounted to $40,251.</p>
        
            <p>Waddick explained to police that her offending gradually got worse.</p>
        
            <p>She said it started when she would take a packet of cigarettes and pay for them on pay day.</p>
        
            <p>That escalated to stealing two or three packets a week and ultimately she took $48,637 worth of cigarettes since 2014.</p>
        
            <p>She told police she intended to pay for what she had taken but had "dug herself into a hole and she was unsure how to rectify it", the summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>Waddick said she felt "the trust owed her" as she had worked overtime with no extra pay.</p>
        
            <p>She confessed she would spend the cash she stole from the TAB book proceeds to gamble on the pokies.</p>
        
            <p>Counsel Keith Owen questioned why the ILT was not doing regular audits.</p>
        
            <p>"This offending could've been stopped in its tracks," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Duncan Harvey said that highlighted how much trust the company had placed in Waddick.</p>
        
            <p>"It is likely that there was no audit because that is how much you were trusted," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Owen said his client was cooperative and honest with the police and had taken responsibility for the offending.</p>
        
            <p>The ILT told the court it wanted to see "strong sentencing" and reparation of $88,000 was sought.</p>
        
            <p>The judge said home detention was not a soft sentence, but reparation would be an empty order.</p>
        
            <p>"You have nothing. You are not employed and it may well be very difficult for you to find future employment," he told the defendant.</p>
        
            <p>"With a great deal of reluctance, I have to say to the victim that reparation is not a viable option and no such order is made."</p>
