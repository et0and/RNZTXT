            <p>Demolition in Te Ngākau Civic Square in central Wellington will close Wakefield Street to traffic for more than three months, as one of its key buildings is removed.</p>
        
            <p>The Wellington City Council said the demolition of the six-storey, quake-prone Civic administration building would begin on 24 June, closing Wakefield Street to traffic between Victoria Street and Cuba Street until September, to accommodate a large crane.</p>
        
            <p>From September, one lane will reopen to vehicles heading west toward Victoria Street.</p>
        
            <p>Demolition should be completed in December, with the road completely reopened to vehicles in early January.</p>
        
            <p>The Victoria Street pedestrian entrance to Te Ngākau Civic Square would be closed from 20 June until December at the earliest, or February 2025 at the latest.</p>
        
            <p>There would, however,be continuous pedestrian access to the square through the other entrances at Harris Street and the City to Sea Bridge for the entire period.</p>
        
            <p>The Royal New Zealand Ballet temporary building in the Michael Fowler Centre car park will also be dismantled and stored while the council investigated alternative uses for it.</p>
        
            <p>Deconstruction would begin on 24 June and was expected to finish in October, with minimal disruption to local businesses and residents.</p>
        
            <p>The temporary building was built in 2019 to house the ballet company during the earthquake strengthening and restoration of the St James Theatre. It moved back into the St James when it re-opened in 2022, and the temporary building had not been in use since.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, City Gallery Wellington Te Whare Toi is scheduled to receive an earthquake-prone building notice, with remedial maintenance, including earthquake strengthening, starting in February 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Due to the disruption caused by the works around Te Ngākau, particularly the demolition of the Civic administration building which would limit access to the gallery, Experience Wellington has decided to relocate City Gallery Wellington from 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>It will continue to bring art to new spaces around Wellington, including upcoming exhibitions at Te Papa and the Dowse Art Museum, until the gallery returns home in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>The council will take the opportunity to undertake maintenance and strengthening work throughout 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Work continues on quake-strengthening and upgrading of Te Matapihi Central Library and the Town Hall.</p>
