            <p>Police have executed a search warrant and seized items at a gang-affiliated Hutt Valley address after a man was shot dead at a birthday party at his home last month.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the George Street, Stokes Valley property shortly after 2am on 16 December and found two men with firearm-related injuries, they said.</p>
        
            <p>Rawiri Zane Wharerau, 39, died of his injuries. His brother was also found at the scene, and had also suffered serious gunshot injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they executed a search warrant in Stokes Valley at 10am Friday in relation to the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"We are making excellent progress with our investigation. I want to thank the community for all the information they have provided to date," Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Sears, District Investigation Support from Wellington CIB, said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"This vital information has led us to execute a search warrant this morning at an address linked to members of the Mangu Kaha gang.</p>
        
            <p>"While no arrests have yet been made, the warrant and seized items have advanced our investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"What is clear from the community's response to date is that they are sick of the behaviour of these gang members.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to work hard on behalf of the victim, his family and the wider community to prosecute those responsible."</p>
        
            <p>Police urge anyone with any information or CCTV footage from George Street, Delaney Drive, August Street and Amundsen Grove in Stokes Valley from 10pm Friday 15 December to 5am 16 December 2023 to please contact them.</p>
