            <p>Community leaders experienced a full blown adrenaline rush as the Christchurch Adventure Park reopened for the first time since the Port Hills wildfire five weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>The park was evacuated on 14 February after a large scrub fire broke out on Worsley Spur and grew to 650 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger attended the park's reopening on Friday and experienced New Zealand's longest zipline.</p>
        
            <p>"It was bloody marvellous," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was absolutely fantastic, everyone should have a go at this."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to media following his thrill-seeking exploits, Mauger said it was great the park was able to reopen so quickly after the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"We're back in business.</p>
        
            <p>"Luckily we didn't get as much damage as last time.</p>
        
            <p>"These guys have moved heaven and earth to get this up and running, especially for this weekend and Easter coming up."</p>
        
            <p>Mauger said he would be "bringing the grandkids up to the park very soon".</p>
        
            <p>Smoke could be seen near the Port Hills on Friday afternoon, prompting fire crews to rush to the area.</p>
        
            <p>
Mauger said he was thrilled the adventure park was open for business again.

            <p>It was later reported to be from controlled burn-offs in surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>Maurice Noone, chairperson of the park's owner/operator Leisure Investments NZ (Linz), said areas of the park which were utilised came through the fire unscathed.</p>
        
            <p>"It was precautionary (to close) as you need to do with the chairlift and ziplines," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The hill we're trying to get back on to for mountain biking, that's unfortunately been badly damaged.</p>
        
            <p>"But the trees are looking reasonably sound."</p>
        
            <p>Noone said schools and volunteers had been on site planting natives at the park.</p>
        
            <p>The Adventure Park will be having a band play at its cafe and a bouncy castle set up across this weekend as part of celebrations for the site's reopening.</p>
