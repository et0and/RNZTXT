            <p>Police are looking into their own policies and practice after an alleged fleeing car crashed into two vehicles in Auckland, killing one of the passengers.</p>
        
            <p>One person died and another remains in a critical condition after a driver allegedly fled from police crashed on Great South Rd in Penrose just before 2pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A 22-year-old man will appear in Manukau District Court on Friday charged with reckless driving causing death and reckless driving causing injury.</p>
        
            <p>The crash happened after a police officer saw a vehicle travelling at excess speed along Vestey Drive and signalled for it to stop.</p>
        
            <p>It failed to do so and reportedly fled.</p>
        
            <p>Moments later the vehicle crossed the centre line and crashed into two other vehicles near the intersection of Great South Rd and Sundown Lane, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger from one of the vehicles struck died at the scene and the driver of the same vehicle was transported to hospital where they remain in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the other vehicle hit sustained minor injuries and did not require medical treatment.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the speeding vehicle was taken to hospital in a critical condition, and remained there in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to acknowledge the impact that yesterday's events will have had on the community and our thoughts are with everyone involved," Detective Inspector Kevan Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are providing support to those affected and their families, as well as our staff who were impacted."</p>
        
            <p>Police will not be releasing further details about person who died until family had been notified, Verry added.</p>
        
            <p>Verry said there were now several investigations underway, including a critical incident investigation and a policy, practice, and procedure investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) had also been notified.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was completed on Sunday and the Serious Crash Unit and staff were working to establish the full circumstances surrounding the crash, Verry said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were appealing to any witnesses who may have seen the a grey Holden Commodore in the Panama Rd, Great South Rd and Vestey Drive areas between 1.30pm-2pm Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or footage is urged to contact police to assist with the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Please update police online or call 105 and use the reference number 250316/5377 or cite 'Operation Kershaw '.</p>
