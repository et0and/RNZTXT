            <p>Two former police staff and a Crown prosecutor will appear in court next month over the wrongful conviction of Alan Hall.</p>
        
            <p>Hall was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1985 for the murder of Arthur Easton but was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2022 and paid $5 million in compensation.</p>
        
            <p>Today police have charged two former staff members who were involved in the original homicide investigation along with a former prosecutor involved in the subsequent trial.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner of Investigations Paul Basham said search warrants were conducted today following "a thorough, methodical investigation led by a detective superintendent, and independent legal review".</p>
        
            <p>"We have been in contact with the Hall and Easton families through this process, and we have advised them of today's development," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge both families have been seeking answers for a wrongful conviction, and answers as to who murdered Arthur Easton."</p>
        
            <p>Police have not confirmed the charges, but allege the three men were involved in Hall's wrongful conviction.</p>
        
            <p>They will appear in the Manukau District Court on the 4 September.</p>
