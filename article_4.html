            <p>A kayaker says he owes his life to rescuers after capsizing in strong winds and being pulled out to sea in Palliser Bay off the South Wairarapa coast.</p>
        
            <p>Police received a distress call at 7.30am on Tuesday that a man was struggling and could not get back to shore.</p>
        
            <p>The kayaker had set-off from the beach south of Lake Ferry at around 6am with a phone and an emergency radio locator beacon on him.</p>
        
            <p>A strong offshore wind carried the man further out to sea than expected, capsized the boat and left him lying on top of it.</p>
        
            <p>He managed to call police and activate his emergency radio beacon which alerted the rescue team at Maritime New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>At around 8am the Police Maritime Unit left Wellington Harbour in Lady Elizabeth the Fourth to rescue the man, with a 40 minute travel time ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the Westpac helicopter had arrived at the kayak's location but gale-force winds meant it was unsafe to attempt a winch recovery.</p>
        
            <p>About 8.45am the police boat arrived at the scene and pulled the kayaker aboard to assess for injuries. He was taken closer to shore and paddled to the beach himself.</p>
        
            <p>The man expressed gratitude to all involved in the rescue, saying "I owe my life to them".</p>
        
            <p>"The bay is huge, and I didn't know where or when I was going to be washed ashore. At one stage I thought I might end-up in Ngawi, or it might be the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"The key for me was keeping calm and that was helped by the reassurance that help was on the way. I had my phone in a waterproof pouch and I got a lot of reassurance from the person on the other end of the line, who gave me updates on when the boat would arrive.</p>
        
            <p>"I encourage everyone who's going out on the water to get a locator beacon, it saved my life," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Maritime Unit said the man was well-prepared for kayaking and was dressed in a full-length wetsuit, wetsuit boots and wearing a lifejacket.</p>
        
            <p>But police warned today's incident showed how quickly the weather and environment could change for even well-prepared adventurers.</p>
