            <p>A landmark building in Wellington's Botanic Garden will be shut until the middle of next week after damage caused by high winds.</p>
        
            <p>The Begonia House, built in 1960, contains several exotic plants and is a venue used for events such as weddings.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy wind gust dislodged two glass panes from its roof on Thursday morning, when strong winds also forced the Ministry of Culture and Heritage to call off a wreath-laying service at Strathmore due to the winds.</p>
        
            <p>Winds were gusting up to 109km/h on Anzac Day around Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, where an outdoors service was also cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The Botanic Garden's floral display area is also closed for repairs and safety assessments.</p>
        
            <p>The Picnic Caf√© in the building remains open.</p>
