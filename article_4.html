            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said they were called just after 2am on Wednesday, and the house was well ablaze when crews arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Forty firefighters worked to contain the blaze, and crews remain on the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said paramedics treated four patients and took three to Christchurch Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>One person was in a serious condition and two in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters are also working to contain another house fire in Rangiora, north of Christchurch, in Waimakariri District.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ were called to the scene about 4am and found the property ablaze. The house was unoccupied at the time.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze was under control, but firefighters were still working to fully extinguish the fire, FENZ said.</p>
