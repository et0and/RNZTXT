            <p>A man has been summoned to court after a crash in Taupō today left multiple people seriously injured.</p>
        
            <p>Two vehicles crashed on the Napier-Taupō Road, State Highway 5 near Rangitaiki School Road, Taupō District, about 10.30am.</p>
        
            <p>"Our crews have assessed and treated 12 patients, with their conditions ranging from minor to serious," Hato Hone St John said.</p>
        
            <p>Nine patients were airlifted to Waikato hospital; four in a serious condition, three in a moderate condition, and two in a minor condition."</p>
        
            <p>Police said Sunday afternoon that their initial inquiries suggest that the van driver allegedly attempted to overtake a vehicle, and struck the second vehicle head on.</p>
        
            <p>The 57-year-old driver has been summonsed to appear in the Tauranga District Court next week on a charge of careless driving causing injury.</p>
        
            <p>Originally 13 people were reported injured but Hato Hone St John has said only 12 were injured.</p>
        
            <p>Four ambulances, one rapid response unit, and four helicopters were sent to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicles involved were a van and an SUV, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time, two patients in serious condition have been airlifted to Waikato hospital, and one patient in a serious condition has been airlifted to Hawke's Bay hospital."</p>
        
            <p>The road has since reopened, police said.</p>
