            <p>Thirty-six vehicles have been ordered off the road in Invercargill as police target "skid meets" around the city.</p>
        
            <p>Senior constable Paul Moylan says Operation Hoon honed in on drivers who regularly do a lap of Invercargill's CBD before going to organised skid meets in rural locations.</p>
        
            <p>The police took advantage of laws allowing for vehicles to be inspected if they were stopped within five kilometres of a VTNZ test site.</p>
        
            <p>Myolan said an extreme example of the unsafe modification of a vehicle was the use of a pair of jandals as suspension bump stops.</p>
        
            <p>Southern District Road Policing Manager Inspector Craig Brown said" "These drivers pose an unnecessary risk to everyone on the road through their behaviour and the state of their vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>"To get this many unsafe cars off the roads over just two evenings is a great success for our teams, and goes a long way in making sure we can keep the roads safer, and help other motorists feel safer too."</p>
