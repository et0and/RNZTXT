            <p>The chill is setting across the country ahead of winter, with Christchurch facing the prospect of sub-zero temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said some of the coldest temperatures overnight on Monday were in Tekapo (-3.7C), Dunedin Airport (-2.6), Christchurch (0.8) and Alexandra (-2.2).</p>
        
            <p>It said the first two weeks of May were expected to be on the cooler side due to southwest winds moving up the country.</p>
        
            <p>Even with a drier than normal rain outlook, there would also be a number of wet days, especially from mid-May.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, temperatures are expected to dip to a low of 7 degrees Celsius and 5C this week, with some showers expected up until Wednesday.</p>
