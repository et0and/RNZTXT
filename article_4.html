            <p>The baby was found uninjured on a grass verge near the corner of Queen and Cameron Street.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was also found abandoned on the corner of Henui and Mclean Streets, after being driven all over Taranaki in the weekend, about 6am on 13 May.</p>
        
            <p>An associate was taken into custody with the vehicle and enquiries are ongoing to locate the man involved.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, police made an appeal for sightings of Smith via their Manawatu, Taranaki, Whanganui-Ruapehu Facebook page.</p>
        
            <p>Stuff is reporting court documents show charges against Smith include assault with intent to facilitate flight by the taking of a motor vehicle, intent to deprive a parent of the possession of a young person by unlawfully taking the child, theft of a motor vehicle, driving while disqualified and driving with a false licence plate.</p>
        
            <p>Police have confirmed the charges relate to the incident in Waitara last Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the public interest in the case we will make a proactive statement when he is taken into custody."</p>
        
            <p>An 27-year-old associate of the alleged thief appeared in New Plymouth District Court this week, charged with unlawfully getting into a vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Police said sightings of Smith or information about his whereabouts could be reported to them via 111, quoting case number 240510/8076, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
