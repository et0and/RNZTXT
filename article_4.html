            <p>A Westland Mineral Sands barge, owned by WMS Group, has run aground near Westport during a thunderstorm overnight.</p>
        
            <p>WMS Group chief of corporate affairs Kate Lynch confirmed the barge Manahau came ashore on Carters Beach on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>She said all 11 crew on board were safe and there were no environmental concerns.</p>
        
            <p>"Westland Mineral Sands is working closely with relevant maritime and coast guard authorities to understand how this incident occurred."</p>
        
            <p>Buller District Mayor Jamie Cleine said the motorised barge carting mineral sands had been anchored since last Sunday, awaiting suitable weather for it to come into port.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been anchored off Westport for the best part of a week ... and obviously last night's pretty severe thunderstorms and weather - something's happened and changed for them, and it's ended up coming ashore," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He added Westland Mineral Sands would want to pull the boat back out into the water as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>That job would require a tug boat from somewhere around New Zealand, but that resource was not available anywhere near Westport, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime Union national secretary Carl Findlay said not having a tug boat nearby was concerning.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a real worry for us all. How are we going to get it off there?"</p>
        
            <p>Westport resident Kevin Smith said he became aware the Manahau had run aground about 2am after seeing photographs posted on a Facebook group. He believed it happened between midnight and 1am.</p>
        
            <p>"I went down this morning at 6.30am and just took some photographs."</p>
        
            <p>The barge was resting between the beach and the sandbar, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If it was going to ground anywhere, it was probably the best place possible. It's a big, flat beach. It's a flat-bottomed boat."</p>
        
            <p>However the barge did not appear to be firm aground, Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was evident that the stern, the rear of the ship, was afloat. So you could see it moving about."</p>
        
            <p>He said there did not appear to be any damage.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ said it was aware that the barge had grounded at Carters Beach.</p>
        
            <p>"We have received reports from the local on scene commander that the vessel is currently stable and there is no evidence of an oil spill.</p>
        
            <p>"It is understood the vessel, which is used to move iron sand, grounded at about midnight. At the time, there were 11 people on-board, we have not been informed of any safety risks."</p>

            <p>Findlay said concerns had been raised previously by New Zealand seafarers about the foreign crew and flag of the barge.</p>
        
            <p>There had been no reports of injuries, which Findlay said was fortunate, as the West Coast was a notoriously treacherous maritime environment.</p>
        
            <p>The 97.53-metre and 3706-GT self-powered barge Manahau had only just come into service in August, carrying mineral sands out of shallow draught port Westport to Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>The Manahau did not have a New Zealand crew and the flag state was Niue, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"Vessels such as the Manahau operating in New Zealand's unique and challenging maritime environment should be crewed by experienced New Zealand seafarers."</p>
        
            <p>It had been extremely disappointing to see substantial government funding go towards a vessel operating in our waters that was neither New Zealand flagged nor crewed, Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>"In the last several years, we saw an upsurge in New Zealand-crewed coastal shipping, but this is now going backwards with the loss of coastal shipping services, or in this case, failing to provide jobs for skilled local crews.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand needs to build its coastal shipping capacity, and that means New Zealand-owned, operated and crewed ships.</p>
        
            <p>"We're an island nation, so we've got highly skilled seafarers. We should be locally looking after our coast, because no one knows it better than us."</p>
