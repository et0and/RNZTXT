            <p>State Highway 20 remains closed in Onehunga due to a fallen tree and large slip.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency said a tree fell onto the Southwestern Motorway in Onehunga about 1.30am.</p>
        
            <p>It closed the highway between the Neilson Street off-ramp and Hillsborough Road on-ramp.</p>
        
            <p>At 7.30am emergency services were called to a crash at the fallen tree.</p>
        
            <p>The crash was cleared by 8am, but NZTA said the highway remained closed as crews removed the tree.</p>
        
            <p>A witness told RNZ northbound traffic was blocked up from Onehunga, over the Māngere bridge as far as Māngere, with traffic at a "complete standstill across all lanes".</p>
        
            <p>NZTA advised drivers to detour via the Neilson St off-ramp, Onehunga Harbour Rd, Onehunga Mall Rd, Princes St, Beachcroft Ave, Queenstown Rd, Herd Rd, Hillsborough Rd and back onto SH20 Hillsborough on-ramp, and allow extra time for their journey.</p>
