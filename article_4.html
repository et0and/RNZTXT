        <h2>Warning of increased fire risk to parts of Otago</h2>

            <p>A sharp increase to fire risk to parts of Otago in the coming days is sparking a warning from Fire and Emergency (FENZ).</p>
        
            <p>Hot, dry and windy weather is expected for inland areas on both Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the Central Otago, Queenstown Lakes and the Upper Waitaki districts are being urged to avoid activities that could generate sparks during those days.</p>
        
            <p>The warning extends to farmers, contractors and tradesmen, who are being asked not to use machinery that elevates risk, including grinders and ride-on lawnmowers and "other tools or implements with blades that can strike against stones and cause a spark".</p>
        
            <p>A prohibited fire season has already been declared for the three Otago zones, meaning outdoor fires are banned due to extreme fire danger.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ's Otago district manager Phil Marsh said any fire that does start will spread quickly and would present greater difficulties for firefighters to extinguish.</p>
        
            <p>"We are expecting very hot, dry and windy conditions on Wednesday and into Thursday, based on the weather forecast," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Marsh added that grass that appears green on top is already drying off underneath and the ground itself will be dry in most places.</p>
        
            <p>"All the indications are that we are in for a long, dry summer, and the risk of wildfire is already high.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who has turned a spade in their own garden will know exactly how dry the soil is, even after a shower of rain.</p>
        
            <p>"These are the conditions where a fire can start easily and be very hard to put out."</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said anyone who lit an outdoor fire over the last three weeks should also check that it was completely out due to the possibility of fires reigniting in strong winds.</p>
