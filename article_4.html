        <h2>Souped-up e-scooter overtakes Tesla on Auckland motorway</h2>
        <p>
Motorists on Auckland's Northwestern Motorway have been surprised to see an electric scooter weaving through traffic, but the jury is still out on whether it's illegal.

            <p>Motorists on Auckland's Northwestern Motorway have been surprised to see an electric scooter weaving through traffic, but the jury is still out on whether it's illegal.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Peter Idione captured footage of a rider on an e-scooter overtaking his Tesla at an estimated 90kph.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a shock to see the guy going past us. I was doing around 83kph."</p>
        
            <p>He said the scooter had a small profile and was poorly lit from the back. He and his wife felt that it would be easy for a motorist to miss the scooter if they were changing lanes.</p>
        
            <p>"[The rider] was passing most of the cars on the motorway, and he continued to weave through traffic before getting off at Great North Road."</p>
        
            <p>It's not the first time the rider has raised an eyebrow. After Idoine posted the footage on social media, he said a friend got in contact to say they had also seen them speeding down the Northwestern Cycleway.</p>
        
            <p>It is generally understood that mopeds or scooters should not be ridden on the motorway, because their top speed isn't fast enough to safely join fast moving traffic, but new high-powered e-scooters may sit in a legal grey area.</p>
        
            <p>
The e-scooter rider may have been breaking the 80kph speed limit on the Northwestern Motorway near St Lukes in Auckland.

            <p>A spokesperson for Waka Kotahi said any e-scooter that had a top speed of above 50kph was legally classed as a motorcycle.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, any e-scooter with a power level above a relatively small threshold of 300 watts cannot be lawfully ridden on any road unless they were licensed and registered.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorways are high speed environments and it's important that all vehicles using them are legally and appropriately registered and licensed," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Jonno Leonard of the Electric Scooter Shop in Takapuna said he recognised the scooter in the footage as being a particularly high powered model likely imported from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>He said he had previously sold a few but had stopped retailing them because he did not support "that kind of riding".</p>
        
            <p>"It is not what we feel scootering should be about, which is providing simple, cheap and effective transport."</p>
        
            <p>Leonard said riders "hooning it" down cycleways and footpaths, or even motorways, gave everyone a bad name.</p>
        
            <p>He said current legislation around e-scooters was "very woofly" and needed updating. For example, riders were not legally required to wear helmet although it was encouraged.</p>
        
            <p>Leonard wants rules that define where a scooter can be ridden and varying speed limits set for riding on the footpaths, shared paths and the road.</p>
        
            <p>He said with more apartments in Auckland and fewer parking spaces, scooters were increasingly being used for commuting.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we're even starting to see electric unicycles. These things are not going away."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport said the government was expected to be considering new regulations later this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the regulations have not kept up with technology advancements in some privately-owned electric vehicles, such as the e-scooter seen in the video."</p>
