            <p>A Stewart Island/Rakiura ratepayer on the receiving end of a 500 percent rates hike received little sympathy from the district councillors this week.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, the unnamed person made headlines after appearing in a Southland District Council report for contesting a jump in their rates from $348.68 to $1743.95 in the space of one year.</p>
        
            <p>Arguing their undeveloped section sat on a neglected section of road with no council services available, they labelled the sharp increase "drastically unfair and unjust".</p>
        
            <p>But on Wednesday, councillor Jon Spragoon - an appointee to the Stewart Island/Rakiura community board - questioned some of the ratepayer's claims about a lack of services at his Rata St property including no sewerage, power and lighting.</p>
        
            <p>"It won't get street lights in the sense that we're a dark sky sanctuary. He refers to a muddy track, well it's just a standard gravel road," Spraggon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've spoken to half the community board, and they back the council stance that no remission be given."</p>
        
            <p>The issue was escalated to elected members after the ratepayer was unsatisfied with the reason given by staff for the increase - a change of ownership in June 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The section had previously come under the umbrella of an adjacent property, meaning it had only been charged partial rates as a contiguous property.</p>
        
            <p>In its report, council staff pointed out the nature of the land would have been highlighted in a LIM report, showing what was at stake with the rating situation.</p>
        
            <p>"Had the information not been contained in the LIM, we'd probably be having a different conversation now . . . the reality of the situation was there and available for the purchaser to see," Mayor Rob Scott told those gathered.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Matt Wilson hoped the council would take opportunities to educate potential buyers, and asked if it was possible to include additional information in the online rate search tool.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it was exploring that further.</p>
        
            <p>Ultimately, councillors voted for no rates remission to be applied to the Rata Street property for the 2023/24 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>The section in question has a capital value of $50,000.</p>
        
            <p>The average rates increase for Southland district for 2023/24 was 13 percent.</p>
