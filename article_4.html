        <h2>NZQA to trial computer auto-marking for online writing exams</h2>
        <p>
Students and teachers want results as quickly as possible, and auto-marking could help speed up the process, deputy chief executive Jann Marshall says.

            <p>The Qualifications Authority is trialling computer-marking of its online NCEA writing exams.</p>
        
            <p>The organisation already used auto-marking for multi-choice online reading tests that recently became a critical part of NCEA literacy and numeracy requirements known as co-requisites.</p>
        
            <p>NZQA deputy chief executive Jann Marshall said it was now testing whether the same technology would work well for the writing tests.</p>
        
            <p>She said the literacy and numeracy tests were held twice a year and in the most recent round in September, students completed more than 152,200 assessments, which were being marked by a contracted workforce of 186 markers.</p>
        
            <p>Students and teachers wanted the results as quickly as possible, and auto-marking could help speed up the process, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said automated marking had been used for the multi-choice reading assessments since they were being piloted.</p>
        
            <p>"Following the May 2024 assessment event, this allowed us to return results for reading to students and schools several days earlier than results for other standards," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Following a small-scale trial of automated text scoring trial on writing assessment responses from the May assessment event, we are conducting a large-scale trial using 35,000 writing assessment responses from September.</p>
        
            <p>"Automated text scoring uses machine learning to recognise the characteristics of a piece of text to mark other similar responses."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said the trials allowed NZQA to compare the results from auto text scoring with scores provided by its regular markers.</p>
        
            <p>"This shows whether automated text scoring would be suitably reliable and accurate," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If the trial is successful, we plan to use automated text scoring in the writing assessments from May 2025, which will contribute to reducing the turnaround time."</p>
        
            <p>Marshall said automated text scoring would be quality assured for consistency and accuracy using NZQA's existing check-marking process, where samples of students' assessments were reviewed by experienced human markers.</p>
