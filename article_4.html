            <p>A screenshot of two of Zinger's boxes of nicotine patches, these two are called Groovy Grape and Iced Melon Mini.</p>
        
            <p>A Christchurch woman says she is horrified that her non-smoking teenage daughter was given addictive nicotine pouches as part of a social media promotion.</p>
        
            <p>The woman's 18-year-old daughter won two packets of Zyn nicotine pouches via an Instagram competition by Zinger Pouches, an online company which describes itself as based in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Zyn are flavoured nicotine pouches, which are used by putting a small pouch of the product between the upper lip and gum to be absorbed over a period of time.</p>
        
            <p>The Christchurch woman, who asked not to be named, said she was horrified at the way the product was being promoted.</p>
        
            <p>"The product is being promoted in the same way as with vapes, as a (smoking) cessation product. But it's not. It is just about making money and bringing in children. It does the same thing as vapes. It has all the nice colours and flavours".</p>
        
            <p>She said she was particularly shocked that her younger daughter who has just turned 15 also knew all about the product from social media promotions.</p>
        
            <p>The US website for Zyn Nicotine Pouches says the product is for adults over 21 who currently use nicotine.</p>
        
            <p>It says: "If you do not currently use nicotine, ZYN is not for you."</p>
        
            <p>The site that describes itself as New Zealand-based asks users to confirm they are 18 or over.</p>
        
            <p>Medsafe says Zyn would need to be approved as a medicine or under the Psychoactive Substances Act to be sold or given away in New Zealand, and it has not been.</p>
        
            <p>If the product was imported for the personal use of the importer it would be allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Medsafe says it is currently investigating issues around the supply of these products in New Zealand, and how the relevant legislation can be applied.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago professor of public health Janet Hoek said the Zyn products were very new to New Zealand so knowledge of them was still developing.</p>
        
            <p>She said Zyn was the leading brand in the US, and there was increasing discussion of them there.</p>
        
            <p>There were now several New Zealand domain pages advertising Zyn, Hoek said.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was a real risk that Zyn and other similar products would be promoted to regulators as something beneficial to help people stop smoking, but then marketed at young non-smokers.</p>
        
            <p>"When vaping was introduced it was marketed through music festivals, through dance parties, through exactly the type of activities and sponsorship you would expect to see if you were targeting a youth audience. So it is really concerning to hear a young woman who has never smoked has been sent these products as a result of a social media promotion. I just don't think that should be happening."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Health said the ministry was always concerned about the use of tobacco or nicotine products by young people.</p>
        
            <p>Zinger Pouches was approached for comment but did not respond to RNZ.</p>
