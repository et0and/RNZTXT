        <h2>Ferry disruption: New weather system on the way</h2>
        <p>
The new weather is set to whip up waves today but it shouldn't cause the same disruption as the recent southerlies.

            <p>MetService says a new weather system will whip up the waves Tuesday, but the northerly doesn't look set to cause the same disruption on Cook Strait as recent days.</p>
        
            <p>Strong southerly winds saw ferry crossings delayed and cancelled over the last few days, with huge swells making the strait too treacherous for sailings.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Mathapelo Makabulane said the swells dropped below four metres as the southerly eased Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday would see the southerly dying away entirely, but a northerly would pick up later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander said all passengers affected by ferry cancellations have been rebooked on alternative sailings.</p>
        
            <p>And Bluebridge said it was reviewing its schedule to see if sailings could be added.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Nigel Kennedy, who had performed magic shows for families on Interislander ferries for the past 35 years, said he had never seen a summer period like this one for bad weather.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen southerly after southerly after southerly and they're not little ones - they've been storm force southerlies," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Kennedy said staff handed out sick bags and cups of ice on Monday's sailing of the Kaitaki, and some sailings took the long way around to avoid the worst of the swells.</p>
        
            <p>He would expect three to four days of rough southerly weather in winter, but not in summer.</p>
        
            <p>But he said the tough trips made his job all the more important. "You've got to have a laugh and put and a smile on things."</p>
        
            <p>During rough conditions he shifted the timing of his show so it took place in calmer waters, rather than the middle of Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>"Fortunately I've got my sea legs, which is a bonus - I don't think I would've last this long in the job if I didn't."</p>
