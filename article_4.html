            <p>A consent for a Southland wind farm has been declined due to the potential impact on the local flora and fauna.</p>
        
            <p>Contact Energy had applied to build the Southland Wind Farm on land near Wyndham in Southland.</p>
        
            <p>The Environmental Protection Authority has released the decision by an independent panel.</p>
        
            <p>The panel said the project would have had significant economic and social benefits, but it was not satisfied that the adverse effects could be offset or compensated for.</p>
        
            <p>It said some of the main concerns were about the impact on birds, bats and lizards in one of the three areas of the proposed wind farm, the Jedburgh Plateau.</p>
        
            <p>The project site included three areas - Glencoe Station, Matatiki Forest and Jedburgh Plateau.</p>
        
            <p>The panel said Glencoe Station and Matatiki Forest are both highly modified, but Jedburgh Plateau contains large areas of indigenous vegetation that is ecologically significant.</p>
        
            <p>It said the area is interspersed with upland bog and fen wetlands, together forming a complex terrestrial and wetland ecosystem that is significant habitat for indigenous species, including threatened and at risk flora and fauna.</p>
        
            <p>The Panel said it had concerns about the impact on significant indigenous vegetation, local birds, bats, lizards and invertebrates.</p>
        
            <p>In its decision the panel said the project could have provided employment, and helped reduce New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions but the project was declined because of the environmental effects.</p>
        
            <p>Contact Energy said it was extremely disappointed that the consent has been turned down.</p>
        
            <p>Contact chief executive Mike Fuge said the Southland Wind Farm was an important project to support energy security of supply for all New Zealanders.</p>
        
            <p>"The growth in demand for electricity, as New Zealand moves away from relying on fossil fuels, means that projects like this will be critical. Last year, we made a commitment to be net carbon zero in our generation by 2035, and the Southland Wind Farm has been carefully selected as another important step in achieving that."</p>
        
            <p>He said that Contact's approach to offsetting and compensating for unavoidable adverse effects during construction and operation of the wind farm has been modelled to achieve at least a no-net-loss of biodiversity.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes a long list of sustained long-term pest and predator controls covering deer, pigs, mustelids, feral cats, rats and even mice for the life of the windfarm."</p>
        
            <p>Contact Energy said it would now take some time to fully understand the reasons behind the decision and assess what option to take next.</p>
