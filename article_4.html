            <p>The services offered by a Canterbury children's centre that marks its centenary this weekend are as important as ever, its general manager says.</p>
        
            <p>Cholmondeley Children's Centre boss Darel Hall said the Governor's Bay centre opened in 1925 as a rest and recuperation centre for sick children.</p>
        
            <p>"In those days when children had debilitating illnesses and needed months of recovery they would come to a place like Cholmondely. We are just over the hill, about 30 minutes from the centre of Christchurch, but mentally, a million miles away from the city."</p>
        
            <p>It now provides short term, regular respite for families, Hall said.</p>
        
            <p>"Children will come for three days in a week, every six to eight weeks. It allows children and wider families to deal with issues they're facing, such as parents with mental health issues, or if a parent has died and the other needs respite, or grandparents looking after grandchildren full-time."</p>

            <p>The centre played a unique role, Hall said.</p>
        
            <p>"There isn't a government service that does what we do, we're very much helping families to stay together rather than wait until they fall apart, at the bottom of the cliff, if you like."</p>
        
            <p>Around 33,000 tamariki have gone through its doors in the past 100 years, including Hall, whose mum had him at 17 and raised him on her own.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in Cholmondeley almost 50 years ago now... it's still hard for young solo parents now but it was much harder back then."</p>
        
            <p>Hall, who became general manager last year after five years serving on the charity's board, would go to Cholmondely to give his young mum a break.</p>
        
            <p>"I was having a wonderful time, I had not experienced this before. I was a city kid, didn't have a clue about Governors Bay or spending time in rural settings, it was all to me.</p>
        
            <p>"They took us on outings to graveyards, to the coasts to play with crabs. It sounds simple but it was a very different experience to what I had had, [up until] then.</p>
        
            <p>"It also gave my mum time to be an adult, and become more of an adult without a child. Anyone who has been in that situation knows the child is a hundred percent your focus, when the child's there. To just not have that focus, and to spend that time on yourself is really helpful.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's what we offer - time. Respite is time, and time is vital."</p>
