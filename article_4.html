            <p>Police say there are inconsistencies between statements they are getting and injuries a baby who died in Te K큰iti had.</p>
        
            <p>The 10-month-old boy, Mustafa Ali, was brought unconscious to Te K큰iti Hospital on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Tragically, despite the best efforts of medical personnel, he was unable to be resuscitated," detective inspector Graham Pitkethley said. Police have launched a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Mustafa's injuries were the result of violent blunt force trauma and did not appear to be accidental. A post-mortem was expected to take multiple days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage police believed both Mustafa's mother and father took him to the hospital and the fatal injuries took place the same day.</p>
        
            <p>They have both spoken to police but Pitkethley said he had concerns there were inconsistencies with their statements.</p>
        
            <p>Mustafa's father has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        
            <p>"Mustafa Ali is known to police in regards to a non-accidental injury previously that has been investigated," Pitkethley said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified of this incident in October and Pitkethley said the investigation has been ongoing since.</p>
        
            <p>At the time Mustafa received fatal injuries police believed his mother, family and potentially two other people lived at the house.</p>
        
            <p>Pitkethley was asking for anyone in the community with information to come forward, including anyone who heard screams coming from the house.</p>
        
            <p>Non-accidentally injuries on children were one of the most complex cases police could work on and complexities were present in this case too, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police will continue to speak to family members.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki said it was was notified of Mustafa's death.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki DCE Service Delivery Rachel Leota confirmed to RNZ the organisation had prior involvement with the family.</p>
        
            <p>"As this matter is subject to an active police investigation, we cannot go into further details.</p>
        
            <p>"Oranga Tamariki continues to assist police in trying to understand the circumstances that led to the death."</p>
        
            <p>The death was "a huge shock to the community", Waitomo District mayor John Robertson told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"We have our tragedies from time to time, but no community wants to see a 10-month-old baby apparently suffer like this baby did."</p>
        
            <p>Te K큰iti had a population of 4500 people, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of sympathy goes to those who knew the child but shock at the fact that this could happen in our community."</p>
