            <p>New Zealand's population has grown by almost three percent in the past year.</p>
        
            <p>Stats NZ has released its most recent population figures, showing there are now 5.27 million people living in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>In the year ending September, the population grew by 138,000 people.</p>
        
            <p>Of that, the natural increase - the number of births minus deaths - was 19,300 people.</p>
        
            <p>Net migration - the number of migrants arriving minus those departing - was 118,800 people.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori population grew 1.5 percent - 13,100 people.</p>
        
            <p>The estimated Māori population is now 904,100 - which is 17.3 percent of the national population.</p>
        
            <p>The median age of Māori males is 25.8 and and for females it is 27.9 years.</p>
        
            <p>This is compared to the national median ages, which are 37.0 and 39.0 years respectively.</p>
