            <p>Hastings homeowners may be hit with a 25 percent rates rise as the city grapples with how to pay for the huge amount of cyclone recovery work still ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council will on Thursday consider the rates hike as part of its draft long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>The draft plan is proposing 8 percent of the increase is targeted to cyclone recovery and 17 percent to core services, such as maintaining existing roading and invest in infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very much an infrastructure-based budget," mayor Sandra Hazlehurst told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>"What we've spent in the last year is close to $155 million just in the response and road repairs.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition to that we had the category three voluntary buyout, which is $50 million, and on top of that, we need around $170 million to continue with our transport rebuild."</p>
        
            <p>Hazlehurst said the council was hoping for more funding from the government to help the recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment we are borrowing this money over 16 years, so it is a burden on our future ratepayers, but we don't have a lot of choice at the moment, we have to get our infrastructure rebuilt."</p>
        
            <p>Hazlehurst said it was difficult for the council to forecast rate rises.</p>
        
            <p>"The 15 percent (rise) in the following year and 10 percent in the following year will depend on what happens with our three-water infrastructure and how we manage that.</p>
        
            <p>"It is very unknown, so we just have to work through what we know today and keep talking and meeting with the Crown to identify some support."</p>
