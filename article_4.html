            <p>Hawke's Bay emergency managment is on alert as a forecast downpour hits the region.</p>
        
            <p>MetService has issued a heavy rain warning for the Wairoa district from 9am on Thursday until midnight, with 70 to 110 millimetres of rain expected to fall.</p>
        
            <p>It is forecasting peak rates of 10 to 20 millimetres an hour, and warns of rapidly rising waterways and flooding on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>Power cuts were affecting Raupunga, Kotemaori, Willow Flat, Otoi, Piripaua and Ardkeen about 11am and Gisborne lines company Firstlight was working to restore supply.</p>
        
            <p>The region's civil defence says its keeping an eye on the situation and asks residents to follow Wairoa District Council's facebook page for local updates.</p>
        
            <p>MetSevice has also issued a heavy rain watch for Gisborne/Tairawhiti until midnight tonight, with a chance of upgrading to warning level.</p>
        
            <p>In an update at 10am, it said heavy rain was was being funnelled into the Wairoa District and Gisborne/Tairawhiti by a low pressure to the northeast.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa mayor Craig Little said drains were starting to fill up but by midday there had been no reports of flooding and rivers were holding up well.</p>
        
            <p>He said the rain kicked off at about 10am causing a sudden drop in temperature.</p>
        
            <p>"I was quite amazed really, the rivers weren't too bad on the way in, I follow the Waikaretāheke River into town and it was pretty good really."</p>
        
            <p>Little said it was likely nothing would come of it, but noted they'd thought the same with Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>Council emergency management controller Juanita Savage said the main message was to be mindful when travelling on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>She said the most likely impact would be flooding and slips and, if possible, people should delay or avoid travelling.</p>
