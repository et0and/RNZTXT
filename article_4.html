            <p>A man is being airlifted to hospital after losing his kayak and spending almost 24 hours in the bush.</p>
        
            <p>The man was found with a back injury at the bottom of a gully at Okere Falls in Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>Ground crews heard whistling and shouts for help shortly after 1pm on Tuesday and worked their way down to him.</p>
        
            <p>Land Search and Rescue volunteers are cared for him while a helicopter flew in.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Graeme Hill said the 34-year-old was kayaking with friends down the Kaituna River on Monday when he became separated from his kayak.</p>
        
            <p>He told his friends he intended to walk to a four-wheel-drive track and back to their accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>That was at 2.30pm and the trip on foot would have taken several hours, Hill said.</p>
        
            <p>By 9.30pm, the man still had not made it back to the accommodation and police were called.</p>
        
            <p>Hill said as he was not carrying a Personal Locator Beacon, a large search operation began immediately, involving ground crews, and the police Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>Police wanted to thank everyone involved in the operation, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Search teams have worked through the night in challenging and dangerous terrain, and we're grateful to be able to reunite the man with his family and friends."</p>
