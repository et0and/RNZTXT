            <p>One of the 10 young men taking part in the boot camp pilot is on the run after attending the funeral of another who has died.</p>
        
            <p>The three-stage pilot - which involved "military style activities" and a special curriculum - launched in July, and was run by Oranga Tamariki.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour said a participant who attended the funeral on Tuesday has not been located since.</p>
        
            <p>"This means he is breaking the conditions of his court order, and both Oranga Tamariki and the police are looking for him," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki and Waikato police both confirmed the 15-year-old, who was granted bail on compassionate grounds to attend the funeral by the Youth Court, had absconded.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato police said he was wanted to arrest.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald reported it understood the young man who died was the fatality in a crash on State Highway 1 near Tīrau on Wednesday last week between three vehicles, including a tourist bus, which injured 14 others.</p>
        
            <p>Children's Minister Karen Chhour said she was shocked by the death and attended the victim's funeral.</p>
        
            <p>"The death of a young person participating in the military-style academies pilot programme has come as a great shock to me.</p>
        
            <p>"My heart goes out to this young person's family, and I am heartbroken for them. This young man had just started to turn his life around, and from the stories I have heard, he was proud of what he was achieving.</p>
        
            <p>"I attended his funeral in a personal capacity to show my support for the family who were kind enough to include me in such a difficult time."</p>

            <p>Oranga Tamariki deputy chief executive of youth justice services and residential care Tusha Penny confirmed a participant died as a result of an accident.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with this young man's family at this tragic time, and we are offering them our condolences and support," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Both Chhour and Penny said they could not comment on specific details as the circumstances of the accident are under police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki also confirmed another young man - granted bail on compassionate grounds by the Youth Court - had absconded.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato Police said a 15-year-old was wanted for arrest after breaching compassionate bail, granted to allow him to attend a tangi on 3 December.</p>
        
            <p>They said inquiries to locate him were ongoing, and at this time no further information is available.</p>
        
            <p>"A full review into the circumstances and events leading up to both incidents has already begun."</p>
