            <p>A driver was caught going 104 kilometres per hour in a 50km/h zone following a car show in Christchurch earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they arrested three people and impounded 13 cars.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Luke Vaughan said more than 500 vehicles attended the event from 1-3 March. He said the main cruise on Saturday night went without any problems.</p>
        
            <p>But "sustained loss of traction and speed were common themes across the weekend".</p>
        
            <p>Vaughan said police were focused on preventing illegal street racing and burnouts.</p>
        
            <p>A total of 13 vehicles were impounded for burnouts, including some conducted previously.</p>
        
            <p>And more than 30 speeding infringements were issued, including one person doing 104km/h in a 50km/h zone. Several others were caught at 80kmh in the same area.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff will continue to take action against anti-social road users," Vaughan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police also wish to thank the members of the community for their ongoing assistance in reporting their concerns and urge the public to continue to do so when they see illegal road user activity."</p>
