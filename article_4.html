        <h2>Christchurch terror attacks: Coroner continues probe of locked door</h2>
        <p>
Al Noor Mosque worshippers have said they kicked out a glass pane in an emergency exit door at Christchurch's Al Noor Mosque and crawled out during the terror attack.
</p>
        
            <p>
The inquiry's first phase is considering ten issues, including whether an emergency exit door in the main prayer room of Al Noor Mosque failed to open during the attack.

            <p>The deputy chief coroner will further examine why an emergency exit door at Christchurch's Al Noor Mosque did not open during the 2019 terror attacks.</p>
        
            <p>Expert witnesses will be called to give evidence at the week-long hearing.</p>

            <p>The door and legislation surrounding its installation was the sole focus of a hearing in May, when survivors and police said the door - which was controlled by a mechanical and an electromagnetic lock - did not open during the 15 March shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Al Noor worshippers Mohammad Siddiqui and Ahmad Alayedy said they kicked out the door's bottom glass pane and crawled out instead.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Brigitte Windley is examining a total of 10 issues as part of the inquest's first phase, with the bulk of evidence heard over seven weeks late last year.</p>
        
            <p>The issues included:</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Windley told the court the hearing was designed to transition the country's understanding of the events of 15 March from "darkness to light".</p>
        
            <p>"The evidence we've heard in this inquest is vital to fully understanding the circumstances of the deaths, in so far as the actions or inactions of the emergency response agencies and their staff on 15 March 2019 are relevant.</p>
        
            <p>"Only with that understanding is it possible to consider if the response and the inevitable care gap could be improved in the future, despite our strongest desire that a response to such an attack will never again be needed on our shores," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry will later consider a further three issues - the police firearms licensing process, the terrorist's online activities and the community's ability to detect and respond to violent extremism.</p>
        
            <p>The firearms licensing issue will be considered in a hearing set down for October.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday the government announced it would not implement eight of the 44 recommendations of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the 15 March terror attacks.</p>
        
            <p>The Federation of Islamic Associations urged the government to revisit its decision to wind up work on the commission response, while Labour accused the coalition of walking away from the prime minister's commitment to victims and survivors.</p>
