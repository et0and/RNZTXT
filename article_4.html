            <p>Queenstown's longest-serving doctor says she quit her job as she felt it was time for a change. However, she is not ready to hang up her stethoscope.</p>
        
            <p>Val Miller, who has practised locally for 40-plus years, was a partner in the Wakatipu Medical Centre (renamed The Doctors Whakatipu) when it sold to Green Cross Health (GCH) in 2021 - NZX-listed GCH owns 66 clinics nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>At the time she welcomed the takeover because running an ever-growing business, with clinics in both Frankton and Shotover Country, was becoming more stressful.</p>
        
            <p>"From my personal point of view, it will take a huge weight off my shoulders and hopefully enable me to go for much longer," she told Mountain Scene at the time.</p>
        
            <p>However, Miller, who finished on 31 December, says she had a different approach to GCH.</p>
        
            <p>"I still liked to practise general practice in the way that I was trained - the corporate model is not quite the same as the old [model].</p>
        
            <p>"I think the face of general practice has changed very much in the last 10 years because there has been less available government funding."</p>
        
            <p>Miller, who also served two terms on the local council, says she "absolutely" loved looking after families over a long period - "I'm looking after the children of the children" - and it meant she could sense when something wasn't right with a patient.</p>
        
            <p>"Where general practice is changing now is there's not the room to have that depth of knowledge."</p>
        
            <p>She feels sad for patients who have only known her as their doctor.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been absolutely touched by some of the things people have said, it's been very heartwarming.</p>
        
            <p>"The gratitude I have to the community for having me work with them for the last 40-odd years is enormous."</p>
        
            <p>Though of "retirement age", Miller says she is taking a short breather before taking on some freelance work - "a little bit more focusing on doing procedural work, minor surgeries and gynaecological procedures and things like that, because a lot of the young GPs actually don't do a lot of the things I do".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very happy to teach young doctors if they want me to, but I don't think the corporate model particularly embraces that sort of thing any more."</p>
