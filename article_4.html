            <p>A group calling itself Tamaki for Palestine said the paint symbolised blood on US and New Zealand officials' hands following the death of thousands of people in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>It claims the current tensions did not start on 7 October with the Hamas attack in Israel.</p>

            <p>The US supported the right of people to voice their opinion through peaceful protest but civil protests "do not include vandalizing property", a United States Embassy spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"As we stand with the people and government of Israel, we also stand with Palestinian civilians."</p>
        
            <p>They said the US recognised "the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and we support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike", reiterating US President Joe Biden's comments.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the humanitarian situation is urgent, and we continue to focus on addressing the humanitarian needs of civilians in dire need.</p>
        
            <p>Quoting US Secretary Antony Blinken, the spokesperson said: "Addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza ... aligns with our nation's most deeply held principles, including our belief that every civilian life is equally valuable and equally worthy of protection - no matter what his or her nationality, ethnicity, age, gender or faith. A civilian is a civilian is a civilian."</p>
        
            <p>MFAT declined to comment.</p>
