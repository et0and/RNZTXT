            <p>The Human Rights Commission (HRC) is hosting a two-day conference in Auckland on human rights protections and access to justice for rainbow communities.</p>
        
            <p>The conference - Te Kāhui Uenuku - taking place today and tomorrow will cover a range of issues, including the impacts of racism and colonisation on takatāpui and the rainbow community, recent research and human rights laws.</p>
        
            <p>Senior human rights advisor Taine Polkinghorn said it was timely to celebrate the rainbow communities in response to increased incidents of online and offline harm.</p>
        
            <p>"This conference is an opportunity for rainbow communities to support, learn from each other, and affirm their human rights in person, at a time when rainbow people in Aotearoa and around the world have reported increasing levels of feeling unsafe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The conference will also be looking at access to government services if rainbow people experience discrimination or harassment.</p>
        
            <p>The HRC said it was investing in building the human rights and Te Tiriti o Waitangi capability of the rainbow sector - which is largely volunteer run and dependent on fundraising.</p>
        
            <p>About 150 people have registered to attend the event.</p>
        
            <p>The HRC said the conference was made possible through funding from the Michael and Suzanne Borrin Foundation, which aims to provide legal education for priority populations requiring access to justice.</p>
        
            <p>The commission has matched this funding.</p>
