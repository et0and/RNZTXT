            <p>Police have arrested 11 people following an investigation into breaches of the gang patch law during the tangi of a senior Mongrel Mob member.</p>
        
            <p>The funeral that happened in December last year saw a police operation carried out in Napier during the funeral.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested three people at the time who were displaying gang insignia and four others for disorder offences.</p>
        
            <p>Thirteen search warrants were executed across Hawke's Bay, Gisborne, Wairoa, Auckland and Dannevirke today to seize other gang insignia displayed at the time.</p>
        
            <p>All those arrested are all due to appear in their respective district courts in the coming week, and further arrests are likely.</p>
        
            <p>Police seized 11 gang patches, one t-shirt and one pair of shorts.</p>
        
            <p>Several other items including a replica pistol, a taser, ammunition and 22 cannabis plants were also confiscated.</p>
        
            <p>Police said these items highlight the dangerous roles gangs play within our communities.</p>
        
            <p>Police hope the arrests serve as a clear reminder they're committed to enforcing the ban on gang patches law and will take every chance to follow it up plus other illegal gang activity.</p>
        
            <p>They said the gang disruption units are dedicated to targeting unlawful gang activity even if it means following up further down the line.</p>
        
            <p>Police said it will not tolerate intimidation or breaches of the law.</p>
