            <p>There has been a minor eruption at Whakaari White Island, near Whakatane, on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The GNS Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences webcam shows a plume rising above the island for about an hour from 6.30am.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said that minor activity had since stopped.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the week, GNS said the Whakaari Volcanic Alert Level remained at Level 2 and the Aviation Colour Code remained Yellow.</p>
        
            <p>The volcano had been emitting steam and gas nearly constantly since an eruption on the 24 May.</p>
