            <p>A mass murderer who killed seven family members will have another opportunity to apply for parole following concerns about bias.</p>
        
            <p>Raymond Ratima was jailed for life after he went on a rampage in Masterton in 1992, killing family members including his three sons and pregnant sister-in-law.</p>
        
            <p>He has been denied parole 14 times, with the last time being in October, 2022.</p>
        
            <p>He applied for a judicial review of the decision, saying a psychiatrist who prepared mental health reports for the courts in 1992 should not have been on the panel.</p>
        
            <p>In November Ratima's lawyer, Roger Eagles, told the High Court in Christchurch there had been "extensive personal contact" between Parole Board member Professor Phillip Brinded and Ratima after the murders in 1992, when Brinded prepared psychological reports.</p>
        
            <p>Eagles argued Brinded's previous involvement with his client could create a "perception of bias" when it came to sitting on Ratima's parole hearing.</p>
        
            <p>In a High Court judgment, Justice Preston said Ratima was entitled to a re-hearing before a different board.</p>
