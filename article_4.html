            <p>Residents said police had been asking local businesses for CCTV.</p>
        
            <p>A nurse at the park on her lunch break, who did not wish to be named, said police had revealed few details about what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"I come down here most days. The police just said that they found a woman severely injured, today in the park," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who lived nearby, who did not wish to be named, said it was a "dodgy area" so she avoided the park.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always people loitering around, I don't see many families go and play there apart from... I'd say like druggies.</p>
        
            <p>"There's always older people just standing around the park, I wouldn't say it's safe for kids. I don't usually go around walking," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said some people also slept at the park.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said he was shocked to hear someone had been found injured at the park.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know if I should take [my daughter] there, we'll probably stay away from that park," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said he was not aware of any fights happening at the park.</p>
