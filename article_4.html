            <p>More people are using public transport in Canterbury, but there are not enough buses to keep up with growing demand.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Canterbury chairperson Peter Scott said bus use in the Greater Christchurch area grew significantly over the last year, placing services under pressure during peak times.</p>
        
            <p>''We are going to need to make a lot of buses over the next 10 years to keep up with demand.''</p>
        
            <p>The regional council last week voted to order five new electric buses so it could increase the frequency of a popular Christchurch route.</p>
        
            <p>Buses will run every 10 minutes on Route 7, between Queenspark and Halswell, when the new buses arrive in six to 12 months.</p>

            <p>Bus patronage in Waimakariri, in the year to October, was up 21 percent on pre-Covid-19 levels (2018/19), while the Selwyn district saw a 25.27 percent increase, council's public transport strategy and planning manager Sonia Pollard said.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Canterbury had no spare buses in the fleet, so any improvements were subject to funding being approved, Pollard said.</p>
        
            <p>''This is why we are getting underway now with this for our Route 7 uplift, which we hope to implement next year.</p>
        
            <p>''We are working with central government to identify ways we can respond to changes in demand, in particular areas where demand exceeds capacity which is focused on the peak times.''</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at a recent council meeting, Scott called on the new government to help regional councils with the challenges.</p>
        
            <p>There needed to be more consistency and the new government should "look at this with other regional councils''.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Canterbury completed a Public Transport Futures Programme Business Case in 2019, which estimated an extra 100 buses would be needed over 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>A new business case was being prepared in preparation for the 2024/34 Long Term Plan and for next year's National Land Transport Programme, which sets out priorities for transport spending.</p>
        
            <p>Waimakariri Mayor Dan Gordon said he was pleased to see a significant increase in bus patronage from the district.</p>
        
            <p>''A lot of the country's emissions come from transport so it is great to see that our improved services are working for people.</p>
        
            <p>''I would say it is down to a combination of having the right services at the right time.''</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said he often took the bus for meetings in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>''Environment Canterbury and the council will need to look at how we can further improve this service to meet demand.''</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged Environment Canterbury to meet with his council to discuss options for improving the service and how the councils could continue to work together.</p>
        
            <p>Comment has been sought from incoming Associate Transport Minister Matt Doocey.</p>
