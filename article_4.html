        <h2>Commercial flights resume for quake-hit Vanuatu</h2>
        <p>
The priority is for stranded citizens to return home as well as enabling visitors to leave.

            <p>Airports Vanuatu chief executive Jason Rakau said he was thankful the only damage to the airport was from things being thrown around in the terminal.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a number of different engineers come in to assess and so far what they have mentioned is that there is no damage sustained to our structure.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's enabled us now to make the decision to recommence commercial operations."</p>
        
            <p>The priority was enabling Vanuatu citizens stranded outside the country to return home, and for visitors to Vanuatu to be able to leave.</p>
        
            <p>Rakau hoped passengers would be able to get home for Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>Stranded passengers should organise travel with their respective airlines, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, two passengers on New Zealand's final repatriation flight out of Vanuatu on Saturday said it was a huge relief when they found out they had seats on the plane.</p>
        
            <p>Around 70 evacuees from 16 countries boarded the Defence Force flight which landed back in Aotearoa last night.</p>
        
            <p>Aucklanders Rebecca Shrigley and Nooroa Marsters had been holidaying at the Iririki Island Resort in Port Vila.</p>
        
            <p>They say the earthquake was a harrowing experience.</p>
        
            <p>"We were just back from the coastline so we were outside," Shrigley said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was like the ground was an ocean - the concrete was like a wave."</p>
        
            <p>Marsters said they held on to each other as their vehicle shook.</p>
        
            <p>Vanuatu had another earthquake this morning after Tuesday's magnitude 7.3 tremor that caused widespread damage.</p>
        
            <p>The aftershock hit near the island nation at around 4.30am New Zealand time at a magnitude of 6.1 and a depth of 40 kilometres.</p>
        
            <p>It's the latest in a series of aftershocks.</p>
        
            <p>The Red Cross says Starlink has been transformational for responding to disasters in Vanuatu.</p>

            <p>John Moriarty who is working in Port Vila said most of the infrastructure in the capital was quite broken.</p>
        
            <p>He took the Vanuatu Red Cross its first Starlink kit 18 months ago and he brought in an additional one to improve coverage.</p>
        
            <p>Both have proved their worth as the country recovers from the disaster.</p>
        
            <p>Almost a week after the magnitude 7.3 quake most businesses in Port Vila still have no internet and the telecommunications network supports only local calls and texts.</p>
