            <p>Hundreds of people holding empty plates have gathered in central Auckland demanding the New Zealand government call for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Protesters at Aotea Square say the empty dinner-places are to raise awareness for those going hungry within the warzone.</p>
        
            <p>A dozen police officers watched over the protest on Saturday afternoon, to ensure it was peaceful.</p>
        
            <p>Families, children and iwi attended the protest, with tamariki leading the chant asking for a cease-fire.</p>
        
            <p>As war continues in Gaza, international agencies have called on Israel to do more to prevent serious food shortages affecting the population within Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The Israel-Gaza war began following an attack by Palestinian Hamas forces on Israeli citizens on 7 October last year, with Israel responding with air strikes and ground forces. The conflict has displaced much of the population of Gaza within its boundaries.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders who have tried to send food aid into Gaza say it has been a struggle to get it to its destination.</p>
