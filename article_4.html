        <h2>Main construction on Wellington's controversial Golden Mile planned for next year</h2>
        <p>
Work on the first stage of the project will start next month.
</p>
        
            <p>Main works on Wellington's Golden Mile upgrades are planned to start next year, RNZ can reveal.</p>
        
            <p>The $116 million project would see cars banned from 7am to 7pm between Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place, along with widened footpaths and a cycle lane.</p>
        
            <p>Work is scheduled to start next month, with changes to Kent and Cambridge Terrace which is expected to take eight months to complete.</p>
        
            <p>The council has not said when major works on Courtenay Place, which was slated to begin once Kent/Cambridge work was done, would start due to ongoing talks with contractors.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council documents released this week show that main construction works on the project along Courtenay Place are planned to start early next year.</p>
        
            <p>A Wellington City Council spokesperson told RNZ enabling works, which could include establishing transport diversions and safety signage, could start late this year.</p>
        
            <p>However, they said that was still subject to negotiations with contractors which were yet to be resolved.</p>

            <p>The project will remove cars from Courtenay Place during the day, widen foot paths, create a cycle lane down the road and improve lighting.</p>
        
            <p>It will also see the street lined with new anti-slip pavement and new greenery, while also replacing any old water pipes that are sitting under the throughfare.</p>
        
            <p>The design of Golden Mile upgrade has been created in partnership with mana whenua and features ngā ūranga - interactive sculptures where people can sit, share food or use as a performance area.</p>
        
            <p>The Lambton Quay part of the project is not expected to start for at least three years, due to Courtenay Place being prioritised by councillors.</p>
        
            <p>The Golden Mile upgrade was part of the Let's Get Wellington Moving transport plan, a joint initiative which started in 2016 between Wellington City Council, Greater Wellington Regional Council and NZTA Waka Kotahi.</p>
        
            <p>On 17 December 2023, the government and the two councils agreed to disestablish the plan.</p>
        
            <p>As part of this agreement, the central government would build and fund the Basin Reserve upgrade and second Mt Victoria tunnel while Wellington City Council brought the Golden Mile project in-house.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA will still fund 51 percent of the Golden Mile.</p>
        
            <p>The project had been controversial among some councillors, residents and some of the business community.</p>
        
            <p>There was strong opposition to the project by some when the project was voted into the council's latest long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>The government had also been unhappy at times with the council's handling of the project.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ revealed in April last year that the then-Transport and Infrastructure Ministers wrote a 'please explain' letter to the council raising concern about a lack of consultation with local businesses.</p>
