            <p>An Auckland woman with a rare disease that caused unpredictable and dangerous swelling - sometimes of her entire body - says a world-first gene editing treatment has been life changing.</p>
        
            <p>Bev Tanner was one of just 10 patients internationally who took part in an initial trial of the therapy led by Auckland University.</p>
        
            <p>She has hereditary angioedema - a condition that took 17 years to be properly diagnosed.</p>
        
            <p>An attack would start with a small red mark on her arm, then a few hours later her whole arm would be "swollen up like a rubber glove".</p>
        
            <p>"Then my legs, my back, my whole internal organs, anything on my body could swell up. My throat could swell closed. And that happened all the time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Sometimes she would vomit every 15 to 20 minutes for several days.</p>
        
            <p>"By the time I got diagnosed I was in bed four or five days a week."</p>
        
            <p>After diagnosis she was put on a heavy duty steroid for 13 years that minimised the severity of the attacks but caused weight gain and meant she had to be regularly checked for liver damage.</p>
        
            <p>When she got the opportunity to go on the trial she was nervous.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a hard decision, I hummed and hahed for quite a while," she thought.</p>
        
            <p>She decided she could help other people so they would not have to go through 17 years of "thinking you're a hypochondriac and being sick all the time and no-one knows what's wrong with you".</p>
        
            <p>In August 2022, she became the eighth person on the trial and since then she has not had an attack and does not take medication.</p>
        
            <p>Clinical immunologist and Auckland University honorary associate professor Hilary Longhurst led the work which was done with Amsterdam and Cambridge universities and funded by an American biotech company, Intellia Therapeutics.</p>

            <p>It is a type of therapy known as a CRISPR and this one, called NTLA-2002, is a single dose infusion into a vein that introduces a genetic treatment to the liver where the problem begins.</p>
        
            <p>"It will go into the nucleus and it will find very, very specifically the gene that is causing the problem and it will just cut that gene," Longhurst said.</p>
        
            <p>The clinical collaboration with the two other universities came after many years of research on the therapy, much of it in the United States, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She had been confident it would work well on patients but there was always a small degree of uncertainty that it would not act as expected until the results came in.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been so excited and happy for my patients," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Longhurst thought it would be a permanent cure for the symptoms of hereditary angioedema - which was often found throughout families.</p>
        
            <p>However, such a small trial was not enough to determine that, so now a larger, double-blind trial was under way meaning neither the participants nor their doctors know whether they are on the treatment or a placebo.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped the therapy would eventually be able to be applied to other conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Tanner and other trial participants would continue to be monitored for 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>A paper on the research was published on Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
