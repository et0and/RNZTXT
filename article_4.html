        <h2>Animals often neglected if given as Xmas presents - advocate</h2>
        <p>
You wouldn't buy your kid a sibling as a present, so don't buy a companion animal without thinking very hard, an animal charity says. Audio

            <p>An animal rescue charity has a Christmas message of its own, ahead of a busy holiday season: You wouldn't buy your child a sibling as a present, so don't buy a companion animal without thinking very hard.</p>
        
            <p>Mini Vadke, from Māmā Mini's rescue in Palmerston North, knows too well how often animals are neglected or abandoned if they are given to friends or family as presents, so is warning against the idea.</p>
        
            <p>Vadke started her animal rescue charity earlier this year and is braced for a post-Christmas rush of unwanted animals.</p>
        
            <p>"Come January, once everyone goes back to work and school, I'm expecting a lot of puppies to be dumped, returned, up for rehoming - the same with kittens, but especially puppies.</p>
        
            <p>"Suddenly you have to go to work. The puppy's used to you being home all the holidays then suddenly they get bored."</p>

            <p>She has 20 kittens and three puppies looking for homes, and has found families for about 50 dogs and 100 cats or kittens this year.</p>
        
            <p>"People who are interested have to fill out an application form, which is extremely comprehensive.</p>
        
            <p>"Mine's quite a bit stricter than other rescues. I consider it the same as adopting a human, basically, so I'll ask you about your finances, whether you're working, your history with animals, what research you've done, if you're a first-time owner."</p>
        
            <p>Vadke, a former public servant and zoo keeper who has turned her attention to her rescue full-time, said a perfect match was essential.</p>

            <p>"My rescue doesn't condone adoptions based on looks. If you're like, 'I want a fluffy ginger kitten', we're probably not the best rescue for you.</p>
        
            <p>"We're all about the household and the personality."</p>
        
            <p>Vadke does not mince words when it comes to people considering a pet as a Christmas gift.</p>

            <p>"Don't do it. Would you buy a human baby for someone for Christmas? Just any time you're dealing with animals apply the human baby rule.</p>
        
            <p>"Would you do this to a human baby? At Christmas, would you buy your older sibling a younger sibling? No you wouldn't.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the questions in my application form is, 'Why are you looking to adopt a puppy or a kitten?'</p>
        
            <p>"The minute someone says, 'It's a Christmas present', I actually don't even read the rest of the application. It's just a straight 'no'."</p>
        
            <p>Vadke's home has transformed into a shelter for cats and dogs.</p>
        
            <p>There are crates, cat climbing equipment, a freezer full of animal food and even an incubator for young kittens.</p>
        
            <p>Māmā Mini's three puppies, Xena, Shadow and Mouse, were unclaimed at the Palmerston North pound.</p>
        
            <p>Xena was found roaming the streets, while Shadow and Mouse were dumped in a park.</p>
        
            <p>They are about eight to 10 weeks old.</p>

            <p>"This is when they should be healthy, with fat little tummies, living their best lives with a nice family and getting training and going to puppy school.</p>
        
            <p>"This is what they will get now they they're out of the pound. I will be fattening them up over Christmas."</p>
        
            <p>Kittens were easier to find homes for than older cats, and came to Māmā Mini's often when people found a litter under their house, or even when their own cats had a litter.</p>
        
            <p>"When it comes to people who say, 'My cat has had kittens and I can't afford them. Can you take them?' I'm happy to," Vadke said.</p>
        
            <p>"But that's on one condition, that the māmā cat gets de-sexed, because I don't want to come and see you next season."</p>
        
            <p>Vadke has another seasonal message: Seek advice before adopting an animal and make sure they fit well with your lifestyle, and then the post-Christmas rush for animal rescues might be slower.</p>
