            <p>University of Otago vice-chancellor Grant Robertson is to be the MC at Dunedin singer/songwriter Martin Phillipps' funeral on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Phillipps' father Donald said the former deputy prime minister was chosen by the family because he was a "real fan" and friend of his son.</p>
        
            <p>"When we asked Grant, he was more than happy to help."</p>

            <p>Phillipps said most of the speakers would be family members and a handful of musicians who had a connection with Phillipps would also speak.</p>
        
            <p>He said the 61-year-old's death on 28 July had prompted an outpouring of tributes from around the world, and the family had to put a limit on who would speak.</p>
        
            <p>Hope and Sons funeral director Matt Jenkins said the Phillipps family had requested the funeral venue be changed from the Hope and Sons chapel to the Glenroy Auditorium in Central Dunedin, to cater for what was expected to be a large event.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand indie rock band formed in 1980 and became popular around the world with hits such as 'Pink Frost,' 'Doledrums', 'I Love My Leather Jacket', 'Heavenly Pop Hit' and 'Male Monster from the Id.'</p>
        
            <p>His funeral starts at 2pm and will be livestreamed online at Hope and Sons and on YouTube.</p>
