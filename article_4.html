            <p>Ten of New Zealand's top chess players have just finished competing at the world's most elite chess tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, an open team and a women's team represented New Zealand, travelling to Hungary to play in Chess Olympiad.</p>
        
            <p>It turned out to be incredibly successful for the country.</p>
        
            <p>The event is seen as the Olympics of the chess world - a biennial team event which decides what country dominates the 64 squares.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand chess player Nadia Braganza was on the women's team which placed 48th out of more than 160 countries.</p>
        
            <p>She was ecstatic about the results.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's our first time being in the top 50, so that was really cool. We were also close to getting a medal in our category, we came fourth so we just missed it."</p>
        
            <p>She also scored herself a Women's FIDE Master title after winning seven out of eight games.</p>
        
            <p>"I've won the WFM title twice in two Oceania tournaments, one which was in 2019 and the other was this year, but I had not crossed 1900 rating. I was hoping to get a 1900 rating in this tournament, so fortunately I did."</p>
        
            <p>The open team also played better than expected, finished 70th out of nearly 200 teams.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Chess Federation president Nigel Metge said both local teams performed very well.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our young players actually beat an Australian Grand Master which is a really wonderful and difficult thing to do.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 1900 players competed in the 45th Chess Olympiad, a record number for the tournament.</p>
        
            <p>Top grand masters such as world number one Magnus Carlsen from Norway and current world champion, China's Ding Liren, were there.</p>
        
            <p>Women's team member Yolanda Chang was stunned to be in the same tournament hall as experts she had only ever seen play online.</p>
        
            <p>"For my games I could just walk around and a few tables across was Magnus and Ding Liren, the whole Indian team."</p>
        
            <p>She also came away with a Women's Master title.</p>
        
            <p>"You have to win six out of nine games, I got the title in the last round, and it was really tough, I was nervous."</p>
        
            <p>In chess, a person's rating works as a handicap, titles are awarded to those who exceed a master level understanding of the game.</p>
        
            <p>But for chess players, the ultimate prize is receiving the coveted grand master title.</p>
        
            <p>Braganza was one of many young chess players who hoped to reach this level one day.</p>
        
            <p>"My biggest goal would be to become a grand master, but I think my realistic goal right now is to try and cross 2000 rating now that I've crossed 1900."</p>
        
            <p>As for the winners? India has fast become the world's toughest country to beat.</p>
        
            <p>Both the women's and the open Indian teams topped the rankings, scoring double gold at the 2024 chess Olympics.</p>
