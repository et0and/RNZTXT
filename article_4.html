            <p>Members of the public have intervened after claims a man forcefully grabbed and verbally abused two lifeguards in Mount Maunganui.</p>
        
            <p>Police said inquiries were being made into the alleged Wednesday incident, where Surf Life Saving New Zealand said the man brought a female lifeguard to tears when he hurled "foul language" at her before he grabbed her colleague.</p>
        
            <p>SLSNZ said it started when the man tried to get the female lifeguard's attention from the beach while she was on duty at Tay Street.</p>
        
            <p>"The surf lifeguard scanned the water, figuring that he may have been referring to another swimmer, but she could not spot anyone who appeared to be in difficulty," SLSNZ said.</p>
        
            <p>It said the man became agitated, pointing to a woman who appeared to the lifeguard to be "floating happily on their back behind the breakers and between the flagged area".</p>
        
            <p>The lifeguard had been monitoring this person but decided to take a rescue board out to her for a welfare check.</p>
        
            <p>"As she ran past the man in the shallows," SLSNZ said, "the man began verbally abusing her".</p>
        
            <p>The woman in the water accepted an offer to be returned to shore and said she may have swum too far.</p>
        
            <p>On returning to shore, the man continued the abuse and followed her to the surf lifeguard tower and proceeded to "hurl foul language" at her and bring her to tears.</p>
        
            <p>At the tower, another lifeguard tried to step in to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>The man then turned his attention to this surf lifeguard," SLSNZ said, "and grabbed him forcefully before passing members of the public intervened and pulled the man away."</p>
        
            <p>The man and woman then left.</p>
        
            <p>SLSNZ eastern region lifesaving manager Chaz Gibbons-Campbell said the lifeguards acted accordingly and "did absolutely nothing wrong".</p>
        
            <p>"They were actively monitoring the flagged area, and there was no-one who appeared to be in any difficulty as the woman was showing no signs of distress or fatigue," Gibbons-Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any level of abuse directed towards our surf lifeguards, whether they are paid guards or volunteers, is completely unacceptable."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had received the reports and inquiries were ongoing.</p>
