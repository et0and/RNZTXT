            <p>Hawkes Bay's emergency management system will be overhauled as part of a new strategy that's been voted on by the region's councils.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence Transformation Director Matt Boggs told councils and iwi that with 95 percent of people living where the hazards are, the whole region must be involved in these changes.</p>
        
            <p>"I can't stress enough that our system needs both a local system and a regional system, and in the last 5 to 10 years our region has re-organised from a local system to a regional system and mixtures of in between, I'm suggesting to you that we must in this region have both," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The (HBCDEM) strategy focuses on seven key areas: Māori partnership, Connecting with the community, infrastructure and assets, training and assurance, planning and service level agreements.</p>
        
            <p>"The success of the HBCDEM Transformation Strategy lies in driving systemic change," the document reads.</p>
        
            <p>The plan lays out rough timeframes for some of the biggest changes:</p>
        
            <p>Bogg said they've already engaged with a contractor to deliver the formal credited training, a key recommendation of the government review.</p>
        
            <p>"That's an important message to send to our community - the formal training of 240 staff this year, next year and the following year... aside from the 500 to 700 people trained by our civil defence group annually.</p>
        
            <p>"That formal training turns our volunteer system into one that's professionalised," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The meeting also heard from Ngāti Kahungunu chair, Bayden Barber, who welcomed the formal inclusion of mana whenua in civil defence and asked that the region's marae be marked out on the strategic maps.</p>

            <p>"There are 100 marae in Ngāti Kahungunu... when we are thinking about this whole system - the Māori community and its contribution to civil defence - we can bolster it with some of the stuff our people bring to the table.</p>
        
            <p>"I like the korero that we will be formally included, but I think this plan can be strengthened by including clusters of marae," he said.</p>
        
            <p>All three reviews of the the Cyclone Gabrielle response identified a need for emergency responses to be more inclusive, and recognise that marae are vital providers of community intelligence and services.</p>
        
            <p>The HBCDEM Transformation Strategy will be rolled out in three phases over the next three years and comes amidst legislative changes to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).</p>
        
            <p>NEMA and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are still clarifying the scope, timing and funding requirements to deliver the planned overhaul.</p>
        
            <p>An announcement outlining a public roadmap for the promised changes is expected early this year.</p>
        
            <p>"The government inquiry has been woven into this... it's still at quite a high level, but there are themes around an assurance that we will find ourselves probably leading the country in this," said Boggs.</p>
        
            <p>NEMA chief executive David Gawn backed the region's new strategy at the Wairoa meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very aligned with the findings and direction that the central government is taking as well. I applaud Hawke's Bay in terms of the lead you are taking on this, Auckland went through a similar process last year," he said.</p>
