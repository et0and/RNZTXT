            <p>Tuesday was expected to be a cold day around the country with frosts expected this morning in the east, including Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>After wild weather caused severe road disruption on Monday and rain caused flooding over the weekend, Tuesday looked set to be somewhat calmer, though cold.</p>
        
            <p>There was a heavy snow watch in place overnight for Central Otago overnight with snow forecast down to 300m.</p>
        
            <p>Road snow fall warnings were also in place overnight for Milford Road (SH94), Crown Range Road, SH1 Dunedin to Waitati and the Desert Road (SH1) in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>The Desert Road was closed between Rangipo and Waiouru due to snow.</p>
        
            <p> It's a tad nippy out there -here are this morning's temperatures☀ Cold air remains over Aotearoa NZ for the next couple of days, but some direct sunshine will take the edge off the winter chill A few places reached negatives in the South Island, but not all of these… pic.twitter.com/YQ6oVSDj7V</p>
        
            <p>Even as the weather cleared, Waka Kotahi was urging drivers to take extra care.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency said there was a risk of black ice nationwide because temperatures were still so low.</p>
        
            <p>Roading crews were putting grit on the roads as a precaution, but Waka Kotahi was also warning drivers to be aware of the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to snow and ice conditions, road users are advised to take extra care," Waka Kotahi said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said frosts were expected Tuesday morning, especially in the east of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday would see a southwesterly bringing showers to the bottom of the South Island and Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of the rest of the country will be a lot more clear," the MetService predicted.</p>
        
            <p>However, wind would be making things feel cooler.</p>
        
            <p>The lowest temperature on Tuesday morning was Mount Cook on -5.6C.</p>
