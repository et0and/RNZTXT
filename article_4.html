            <p>Armed police are guarding a house in Kaikohe after the town's second shooting in less than 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred about 12.20pm on Tawa Street, leaving a man bleeding heavily from what was believed to be a single gunshot wound to the leg.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Chris Fouhy of Northland police said the man was airlifted to WhangƒÅrei Hospital about 1.20pm in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>The injury was not life-threatening, he said.</p>
        
            <p>An armed officer was guarding the property as a precaution while the investigation continued.</p>
        
            <p>It was thought to be an isolated incident and the public are not at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Police were following possible leads, Fouhy said. It was not yet known if the shooting was gang-related.</p>
        
            <p>Fouhy said it was the second shooting in the area in less than 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, a man was shot in the neck with an air rifle in a rural area south of Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>He had been flown to Auckland Hospital for surgery and was also in a serious but stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Fouhy said he was "very lucky" the outcome was not worse.</p>
        
            <p>The two incidents were not related, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood the offender left the Tawa Street incident in a ute.</p>
        
            <p>About 1pm several police were seen travelling at speed towards State Highway 10 on the east coast.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to the Tawa Street shooting from around the Far North, including officers stationed at Waitangi for Treaty commemorations.</p>
