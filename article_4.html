        <h2>Live: Hope Canterbury fire can be halted as weather cools, rain forecast</h2>
        <p>
Efforts are ramping back up to fight the Castle Hill blaze, which remains uncontained and out of control. Audio

            <p>Firefighters in Canterbury will get some much-needed help from Mother Nature on Friday, with cooler temperatures and light showers forecast for the region.</p>
        
            <p>Nine helicopters and three planes were due back in the air as efforts to fight a massive Castle Hill scrub fire ramped back up.</p>
        
            <p>An overnight crew of firefighters fought the blaze from State Highway 73 as it was deemed too dangerous to go off road in the dark. Fire and Emergency on Friday morning said the blaze did not enter the village overnight, but remained uncontained.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday night, firefighters encouraged Castle Hill residents to leave their homes as the 535-hectare scrub fire burned.</p>
        
            <p>"The winds are a lot lighter than we saw yesterday, and I think we are looking at cooler temperatures that are speeding up and across the country," MetService meteorologist John Law told Morning Report on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"And we should hopefully see - as we get through towards the afternoon - a bit more in the way of cloud building up and the chance of some showers to come through as well, hopefully helping things be a little bit more containable and a little bit more bearable across the region."</p>
        
            <p>A community meeting was scheduled for 1pm Friday at the Tawera Memorial Hall in Springfield in case people were still evacuated at that point.</p>
