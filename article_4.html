            <p>A national emergency exercise has been carried out at Parliament with the aim of improving New Zealand's ability to respond to and recover from a significant Alpine Fault earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>Exercise RÅ« Whenua comes under the National Civil Defence Emergency Management exercise programme.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence said the exercises would improved Civil Defence's ability to respond to and recover from emergencies.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't predict when an earthquake will happen. But scientific research indicates there is a 75 percent probability of an Alpine Fault earthquake greater than magnitude 7 happening in the next 50 years. And there is a 4 out of 5 chance that it will be a magnitude 8+ event."</p>
        
            <p>Over the last 8000 years, the Alpine Fault has ruptured 27 times, the last significant quake on the Alpine Fault was in 1717.</p>
        
            <p>"The next severe earthquake on the Alpine Fault is likely to be within our lifetime or our children's. This will need a coordinated multi-agency national response and include international support."</p>
        
            <p>NEMA director civil defence emergency management John Price said the exercises would be done over three dates.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about seeing where the gaps are, where we need to improve and how we can improve ourselves to provide and keep our communities safe in the future."</p>
        
            <p>This first exercise was about activating the National Crisis Management Centre, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The next exercise, which would be carried out on 26 June, would look at a scenario two weeks following an Alpine Fault rupture and what problems had not been addressed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A third exercise would happen on 10 July.</p>
