            <p>Almost 300 Gore residents have signed a petition calling for the district council to revoke its appointment of former chief executive Stephen Parry to an interim role.</p>
        
            <p>Parry had butted heads with Gore mayor Ben Bell since the then-23-year-old ousted long-time incumbent Tracy Hicks in October last year.</p>
        
            <p>Only a month after Bell put on the mayoral chains, the pair were in mediation and no longer speaking.</p>
        
            <p>The fallout from their fractured relationship led to a group of rogue councillors calling on Bell to quit, an aborted vote of no confidence in the young mayor and a petition from the public calling for Parry to resign in response, as well as a protest outside a council meeting.</p>
        
            <p>A mediation process took place in June which resulted in a surprise apology from Bell and his councillors to Parry.</p>
        
            <p>Parry then announced his intention to resign in September after more than two decades in the role.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands that was as a result of the mediation agreement.</p>
        
            <p>But last month, a majority of councillors appointed Parry to take on an interim chief executive's role until a replacement was found.</p>
        
            <p>Bell was not among those in favour.</p>
        
            <p>It had resulted in another petition against Parry and that would now be presented to the council at next week's meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The petition called on the council to decline to appoint Parry as interim chief executive and rescind, revoke or replace the decisions which led to the appointment on 10 October.</p>
        
            <p>"The motion doesn't reflect community feeling," the petition said.</p>
        
            <p>"Confidence of ratepayers is lacking.</p>
        
            <p>"The chief executive, Stephen Parry, has made clear via public media statements, his unwillingness to work with elected members, particularly mayor Ben Bell."</p>
        
            <p>A report to the council accompanying the petition was prepared by Parry.</p>
        
            <p>It said the petition contained a total of 313 signatories, with 18 being invalid due to having an address outside of the Gore District.</p>
        
            <p>"Mayor Ben Bell provided to the interim chief executive, a hard copy version of a petition on Monday 6 November 2023 and requested it be presented to the 21 November 2023 Council meeting," Parry's report said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is understood, and has been advised to staff, that the petition organiser, Mr Hayden McIntyre, is to present this petition."</p>
        
            <p>The council would also consider a report outlining the terms of reference for the appointment of Parry's long-term replacement.</p>
        
            <p>A sub-committee - consisting of Bell, deputy mayor Keith Hovell and councillors Neville Phillips and Andy Fraser - would oversee and make a recommendation on a preferred appointee for the vacant chief executive role.</p>
