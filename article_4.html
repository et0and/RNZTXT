            <p>The New Zealand Defence Force is moving ahead with a $490 million expansion and upgrade of housing at its military training base in Waiouru.</p>
        
            <p>The first $75m stage of the project will 50 new homes for military families on newly developed land in partnership with local iwi Ngāti Rangi.</p>
        
            <p>The Defence Force (NZDF) says it needs 211 homes to support military and civilian personnel at Waiouru Military Camp.</p>
        
            <p>It plans to modernise a further 161 homes in a second stage.</p>
        
            <p>The poor state of Defence Force housing has made headlines in recent years, with homes described as cold and damp.</p>
        
            <p>NZDF General Manager of Estate Strategy Phil Gurnsey, said the Waiouru camp needs warm, dry, modern housing to attract and keep personnel in Waiouru and look after their wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the next 25 years we plan to spend around $490m on our Waiouru housing estate including new builds, upgrades, maintenance and utilities costs in support of NZDF operations."</p>
        
            <p>Gurnsey said the housing programme would also provide the flexibility to post regular force members and their whānau to Waiouru at short notice.</p>

            <p>Waiouru has been base for an army training area since World War II. According to Defence Force information, the military camp hosts about 500 civilian and military staff.</p>
        
            <p>All Army soldiers complete 16 weeks of initial basic training in Waiouru.</p>
        
            <p>The training area includes weapons ranges, military manoeuvre and live fire training areas, an urban training facility and a helicopter landing area. The facilities support all three Defence Force Services as well as other Government agencies and international partners.</p>
        
            <p>Ruapehu Mayor Weston Kirton and Ruapehu District Council chief executive Clive Manley have met with senior Defence Force personnel to discuss supporting the development plan.</p>
        
            <p>"By taking a proactive approach we can help ensure that any large-scale development proceeds smoothly, complies with legislative requirements, and are completed on time and within budget," Manley said.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council's relationship with the Defence Force reflects a long history of cooperation and mutual assistance.</p>
        
            <p>Gurnsey said the cooperation between the NZDF and the council would ensure Waiouru remained a thriving and supportive environment for both military personnel and local residents.</p>
