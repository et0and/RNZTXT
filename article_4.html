            <p>A police standoff that lasted for more than eight hours in the Christchurch suburb of Avonhead has been resolved tonight.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been at a property on Beatrice Place since early this afternoon where a person, alone inside, was believed to be armed.</p>
        
            <p>It follows reports they received that expressed concern for the person's welfare.</p>
        
            <p>Some nearby residents were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Police superintendent Lane Todd said one person was in custody and no one was injured in the episode.</p>
        
            <p>An investigation was under way and police cordons would remain in the area, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank the residents of Beatrice Place and the surrounding area for their patience while we worked to resolve this matter safely.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd also like to acknowledge the work of police staff in attendance, including the police negotiation team who worked for over eight hours to achieve this negotiated resolution safely for all parties."</p>
