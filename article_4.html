            <p>Wellingtonians are being warned of a scam email coming from the Wellington Cable Car after its website domain was hacked.</p>
        
            <p>The email pretends to be from NZ Transport Agency / Waka Kotahi (NZTA), telling people who receive the email their vehicle registration is due, and links to a fake website that asks for payment.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi urged those who received the email to check their rego expiry date on the label in their vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA said it always puts expiry dates in its emails, and if there isn't one it is likely a scam.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council said the Cable Car has dealt with the scam and alerted everyone who received the emails.</p>
        
            <p>In a newsletter to its subscribers, the Cable Car said its database was hacked by unauthorised parties who sent the spam email.</p>
        
            <p>"Upon discovering this breach, we acted immediately to stop the attack and have implemented additional security measures to further protect our systems," it said. "Please rest assured that we are undertaking a thorough review and investigation to understand how this happened and to prevent anything like this from occurring in the future."</p>
        
            <p>The Cable Car advised subscribers to not click any links or provide any personal information, if they had received any suspicious emails claiming to be from the Wellington Cable Car or Waka Kotahi.</p>
