            <p>A veranda on a portable home has collapsed onto two volunteer firefighters and three locals in the small Hawke's Bay settlement of Te Pohue.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the firefighters were helping a neighbour in a private capacity to erect a portable home at around 9am Thursday when the mechanism lowering the veranda into place broke, causing the structure to fall on them.</p>
        
            <p>Two people have serious injuries and three have moderate injuries. One of the injured has been flown to Hawke's Bay Hospital in Hastings.</p>

            <p>Several fire crews from nearby districts were called to the scene on Ohurakura Road in Te Pohue, but have since departed.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said two of the five are local volunteer firefighters and they are supporting them and their families.</p>

            <p>A local told RNZ they heard sirens and had seen a portable home being delivered earlier on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Backpacker Chantal Rikse was camping nearby when the sirens went off.</p>
        
            <p>"Several cars came and fire department cars, and some ambulances came.. and there was even a helicopter," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst told RNZ she was devastated to hear about the accident.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts go out to those hurt and their families. Te Pohue is a very close-knit community and I know they will all be supporting each other. I do hope those injured recover as quickly as possible," she said.</p>
