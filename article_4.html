            <p>Protesters at the University of Otago "crossed the line" this afternoon when they damaged the clock tower on campus today, vice-chancellor Grant Robertson says.</p>
        
            <p>The protesters want the university to stop collaborating with Israeli universities and join the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said they were monitoring the event when they were told the clock tower had been damaged at about 1pm.</p>
        
            <p>A door of the clock tower had been damaged, the Otago Daily Times has reported.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the clock tower was locked down as a precaution and one person had been arrested over the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Charges will be "considered", police said.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson said in a statement that peaceful protest had been a long tradition at the university.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that students and staff are able to express their views and protest within the law.</p>
        
            <p>"However, there is no place for vandalism or disorderly actions, particularly when the safety of others including staff and students is put at risk. This protest crossed that line. This is against the kaupapa of our community and is not welcome."</p>
