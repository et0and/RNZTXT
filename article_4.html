            <p>Police have asked Taranaki schools to warn students about internet safety, after a student was extorted for money after sending nude photographs.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they contacted Taranaki intermediate and high schools after a young person was caught-up in a "sextortion-style online scam".</p>
        
            <p>The incident is being investigated by police.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the schools were asked by police to send out a message warning students and parents.</p>
        
            <p>"Students are being contacted via social media platforms (Instagram, Tik Tok, Snapchat, etc). A picture of either a naked male or female will be posted to them, with a message to send a nude back," the police message said.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the student sends a nude back, they are told that if they don't pay money, the picture will be posted on their family members' social media accounts.</p>
        
            <p>"Please be on the lookout, and if you become aware of this please contact the police."</p>
        
            <p>Police would not say which school had reported an incident, but referred RNZ to a press released issued in February regarding "sextortion".</p>
        
            <p>In the release, Detective Sergeant Dan Wright defined sextortion as "online blackmail that involves someone persuading you to send them sexual images or videos of yourself and then threatening to share them with others unless you pay them money, agree to send more photos or even move funds for them".</p>
        
            <p>Police received 618 reports of sextortion between 2020 and the end of 2022, and of these, 54 percent of victims were males under the age of 25.</p>
        
            <p>The youngest reported victims were two 10-year-old children.</p>
        
            <p>"This is organised crime committed by offenders who often pose as someone similar in age to the person they are talking with," Wright said.</p>
        
            <p>"They will rely on threats and aggressive behaviour to get you to send them what they want - it is important to remember you are not to blame and there is help available."</p>
        
            <p>Inglewood High School principal and Taranaki Secondary Schools Principals' Association chairperson Rosey Mabin said inappropriate cellphone use was widespread, and not just among teenagers.</p>
        
            <p>"Adults do silly things on their cellphones, too," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Schools were often the place where these issues came to light, Mabin said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes we end up having to unravel situations that are not of our making, or haven't happened in school time."</p>
        
            <p>Parents had a role to play in keeping their kids safe online, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important that parents are actively involved in monitoring their teenager's use of their cellphones, and what they're doing on various social media platforms.</p>
        
            <p>"How you do that is not necessarily straightforward, but there are ways -- and I know lots of parents who do their level best."</p>
