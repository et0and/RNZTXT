        <h2>Do New Plymouth's otters really need a new $1.5m home?</h2>
        <p>
Brooklands Zoo is planning a major makeover - but not everyone is impressed with the cost.

            <p>New Plymouth ratepayers are being asked to choose between closing the much-loved Brooklands Zoo or funding up to $9 million of upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the work was required to meet regulatory requirements - but for some, a $1.5 million-plus redesign of the otter habitat is a step too far.</p>

            <p>Brooklands Zoo's collection includes exotic mammals such as a capybara, capuchin monkeys and meerkats, as well as exotic and native birds, farmyard animals and a range of exotic and native reptiles and amphibians. It includes a total of 30 species and 90 individuals.</p>
        
            <p>It is the only free zoo in the country and attracts about 135,000 visitors a year, particularly families with young children.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are being asked - as part of consultations on its long-term plan - if council should go ahead with a full suite of zoo upgrades, choose just some of them or close the zoo altogether.</p>
        
            <p>The zoo is proposing some habitats be at eye-level or higher, so that visitors don't look down on the animals - as is the case with its otter family.</p>

            <p>That was too much for councillor Gordon Brown.</p>
        
            <p>"The otters, bless them - $1.5 million to re-house four of them? Please.</p>
        
            <p>"And if you asked every child that came to the zoo, 'What's your favourite animal?' I suspect the otters would be a long way down the list."</p>
        
            <p>
The Brooklands otters are happy enough without new $1.5m digs, says Gordon Brown.

</p>
        
            <p>Brown did not want the zoo to close and was pleased a cheaper, $5.7 million option for upgrades had been included in the consultation document - but he did not think the otters had a problem with their habitat.</p>
        
            <p>"Well, the latest compliance and guidelines nationally are that in zoos we mustn't look down on animals - we must look at them somehow, almost as if they are equals at eye-level.</p>
        
            <p>"So, you've got these good folk beside me who are enjoying watching the otters, fair enough. I bet they don't realise it's going to cost $1.5 million just so we can look at the otters at eye-level."</p>

            <p>Brooklands Zoo is a member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, it said Brooklands Zoo did not have to change its otter habitat, but there was a move internationally away from such pit-style enclosures.</p>
        
            <p>"Exhibit designs with depressed pits, where humans view the animals from above, can in some cases create an attitude of dominance and otherness as humans literally 'look down' on the animals on display.</p>
        
            <p>"Some zoos and aquariums believe that seeing animals at eye level, without obstructions, can foster a stronger, more empathic connection between visitors and animals."</p>

Malte Boehmer says it's "hard to judge" if the otters are uncomfortable with their present abode.

            <p>But how did zoo visitors feel? Malte Boehmer was watching the otters at play.</p>
        
            <p>"Like for me, it doesn't feel odd to look from above because I feel like it gives you a pretty good overview of everything that's happening.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not too sure how the otters feel about that to be honest. If it's weird for them? It's hard to judge."</p>

Zoo visitor Cam Murray reckons money spent on an upgrade will be a good investment.

            <p>Cam Murray got it. "I can understand it, because otherwise all the time they're looking up and feeling people are being dominant over the top of them.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's a good idea to have to bring them up or reduce us down to the same level."</p>
        
            <p>He reckoned upgrading the zoo was money well-spent, regardless.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a weekday, not a weekend - and look at all the kids here - and these are visitors from Australia.</p>
        
            <p>"So, it's a good investment. I think we should keep it and if it requires upgrading so be it."</p>

            <p>University students Maddie Strachan and Isla Smale were not so sure there was a problem.</p>
        
            <p>"I had no idea it was frowned upon to look down upon on the otters. They don't seem bothered - they were more putting on a show before," said Isla.</p>
        
            <p>She was torn on the idea of a new display.</p>
        
            <p>"I guess if you could see them swimming if they had windows in the pool that would be pretty cool, but then you also get quite a good view from above because then you can see all over and they don't seem to mind being looked down on."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the Ministry for Primary Industries said there was no legal requirement for zoo displays to be at eye level.</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth District Council's long-term plan has a proposed work programme of about $4 billion. If adopted, it would see residential rates rise on average by 9.9 per cent in the first year - or around $311 for the average residential property.</p>
        
            <p>Public consultation on the long-term plan ends on 19 April. Survey-style submissions can be made on the council website.</p>
        
            <p>Feedback is sought on:</p>
