            <p>The police union is hopeful the new Commissioner will be open to discussing the routine arming of officers.</p>
        
            <p>Richard Chambers was named as the new Police Commissioner on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police Association vice president Steve Watt told Morning Report he believed Chambers had indicated on Wednesday that he was open to having a conversation about officer's firearm access.</p>
        
            <p>The union has long advocated for routine arming of officers.</p>
        
            <p>Watt said an earlier survey should 68 percent of staff supported the move.</p>
        
            <p>"That's all we're aiming for is to have that conversation.</p>
        
            <p>"I envisage it will start with pistols on the hip."</p>
        
            <p>Officers currently have access to firearms that were kept locked in patrol cars.</p>
