            <p>Hutt City Council is draining some of its pools previously associated with cryptosporidiosis after a spate of gastric illness across the Greater Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>Cryptosporidiosis is a stomach bug that can cause diarrhoea, stomach cramps, and vomiting.</p>
        
            <p>As of 21 March, there were 35 cases of gastric illness in the Greater Wellington region, with 18 of those cases being people who had used a pool or had contact with unwell people in their household who had used a pool.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday a Hutt City Council spokesperson said some cases in the outbreak were linked to the toddlers pool at Te Ngaengae and the Huia Hydro Pool.</p>
        
            <p>Those pools had been treated and reopened.</p>
        
            <p>But a decision had since been made to close some of the pools again.</p>
        
            <p>"To prioritise the health and wellbeing of the community, we have gone a step further than required and made the decision to close the toddler and shallow leisure pools at Te Ngaengae and the Huia Street Hydrotherapy Pool so they can be fully drained and refilled with fresh water," said Head of Aquatics Iain Brown.</p>
        
            <p>The Te Ngaengae pools were expected to reopen on Saturday morning and the Huia Hydrotherapy Pool by Monday morning.</p>

            <p>"We continue to work closely with Public Health, who are satisfied with our response and have not directed any further action at this time," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>Six pools have been identified and contacted following the cryptosporidiosis outbreak according to local officials.</p>
        
            <p>Medical Officer of Health for the National Public Health Service Central Region, Jill McKenzie, said Health New Zealand has contacted pools "where information shows that a case may have had contact with the pool during the expected time it takes to get sick after being exposed or during their infectious period."</p>
        
            <p>"Pools should follow the New Zealand Standard for Pool Water Quality guidance for response to concerns around potential cryptosporidium contamination," said McKenzie.</p>
        
            <p>"Health New Zealand also recommends there is visible signage in the pool complex reminding swimmers of how to prevent the spread of crypto and other bugs while using the facility."</p>
        
            <p>She said cryptosporidiosis was particularly affecting preschool children, school-aged children, their parents, and whānau.</p>
        
            <p>McKenzie said people should follow Health NZ's advice to stop the spread of cryptosporidiosis and avoid the illness:</p>
        
            <p>The biggest health risk from crypto was dehydration, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If someone in your whānau develops crypto symptoms make sure they keep their fluids up, and seek help early if you are concerned, particularly for babies and young children."</p>
        
            <p>People could also contact Healthline for advice, McKenzie said.</p>
