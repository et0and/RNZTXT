            <p>Police have located the body of a person who died after crashing into a Bay of Plenty river last week.</p>
        
            <p>A vehicle left State Highway 2 and went down a bank into Ōpōtiki's Waioeka River, around 2.5km south of the Tauranga Bridge, on 4 October.</p>
        
            <p>"Search and rescue teams, including a boat, helicopter and Coastguard jet skis conducted sweeps of the river and riverbank on Friday," senior sergeant Richard Miller said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, the person and vehicle were unable to be located."</p>
        
            <p>Police and rescue teams had been on standby ever since, "ready to respond once the river conditions were right to safely deploy a team to the area", Miller said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"Today, the river conditions had cleared sufficiently and Police along with search and rescue teams, local jet boat operators, and the Police National Dive Squad responded, searching the river.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle was located at about 12:05pm, around 400 metres from the original crash site.</p>
        
            <p>"The victim was located deceased inside the vehicle and has since been successfully recovered."</p>
        
            <p>Police were pleased they had been able to reunite whānau with their loved one, Miller said.</p>
        
            <p>Inquiries into the circumstances of the crash were ongoing.</p>
