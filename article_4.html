            <p>Dunedin city councillors say the area's new hospital is under threat, but they are standing united in its defence.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of the new Dunedin Hospital project, which is already underway, is understood to have ballooned and Health New Zealand commissioner Lester Levy has said it is one of many projects under review.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin mayor Jules Radich said no proposal for cuts has yet been put forward, but clinicians have spoken out in alarm at the possibility.</p>
        
            <p>He said as a show of unity, Dunedin's city councillors are today joining him in calling for the project to proceed without clinical cuts.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been very clear that we expect the government to honour its commitment and build the hospital our communities need. Any facility or service cuts at this stage in the project would only deliver a false economy, and the people of Dunedin and the lower South Island would pay the price," Radich said.</p>
        
            <p>"That is completely unacceptable, and we are united with clinician representatives and residents of the region in our determination to see this project delivered as promised.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that sends a powerful message to everyone - including our city's residents - about our commitment to this cause and our readiness to reignite a campaign if required."</p>
        
            <p>Radich said that suggestions that short-stay beds might be lost from the Emergency Department was of particular concern.</p>
        
            <p>"They are what will help get ED wait times under control and cutting them will of course do the opposite."</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ head of infrastructure delivery Blake Lepper said Health New Zealand remained committed to delivering a Dunedin hospital that provided the health services needed for the local community, and represented value for money.</p>
        
            <p>He said the project was currently receiving pricing for the above-ground construction of the Inpatient Building, and it was important that it continued to monitor and manage costs.</p>
        
            <p>Lepper said it was continuing to work towards providing the best possible outcome for patients, staff, and the community.</p>
