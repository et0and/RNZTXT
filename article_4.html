        <h2>'Critical infrastructure': Regional airlines need govt funding - operator</h2>
        <p>
Sounds Air says all regional airlines are "increasingly desperate" and need backing from the government - and Shane Jones has floated the idea of a dedicated fund. Audio

            <p>Regional operator Sounds Air is canning its Wellington to Westport route from the end of the year in the face of tough economic headwinds.</p>
        
            <p>Managing director Andrew Crawford said in his 21 years at the helm, nothing compared to the post-Covid-19 financial challenges. He backed a call from another regional airline, Barrier Air, which earlier this week said small airlines needed some help from the government.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said there might be a need for a dedicated fund to help the airlines survive.</p>
        
            <p>However, if a case was established he would have to convince Cabinet to accept it.</p>

            <p>Sounds Air said unlike Air New Zealand, it did not receive government funding - and had twice applied for funds intended for the regions but missed out both times.</p>
        
            <p>A year ago, the business had approached key people in all its regional destinations asking for more support in the face of "tough times".</p>
        
            <p>It also met with several ministers and made a failed application to the Regional Infrastructure Fund - leaving him frustrated and angry.</p>
        
            <p>Crawford said if the airline did not meet the fund's criteria "who would?"</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand, rail and roading all attracted government funding as "critical infrastructure", however, regional airlines were forced to seek private shareholders.</p>
        
            <p>"And it's an increasingly desperate market."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand was pulling out of some regional routes - meaning airlines such as Sounds Air were even more important.</p>
        
            <p>"Don't forget the people that fly these routes, it's healthcare, business, education, government. It isn't holidaymakers, this is critical infrastructure."</p>
        
            <p>There were at least 30 countries around the world that stepped in to support regional airlines which could be done in a number of ways.</p>
        
            <p>"For some reason we just don't want to do it in this country."</p>
        
            <p>Obstacles facing the airline since the pandemic included: the cost of fuel, the exchange rate, the supply chain and the labour market.</p>
        
            <p>"But the big ones are the fuel, maintenance and the dollar."</p>

            <p>Jones said there was no doubt regional airlines contributed to regional productivity and improved resilience for communities.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no desire to get into a war of words with the owners of regional airlines," he said, adding that Air New Zealand got backing because it was effectively government-owned.</p>
        
            <p>He intended asking officials to look into the merits of establishing a fund similar to the $30 million kitty set aside to help support coastal shipping services via the National Land Transport Programme.</p>
        
            <p>Jones said he came close during 2019-2020 while the Provincial Growth Fund was being set up to having some money set aside for smaller districts to "enjoy aviation connectivity" for a few years.</p>
        
            <p>It didn't happen but "we are at a point where a dedicated fund could be necessary".</p>
        
            <p>Crawford had a message for Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, whom he hoped would be supportive, given his career running Air New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the government should talk to regional aviation as a group urgently and work out what's going to happen. ... This can't go on and I'm not doing it anymore."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if his Cabinet colleagues might be sympathetic to the possibility of a helping hand for regional airlines, Jones said it was like all areas of government spending - there was only so much money to be shared out in a very difficult economic climate.</p>
