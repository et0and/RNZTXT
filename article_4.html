        <h2>Two Wairarapa towns to enter water restrictions</h2>
        <p>
From Monday, Featherston and Greytown will have to comply with level 2 water restrictions which will mean a ban on sprinklers and irrigation systems for residential households.

Residents are able to water their garden, but a handheld hose is required and must not be left unattended.

            <p>Dry weather has forced two towns in the Wairarapa into water restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>From Monday, Featherston and Greytown will have to comply with level two water restrictions which will mean a ban on sprinklers and irrigation systems for residential households.</p>
        
            <p>The South Wairarapa District Council said the decision was made due to increasing demand on water over the past fortnight and the impact that dry weather has had on the Waiohine River levels.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are able to water their garden - but a handheld hose is required and must not be left unattended.</p>
        
            <p>Council spokesperson Stefan Corbett said the restrictions have been put in place to reduce the risk of having tighter rules down the track.</p>
        
            <p>He said despite water restrictions only applying to residential properties, local businesses should also be taking steps to reduce their water usage.</p>
        
            <p>"If we all do our bit, we can hopefully avoid further restrictions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Small changes such as taking shorter showers, not running the tap while brushing your teeth and only doing full loads of washing can all make a real difference".</p>
