            <p>Surf Life Saving is warning people to think about what they take to the beach on a windy day.</p>
        
            <p>It says significant numbers of beachgoers have been swept offshore by strong winds and surf, particularly on the East Coast of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>High winds have hit much of the country the last few days.</p>
        
            <p>Life saving manager Andy Kent said many rescues have involved large recreational items.</p>
        
            <p>"Pool toys cause us issues as people are going down there and are caught unawares</p>
        
            <p>"But it's other things too with stand-up paddleboards and someone's got a brand new Christmas present, and he's not that confident on it.</p>
        
            <p>"Paddleboards are perfectly okay for beach conditions but if you don't know what you're doing and you fall out, you can get blown off sort of out of your depth."</p>
        
            <p>Kent said people who do get swept away should keep holding on to their item, to help stay afloat.</p>
        
            <p>But he said it is best to keep inflatable pool toys, like lilos, at home.</p>
        
            <p>"Blow up lilos, we see all sorts. Our amazing volunteers right across the motu are well experienced in this sort of stuff and they see all sorts of stuff.</p>
        
            <p>"And, pool toys are definitely not for the beach."</p>
        
            <p>Eleven people were rescued on Christmas and Boxing Day, and 31,000 people have been warned of the dangers in the past two days.</p>
