            <p>A Christchurch man is facing multiple charges in relation to intimate visual recordings of young women without their knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had fielded complaints from several young women living in the upper Riccarton and Ilam areas, with offending believed to have happened since last year.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Tania Jellyman said a 56-year-old man was facing 16 charges, including five of making intimate visual recordings and seven of burglary.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank the young women who shared their story - they have been instrumental in helping us identify other victims," Jellyman said.</p>
        
            <p>"To date, the charges of making intimate visual recordings relate to five separate incidents, and we are endeavouring to identify further victims.</p>
        
            <p>"While in one case, neighbours alerted the occupants to a suspicious person lurking outside a window, most of the victims appear to have been unaware of the filming."</p>
        
            <p>On 3 March, investigators, who were speaking to the man on an unrelated matter, realised his description reportedly matched that of the man who had reportedly been seen filming through a resident's window.</p>
        
            <p>"These events have been disturbing for the victims, who are in no way at fault for what occurred.</p>
        
            <p>"They are alarmed at what has happened to them.</p>
        
            <p>"We are providing them with support and a Police Liaison Officer is keeping them up to date with developments in the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"The young women involved have shown incredible bravery, which has allowed police to lay these charges."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were reviewing items of interest and more charges were likely.</p>
        
            <p>The charged man is due to appear in Christchurch District Court on 13 May.</p>
        
            <p>Police said anyone who noticed suspicious behaviour should call 111 immediately, or 105 if it was after the fact.</p>
