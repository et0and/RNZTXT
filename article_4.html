        <h2>New guide for assessing earthquake strength of concrete floors released</h2>
        <p>
It "seek to incorporate state-of-the-art approaches for assessment of concrete buildings drawn from local and international research, and from international assessment guidance", said a summary.

            <p>A new guide for assessing the earthquake strength of concrete floors in multistorey buildings has been released, aimed at helping with strengthening them better.</p>
        
            <p>It makes more than a dozen changes to guidance rushed in after the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake damaged many buildings in Wellington, often cracking multiple floors.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand buildings have a lot of precast hollowcore concrete floors, and Kaikōura exposed hidden weaknesses in them.</p>
        
            <p>As authorities grasped why floors fell in at Statistics House in Wellington, they realised they faced big gaps in engineering knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>They hurried in stopgap changes in 2018, to improve the assessment and retrofit of buildings; in the meantime, seismic engineers set about a project, ReCast Floors.</p>
        
            <p>"In contrast to most other deficiencies found in existing buildings, little international research is available regarding the adequacy of existing precast floors," said a ReCast project report in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Assessments carried on according to 2018's guidance, revealing in 2022 that about 150 buildings in the capital [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/467993/scores-of-buildings-share-same-floor-weakness-as-education-ministry-s-office</p>
        
            <p>shared a design flaw] in their precast hollowcore floors that had led to a government office block being evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>The new guidance now supersedes what engineers called 'the Yellow Chapter' from 2018. It runs to 258 pages.</p>
        
            <p>"Errors and internal inconsistencies identified in the November 2018 version have been corrected."</p>
        
            <p>Engineers assessing many types of buildings are expected to use it.</p>
        
            <p>The committee behind the guidance said it wanted to help make it easier to decide on retrofitting or not, and how to do it.</p>
        
            <p>Since Kaikōura, some projects have worked but others have foisted heavy costs on building or apartment owners.</p>
        
            <p>"It is increasingly evident that major - and sometimes controversial - issues can arise," said the new guidance.</p>
        
            <p>This could even be as basic as "deciding whether the retrofit is needed ... and to what extent".</p>
        
            <p>The committee aimed to help retrofits where necessary, "while limiting unnecessary disruption, demolitions and carbon impacts, [and] promoting continued use or re-use of buildings".</p>
        
            <p>Retrofit studies had been limited, and the new research had brought to light much more about how to use or combine "selective" interventions - even "selective weakening" so that one overly-strong part of a building did not put pressure on the others - to make strengthening the floors work.</p>
        
            <p>More new guidance is due later this year on geotechnical assessments and unreinforced and reinforced masonry.</p>
        
            <p>The new guidance on concrete floors does not apply to buildings being assessed under legislation covering earthquake-prone buildings. The government last year extended by four years the various deadlines on building owners needing to strengthen these buildings.</p>
