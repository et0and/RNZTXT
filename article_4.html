            <p>Flights have had to be delayed after an evacuation in Auckland International Airport's control tower on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The alarm was triggered just before 2pm, restricting aircraft movements in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The air navigation service provider, Airways New Zealand, apologised to passengers for the delays.</p>
        
            <p>It said five planes were able to arrive or depart during the 35-minute evacuation, but a number of others experienced delays.</p>
        
            <p>Management of air traffic was diverted to the Christchurch air traffic control centre during the evacuation.</p>
        
            <p>It said there was no fire and was investigating what triggered the alarm.</p>
