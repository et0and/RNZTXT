        <h2>Drug testing and wet tents as Rhythm and Vines festival kicks off</h2>
        <p>
Record rain hasn't dampened the spirits of thousands of festival goers, and Drug Foundation staff say they're "slammed" by the numbers they're testing.

            <p>The Drug Foundation says people are lining up to have their substances tested on the first day of Rhythm and Vines.</p>
        
            <p>Drug Foundation spokesperson Hayden Eastmond-Mein said their drug checkers at the Gisborne festival are at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Eastmond-Mein said there is a limited number of spectrometer testing devices available which means they need to be shared around other New Year's festivals.</p>
        
            <p>Last year they tested roughly 1000 samples at the festival and they expect this year to be just as busy, with more than 26,000 attendees expected.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been really busy at [Rhythm and Vines] which is awesome, this is our first day testing, we're testing right throughout the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"Our people are seeing a lot of people through and they are slammed which is what we want to see," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said their team of 12 will be at the three-day festival until 5pm each day.</p>
        
            <p>Over 17,000 campers are checked in and ready for Rhythm and Vines' first day despite record rainfall.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne saw a month's worth of rain and high winds on Boxing Day, the region's wettest day since records began in 1937.</p>
        
            <p>Rhythm and Vines' head of marketing, Kyle Bell, said the festival asked campers to delay their arrival until after 12pm yesterday to allow the ground to dry up.</p>
        
            <p>"A couple of days out the ground was a little bit soggy we just wanted to make sure people took their time coming in."</p>
        
            <p>He said luckily the high winds they have been experiencing helped to dry the ground, leaving festival-goers with a solid patch to pitch their tents later that day.</p>
        
            <p>Bell said the weather is looking promising for the expected 25,000 people who have purchased tickets to the three-day festival.</p>
