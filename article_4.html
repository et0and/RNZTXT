            <p>A boy who was injured at a motocross event in Auckland over the weekend has died.</p>
        
            <p>Eli Hankins was airlifted to hospital on Sunday with serious head trauma after taking part in a club day at Pukekohe Motorcycle Club.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the boy was 12-years-old.</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed he died at Auckland City Hospital late on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>A Give-a-little donation page has been set up by the Pukekohe Motorcycle Club with more than $8000 already raised.</p>
        
            <p>The page paid tribute to the young rider and was set up "in the hopes that we can alleviate the financial pressure and responsibilities of everyday life as Eli's family come to terms with the loss of their much loved, moto mad little boy."</p>
        
            <p>"The MX world is one big family - it's what makes our sport so special so we hope this page helps send that special support to Eli's family," it read.</p>
