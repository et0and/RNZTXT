            <p>Porirua mayor Anita Baker says an initiative to stop students fighting at the city centre railway station is off to a good start.</p>
        
            <p>Three safety officers, known as navigators, began patrolling Porirua station on Monday during peak hours.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said while it might only be day two of the pilot, people were already feeling safer.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot has three community safety officers patrolling the station from 7am-9am, and from 3.30pm-5.30pm for the next six months, funded by the Ministry of Social Development.</p>
        
            <p>Baker hoped to secure more funding to keep the pilot going past the initial six months.</p>
        
            <p>Several groups are involved in the project, including police, Partners Porirua and Piri'anga Alofa Pacific and Community Services.</p>
        
            <p>The project came about after secondary schools wrote to the mayor and the council's chief executive about their concerns around fights breaking out at the station.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said the fighting had affected several schools, and some of the fights had been between students from different schools.</p>
        
            <p>Partners Porirua contract services manager John Lafaele said it was not just current students, but also students who have recently left school who were involved.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the fights seemed to have been organised and planned online.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been working really closely with the police, city council and other really key stakeholders to ensure that we have a community response to pushing back on that type of activity," he said.</p>

Caroline Mareka says commuters are enthusiastic about the initiative.

            <p>Senior lead for Piri'anga Alofa Pacific and Community Services Caroline Mareko said the navigators had received a positive response from the community, and commuters were happy to see them on the platform.</p>
        
            <p>Navigator Reuben Baker said while patrolling the station they had had people come up to them to thank them for keeping them safe.</p>
        
            <p>Fellow navigator Bronsin Ikurere said so far they had had a quiet week at the station and he hoped their presence was acting as a deterrent.</p>
