            <p>The chief executive of a retired Auckland eye surgeon's workplace says Philip Polkinghorne frequently fell asleep at meetings in the year before his wife's death and on one occasion, appeared aggressive.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne is on trial for murdering Pauline Hanna in 2021 and staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>He has previously pleaded guilty to methamphetamine use and possessing a pipe.</p>
        
            <p>Former chief executive of Auckland Eye, Deborah Boyd, told the High Court at Auckland Polkinghorne was disengaged at board meetings, often seeming to be asleep, through 2020.</p>
        
            <p>At a shareholder meeting in 2021, where Polkinghorne attended online, Boyd said he was standing, and appeared agitated, hyperactive and aggressive.</p>
        
            <p>"We were in the Auckland Eye boardroom and he was attending via Zoom," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was just extremely agitated, often up on his feet, not his usual self really, quite agitated and aggressive in the language he was using."</p>
        
            <p>"Almost hyperactive behaviour," Boyd said.</p>
        
            <p>She said several of the other directors commented about Polkinghorne's behaviour and that she had not seen him act in that way before.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd just be in the middle of a board meeting or shareholder meetings and you'd just notice that he'd dozed off at times and wasn't participating in the meeting," Boyd said.</p>
        
            <p>"He appeared to be, I would say, asleep, not engaged in what was happening.</p>
        
            <p>"Certainly his eyes were shut and he wasn't participating in the conversation."</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's Pip McNabb asked Boyd about the methamphetamine pipe found in retinal laser room at Auckland Eye in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>It had been found by a nurse and was handed in to Auckland Eye's operations manager Tracey Molloy.</p>
        
            <p>The pipe was thrown in the bin, before being recovered the next day when police were alerted.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Eye conducted their own investigation, including searching through CCTV footage to try and track who came and went from the room the pipe was found.</p>
        
            <p>While being questioned by Polkinghorne's defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC, Boyd admitted the rooms were not secured.</p>
        
            <p>"There would be nothing to prevent other staff, and or maintenance, and or cleaners having access to a consult room," Mansfield asked.</p>
        
            <p>He put to Boyd that there was no way of knowing who had been in and out of a room or who has used them, expect for name cards placed on room doors when specialists were using them.</p>
        
            <p>Boyd agreed.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield continued asking Boyd about a strategic planning day held by Auckland Eye, producing minutes that showed Polkinghorne's engagement during the meeting at parts which concerned him.</p>
        
            <p>"We can agree, can't we, that for the very bit that's relevant to Doctor Polkinghorne, there's a record that shows he's awake, alert and in fact registering his disagreement," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes," responded Boyd.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
