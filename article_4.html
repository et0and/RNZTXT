            <p>Security guards need legal powers to detain offenders while committing a crime, an industry group says.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday night a man was shot dead on Auckland's Ponsonby Road and the gunman, who had been refused entry into a bar, was later found dead in Taupō.</p>
        
            <p>Two security workers from the bar tried to help the man who was fatally shot.</p>
        
            <p>In April, groups of masked thieves with weapons attacked two jewellery stores in Auckland while customers were inside.</p>
        
            <p>Security Association chief executive Gary Morrison said security guards were increasingly facing hostile situations and needed more protective gear and powers.</p>
        
            <p>There had been an increase in verbal and physical aggression across most public-facing security roles, Morrison told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>It ranged from questioning and swearing, to threatening and assault, Morrison said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen that change in society, probably post Covid where people just have slightly different attitudes, they feel certainly a level of entitlement in some cases."</p>
        
            <p>He said the abuse was prevalent in hospitality, retail and crowd control situations at events.</p>
        
            <p>And the association was looking at stab-resistant vests and body cameras to minimise risks to guards. They were not cheap - more than $1000 - and would add to the cost of the security service delivery, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We do run the risk of overpricing services and losing work as well. That's a difficult balance."</p>
        
            <p>There was an increase in weapons being carried around, not necessarily guns but "if you look at the ram raid situation - machetes, knives [are] very, very common and they can be quite easily concealed".</p>
        
            <p>"That's a real concern because the security staff may not be aware of weapons that are being carried, so they have to be very careful and observant."</p>
        
            <p>Security guards had moved from the minimum wage to the living wage, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly not a high-paying role in most cases."</p>
        
            <p>Morrison said the association supported the coalition government's stance on being tough on crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Offenders committing the crime need to be aware that there are consequences."</p>
        
            <p>Security guards had minimal authority, and limited power to make arrests.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with our registrar, the Ministry of Justice and police with regards to having increased powers and certain functions, particularly around shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like the ability to detain offenders who are in the process of taking property, but only where we've got appropriate licensing and training to support that as well.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like them to be able to retrieve the property and detain those offenders, if it's safe to do so, pending arrival of police."</p>
        
            <p>Mealamu Security which looks after the Auckland suburb of Ōtāhuhu said deterrents were needed, not just proactive responses to disturbances.</p>
        
            <p>Its boss Luke Mealamu said a community approach was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing a lot of anti-social behaviour in regards to not only alcohol, but drugs in our community," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I do believe it's a community approach ... local rugby clubs, local boxing clubs, we're all pushing the vision of safe community, so that our kids can all walk the streets safe, without bumping into a group of men drinking on the corner."</p>
