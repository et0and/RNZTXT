            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries is making enquiries after a video of a teenager hitting and kicking a live octopus on a Bay of Plenty beach has emerged.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the video was posted to the boy's Instagram story. RNZ has opted not to publish the full footage.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry for Primary Industries said it had received complaints.</p>
        
            <p>"The behaviour in the video is unacceptable, and we will be making enquires."</p>
        
            <p>The police said they had also received an online report on 25 January regarding the video posted on Instagram, which appeared to show an octopus being beaten.</p>
        
            <p>Animal charity SAFE chief executive Debra Ashton told Checkpoint it was a "senseless, violent and deliberate attack on an innocent sea animal".</p>
        
            <p>Everyone she knew was sickened by the video including fishing groups who had been expressing their outrage online.</p>
        
            <p>The octopus had been punched forcefully up to eight times and then kicked "while his friends were cheering him on".</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't see what happened to the octopus afterwards but I do suspect that the animal died from the impacts of this attack ... there almost appeared to be some kind of heroism for what this young man was doing."</p>
        
            <p>It was an even more "tragic" incident to witness because it was clear the octopus was trying to escape, Ashton said.</p>
        
            <p>"I imagine the octopus suffered greatly."</p>
        
            <p>Ashton said SAFE had laid a formal complaint with the Ministry for Primary Industries.</p>
        
            <p>The Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher would be a good starting point for those who participated in the attack, Ashton said.</p>
        
            <p>Octopuses were sentient creatures and able to experience things, including pain.</p>
        
            <p>Ashton wanted some action although she acknowledged the offender was probably young and might end up being dealt with in the Youth Court.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged anyone who knew the perpetrators to get in touch with the MPI.</p>
        
            <p>People should also "man up" and call out any cruelty to animals.</p>
        
            <p>"Let's all take responsibility and when we see it we call it out."</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation declined to comment, and said it was a matter for the Ministry for Primary Industries.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the Tauranga Sport Fishing Club said they were aware of the video but did not believe the pair were affiliated with the club. The spokesperson said they would refer requests to the club's committee for comment.</p>
        
            <p>The SPCA has also been approached for comment.</p>
