        <h2>Wellington public transport: $134m shortfall in funding - council</h2>
        <p>
Wellington transport fares could go up - while bus, train and ferry services could be cut back - due to a lack of government investment, according to council claims.

            <p>Wellington transport fares could go up - while bus, train and ferry services could be cut back - due to a lack of government investment, according to council claims.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council estimates funding cuts in the government's National Land Transport Programme - released last week - have led to a $134 million shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>The government plans to spend $33 billion on transport in the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>But the Wellington council is not happy with the funding allocations in the programme. Chairperson Daran Ponter has written a letter to all local MPs and mayors in the region, claiming more than 40 of their transport infrastructure projects had seen declined funding.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said that this had happened with little to no explanation, and that their council was "surprised and disappointed" by the funding cut backs.</p>
        
            <p>He said that while they were still assessing the extent of the changes, they estimated a $134 million shortfall over the next three years.</p>
        
            <p>Ponter said the council could not cover any of the funding shortfall through increased rates, and would be considering cost-saving measures such as reducing school and ferry services, rationalising high cost/low patronage routes and further increasing fares.</p>
        
            <p>The letter included a list of the projects he claimed were now at risk.</p>
        
            <p>These included buying land for the new Melling Station site, seismic strengthening work for the Ngauranga Railway Station, business case work for new train carriages and a range of technology upgrades across the region.</p>
        
            <p>He said the council had been developing its draft Wellington Regional Public Transport Plan, which would now be put on hold while it reset its priorities due to the funding problems.</p>
        
            <p>The affected projects mentioned in the letter include:</p>
        
            <p>fleet electrification and competitive tending of bus services.</p>
