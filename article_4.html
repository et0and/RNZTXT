            <p>Police are searching for a man who broke into a West Auckland shop with a sledgehammer in broad daylight at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called to a shop near LynnMall in New Lynn at 11.30am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the man pulled a balaclava over his face, smashed the store's window, and stole cash.</p>
        
            <p>They said he ran through the carpark and into a waiting car, which was then seen running a red-light on Clark Street.</p>
        
            <p>The staff sheltered in the rear office and were unharmed.</p>
