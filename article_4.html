        <h2>New electrified train line creates a buzz among Pukekohe residents</h2>
        <p>
Auckland's most southern station now has a direct connection to the CBD.
</p>
        
            <p>Train commuters say they are delighted with the new electrified line in Pukekohe that connects Auckland's most southern station with the city's CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Pukekohe Station closed in 2022 for KiwiRail to electrify the rail line to Papakura and preparation work for the City Rail Link set to open in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Until today, those travelling from Pukekohe had to use a bus connection to Papakura in order to access Auckland's electric rail line network.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fantastic. I think it's it's great for for the greater South Auckland area," James, a passenger travelling to Pukekohe from Onehunga, said.</p>
        
            <p>"My wife here is a native of Pukekohe and we have old friends here so we we love to come down here."</p>
        
            <p>Opening day was not without teething issues though. James said some signalling issues on the line meant their trip had taken about an hour and a half.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless, he was pleased with the service.</p>

            <p>"It's a great encouragement for people just to hop on the train now and not having to to take a bus to Papakura. It's all the way through and a great encouragement to and with the circle line opening very shortly and to get to a lot more destinations very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's good for Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>Those sentiments were shared by one commuter from the neighbouring town of Waiuku.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's going to be a big thing for me with the congestion and the traffic going through on the motorway, it's hideous."</p>
        
            <p>Another commuter travelling from Pukekohe on Monday said she was relieved there was no longer a reliance on the bus connection to Papakura.</p>
        
            <p>"On Saturday I had to catch five to six vehicles on public transport.</p>
        
            <p>"This is going to be just brilliant, just being able to go straight through without even getting off and health wise it's easier just for me to get on a train and just go.</p>
        
            <p>"No more five to six buses. Just one train, woohoo."</p>
