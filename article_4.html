            <p>Water has now been restored to up to 500 properties in the Wellington suburb of Karori.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water earlier said its crews were responding to a burst water main on Monaghan Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>Two water tankers were arranged to provide drinking water to affected properties.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said residents could notice that their water appeared cloudy or had air pockets.</p>
        
            <p>People were advised to run a cold tap for a few minutes before using hot taps, dishwashers and washing machines to clear this.</p>
