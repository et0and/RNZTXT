            <p>While free tickets will be available at the gates throughout the festival, visitors are encouraged to book online in advance to save time at the entrances.</p>

            <p>"This year's BNZ Auckland Lantern Festival is set to be one of the best yet," Hill said.</p>
        
            <p>"I encourage everyone to get their tickets, take advantage of the free transport options on offer, and enjoy the many lanterns, performances, and whānau activities at what will be a spectacular event for the region."</p>
        
            <p>Free shuttle buses will also operate between Manukau Train Station, Westfield Manukau, and the event location at Manukau Sports Bowl during and after the festival.</p>
