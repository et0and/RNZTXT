            <p>The first ever Manu World Championships gets underway in Wellington this weekend, where the contestant with the best v-shaped divebomb will be awarded a grand prize of $30,000.</p>
        
            <p>Event organiser Scott Rice said depth, volume and splash will all play a part in deciding on a winner.</p>
        
            <p>He told Morning Report that manu was the term for a style of bomb into the water.</p>
        
            <p>"It originated from, most say out South Auckland, Manurewa, MƒÅngere. It's also called a v-bomb ... where the bum goes into the water first and the arms and legs are raised in a v and they collapse when they get there, causing a massive splash."</p>
        
            <p>Rice explained there were a lot of other styles as well, including the gorilla, coffin and staple.</p>
        
            <p>There was definitely technique in making a good splash, although having a "little bit of body mass" and the height from which people jump does help, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The bum goes in first, [get] a tight v and as the bum enters the water, probably about a foot under water, that's when it collapses ... [your] head and [your] back goes back forcefully into the water and that kind of creates that, propulsion of the water upwards."</p>
        
            <p>Rice said in the qualifying round, contestants will be judged on splash, height and volume.</p>
        
            <p>But the finals would have another component to consider.</p>
        
            <p>"We add a decibel reading in the final to measure their boom ... the sound of their bomb, which is going to be interesting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Rice is raising the call-out to all manu competitors.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone who can make a big splash, we're wanting them to come along and register."</p>
