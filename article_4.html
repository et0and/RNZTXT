            <p>The holiday road toll has moved to 10 after a person was killed in a single-vehicle crash on State Highway 69 in Inangahua in Tasman last night.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the crash at about 1am, and police said the person died in the crash.</p>
        
            <p>The road would remain closed for some time this morning, and motorists were being asked to avoid the area.</p>
        
            <p>Up north, State Highway 1 north of WhangƒÅrei, has reopened following a two-car crash earlier this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The accident, at Kauri, blocked the southbound lane at about 8.30am and led to significant delays.</p>
        
            <p>One person was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred as large numbers of people head north for New Year's festivities in the Bay of Islands and a music festival near Mangawhai.</p>
        
            <p>This follows a death yesterday after a crash on State Highway 29 in Lower Kamai between a truck and car.</p>
        
            <p>The crash which happened around midday and also left two others injured, resulted in a lengthy detour for people travelling between Hamilton and Tauranga before the highway was reopened.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, police have confirmed that Brayden Tawa, 27, from Papamoa, was the man who died following a fatal crash at Mount Maunganui on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were notified of the crash at 10.17pm at the intersection of Aerodrome Road and Hewletts Road.</p>
        
            <p>Police said an investigation into the cause of the crash remained ongoing.</p>
