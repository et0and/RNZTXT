            <p>The first contingent of New Zealand firefighters battling blazes overseas have been welcomed home from Canada.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-person team, known as the Alpha deployment, have been helping control hundreds of wildfires across British Columbia.</p>
        
            <p>They have been filling specialist roles of helicopter coordinators, division supervisors, operations branch directors and agency liaisons.</p>
        
            <p>The team left New Zealand on 21 July and arrived home on Saturday morning.</p>

            <p>While Deputy National Commander Brendan Nally said the wildfire season was not as bad as last year, Canada still lost over 5 million hectares of land during its wildfire season, with more than 900 fires burning across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just beyond what we can imagine here in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>National Commander Russell Wood said New Zealand had reciprocal agreements with several countries.</p>
        
            <p>"International deployments provide valuable experience for our personnel that help build our capability to manage large wildfires at home," he said.</p>

            <p>Nally said that after many years of working with Canada and Australia, the three countries could share resources without issue.</p>
        
            <p>"We've all got the same approach to command and control, the same equipment standards, et cetera."</p>
        
            <p>Another contingent, a 21-person strike team known as the Bravo deployment, will return from Canada on 31 August.</p>

            <p>Nally said that team was doing arduous work "so they're working in really rough conditions".</p>
        
            <p>There was also a seven-person Zulu deployment in the United States for the first time since 2016, who will return on 10 September.</p>
        
            <p>"The Canadian and Americans have reported back that they work incredibly hard with a great degree of skill, and they've contributed significantly, so I'm really proud of them."</p>
        
            <p>"They've had a very busy fire season. They needed a hand, and we were able to help."</p>
