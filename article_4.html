            <p>Wellington police are investigating two aggravated robberies that took place at New World supermarket car parks in the capital.</p>
        
            <p>Both the robberies happened after the victims engaged with a person on the social media platform Discord and arranged to meet them in person in order to exchange cash for crypto currency, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The first incident happened about 5.30pm on Monday 29 February in the underground car park at New World in Newlands. The offender arrived in a silver Subaru Legacy, got into the victim's car and received a large amount of cash before returning to their car and driving off, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The other incident took place at the New World Chaffers car park on Tuesday 5 March at about 1.30pm. The victim got into the Subaru and two people were present - one took the cash, while the other was seen pointing a firearm at the victim who was ordered out of the vehicle before the pair drove off.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they wanted to identify and speak with the two men pictured who may be able to assist with their enquiries.</p>
        
            <p>A search warrant executed at a Strathmore address, recovered the Subaru and an imitation firearm, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were following strong lines of inquiry and investigators believed that other victims may have been targeted by similar crypto robberies but were yet to report it to police.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information that could assist in identifying the two men or who had been a victim of crypto currency robberies should contact the police on 105 quoting file number 210305/3355 or anonymously via crime stoppers.</p>
