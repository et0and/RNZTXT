            <p>Former mayor and beloved "Murupara character" Alan 'Bill' Whiteman will be buried at Galatea Cemetery on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Whiteman died in Motueka on 11 June, aged 94 years. He was Murupara's mayor before the borough council amalgamated with Whakatāne District Council in 1989.</p>
        
            <p>His daughter Raima Henery told Local Democracy Reporting that he was "quite a special character in Murupara" who served the town as mayor for nine years.</p>
        
            <p>She said even though he was originally from Australia, he was awarded a lifetime membership of the Māori Wardens because of the work he did with them in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"He was also president and lifetime member of the Murupara RSA and lifetime member of Whakatāne and Tauranga RSAs as well."</p>
        
            <p>He also put down one of the best hāngi in town, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Back in the day, it was funny because we always had a hāngi for Christmas and when the local marae or the school wanted a hāngi they always got dad to do it because he was better than anyone else to put it down," Henery said.</p>
        
            <p>She said he spent his last years in a rest home in Motueka, to be near family, but was independent and still loved to have a good yarn.</p>
        
            <p>"He loved sugar. He had six teaspoons of sugar in his tea or coffee, every day and he'd have quarter of a cup of sugar on his porridge and loads of cream.</p>
        
            <p>"We always had to make sure he had lots of chocolates and lollies because he was addicted to them. But he never had a heart attack and he never lost his faculties."</p>
        
            <p>Jaine Storey, who grew up in Galatea and worked for Murupara Borough Council as town clerk, said Whiteman was a big icon in Murupara.</p>
        
            <p>"He just loved the place and always had a sense of humour.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody looked out for him and he looked out for everybody else. He knew everybody's name and who he could joke with - and if he couldn't he'd still try."</p>
        
            <p>Her best memories of Whiteman were from when he was working for New Zealand Road Services.</p>
        
            <p>"He was our bus driver when we were kids, growing up. Whether we were going to Galatea School or later Rangitahi College or into town, he covered that whole area.</p>
        
            <p>"He enjoyed a joke and always, when he opened the school bus doors in the morning he'd have a smile and a cheery greeting."</p>
        
            <p>Later, during the time he was mayor, he worked as the caretaker of Rangitahi College.</p>
        
            <p>"He took both of his jobs very seriously and combined them when he could," Storey said. "The old school tractor-trailer was often his mode of transport."</p>
        
            <p>She recalled one occasion when a regional town clerk's meeting was held in Murupara, with town clerks visiting from Gisborne, Whakatāne, Tauranga and Rotorua.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them, as they arrived in Murupara passed this guy in a suit driving his tractor and trailer up the road. They jokingly thought, 'I wonder if that's the mayor', and it was.</p>
        
            <p>"He was coming up to open the meeting before going on to do his caretaker duties. So after he'd opened the meeting he hops on his tractor again."</p>

            <p>A service will be held at the Galatea Cemetery at 2pm where he will be buried beside his wife, Rose, with whom he had six children.</p>
        
            <p>"We made a promise that we'd take him home to mum," Henery said. "He's had a plot next to her for years and years."</p>
        
            <p>Anglican minister Minnie Pouwhare will take the service, also in accordance with his wishes.</p>
        
            <p>"He was never a church person, but he loved the Reverend Pouwhare so he asked that she do a service out at the urupa," Henery said.</p>
        
            <p>After the service, there will be a get-together at the Murupara Hotel.</p>
