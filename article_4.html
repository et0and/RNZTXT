        <h2>Retailers see impact of more officers on patrol in Auckland CBD</h2>
        <p>
They say they already feel safer and are seeing a drop in inner-city crime and bad behaviour.

            <p>Businesses in the Auckland city centre say more police foot patrols are already starting to make a difference in their desperate battle against retail crime and disorder.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-one new beat police were on the ground on Monday, bringing the total number now patrolling the city's CBD to 51.</p>
        
            <p>Business owners who have so often fallen victim to crime in recent years said they were already feeling safer.</p>
        
            <p>On Fort Street, where two people were shot last year, Roland Sugumaran of Vape King, said he has noticed a change.</p>
        
            <p>"Used to be lots more trouble," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But recently, we see a lot of decrease, decrease in crimes, crime rates, and also the streeties are just decreasing."</p>
        
            <p>Sugumaran said he trusted authorities to direct resources where they most needed to be.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe the police and the security, they know what is going on in the city," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They know which area needs more coverage...</p>
        
            <p>"I believe Queen Street needs more overlook, but Fort Street is doing really good at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>The new foot patrols were announced last month, the start of a staged two-year rollout which will ultimately see 63 additional staff deployed to community beat teams across Auckland's three policing districts, with an additional 17 in Wellington and 10 in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>At Sail City Mart just off Queen Street, owner Willy Pu said having extra police around made him feel safer, but he wanted to see it go even further.</p>
        
            <p>He wanted to see more frequent patrols as well as an increase in officers.</p>
        
            <p>He would also like to see police paid more.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they should have more salary because their job is very important," Pu said.</p>
        
            <p>"Important, and [dangerous], and very complex."</p>
        
            <p>The government won a long-running pay dispute with the police union on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The pay increase awarded was far less than what the union wanted, but included a $1500 lump sum payment and a flat $5000 pay increase, plus another four percent increase this month, and again in 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Back on Queen Street, Ivan Chen from phone repair store Funtech, said the area had improved from how it used to be.</p>
        
            <p>"It used to be pretty bad, people misbehaving on the street, often fighting each other," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You can see people yelling and doing crazy stuff like destroying public facilities, and you can smell a weird smell like they're smoking something."</p>
        
            <p>For those like Chen working in the CBD, more police meant more safety.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be much safer," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The environment on the street has been changed, there is a big difference."</p>
