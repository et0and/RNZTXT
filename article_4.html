            <p>A joint investigation by police and customs has led to 50 kilograms of cocaine being intercepted on its way to the Port of Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the shipment was sent to New Zealand from Brazil in February, Detective Inspector Tom Gollan, from police's national organised crime group said.</p>
        
            <p>Four men were initially arrested following the discovery, and a further seven arrests were made after police searched properties in Auckland and Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the men arrested were believed to be senior members of a well-known gang, Gollan said, while two others were believed to be in the same gang.</p>
        
            <p>"During a further search warrant in the Counties Manukau district, a significant number of firearms were located and seized. A man arrested at the address was found with a loaded pistol."</p>
        
            <p>The group of men had been preparing to recover the cocaine, Gollan said, and they had purchased walkie-talkie radios, an army ghillie suit, bolt cutters, gloves, security branded shirts and high-vis gear.</p>
        
            <p>"These methods, combined with the alleged possession of illegal firearms, demonstrates the lengths criminal enterprises are willing to go to avoid detection and import illicit drugs into New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The 11 men are facing charges relating to the importation and possession for supply of cocaine and will appear in Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the men also faced charges related to the guns found, and Gollan said further charges as more information came to light has not been ruled out.</p>
        
            <p>Customs Investigations manager Dominic Adams added all air and sea cargo shipments were screened by Cutoms and any that raised red flags were looked at.</p>
        
            <p>"We also work closely with Ports and legitimate supply chain partners to help keep our borders safe and secure."</p>
