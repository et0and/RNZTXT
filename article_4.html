            <p>Heavy rain and strong wind warnings and watches are in place for a number of locations across the motu on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) meteorologist Chris Brandolino earlier told RNZ the country was in for a weather "rollercoaster" before temperatures rose into the 30s again next week.</p>
        
            <p>Weather would be unsettled on Friday night and into Saturday, with a day or two of "unusually cool, brisk temperatures for this time of year", he said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService orange heavy rain warnings are in place for the ranges of Buller and the ranges of Westland and Grey districts.</p>
        
            <p>Buller's warning was in place from 9am until 7pm on Friday while Westland and Grey districts warnings was in place from 4am until 4pm.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 90 millimetres of rain could be expected with possible thunderstorms.</p>
        
            <p>As of 5.30am, Fire and Emergency New Zealand said it had not yet received any weather-related callouts on the South Island's West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Warnings and Watches issued this morning for Heavy rain and Strong Winds on Friday. Peak rainfall rates of 20-30mm/hr in the WLD and BLR Ranges. Wind gusts to 120km/h in exposed parts of WGN and WRP. Get full details at https://t.co/qHyE5zzql5 pic.twitter.com/3WXyRfMNQ3</p>
        
            <p>Orange strong wind warnings were in place for Wellington and Wairarapa, including Tararua District, from 1pm until 9pm and Marlborough Sounds from 12pm until 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the strong wind gusts, of up to 120 kilometres per hour, could damage trees, powerlines and unsecured structures.</p>
        
            <p>"Driving may be hazardous, especially for high-sided vehicles and motorcycles."</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was in place for Tasman, west of TƒÅkaka, including Nelson lakes National Park from 10am until 7pm.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury headwaters, north of the Rakaia River, was also under a watch from 6am until 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said a period of heavy rain and possible thunderstorms could be expected and all locations could approach warning criteria.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a strong wind watch was in place for Tasman, west of Nelson, from 10am until 6pm, and Marlborough from 11am until 6pm.</p>
        
            <p>But Brandolino said warm air was coming from Australia next week, which would set the country up for potentially high temperatures.</p>
        
            <p>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday would see the eastern North Island and eastern South Island as the places to be with temperatures "well into the 30s" for several days.</p>
        
            <p>"More heat is coming next week, for sure."</p>
