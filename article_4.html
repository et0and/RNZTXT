            <p>Auckland Council advisory staff say neither proposal for a new or upgraded "main stadium" is viable.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors will vote on Thursday whether to endorse one of the two competing proposals: An upgrade to Eden Park or an entirely new stadium on Auckland's waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>Both proponents released feasibility reports to the council in February in preparation for this week's Governing Body meeting, but council staff aren't convinced by either.</p>
        
            <p>"Neither proponent has demonstrated that their proposal is feasible without significant public funding," reads official advice from staff.</p>
        
            <p>Eden Park's so-called 2.1 upgrade would include a retractable roof and increased seating.</p>
        
            <p>It's "technically feasible, but is not currently financially feasible because it relies on significant public funding," advisors said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Tōangaroa, an ambitious $1 billion proposal for a new 55,000 seat stadium in central Auckland, "had not demonstrated that their proposal was technically or commercially feasible at this stage and had suggested it needed more time to do so."</p>
        
            <p>Advisors presented councillors with several options.</p>
        
            <p>The first was to decline both of the proposals, but staff also noted councillors could go ahead and endorse one anyway.</p>
        
            <p>Staff also noted the Eden Park upgrade could proceed as a staged development, with council only endorsing part of the upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>Another option was to give both proponents more time to plead their case and delay the decision further.</p>
