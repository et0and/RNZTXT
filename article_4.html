            <p>Coastguard has resumed the search for a man who fell into the sea off Auckland's Manukau Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Authorities said the man was with another person collecting shellfish at Ninepin Rock, off Whatipu Beach, when he fell into the water just before midnight on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He was not wearing a life jacket.</p>
        
            <p>1News reported fisherman at the scene as saying the man's family had been searching the beach on Saturday, and understood he was from the Chinese community.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard's Papakura volunteers were back on the water on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A Coastguard aeroplane would also be in the air today.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Titirangi skipper Mike Armstrong said yesterday the search was suspended on Friday night due to poor conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing person during this difficult time. We extend our thanks to all the volunteers who responded last night and wish the best of luck to the crews continuing the search today."</p>
