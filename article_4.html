            <p>Trains between Wellington and Waikanae have been suspended due to what Metlink is calling an operational incident.</p>
        
            <p>It cancelled the 5.55pm KƒÅpiti line service from Wellington to Waikanae, and the 7pm service from Waikanae to Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Other services have been suspended between Wellington and Porirua, and people should expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink said it has organised a limited number of bus replacements, but people should arrange alternative transport if they can.</p>
