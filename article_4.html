            <p>Warning: This story discusses suicide. </p>
        
            <p>The brother of a Gloriavale man who died in 2018 has told an inquest he was not aware of his brother being badly bullied at the Christian community.</p>
        
            <p>Sincere Standtrue died at Christchurch Hospital, 10 days after he was found unresponsive at Gloriavale's paint shop, where he worked.</p>
        
            <p>An inquest is being held in Greymouth to determine the cause and circumstances of the 20-year-old's death, including whether it may have been self-inflicted.</p>
        
            <p>Standtrue's sister, Rose Standtrue, earlier gave evidence that her brother was often isolated, shamed, and beaten at the community.</p>
        
            <p>She said multiple Gloriavale members and senior leaders picked on her brother.</p>
        
            <p>"As soon as [I was told Sincere was found unresponsive], I immediately thought that someone had done this to him as he was subject to bullying throughout his life," she said.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the court heard from Standtrue's younger brother, Endure Standtrue, who gave a different account of Sincere's experience at Gloriavale.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think his friends ever bullied him. I don't really know much about him being bullied when he was younger at school. He would talk to people and he did have a few friends," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think the teachers picked on Sincere at all."</p>
        
            <p>Endure said Sincere was "teased a bit" at school by his peers, which could make him angry, but he was otherwise a happy person.</p>
        
            <p>"In 2018 before he died Sincere was relatively happy. I don't think that there was anything he was unhappy about. He used to whistle quite often when he was happy," he said.</p>

            <p>Endure said his brother had aspirations for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"I think Sincere wanted to get married. He was working on getting his learners licence, I think he was going to go for his test in a while. I think he liked his work."</p>
        
            <p>He last spoke to his brother on the morning of the day he was found unresponsive, on 23 October, 2018.</p>
        
            <p>"I saw him just after breakfast before he went to work, we had done dairy that morning. He seemed pretty happy that morning, just the same. I think he liked doing dairy which involves hosing the milking shed, and putting the machines on the cows and removing them."</p>
        
            <p>Endure said it was "reasonably easy" to tell whether his brother was happy or sad.</p>
        
            <p>"Leading up Sincere's death I was in high school, I would see him at home every night. We would play together, things like cards and that."</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday the court heard from Gloriavale man Willing Disciple, who worked at the paint shop with Standtrue. He did not believe this workmate had taken his own life.</p>
        
            <p>"It doesn't align with his nature and my experience of him. He didn't do things to purposely endanger himself. [In Gloriavale] We believe that taking our own lives is not a way to solve a problem, we're taught that from a young age and it is in the Bible," Disciple said.</p>
        
            <p>"I believe Sincere would've found his faith a barrier."</p>
        
            <p>The inquest continues.</p>
