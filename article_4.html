            <p>Environment Canterbury's chairperson has stood down pending an investigation following recent media comments about his farming activity.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the regional council said Peter Scott had decided to step aside while the investigation was carried out.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy chairperson Craig Pauling will be acting chairperson.</p>
        
            <p>During a recent interview with Newstalk ZB, Scott said two of his own consent applications for irrigation had been delayed by another government agency.</p>
        
            <p>It meant he was operating ''illegally'', he said.</p>
        
            <p>An Environment Canterbury spokesperson said the council was aware of the status of Scott's consents.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes consent applications can be delayed when information is required from third parties - as is the case here."</p>
        
            <p>The investigation will be carried out by an independent external reviewer.</p>
        
            <p>It was anticipated it will take a number of weeks.</p>
