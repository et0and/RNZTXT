            <p>Police have now confirmed the man who became unresponsive and could not be revived after being Tasered and pepper sprayed near Auckland yesterday threatened officers with a metal pole, not a samurai sword as previously reported.</p>
        
            <p>A cordon has been removed and police have left the scene where a man was Tasered and died on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The dead man was a passenger from a car that had spent an hour fleeing from officers. While police originally said he threatened officers with a samurai sword, they now say it was actually a metal pole.</p>
        
            <p>He also bit the hand of one officer in the incident at Ōrere Point.</p>
        
            <p>The police used a Taser and pepper spray on the man, who became unresponsive and could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the car surrendered.</p>
        
            <p>The death has been referred to the Independent Police Conduct Authority and WorkSafe.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement released today, police said the driver failed to stop after an officer recognised the car - being sought as part of an investigation of an aggravated robbery at a Takapuna bar - on Great South Road in Papakura at 2.15pm.</p>
        
            <p>The driver failed to stop for police and was followed by the Eagle helicopter as they drove to Ōrere Point, where the car stopped on the beach at about 3.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>While the driver of the car was taken into custody without incident, the male passenger threatened officers with a samurai sword and bit the hand of one officer.</p>
        
            <p>Officers used a Taser, OC spray and a police dog unit, allowing them to take the man into custody without any further injury to officers.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Jill Rogers said it was an "incredibly fast-moving and volatile incident which unfolded over a short period of time".</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to acknowledge the impact that yesterday's events will have had on the community and our thoughts are with everyone involved.</p>
        
            <p>"We are providing support to staff involved in this incident and there are now several investigations underway, including a critical incident investigation and a policy, practice, and procedure investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Police were working to locate the man's next of kin.</p>
        
            <p>Rogers said police were aware members of the public may have filmed the incident at Ōrere Point yesterday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the man has yet to be formally identified, and next of kin not yet notified, we would encourage people not to share footage.</p>
        
            <p>"This is for the family's sake, and there is a critical incident investigation underway."</p>
        
            <p>Franklin Ward Councillor Andy Baker said the incident would be traumatising for those involved, and it was a tragic outcome.</p>
        
            <p>Baker said he would check up on the wellbeing of the police officer involved.</p>
        
            <p>"It's often a thankless task, and they get put into positions where they have to make decisions that they will sit with them for the rest of their lives, as the tragedy will do for the family and friends of the person involved.</p>
        
            <p>"Obviously, it was an isolated incident and it's sad, it really is."</p>
        
            <p>Baker said the quiet coastal community was shocked by the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a criminal defence lawyer had told RNZ that camera footage may be able to assist in the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Marie Dyhrberg had previously represented a man who died in police custody after being tasered.</p>
        
            <p>She said a thorough investigation would determine whether the decision to taser was justified.</p>
        
            <p>An autopsy will also reveal pre-existing health conditions or drug-use that can make people more vulnerable to harm from taser shocks, Dyhrberg added.</p>
