            <p>The Nelson Yacht Club, the oldest yacht club in New Zealand, is rallying to raise another quarter of a million dollars to stay afloat, as it faces a bill of more than $500,000 to earthquake-proof its main building.</p>
        
            <p>Established in 1857, the club on the waterfront teaches kids and adults how to sail - including those with disabilities through a programme called Sailability.</p>
        
            <p>Its upcoming season has been shortened due to the required earthquake strengthening work, which has so far cost $250,000. The club needs that amount again to for the second stage of the seismic work.</p>
        
            <p>Cole Thelin, 19, was one of the first people to join Sailability Nelson, set up by John and Linda MacDuff about 10 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"I started from working in a boat with a helper to working my way up to becoming a solo sailor, which is what I'm doing now.</p>
        
            <p>"It was very scary at first but now it is all good and I am able to do it with ease."</p>

            <p>Thelin has now been able to race with other sailors in mainstream events and he said he loved being on the water and meeting new people.</p>
        
            <p>"I enjoy the thrill of rough seas and having time to just have some fun and also learn things about sailing."</p>
        
            <p>A member of the Nelson Yacht Club, John MacDuff, suggested the club create a programme for people with disabilities. Now, every second Sunday through summer, around 15 sailors take to the water in specially designed, accessible boats.</p>
        
            <p>Linda MacDuff said each person was paired with a buddy in the small, two-person yachts.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got all sorts of people, adults and children with disabilites, physical and intellectual disabilites, all sorts and they all benefit in some way even if it is only just sitting there, trailing their hand in the water and feeling the movement of the boat, as simple as that."</p>
        
            <p>The couple, who have a disabled son, said it was a joy to help all kinds of people experience sailing.</p>
        
            <p>"Seeing the smiles on the kids faces and the parents - they probably sometimes get the biggest buzz," Linda MacDuff said.</p>
        
            <p>John MacDuff, who was also the rear commodore for the club, said in order to fund the first stage of the seismic work at a cost of $250,000, the club had taken out a loan, used its reserves and done fundraising.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to put rock anchors into the seabed so there is a lot of work still to be done after we have finished this stage one."</p>
        
            <p>Thelin's mum, Hazel Thelin, said the club had an incredibly inclusive nature and brought joy to its many members.</p>
        
            <p>"It is just nice to know the activity that you choose for [your kids] is the most adventurous, the safest and also the most fun and invigorating and they come home screaming with laughter and as happy as Larry."</p>

            <p>She decided to help out with the drive to raise funds after learning earlier in the year that it was facing a huge cost in order to keep operating.</p>
        
            <p>"They had just realised through general repairs and maintenance that unexpectedly they required earthquake strengthening.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as stage two is concerned we need to make another $250,000 and all of us fundraising committee members are scratching our heads and putting our best foot forward to raise that by next year."</p>
        
            <p>Suzanne Levey heard about Sailability while taking part in the beginners sailing course for adults and said her daughter Chloe was "quite a little thrill seeker" but would have been unable to do a course like she did.</p>
        
            <p>Chloe then joined Sailability for the first time last summer.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been an awesome introduction to sailing for her, she feels safe, she's with someone all the time until they are 100 per cent sure you can do the solo thing.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so awesome just to see anyone, it doesn't matter what their disability is, get in the boats."</p>

            <p>Belinda Williams, 19, has been part of Sailability for a number of years and is lowered into the yacht from her wheelchair with the help of a hoist.</p>
        
            <p>She said she loved the feeling of harmony and calm when she was out on the water.</p>
        
            <p>Her mum, Cindy Williams said sailing ran in the family, she also learnt to sail as a child and both her parents were members of the yacht club, so it was a wonderful tradition to be able to carry on.</p>
        
            <p>"If it wasn't for the likes of Linda and John Macduff and the volunteers giving up their time on a Sunday morning we wouldn't have this great facility and service."</p>
        
            <p>The Sailability season will start a bit later in November this year - while the club pushes on with its fundraising drive to get the seismic work completed.</p>
