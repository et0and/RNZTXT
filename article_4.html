            <p>Two men have been charged after large quantities of class C drug ketamine were imported.</p>
        
            <p>In a joint operation with Customs, police seized about 11 kilograms of ketamine as well as quantities of MDMA ecstasy in Wellington and Kāpiti.</p>
        
            <p>Police searched six properties in those regions before arresting and charging a 19-year-old man and a 20-year-old man.</p>
        
            <p>Charges include importing a class C controlled drug and possession for supply of a class B controlled drug.</p>
        
            <p>Police said their investigation started after Customs noticed an increase in ketamine seizures across the Wellington and Kāpiti Coast regions.</p>
        
            <p>In some cases, it was believed the drugs were imported in packaging masked as anti-inflammatory medication, police said.</p>
        
            <p>They believe the offending uncovered in the operation happened between June 2022 and October this year.</p>

            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Hamish Blackburn said authorities were continuing inquiries into identifying the supplier responsible for exporting the ketamine to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"Police and Customs are committed to identifying and disrupting the importation of these types of drugs which target our communities.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to holding offenders to account and delivering on our intent to keep New Zealanders safe."</p>
        
            <p>Chief Customs officer for regional investigations Rachael Manning said authorities were always monitoring drug activity.</p>
        
            <p>"Acting on intelligence that spans a global reach, we work closely with our police partners as well as our international law enforcement colleagues as needed to nab criminal operations like this one."</p>
