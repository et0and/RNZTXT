            <p>The head of a Wairoa distribution centre says they are receiving up to 50 requests a day for basic needs and clean-up items.</p>
        
            <p>Nearly 500 properties in the town were flooded when heavy rain hit parts of the East Coast late last month.</p>
        
            <p>Jordon Winiata said people had just finished emptying out their homes which meant clean-up items were needed.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's that industrial level of equipment - water blasters, dehumidifiers, anything to support cleaning up outside your home and now people are just looking to the basic needs to remain in their homes as accommodation is quite challenging here in Wairoa."</p>
        
            <p>Councils had given reassurance about the town's water but a lot of people were still being very cautious and were still boiling their water and drinking bottled water, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So that drinking bottled water coming through to Wairoa is definitely still a need."</p>
        
            <p>Bedding such as blankets, pillows and duvets were a top priority, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of people are looking for bedding, blankets, mainly blankets the temperature has dropped considerably over the last week in Wairoa."</p>
        
            <p>Towels, flannels and tea towels were also being requested, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Households were looking to dry out their properties as quickly and as efficiently as possible, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Energy efficient fan heaters would be greatly appreciated so families are able to keep their power costs down, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"And industrial dehumidifiers, so it's about trying to access dehumidifiers that will do you know quite a large area of the home."</p>
        
            <p>Winiata said there was a huge surge of donations from big chain retailers and organisations after Cyclone Gabrielle but that was not happening this time around.</p>
        
            <p>Nevertheless the front line emergency services such as Red Cross which provide support for families were still doing so this time, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Asked how people could help, Winiata said anyone who could provide industrial dehumidifiers would benefit the community.</p>
        
            <p>"Any whiteware, kitchenware that can help the under insured, not insured, and also the insured too because sometimes those insurance processes take some time."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who might want to donate to Wairoa should call 0800 AROHA 3 (0800 276 423) for more information.</p>
