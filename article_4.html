            <p>Te Papa is deciding whether to pull the plug on a conference being held at Wellington convention centre, Tākina, over concerns the content is hostile to trans people.</p>
        
            <p>The event on Saturday has been organised by Inflection Point NZ to stop what it calls "gender indoctrination and medicalisation" of children.</p>
        
            <p>Speakers at the event include Brian Tamaki, former National Party MP Simon O'Connor, as well as others from overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa, who manages the space, said it was actively monitoring the situation and reviewing the health and safety and security arrangements to assess whether the event could occur safely.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was aware a protest was being planned against the event "because of concerns that its content and speakers are hostile to trans people".</p>
        
            <p>The police said it was also aware of it and would monitor and respond to incidents as required.</p>
        
            <p>"Police recognise the right to peaceful protest, but also the right of the general public to go about their normal activities safely."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has approached Inflection Point NZ for comment, and contacted the person listed as hosting its website.</p>

            <p>Mayor Tory Whanau said she was deeply concerned the rhetoric being discussed at the event would be harmful to the trans and queer community.</p>
        
            <p>"Make no mistake, I completely and utterly condemn hate against our rainbow whānau anywhere in Aotearoa," Whanau said.</p>
        
            <p>"In this city, discrimination will never be tolerated. Pōneke is a place where everyone can live with dignity, equality, and respect. End of story."</p>
        
            <p>Pōneke Anti-Fascist Coalition said it had not called for the event to be cancelled, and would hold a trans solidarity event with Queer Endurance in Defiance this weekend whether the event went ahead or not.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was not a safety threat and had held many successful peaceful protests over the years and intended to continue to do so.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City councillor Nīkau Wi Neera said the council owned the Tākina building.</p>

            <p>He said ratepayer-funded spaces must be inclusive and safe for all - and he was concerned at what he called the "inflammatory nature" of the event.</p>
        
            <p>He said the summit was unwelcome in the city.</p>
        
            <p>The NZ Bill of Rights Act states public venues, such as those owned by a city council, cannot cancel or refuse an event because they do not support it or agree with the views of the organisers.</p>
        
            <p>However, that may sometimes be superseded by factors such as competing rights and genuine health and safety concerns.</p>
        
            <p>Inflection Point NZ said on social media platform X that they were not going to tolerate left-leaning politicians "acting like some kind of totalitarian regime that will cancel or shut down anyone else's opinion that they don't agree with".</p>
        
            <p>The group said it would also have security in place and police would be in attendance.</p>
