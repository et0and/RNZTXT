            <p>An international class-A drug smuggling conspiracy was meant to result in thousands of dollars of profit for Australian Matthew Hodder. Instead, the former stripper was arrested as he went to breakfast in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Hodder on Friday pleaded guilty in the High Court at Dunedin to attempting to take possession of cocaine for supply.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old man from Melbourne will be sentenced in February.</p>
        
            <p>The cocaine, worth up to $27 million, was stashed inside an intake grate on the container ship Spirit of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>A summary of facts said US law enforcement received a tip-off that Spirit of Auckland contained "kilogram quantities of cocaine destined for Australia" in July last year.</p>
        
            <p>On 2 August, local law enforcement in Philadelphia used scuba diving equipment to retrieve two large duffle bags containing 91 kilograms of cocaine.</p>
        
            <p>The importation method was commonly called "parasite importation" and often occurred without the knowledge of the ship's captain or crew.</p>
        
            <p>Alongside the cocaine were GPS trackers, but they had been water damaged and so law enforcement could take the cocaine without alerting the organised crime syndicate responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Information on the plan was passed from American to Australian authorities, who monitored the 254-metre ship's berths in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>On 6 September, Hodder went scuba diving at the Port of Melbourne in preparation for Spirit of Auckland's arrival.</p>
        
            <p>Two days later he was intercepted by Australian authorities with scuba equipment.</p>
        
            <p>After that Hodder and an associate, who has interim name suppression, aborted their planned retrieval of the cocaine while the ship was in Melbourne.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, on 13 September, he arrived in Queenstown with the intention of travelling to Dunedin to retrieve the cocaine when the ship berthed in Port Chalmers.</p>
        
            <p>At this point Hodder was unaware of the specific contents of the ship, but appreciated it was likely illegal and of significant value, the summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>The pair hired a rental vehicle and drove to Dunedin, where they purchased $4000 of diving equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Police installed a listening device in the rental vehicle while the pair were in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>At 3.13am on 17 September, they began the drive to Port Chalmers.</p>
        
            <p>On the way, the accused with name suppression complained about the high cost of petrol in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"It's alright mate, after tonight you're not gonna have ta worry about petrol prices. You can buy a petrol station. Put whatever prices you want," Hodder responded, according to the summary of facts.</p>
        
            <p>At 6.50am, Spirit of Auckland berthed at Port Otago. Hodder entered the water wearing his scuba gear and swam to the ship.</p>
        
            <p>He attempted to locate the cocaine numerous times by diving to the intake grate.</p>
        
            <p>At 7.22am, he surfaced and swam to the stern of the ship.</p>
        
            <p>He was seen by Port Otago staff and police officers, who had been surveilling him and his associate.</p>
        
            <p>He exited the water and the pair got back into their rental vehicle and discussed being unable to locate the packages.</p>
        
            <p>The other man called the overseas-based importers by cellphone to get a video of where and how the duffle bags were stashed on the ship.</p>
        
            <p>The two men discussed having a second attempt at retrieving the product, but instead drove to central Dunedin to have breakfast.</p>
        
            <p>"When the defendants arrived in Dunedin Central and parked their vehicle they were arrested by police," the summary of facts said.</p>
        
            <p>"Both defendants had cellphones on their person, which were seized by police and subsequently analysed."</p>
        
            <p>Both refused to speak to police.</p>
        
            <p>Hodder had previously appeared before the court in Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents listed Hodder as a roofer, but he also used to perform for Magic Men Australia, a touring and for-hire male stripper company based in Melbourne.</p>
