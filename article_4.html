            <p>A Colin McCahon artwork, long thought to be lost, is going under the hammer later this month.</p>
        
            <p>McCahon is famous for his landscapes, abstract art and painted text, but this piece is a rare stained glass window.</p>
        
            <p>One of 12 stained glass windows he created will be offered as part of an auction at the International Art Centre in Auckland later this month.=</p>
        
            <p>He made the windows under the guidance of architect James Hackshaw, Art Centre director Richard Thomson told RNZ's Nights.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of them were for Roman Catholic schools and churches and that sort of thing. But this particular one, along with two others, was made for private homes, introduced into the home through architecture."</p>
        
            <p>The piece is "absolutely beautiful", Thomson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We instantly recognised that it was something beautiful, what we didn't know is when we took possession of it from the owners, is that it was thought to be missing and according to the book, the Hackshaw book, The Architect and his Artists, the window sash had been destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>"As it happened, it hasn't been destroyed. And here it is, it's survived, and it's on the market for the first time."</p>
        
            <p>The window has McCahon's trademark symbolism, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's got some of that religious imagery, but you'll see that in works by Hotere and other New Zealand artists at the time, but it's distinctly McCahon in a way, the colours and everything. It's quite a beautiful object."</p>
        
            <p>It's the last window he created before he died, Thomson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of them are installed, one's in Upland Road in a church in Remuera, and other ones have survived in homes and buildings and schools. But this one, the house didn't survive but the sash or the artwork has."</p>
        
            <p>The original owners of the demolished house saved it and brought it to auction, he said, and they would no doubt be glad of their foresight.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got an estimate on it of $80,000 to $120,000," Thomson said.</p>
