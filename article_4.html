            <p>The man wanted for the murder of Albert Enoka last week in Lower Hutt has been named as 28-year-old Wipuhara Kapene.</p>
        
            <p>Police are still on the hunt for Kapene, who they say has gang affiliations.</p>
        
            <p>Enoka, who was reportedly a member of the Tribesmen gang and a former president of the Rebels Motorcycle Club's Christchurch chapter, died after being shot on 10 December in the suburb of Naenae.</p>
        
            <p>Police consider Kapene to be armed and dangerous, and the public should not approach him.</p>

            <p>People should call 111 if they see him, and information after the fact should be reported via 105 or online.</p>
        
            <p>Kapene is likely receiving help, police say, and they will look to prosecute anyone harbouring or assisting him.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, neighbours overheard shouting before the shooting, with the man leaving with associates shortly afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Enoka's tangi will take place tomorrow in Lower Hutt Tuesday morning with a procession to Whenua Tapu Cemetery in Porirua afterwards.</p>
        
            <p>Hutt Valley acting area commander Inspector Shaun Lingard said police will be observing everything happening.</p>
        
            <p>"We will maintain a visible presence in Lower Hutt tomorrow morning and will monitor the procession through Lower Hutt to Porirua."</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the victim's family and those who will be gathering to mourn, and our role is to allow them to do so safely and respectfully, within the law," Lingard said.</p>
        
            <p>Lingard emphasised police will not tolerate any unlawful activity including breaches to the new gangs act which includes a ban on wearing patches.</p>
        
            <p>He said anyone caught breaking this law can expect enforcement action either during or after the tangi.</p>
        
            <p>Police are warning motorists, there will likely be traffic disruption in the late morning in Lower Hutt, mainly around Wainuiomata and the highway between Hutt Valley and Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists are advised to plan ahead.</p>
        
            <p>Police are telling anyone concerned about their safety or witness illegal behaviour to call 111.</p>
