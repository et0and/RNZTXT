            <p>British comedian John Oliver's cameo in this year's Bird of the Century competition has done more than ruffle some feathers.</p>
        
            <p>Forest and Bird told RNZ donations associated with the campaign were "several times higher" than previous years.</p>
        
            <p>That was thanks primarily to Oliver's "outrageous" campaign that saw the pūteketeke take the crown in a landslide victory, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The campaign included ads in Paris, Mumbai, Tokyo and London, promotion on his show Last Week Tonight and an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon dressed in full-on grebe garb.</p>
        
            <p>Donations were still being counted - and continued to roll in - so Forest and Bird could not give a total, but a spokesperson said it was "incredible."</p>
        
            <p>"The support that we've seen from both overseas and here in NZ has been fantastic," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"The overseas donations, given New Zealand's exchange rates, are certainly working in our favour.</p>

            <p>"The donations will help us to keep being an effective advocate and voice for te taiao nature, as we have for the past 100 years."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week Forest and Bird's Ellen Rykers told Morning Report it could only be a good thing that Oliver ignited conversation about our native birds.</p>
        
            <p>There was a record number of votes this year - more than 350,000 from 195 countries, surpassing the previous record of 56,733.</p>
