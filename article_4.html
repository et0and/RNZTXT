            <p>A minor eruption has occurred at Whakaari/White Island.</p>
        
            <p>The Volcanic Alert Level has now been raised to Level 3 and the Aviation Colour Code raised to orange.</p>
        
            <p>On Geonet's website, duty volcanologist Geoff Kilgour said the volcano had produced "a more vigorous plume" on Friday afternoon, moving volanic ash to the east of the island.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a low probability of this ash affecting the mainland. This weak eruptive activity was identified through a combination of webcam imagery and satellite data provided by our colleagues from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre at NZ MetService.</p>
        
            <p>"The activity appears to have been most active from around 1 to 3 pm and has since diminished. Satellite data shows that the plume appears to have contained a minor amount of volcanic ash."</p>
        
            <p>Kilgour said the volcano was currently experiencing a period "of elevated unrest".</p>
        
            <p>Steam and ash emissions "could continue for some time".</p>
        
            <p>Kilgour said it was very unlikely that volanic ash will affect the mainland.</p>
        
            <p>He said GNS Science will be monitoring the island over the weekend.</p>
