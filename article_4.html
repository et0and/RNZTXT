            <p>A thousand-hectare block of land containing precious wetland and native bush is up for sale in Eastbourne, and the regional council is considering throwing its hat in the ring to buy it.</p>
        
            <p>Gollan's Valley Station is 1366 hectares in size, part farmland and part bush, and has been held by the same owners for the past 60 years.</p>
        
            <p>According to the TradeMe listing, it "offers a rare blend of privacy, breathtaking natural beauty, diversified income opportunities and outstanding views all just minutes from the trendy seaside suburb of Eastbourne and across the harbour from Wellington City".</p>
        
            <p>But it is the biodiversity benefits which have caught the eye of the council and locals.</p>
        
            <p>It contains "expansive native bush, environmentally significant wetlands, and stunning coastal access" which borders existing conservation areas and regional park.</p>

            <p>A similar block of land came up for sale 15 years ago. Back then, a group of environmentally-minded Wellingtonians campaigned to have the Department of Conservation, the regional council and Hutt City Council combine to buy the land - and to make up the shortfall, a private donor was found.</p>
        
            <p>The Friends of Baring Head was then formed to help manage the new park. Chairperson Paula Warren said the process would be harder today.</p>
        
            <p>"It is difficult to manage a crowd-sourced fundraising process if the price is not known and there is no guarantee that the purchase will succeed. For that reason, purchase by a public agency is the simplest approach, with the public helping to fund subsequent management," she said.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>She said the logical model for the station would be for public agencies to buy it, subdivide off the bits that were of most value for biodiversity or recreation, and sell the rest with covenants over the land to make sure it was not used for activities that threaten conservation efforts, such as pest and weed control.</p>
        
            <p>Crowdsourcing could be used to make up the deficit.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Greater Wellington regional councillors will discuss whether it could become its next owner.</p>
        
            <p>Chairperson Daran Ponter confirmed there would be a public-excluded session during the council meeting to discuss the opportunity.</p>

            <p>Ponter told RNZ the council recognised the significance of the land for its biodiversity value, and the fact that it shared a border with existing regional park, owned by the council.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was not yet known if there would be a decision following the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>The property owner declined RNZ's request for an interview.</p>
