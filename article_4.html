        <h2>Bikes and tourists an accident waiting to happen - Waiheke cycle group</h2>
        <p>
A cycling advocate on Waiheke island says that without cycle lanes, the area's narrow roads, tourists, bikes, pedestrians, wine and speed, are "an accident waiting to happen".

            <p>On Thursday a person riding a shared four-seater bike was killed in a road accident in the Wairarapa, on a busy stretch at the heart of the area's wine tourism industry.</p>

            <p>Cycle Action Waiheke's Xan Hamilton said many of the island's visitors hired e-bikes without realising there were few cycle lanes and roads are narrow in parts and in poor condition.</p>
        
            <p>One Waiheke resident, who did not want to be named, told RNZ that Onetangi Road, which has many vineyards and is a popular route for tourists, has a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour, but most people travel at 70km/h: "It is a scary road to cycle down for a local, let alone a tourist."</p>
        
            <p>Hamilton agreed the road was a particular concern, with motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and breweries and vineyards all in the mix.</p>
        
            <p>"The road narrows and it's the spot on the island where people are allowed to go the fastest. A lot of drivers on Waiheke are courteous but many are not courteous and they'll pass you with very little space."</p>
        
            <p>Locals had asked for cycling lanes for at least two decades, she added.</p>
        
            <p>"Onetangi Road has one of Waiheke's only cycle lanes, but no footpath means pedestrians force cyclists into the path of buses and cars."</p>
