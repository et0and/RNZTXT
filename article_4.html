            <p>A 44-year-old man is facing numerous charges following an incident at a Park Terrace house in Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the house just after 5pm on Friday, Marlborough Area Commander Inspector Simon Feltham, said after a man arrived with a gun.</p>
        
            <p>A baby inside the house during the incident was unharmed.</p>
        
            <p>Feltham said the man has been charged with threatening to kill, discharging a firearm to intimidate, abducting a child under 16, and contravening a protection order.</p>
        
            <p>He is due to appear in Blenheim District Court on Monday.</p>
