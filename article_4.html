            <p>Around 650 households in Waimate are still under a "do not drink" notice after nitrate levels exceeded the acceptable levels of 50 milligrams per litre of water.</p>
        
            <p>The unsafe levels pose a risk to people, particularly pregnant women and babies.</p>
        
            <p>Boiling the water does not make it safe to drink - in fact, it makes the levels worse.</p>
        
            <p>Tanker water has been made available to residents but it could be months before the tap water is drinkable.</p>
        
            <p>Waimate District Mayor Craig Rowley told Checkpoint that the situation was very frustrating for everyone involved.</p>
        
            <p>"It's terrible for the community. We shouldn't have to be supplying drinking water via bulk tanks."</p>
        
            <p>The nitrate levels seem to be from intensive farming and changing to irrigation practices, he said.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said it was not due to any improper activity.</p>
        
            <p>"The farmers are doing what they are allowed to do, they're via their consents.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a problem that we need to solve, but we also need to be very careful with it too, because we don't want to be beggars living in paradise."</p>
        
            <p>The community is working on a solution, Rowley said, but it may take some time.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, nothing is quick when it comes to drinking water and getting it right."</p>
        
            <p>Waimate is looking at alternative water sources and other ideas, some of which are costly.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to find the most cost effective and best outcome and we've got to get it right."</p>
        
            <p>People in the community were angry, Rowley admitted.</p>
        
            <p>"We shouldn't be delivering undrinkable water to our residents. It's one of the basic things, isn't it?"</p>
        
            <p>A similar situation happened two years ago in the community as well.</p>
        
            <p>About 650 households or around 1800 people are on the drinking water scheme affected, Rowley said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to Checkpoint, Federated Farmers said they support the council's actions and it is important the source of the nitrate is found and that steps are taken to address it.</p>
        
            <p>Farmers have also made changes to reduce nitrate contamination, the group said.</p>
