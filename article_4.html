            <p>Firefighters have contained an ammonia leak from a ship at Lyttelton Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said three crews had been called to the wharf, where the chemical leak was reported about 5am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters worked with engineers to get the situation under control, and it was resolved about 8.30am.</p>
        
            <p>There was no threat to the public, Fire and Emergency said.</p>
        
            <p>Lyttelton Port Company chief operating officer Eugene Beneke said all shipping movements and land operations were suspended at the port as a precaution, but operations had since resumed.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Sunday, about 4am, fire crews contained another ammonia leak at a meatworks in Lorneville, north of Invercargill.</p>
