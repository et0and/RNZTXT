            <p>It's that time of year - where Christmas parties and events are starting to fill up the calendar.</p>
        
            <p>But this year more people than ever have been getting in the spirit by ditching the alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Globally, sales of alcohol-free beer are up six percent, alcohol-free wine by seven percent and alcohol-free spirits up a whopping 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>When it comes to not getting drunk, it is Gen Z that is leading the charge.</p>
        
            <p>A new study by Mintel in the UK has found that Gen Z members were more focused on drinking in moderation - and a third of those surveyed aged 18-24 did not drink at all.</p>
        
            <p>Founder of alcohol free drinks company AF Drinks Lisa King said in the four years the company has been in the market it has seen a dramatic shift in how people viewed non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
        
            <p>"When we started, everyone's like, oh, is this just a trend? But what we're seeing now is that is becoming just part of normal life, and that is mainstream."</p>

            <p>King said she was also seeing a shift from the corporate sector when planning events like Christmas parties.</p>
        
            <p>Christmas parties were often big, boozy events, but this year they were also seeing a lot more interest from companies looking to provide non-alcoholic options at their events.</p>
        
            <p>Living Sober website manager Lotta Dann had also seen a shift in the country's approach to alcohol drinks.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been sober for over 13 years now, and when I first quit drinking, I would go to events and all there would be on offer for me is orange juice,' she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Who wants to drink thick orange juice at a party? Or water? Literally, that was it."</p>
        
            <p>That was echoed by clinical psychologist Simon Adamson who said in the 25 years he had been a psychologist there had been a very clear shift in society's attitudes towards drinking.</p>
        
            <p>"When people choose not to drink it is much more socially accepted."</p>
        
            <p>Dann said there was a lot of pressure at this time of year for everyone, but especially on people who had quit or were trying to quit drinking.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just all the social events - the Christmas parties, the barbecues, the family gatherings - but just the pressure on our wallets, there's often a lot of work pressures in the lead up to Christmas," Dann said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everything's just sort of smashed into this big, ginormous hodgepodge of tiredness and pressure, and alcohol sits there twinkling away, as if it's going to make everything better."</p>
        
            <p>Adamson said families travelling and getting together or on the flipside being lonely at Christmas, could equally be stressful for some.</p>
        
            <p>Dann encouraged people struggling with alcohol to seek support and connect with others, such as through an online community, and to also look after themselves.</p>
        
            <p>"You never wake up in the morning regretting not having drunk the night before," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"So just push your thinking through to the morning and how you're going to feel if you wake up without having had too many Chardonnays and said that embarrassing thing or snogged that person that you didn't want to snog."</p>
        
            <p>People should also feel that they could skip an event or leave early if they were feeling uncomfortable.</p>
        
            <p>"Just remember your truth and know that there are a lot of people who are not drinking and trying not to drink, so you're not alone."</p>
        
            <p>Dann said one strategy she employed was treating herself to some special non-alcoholic spirits. "I feel like I'm treating myself at Christmas to something a little bit fancy."</p>
        
            <p>But while there was no doubt the attitude towards drinking had shifted, some were still up against an environment where alcohol played a big role, and a liquor industry with a strong advertising presence.</p>
        
            <p>Adamson said one of the advantages to alcohol-free drinks was they were an easier way for people to disguise they weren't drinking alcohol if they were uncomfortable.</p>
        
            <p>But he also encouraged people to be considerate of those around them who did not want to drink.</p>
