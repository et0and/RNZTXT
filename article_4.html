            <p>A lucky female tawaki/Fiordland crested penguin has been returned to the wild off the West Coast this week after a scrape with danger, far from home.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation said the female tawaki was found in Christchurch's Scarborough in August - skinny, with few feathers and damaged skin, following a suspected attack possibly by a shark or another large predator.</p>
        
            <p>Biodiversity supervisor Craig Alexander said most of the country's tawaki colonies were in South Westland and Stewart Island - not Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"The tawaki was a long way from home when we picked it up, they're not a regular visitor to Christchurch shores," Alexander said.</p>
        
            <p>The penguin spent the next four and a half months fattening up at on a diet of close to 800 grams of fish a day at the Christchurch Penguin Rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>DOC's fauna technical advisor Cassie Mealey and her team collected the tawaki from Hokitika airport on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>"She drew quite the crowd at the small airport with people very interested in her story," Mealey said.</p>
        
            <p>The penguin bolted out the cage off Hokitika beach when she was released, she said.</p>
        
            <p>'"She then became a bit shy, perhaps realising she was in an entirely unfamiliar place, however, after a bit of an explore, she found the water.</p>
        
            <p>"With some encouragement she ran into the ocean, diving under waves and swimming nearby happily before disappearing out into the big blue."</p>
        
            <p>Two other tawaki were released from the beach in mid-December after weeks of rehabilitation.</p>
        
            <p>Mealey said the adult and juvenile tawaki were skinny, exhausted, missing their waterproof coating on the feathers, and one had lacerations to its flippers.</p>

            <p>The youngest was sent to the South Island Wildlife Hospital for treatment to its flipper wounds, which were likely caused by barracuda bites.</p>
        
            <p>Standing at about 60 centimetres tall, tawaki are endemic to Aotearoa and are one of the rarest penguins in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>They have a conservation status of "At Risk - Declining" - and have an estimated population of about 2500 to 3000 breeding pairs.</p>
        
            <p>Their main threats include human disturbances on the shoreline including from dogs, introduced predators, climate change, and fishing bycatch.</p>
