            <p>Dawn services should be dry in the three big cities, but Anzac Day is expected to be wet and windy.</p>
        
            <p>It's worth checking the forecast, as well as RNZ's list of Anzac Day commemorations.</p>
        
            <p>The Metservice said clear skies would dominate on Tuesday and Wednesday but would give way to a strengthening northwesterly flow bringing clouds and showers.</p>
        
            <p>"The weather looks dry for dawn services in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland on Anzac Day, but strengthening northwesterlies across the middle of the country mean it will be a windy one for the capital," meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said.</p>
        
            <p>"It'll be worth taking a raincoat for the early morning services on the West Coast."</p>
        
            <p>In fact, there's a Heavy Rain Watch in place for Fiordland from Wednesday night through to Friday morning, and a Strong Wind Watch for southern Fiordland, Southand, Stewart Island, Southern Lakes, Clutha, Central Otago and Dunedin from Wednesday evening until 8am Anzac Day. The Canterbury High Country also has a Strong Wind Watch from midnight Wednesday through until 6pm on Anzac Day.</p>
