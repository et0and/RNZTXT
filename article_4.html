            <p>The man who murdered Auckland dairy worker Janak Patel has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>Frederick Hobson, who pleaded guilty to murder, and Shane Tane, who pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery, were both sentenced in the High Court in Auckland this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 years, while Tane was sentenced to four years and six months' imprisonment.</p>
        
            <p>A third man - Henry Ford - had already been granted a stay of proceedings due to being terminally ill.</p>

            <p>After the sentencing Detective Inspector Geoff Baber said Patel had only arrived in Auckland a short time before his killing.</p>
        
            <p>He had been looking after the dairy for the owner.</p>
        
            <p>"He was simply doing his job and should not have been subjected to the violent events that unfolded that night.</p>
        
            <p>"While today's sentencing brings an end to court proceedings, Janak's family will live with his absence for the rest of their lives.</p>
        
            <p>"No sentence will ever bring Janak home."</p>
        
            <p>Police also acknowledged the wider Sandringham and retail communities.</p>
        
            <p>"Janak's murder had a profound impact on the Sandringham community given the superette's place in the neighbourhood," Detective Inspector Baber said.</p>
        
            <p>"This community also played an important role in assisting our investigation team in the days and weeks following this incident, and I would like to acknowledge this support."</p>
        
            <p>He also praised the police's investigation team.</p>
        
            <p>"The team worked thoroughly to piece together the facts surrounding Janak's death, with his killer in custody within days," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Their work resulted in the three offenders being charged and made to "face the consequences of their violent actions".</p>
        
            <p>An earlier court hearing was told Hobson planned to enter the superette, armed with a knife, to take cash and any other items he could manage.</p>
        
            <p>At about 8pm, he wore a black bandana covering half of his face, and ran into the dairy.</p>
        
            <p>He confronted Patel with the knife, causing him to flee into a back room.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson took the cash register, as well as a box of butane lighters and vapes, before leaving the store.</p>
        
            <p>Patel ran after him, armed with a hockey stick from the back of the shop.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson put the cash register in a nearby recycling wheelie bin as Patel approached, and went towards him aggressively, as Patel retreated swinging the hockey stick.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents revealed Hobson lunged at Patel and knocked him to the ground, stabbing him at least three times.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson tried to wrestle the hockey stick from Patel's grasp, stabbing him a further three times.</p>
        
            <p>"The final blow was to Mr Patel's neck, causing him to fall to the ground once again."</p>
        
            <p>Patel used the wheelie bin in an attempt to get away from Hobson, but collapsed after taking five steps back towards the dairy.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson collected the bin and left the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Patel's death sparked protests by dairy owners over the safety of small businesses, while more than $100,000 was raised for his family.</p>
