            <p>A 37-year-old man has been charged with murder after a fatal crash in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a vehicle struck the victim on a driveway at Lanham Lane, Massey, on Tuesday evening and left the scene immediately after.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, despite the best efforts of ambulance staff at the scene, the victim succumbed to his injuries at the scene," Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Williams of Waitematā CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found and seized the vehicle at an Avondale address late on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged offender was known to the victim and was arrested in Coromandel.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in Waitākere District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with the man's death," Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>"While we can't comment on the specifics of what has taken place, I can advise that both men are known to each other."</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination was continuing at the address.</p>
