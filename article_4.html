            <p>Two West Coast men found guilty of running a multi-million dollar cannabis operation in a huge underground bunker have been jailed.</p>
        
            <p>The owner of Cowboy Paradise, a hostel and shooting range near Hokitika, Michael Kevin Milne, 68, and Ngahere man Anthony Wayne Harris, 77, were found guilty on a raft of charges in March.</p>
        
            <p>Milne was sentenced on Thursday to six years' imprisonment on charges of cultivating cannabis, possessing cannabis for supply and selling the drug.</p>
        
            <p>While Harris, who had been found guilty on firearms and other weapons charges, was sentenced to five years in jail.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Paul Kellar described the operation as highly sophisticated.</p>
        
            <p>The 240sqm bunker was buried 3m underground and accessed through a trapdoor in a shipping container. Its power usage was estimated to be about that of a commercial building.</p>
        
            <p>It was buried in a secluded, bush clad area on Milne's property, Cowboy Paradise, an overnight stop about halfway between Kumara and Hokitika, on the popular West Coast Wilderness Cycleway.</p>
        
            <p>Police uncovered the extent of the operation through a series of covert operations, leading to raids in 2019, which saw $5 million of assets seized, including firearms, cash, vehicles, property and machinery.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found more than 800 plants, not including seedlings or harvested cannabis plants.</p>
        
            <p>They also uncovered weapons, including knives, batons, pepper spray, nunchucks and knuckle dusters when searching Harris' property, which the crown said they had for protection.</p>
        
            <p>Both men's lawyers highlighted their ages, and the added difficulties that would mean during their jail sentences.</p>
        
            <p>Milne's lawyer, Anselm Williams, said Milne sought a sentence of home detention.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the bunker, which could grow plants year round, could produce around 136kg (300lbs) of cannabis annually, with a street value of more than $1m.</p>
