            <p>Helicopters will back at first light battling the Northland scrub fire that has destroyed about 20 hectares of vegetation.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze broke out at Whangārei Heads early on Thursday afternoon and quickly spread.</p>
        
            <p>Crews from Whangārei and Onerahi were bolstered by four helicopters with monsoon buckets and another one monitoring the fire.</p>
        
            <p>The residents of two homes evacuated, and crews put protection measures in place overnight at one of the properties.</p>
        
            <p>It's not yet known how the fire started but it's expected to take another two days to extinguish.</p>
