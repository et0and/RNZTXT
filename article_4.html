            <p>A helicopter is working to dampen a smouldering vegetation fire in the southern Wellington suburb of Makara on Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it received a call about the blaze from a vessel in Cook Strait at about 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>While crews were unable to access the location due to the terrain, it monitored the fire overnight until a helicopter could be brought in to assist.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the helicopter is now working to dampen the fire which is currently a smouldering patch.</p>
