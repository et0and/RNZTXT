            <p>A person has died after a single-vehicle crash in Omaio, Ōpōtiki on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the crash on State Highway 35 was reported them at 8.40pm, and, despite emergency services' efforts, the person died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit is investigating the circumstances of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second death which police reported on the roads this King's Birthday long weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But the Transport Agency's provisional data on its website shows there have been three fatalities on the road, one each in Auckland, Bay of Plenty, and Northland.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday evening, a person died after a car crashed into a tree on Te Pua Road near State Highway 1 in Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>The official holiday period began at 4pm on Friday, and will end at 6am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The worst King's Birthday road toll in recent years was six deaths, recorded in 2019 (then known as the Queen's Birthday).</p>
