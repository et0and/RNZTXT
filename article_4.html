            <p>Three more people have been arrested as part of a police investigation into a protest during the Auckland Pride Festival.</p>
        
            <p>It comes two days after four arrests were made following complaints about protesters actions on 15 February at the Te Atatū Community Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Around 30 adults and young children had to be barricaded into a room in a library in West Auckland, when a group linked to Destiny Church tried to drown out a children's event taking place at the centre as part of the annual festival.</p>
        
            <p>Police said eight victims filed complaints with police which have been "thoroughly investigated" in recent weeks. There were also six witnesses that supplied statements.</p>
        
            <p>The three people charged on Wednesday are a 44-year-old man, a 55-year-old man and a 47-year-old man.</p>
        
            <p>They have been bailed to appear in Waitākere District Court on 18 March, along with the four people charged earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>The 44-year-old man was charged with injuries with intent, while the 55-year-old was charged with assault under the Crimes Act.</p>
        
            <p>The 47-year-old man was charged with two counts of assault under the Crimes Act and one of assault under the Summary Offences Act.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are limited in further comment given matters are before the court," a spokesperson said.</p>
