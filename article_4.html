            <p>Auckland train services will be running at only half the usual frequency at peak times, as rail staff continue industrial action.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport says trains will now be running every 20 minutes instead of 10.</p>
        
            <p>Unionised staff from one of AT's rail operators - Auckland One Rail - have been striking since the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>As part of the action, rail workers have refused to work overtime or work changes to rostered hours after a new collective agreement reached an impasse.</p>
        
            <p>It was possible the action could last a month if an agreement could not be reached, Rail and Maritime Transport Union general secretary Todd Valster said last week.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been bargaining with [Auckland One Rail] for the last eight months - it expired about eight months ago, and we've been working away trying to reach a compromise, and there's been a couple of major issues that we haven't been able to get past."</p>
        
            <p>Disputes included removing a clause guaranteeing train drivers the majority of their weekends off, and what Valster described as a lack of trust to resolve workload issues for three major work groups.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said Auckland One Rail and the Rail and Maritime Union were meeting for mediation this week.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland One Rail chief executive Martin Kearney said he was "disappointed" by the strike action.</p>
        
            <p>Off-peak and weekend services were expected to run as normal, but Auckland Transport said there "may be some additional cancellations due to resulting staff shortages".</p>
        
            <p>"Journey Planner will be updated the evening prior with the latest journey information. Please note there may be some changes each day due to staffing availability," it said on its website.</p>
        
            <p>The Onehunga line was closed early on Saturday evening due to shortages.</p>
