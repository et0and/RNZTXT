        <h2>Teens 'incredibly lucky' after rescue from rocks in dark</h2>
        <p>
The teens became stranded in the dark on rocks from the shore of Narrow Neck Beach.
</p>
        
            <p>Two Auckland teenagers are "incredibly lucky" after becoming stranded on rocks far from shore.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Garry Larsen, of the Auckland Maritime Unit, said the pair got into difficulty at Narrow Neck Beach on the North Shore on Tuesday night.</p>
        
            <p>The beach has large sand flats on the outgoing tide and the pair were stuck on rocks as the tide quickly came in.</p>
        
            <p>Larsen said one of the teens called police at 6.20pm when they realised they were unable to get back to land when it was getting dark.</p>
        
            <p>"With the light of the day also slipping away, the Police Maritime Unit immediately responded in a police vessel to assist," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police stayed on the phone with the informant while water rapidly rose around the two."</p>
        
            <p>The Eagle helicopter was also deployed and observed the teenagers unable to get back to land with the incoming tide.</p>
        
            <p>Air Support Unit supervisor Sergeant Colin Ware said the Eagle provided oversight and a light source to assist with the rescue.</p>

            <p>"Our team onboard of Eagle were monitoring the dangerous conditions on the water," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully, the pair were rescued and returned safety to the shore a short time later."</p>
        
            <p>The pair did not need medical attention.</p>
        
            <p>Police were advising the public to be aware of the conditions of both sea and daylight when swimming at the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"We're thankful of this result, but must stress this was an incredibly lucky situation with a positive ending," Ware said.</p>
        
            <p>"The combination of the location, changing tides, and lack of light can change everything in an instant.</p>
        
            <p>"What may seem like a safe area can become a dangerous and risky location faster than you might realise."</p>
