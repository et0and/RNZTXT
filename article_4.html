            <p>Five people have been taken to hospital following a single-vehicle crash in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the accident happened on Browns Road, Eyrewell, at 10.25am.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said five people were treated at the scene and five taken to Christchurch Hospital, all in a moderate or serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>St John said three Ambulances, two helicopters, a rapid response unit and an operations manager were dispatched to the scene.</p>
        
            <p>It was believed the occupants were aged between 16 and 18, or thereabouts.</p>
        
            <p>The road was blocked while emergency services cleared the scene, and had since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>Police were making enquiries into the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>Correction: An earlier version of this story said seven people had been taken to hospital. Later information from Hato Hone St John clarified it was five.</p>
