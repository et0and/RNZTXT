            <p>Five cases of mpox have now been confirmed as of Thursday, which are linked to the recent Winter Pride Festival in Queenstown. </p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand have confirmed the virus is clade II and are not linked to recent clade I cases in Africa.</p>
        
            <p>It said all of New Zealand's mpox cases since reporting began in 2022 have to date been clade II.</p>
        
            <p>There are two types of mpox, known as clade I and clade II - both have caused current outbreaks in African countries, with a recent increase in clade I cases in Africa leading to WHO recently declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.</p>
        
            <p>Mpox has mostly affected the following groups, who are at greatest risk of contracting the virus:   </p>
        
            <p>Symptoms of mpox usually show up between 1 and 3 weeks after exposure.</p>
        
            <p>Most people with mpox develop a rash or other skin change. These are known as 'lesions'. Lesions are spots, bumps, blisters or sores.</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms include:</p>
        
            <p>Some people also experience flu-like symptoms early on, including:</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said if you think you have been exposed to mpox, or if you develop symptoms, especially a rash, please seek medical advice.</p>
        
            <p>It advised to contact your nearest sexual health clinic, GP or healthcare professional, or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice and support. </p>
        
            <p>If you are diagnosed with mpox you do not need to isolate. Cover skin lesions (where possible), and refrain from sexual and intimate activity until any lesions have healed completely. Use a condom during sexual activity for three months after your symptoms have gone.</p>
