            <p>A neighbour of an eight-year-old boy who was violently killed in Hamilton says there had been trouble at the house in the past.</p>
        
            <p>One neighbour RNZ spoke to said the police had been there nearly 24-7 since the attack.</p>
        
            <p>He said the street was generally quiet but there had been times when people would complain about the house where the attack took place.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't super surprised because I knew there had been trouble at the house," he said, though he did not know any details.</p>
        
            <p>He said he tried to keep to himself and hoped there would be a resolution soon.</p>
        
            <p>In the hours leading up to the violent death, police took the murder-accused to the address where the attack took place.</p>
        
            <p>Zahquiel Taipeti died in hospital on Sunday night of fatal injuries that police say were inflicted during the altercation at a house in Bader just before 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>A man accused of murder appeared in court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they responded to reports of suspicious behaviour at a Hamilton motel earlier on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>After speaking to a man and issuing a trespass order, officers transported him to his verified home address - the same address where they later arrested the accused in relation to the fatal assault which killed Zahquiel and injured two others.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they had notified the Independent Police Conduct Authority for their information and consideration.</p>
        
            <p>Media are reporting that Zahquiel Taipeti and his father were attacked with a hammer while they slept in bed.</p>

            <p>RNZ has asked the police to confirm this. However, a spokesperson said they were not in a position to comment as the case was before the court.</p>
        
            <p>The man was charged with murder and two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>The assault charges related to serious and moderate injuries suffered by two adults at the house, who were also taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour told RNZ she was home on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Just after 5pm she said she heard some "pretty intense" shouting coming from the house where the attack took place.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked out my window and I saw some of my neighbours going towards it. I don't know them as well so chose not to get involved," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour came over later and filled her in on what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"My understanding is that it wasn't random, it was personal and based on the people who were there and their relationships," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Although it was "very sad", she said it had not made her feel unsafe living in the neighbourhood. She was planning to take over a meal when the injured men returned home from hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Another neighbour told RNZ that there had been a relocatable house on the driveway a short while ago, but it had been moved on.</p>
        
            <p>He had not noticed any children at the property lately.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was told it was a kid who was killed I was quite surprised," he said.</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ visited the street on Wednesday, police were stationed at the entry to the house where the attack happened. Flowers had been left on and around the front fence. Police were also seen talking to residents of surround properties.</p>
        
            <p>Neither the police nor Oranga Tamariki would comment to RNZ on whether they had any concerns or involvement with Zahquiel before his death.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, a relative announced Zahquiel's death on Facebook with "great sadness and heartbreak" and paid tribute to him.</p>
        
            <p>She said the boy was the baby brother to an older sister, and that his mother had died at an earlier time.</p>
        
            <p>"Rest in the arms of mum our boy," she wrote. "Rest in eternal love MyBro."</p>
        
            <p>His father was named in court documents as one of the other alleged victims of the altercation and the woman said he was stable in hospital and was to undergo surgery today.</p>
        
            <p>She said family were waiting for the release of Zahquiel's body so they could take him home to WhakatƒÅne.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said her heart went out to the family.</p>
