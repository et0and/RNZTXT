            <p>Police making enquiries into the death of a 9-month-old baby in Christchurch on Wednesday can now confirm there are no suspicious circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>The death will be referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said emergency services were alerted to reports a baby was unresponsive at a Barrington Street property in Spreydon shortly after 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Medical attention was given but the 9-month-old died.</p>
        
            <p>Oranga Tamariki referred all comment to police and refused to say whether they had any involvement with the family.</p>
        
            <p>"As this is a police-led investigation ... all enquiries are best directed to them," Oranga Tamariki said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Kāinga Ora regional director for Canterbury Liz Krause said the agency's thoughts were with the friends and whānau of the baby who died.</p>
        
            <p>"While this death is under police investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further."</p>
