            <p>A teenager has been arrested after a woman was seriously assaulted at her Auckland home last night.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City CIB detective senior sergeant, Martin Friend, said the 17-year-old man met with the victim at a Balmoral Road property at about 2am.</p>
        
            <p>An argument occurred between them, and the meeting became violent.</p>
        
            <p>"At one point the offender was asked to leave, but while doing so the situation escalated," Friend said.</p>
        
            <p>"The offender forced his way back inside the house and subjected the victim to a violent assault."</p>
        
            <p>The man fled the house in a vehicle as police arrived on the scene, and did not stop for police there.</p>
        
            <p>Friend said he was followed to the nearby Mount Eden area and arrested.</p>
        
            <p>St Johns ambulance said it attended an assault in the Epsom area with one ambulance and two rapid response vehicles, taking one patient in a serious condition to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Friend said the woman's condition has improved, and she is in a serious, but stable condition, in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter who visited the property said there were two police forensic officers dusting down a door, which had a shattered glass pane.</p>
        
            <p>The residents of the house did not want to comment.</p>
        
            <p>The 17-year-old will appear in the Auckland Youth Court today, facing charges including wounding, burglary and failing to stop for police.</p>
