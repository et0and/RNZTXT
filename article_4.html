            <p>Police say a 27-year-old man has been charged over an alleged fatal hit-and-run in the Far North town of Ōkaihau.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Kevan Verry, of Northland CIB, said the Kaikohe man had been charged with failing to stop or ascertain injury, but further charges were possible.</p>
        
            <p>He was due in the Kaikohe District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Verry said an investigation had been under way since a 19-year-old cyclist was killed on Settlers Way about 10.15pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>He said there had been a strong public response following the tragedy, with a number of locals providing information.</p>
        
            <p>Police enquiries in the town had included checkpoints looking for a damaged vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>Verry said Victim Support was helping the cyclist's family.</p>
        
            <p>The fatality shocked residents in the small, close-knit town, which is on State Highway 1 about 20km west of Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>Another resident told RNZ police had gone door-to-door at businesses, asking for information and any CCTV that might have captured the car.</p>
        
            <p>She said officers set up a checkpoint at the start of Settlers Way, opposite Two Ponga Park, and were stopping every car travelling through the town.</p>
        
            <p>Ōkaihau has a population of about 370, according to Census data, but is a service town for the wider area with primary and secondary schools, two dairies, two cafes and several other businesses.</p>
        
            <p>It is also an emerging cycle tourism destination, thanks to its location on the popular Twin Coast Cycle Trail from the Bay of Islands to Hokianga.</p>
        
            <p>Verry said police were still seeking witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that there were several vehicles travelling on Settlers Road at the time, between 10pm and 10.15pm. I'm still asking that those people make contact with us."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information could contact police online or by calling 105, quoting the reference number 250129/0360.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
