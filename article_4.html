            <p>Police have formally released the name of a woman killed in Blenheim, as family members and friends pay tribute on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Jennifer Phyllis Sheehan, 78, was found dead at a property on Muller Road on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A 55-year-old man charged with her murder appeared at the Blenheim District Court on Tuesday, when he was remanded in custody ahead of his next appearance at the High Court at Wellington on 13 December.</p>
        
            <p>In a Facebook post, Sheehan's nephew said he was "shocked and utterly lost for words" about what had happened to her.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm angry, I'm confused but mostly sad. Sad I won't hear her infectious laugh again, I won't laugh about the silly things she's done or said that have no doubt made me turn bright red in public on more than one occasion, I won't receive a phone call for my 40th birthday this week ... But mainly I'm sad for my kids who she loved and treated like her own grandchildren," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"She always remembered their birthdays and was always one of the first to call or send a message to wish them well on all of our special occasions - I genuinely felt the love she shared for our kids and that's something I will never forget.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel robbed of time that I'll never get again and it sucks. But I'll find a way to remember the good times, will think of her when I hear a song by Elvis and smile when I see a weird freaky witch or something quirky that reminds me of her and all the strange collectables she kept around her house.</p>
        
            <p>"I hope to remember her stories so she continues to live through them and we can laugh for many years to come."</p>
        
            <p>Police were not seeking anyone else in connection with Sheehan's death.</p>
