            <p>After leaving Auckland Zoo, an elephant has had her first trunk-to-trunk connection in South Australia</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Zoo relocated Asian elephant Burma to Monarto Safari Park in November 2024, and less than two months since Burma arrived at her new home, she has had her first trunk-to-trunk connection between Burma and Perth Zoo's female elephant Permai.</p>
        
            <p>35-year old Permai, who was also relocated to Monarto Safari Park from Perth Zoo on Wednesday, is the first of four elephants to join Burma in South Australia.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Zoo's elephant keepers - Andrew, Corryn and Odin, who with long-time teammate Laurel accompanied Burma across the Tasman last November, and have now all taken permanent roles at Monarto Safari Park.</p>

            <p>"We're on elephant time here, just taking things day by day," Andrew said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their interactions on Wednesday night linking trunks, then Thursday morning when they were gently touching and sniffing each other, are all good signs. But Permai's just had a really big trip so is very tired, and we need to get her eating and sleeping properly first and nice and relaxed and in a good head space, and then we can think about next steps."</p>
