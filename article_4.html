            <p>Christchurch City Council has announced the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        
            <p>Leah Scales, who also held the position of general manager of resources, had requested not to work her notice period and would not return to work following the end of her sick leave.</p>
        
            <p>It is the latest in a string of high-profile resignations at the council, with chief executive Dawn Baxendale also tendering her resignation this week.</p>
        
            <p>Scales' resignation comes on the same day as a damning report into the council's Three Water department was made public.</p>
        
            <p>The independent review by consultancy KPMG found $6.5m had been spent on staffing roles over the allocated budget since July 2019.</p>
