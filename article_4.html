        <h2>Firefighters to keep battling Bridge Hill blaze overnight</h2>
        <p>
The 535ha blaze may reach Castle Hill village overnight, while Health NZ warns of the smoky conditions.
</p>
        
            <p>Residents of Canterbury's Castle Hill village were encouraged to evacuate before nightfall Thursday as a 535-hectare scrub fire at Bridge Hill continued to burn out of control.</p>
        
            <p>Incident Commander Brian Keown says it is possible - but not probable - the blaze will reach the village overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand has also issued a public health warning for smoke from the fire.</p>
        
            <p>Nine helicopters, three planes, and 12 trucks, tankers and support vehicles were among the resources thrown at the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>Three school camps staying about a kilometre from the fireground were earlier evacuated as a precaution, as was Flock Hill Lodge.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 is closed between Castle Hill and Arthur's Pass village.</p>
