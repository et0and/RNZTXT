            <p>Invercargill's mayor is recovering in an intensive care unit after undergoing heart surgery in Dunedin Hospital this week.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Nobby Clark had a minor heart attack last Wednesday and was admitted to Southland Hospital overnight as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>He was moved to Dunedin Hospital for more testing the next day and underwent surgery for a double bypass on Wednesday, which was originally set down as a quadruple bypass.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Tom Campbell said the mayor would likely stay in intensive care for at least 24 hours.</p>
        
            <p>"I am pleased to hear surgery went well, and myself and all the councillors wish Nobby a speedy recovery," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>Campbell would remain in charge at the council until Nobby Clark was ready to return with his recovery expected to take a couple of months.</p>
